1
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,793
Lord Lee.

2
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,558
Lord Lee.

3
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,393
Are you awake?

4
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,871
My lord, please…

5
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,001
Lord Lee.

6
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,214
Lord Lee.

7
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,469
It is cold.

8
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,015
You startled me.

9
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,728
He is drunk. I am taking him home.

10
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,647
Do not mind us.

11
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,363
Please go.

12
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,161
Do you want some help?

13
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,463
Over there.

14
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,597
What is all this fuss?

15
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,599
It has disappeared.

16
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,394
Gu Yang-cheon's body has disappeared.

17
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,118
Thank you.

18
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,663
I do not understand why the palace
keeps beating people.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,001
My lord.

20
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,090
My lady.

21
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,141
Lord Lee.

22
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:05,727
Lord Lee.

23
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,605
Lord Lee.

24
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,356
Lord Lee!

25
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,651
Jong-jong.

26
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,778
Bring some hot water and a towel.

27
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,821
Yes, my lady.

28
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,959
Lord Lee!

29
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,637
Your Majesty!

30
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,556
His Highness has
gotten sicker and fainted!

31
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,234
Your Highness.

32
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,294
His Majesty has sent
Lee Hyeong-ik to inspect

33
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,838
His Highness's condition.

34
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,572
He has chills and a high fever.

35
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,741
Can he handle a heated needle?

36
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,243
HEATED NEEDLE:

37
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,121
HEATED WITH FIRE, USED TO PIERCE
ACUPUNCTURE POINTS

38
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,477
Please try everything.

39
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,063
Please try anything!

40
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,484
Please do not leave like this.

41
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,654
Please.

42
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,371
Lord Lee.

43
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,084
My lord.

44
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,212
What happened to you?

45
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,883
What happened to Gu-jam?

46
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,688
I should move him.

47
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,858
What? Why?

48
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:03,071
The eunuch who helped me
knows about this place.

49
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,873
Gu Yang-cheon's body is gone?

50
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,041
That stupid man!

51
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,885
Has he confessed where he moved him?

52
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,721
Baedan-ri, sir.

53
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,108
Lord Lee, we have to go. Please.

54
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,442
Lady Yoo!

55
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,820
Men are searching the village!

56
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,956
Ryang-eum.

57
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,499
Give him to me.

58
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,917
They will be here soon.

59
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,421
Take care of him.

60
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,102
I said I do not know such a man.

61
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,658
There is nothing here!

62
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,173
Is it this house?

63
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,857
A man was seen leaving the village

64
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,859
after loading another man onto his horse.

65
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,153
Let's go.

66
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,512
Is there a man here
who is not a family member?

67
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,478
Who are you?

68
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,564
How dare you come in here?

69
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,608
I am sure it is this house.

70
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:50,655
We brought in a singer
to sing at my lord's birthday party.

71
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,167
What are you doing?

72
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,835
If my lord finds out…

73
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,922
Your lord?

74
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,801
They said a woman defiled
by barbarians lived here.

75
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,805
Do you think we would fear
a man who took in

76
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,182
a woman who lost her virtue to barbarians?

77
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,559
What is all this fuss?

78
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,690
What is all this fuss at this hour?

79
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,695
How dare you raise your voice here?

80
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,780
Your Excellency.

81
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,865
-Your Excellency.
-Your Excellency.

82
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,928
I feel like Jang-hyeon

83
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,015
will wake up soon…

84
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,394
since you are next to him, Ryang-eum.

85
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,318
Do you remember when Jang-hyeon
went to the border for business?

86
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,154
You were having fun
at our kisaengs' lodging

87
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,906
when you got into a fight
with a customer and got hurt.

88
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:19,660
Did you know Jang-hyeon
stopped by that night?

89
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,747
When he heard you got hurt,

90
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,041
he gave up 7,000 yang of silver
to come to your side.

91
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,084
Apparently, he came,

92
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,421
checked that you were all right
and left again.

93
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,466
One of my friends,

94
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,344
who was serving Jang-hyeon, asked him

95
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,431
why he kept fretting over you.

96
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,975
And he said

97
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,563
that he lived to see you happy.

98
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,482
That was his answer.

99
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,611
So, he would never…

100
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,991
die and leave you alone.

101
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,403
How is Lord Lee?

102
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,321
How is he?

103
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,578
I thought about…

104
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,166
who Jang-hyeon would want to see…

105
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,878
in his last moments.

106
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,008
Please go to him.

107
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,622
Lord Lee.

108
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,335
It is me, Gil-chae.

109
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:49,078
"Observation leads to knowledge,

110
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,956
knowledge leads to sincerity,

111
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,458
sincerity leads to an upright mind,

112
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,795
an upright mind leads to a healthy body…"

113
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,216
You whistle quite well,

114
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,301
so I will give you a nickname.

115
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,428
Ryang-eum.

116
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,514
Ryang-eum?

117
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,017
It means "to reach the note."

118
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,478
Hyeon.

119
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,857
Sister!

120
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,684
Hyeon. Do you hear it?

121
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,562
When he smiles,

122
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,648
I hear flowers bloom.

123
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,192
Father!

124
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,364
Father!

125
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,159
Father!

126
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,374
Stop!

127
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,544
Stop hitting him!

128
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,299
Young Master.

129
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,052
I am sorry, Young Master.

130
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,762
Hyeon.

131
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,078
Lord Lee.

132
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,288
Lord Lee.

133
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,127
Lord Lee.

134
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,712
Lord Lee, please…

135
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,882
Lord Lee!

136
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,190
Lord Lee.

137
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,318
Are you awake?

138
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,780
Ryang-eum!

139
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,617
Lord Lee.

140
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,537
Lord Lee.

141
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,965
Where am I?

142
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,926
It is all right.

143
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,429
You are all right now.

144
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,695
Who…

145
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,618
Who are you?

146
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,667
How is he?

147
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,587
He will live.

148
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,632
But why

149
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:14,093
can he not recognize us?

150
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,137
The blow to his head
must have been off-target.

151
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,555
Luckily, his skull is unharmed.

152
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,058
So, just wait a bit.

153
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,562
His memories may or may not come back,

154
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,814
but he is alive.

155
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,780
See?

156
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,367
You nearly made the wound worse
by touching it all the time.

157
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,328
How strange.

158
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,749
You appear younger than me,

159
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,960
so why do you speak informally?

160
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:55,968
Are you a physician?

161
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,679
You seem good with your hands.

162
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,975
I have picked up many talents
thanks to someone I know.

163
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,561
I learned the geomungo

164
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,729
and how to shoot an arrow.

165
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,065
That person got hurt a lot,

166
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,693
so I learned how to treat wounds too.

167
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,902
Who were they?

168
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,697
Was it a woman

169
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,907
you loved?

170
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,917
All done.

171
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,140
You know, I--

172
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,641
Who

173
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,936
is that woman over there?

174
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,070
I thought you would…

175
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,074
remember her at least.

176
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,668
I do not remember.

177
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,050
But it is fun

178
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,136
just watching her.

179
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:53,961
Here.

180
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,184
Open wide.

181
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,780
Why are you being so good to me?

182
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,659
This is nothing compared

183
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,120
to what you have done for me.

184
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,041
Was I a good person to you?

185
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,506
You were more than that.

186
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,935
That young man…

187
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,272
Ryang-eum, was it?

188
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,486
He has the same name as someone I knew.

189
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,991
I used to have a servant

190
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,951
called Sam-do.

191
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,244
Sam-do?

192
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,539
Yes. He was good at whistling,

193
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,624
so I nicknamed him Ryang-eum.

194
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,460
But…

195
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,341
But that young man

196
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,553
is also called Ryang-eum?

197
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,640
How strange.

198
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,311
I am sure Ryang-eum…

199
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,191
was a name I gave to Sam-do.

200
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:48,950
Lord Lee.

201
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,255
Your Highness.

202
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,762
Is there any word of Lee Jang-hyeon?

203
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,849
I heard that in Joseon

204
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,769
the crown prince's people
are being purged.

205
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,729
Is it true?

206
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,017
Your Highness.

207
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,648
Look at this.

208
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,363
Have I been

209
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,158
bedridden for a long time?

210
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,202
All that matters is that you are up now.

211
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,547
I am hungry.

212
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,801
Make some tarak porridge.

213
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,052
TARAK PORRIDGE:
MADE OF MILK AND RICE

214
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,095
No, wait.

215
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,889
I will do it.

216
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,391
I will make it myself.

217
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,663
Leave us.

218
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,303
What about Jang-hyeon?

219
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,473
What happened to Interpreter Lee?

220
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,478
I believe…

221
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,107
Interpreter Lee is safe.

222
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:30,946
Good.

223
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,368
I need to write a letter,
so prepare the materials.

224
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,600
I want to rest.

225
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,853
Yes, Your Highness.

226
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,998
But Her Highness will be
bringing tarak porridge soon.

227
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,837
I should eat her porridge.

228
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,132
Yes, Your Highness.

229
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,563
Your Highness.

230
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,567
Your Highness, I made some tarak porridge…

231
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,879
Your Highness.

232
00:27:58,885 --> 00:27:59,886
Your Highness.

233
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,138
Your Highness!

234
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,098
Your Highness!

235
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,143
Your Highness!

236
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,608
Your Majesty!

237
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:20,031
Please move the prisoners here
to the Office of Justice!

238
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,785
-Move them to the Office of Justice.
-Move them to the Office of Justice.

239
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,955
-Please move the prisoners here…
-Please move the prisoners here…

240
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,915
-…to the Office of Justice.
-…to the Office of Justice.

241
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,250
Master.

242
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,503
His Highness has…

243
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:46,099
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

244
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:51,229
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

245
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:55,024
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

246
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,445
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

247
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,157
Your Highness!

248
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,244
Your Highness.

249
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,208
Please wake up.

250
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,675
Your Highness.

251
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:27,891
Crown Prince!

252
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,735
My son.

253
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,566
Jang-hyeon, read this.

254
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,739
Hyeon.

255
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,121
I will give you a nickname.

256
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,081
Ryang-eum.

257
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,167
Ryang-eum?

258
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,755
Hyeon.

259
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,018
I will be gone for a few days.

260
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,895
Tell everyone I am with my family.

261
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,608
Lord Lee is okay, right?

262
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,569
Is there

263
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,946
any word about Gu-jam?

264
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,743
Is anyone inside?

265
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:32,385
I heard you were living a hard life
after getting a divorce.

266
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,764
Why did you not ask Her Highness for help?

267
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,310
People have been shaming me
for being violated by the barbarians.

268
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,523
I thought contacting her would only

269
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,942
cause her harm.

270
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,905
You were close with Interpreter Lee

271
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,991
in Shenyang, right?

272
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,326
Are you still

273
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,412
in contact with him?

274
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,040
Of course not.

275
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,543
I have not seen him
since I came to Joseon.

276
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,380
I see.

277
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,967
I brought some jewelry.

278
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:18,222
Her Highness heard
of your struggles and asked me

279
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,599
to send some.

280
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,768
There is no need.

281
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,228
It is payment for saving her son.

282
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,150
She prepared it especially for you.

283
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,197
So, please

284
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,075
store it preciously.

285
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:45,875
Your Majesty.

286
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:50,588
The crown prince has only just passed,

287
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,924
but his son should be crowned heir--

288
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,717
Crowned heir?

289
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,177
Yes, Your Majesty.

290
00:34:56,886 --> 00:35:00,848
We must not leave a central seat
of the royal court vacant.

291
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:01,933
Thus…

292
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,730
Are you trying to gain
his son's favor already?

293
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:37,009
You know that Her Highness buried
cursed objects in the palace, right?

294
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,512
No, I…

295
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,603
You must be scared.

296
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,481
Yes, you are.

297
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,402
You just need to say
what you have seen and heard.

298
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,614
Do you want to die in pain like them?

299
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,283
No, right?

300
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,163
If you decide to die,

301
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,166
you will not die alone.

302
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,294
Think of your elderly parents

303
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,463
and your younger sister.

304
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,687
The crown princess has been
implicated in a disgraceful act.

305
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,941
How could I make her child heir?

306
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,026
Thus,

307
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,654
I intend to banish her to a faraway place

308
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,406
to eliminate the seed of trouble.

309
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,209
Your Majesty.

310
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,127
Are you banishing her

311
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,589
because of the rumors
that she has cursed the women above her?

312
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,133
But you cannot banish the mother

313
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,219
of the crown prince's son
without evidence.

314
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,763
That is true, Your Majesty.

315
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:08,017
You cannot banish the mother
of the crown prince's son as you wish.

316
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,936
She is Your Majesty's child as well.

317
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,729
How could you banish her?

318
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,358
Evidence?

319
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,028
Jin-saeng, one of her maids,

320
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,448
confessed that the crown princess
buried cursed objects

321
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,867
in the palace and cursed the royal women.

322
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,705
Things have gotten this far,

323
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,792
and you still call her my child?

324
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,295
How dare you

325
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,173
call that bitch a child of the king?

326
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,103
When the cursed objects were
first found in the palace,

327
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,397
concubine Lady Jo accused Her Highness.

328
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,732
But Choi Myeong-gil, among others,

329
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,943
protected her, claiming lack of evidence.

330
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,030
However, Jin-saeng's confession
has changed everything.

331
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:07,201
Now, no one is speaking up
to defend Her Highness

332
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,203
for fear of being labeled a traitor.

333
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,580
Master.

334
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,833
Now is the time for you--

335
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,334
What if

336
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:19,255
Jin-saeng's confession is true?

337
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,969
If the crown princess truly cursed
those above her,

338
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,555
then it means a child has
cursed her parent.

339
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,515
It goes against the bonds and virtues.

340
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,311
It will shake the foundation
of the nation.

341
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,480
Joseon is

342
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,441
a country

343
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,110
where children serve their parents,

344
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:45,114
wives serve their husbands,
and subjects serve their kings.

345
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,661
Even with the barbarians' violations,
Joseon was able to survive

346
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,539
because of our adherence
to the bonds and virtues.

347
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,168
People argue

348
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,211
that courtesy and loyalty

349
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,089
are useless now that the world
belongs to the barbarians,

350
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,591
but we,

351
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,969
or at least you and I, know

352
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:12,016
what we can protect
with courtesy and loyalty.

353
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,061
Is that not right?

354
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,483
Your Majesty.

355
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,944
Please let me confront Jin-saeng.

356
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,530
Treason?

357
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,824
Assassination?

358
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,704
How could I have poisoned
Your Majesty's abalones

359
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:37,166
or cursed you by hiding
a cursed object in your residence?

360
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,338
It is not true.

361
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,217
The palace maids are innocent,
Your Majesty!

362
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,761
Your Majesty!

363
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,723
How dare she raise her voice
in front of me?

364
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,688
I know she has people working with her.

365
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,445
She must have gained their favor

366
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,364
with the wealth she gained in Shenyang.

367
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,574
By "them", you mean…

368
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,829
I am talking about the captives
the crown prince freed.

369
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:20,751
She is counting on them,
which is why she is being insolent.

370
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,715
In times like this,

371
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,010
we must conduct gichal
with the utmost thoroughness.

372
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,846
GICHAL: QUESTIONING
AND INSPECTING PASSERSBY

373
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,433
Call the police chiefs
and tell them to conduct more patrols

374
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,436
so criminals may not roam at night.

375
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,231
Assign the Minister of Military Affairs
to the palace.

376
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,066
As for you,

377
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,527
join the Royal Guard.

378
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

379
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:03,586
If trouble occurs
in a moment of carelessness,

380
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,465
by then, it will be
too late to have regrets.

381
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,258
This is the traitors' leader.

382
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,052
This man's body has disappeared.

383
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,305
If he is alive,

384
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,640
we must catch him.

385
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,517
If you catch him,

386
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,978
you may kill him on sight.

387
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,358
Excuse me.

388
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,445
If you see this man, let us know.

389
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,238
Excuse me.

390
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,782
Have you seen this man?

391
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,197
Hyeon.

392
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,326
I promise to protect you.

393
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,113
You should not go out alone.

394
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,118
I have…

395
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,914
done something wrong again, right?

396
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:50,919
Sorry.

397
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,715
That is not…

398
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,429
What are you doing?

399
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,479
Thank you…

400
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,399
for being alive.

401
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,821
Truly, thank you.

402
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,616
But this is a bit…

403
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:25,496
I will not go out alone again,
so could you please…

404
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,622
No.

405
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,249
Our relationship allows this.

406
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:30,876
What?

407
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,338
You said you remember nothing.

408
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,840
So trust me.

409
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,725
I will believe you, so could you--

410
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:52,940
Look.

411
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,863
Do not lose this ever again.

412
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,328
What is this?

413
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:09,123
You should put it back where it was.

414
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,125
Where was it before?

415
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,216
How could she

416
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,177
touch my chest?

417
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,520
Did we really have a relationship

418
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,064
that involved doing such childish things?

419
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,482
Of course.

420
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,193
Let me see.

421
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,699
Darn it.

422
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,290
Did you just swear?

423
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,127
Also,

424
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,422
you keep touching me.

425
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,091
But men and women

426
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,969
should not sit together
after the age of seven--

427
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,804
Did I not say earlier?

428
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,098
We are allowed to do this.

429
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,976
Let us play again. Here.

430
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,072
Good.

431
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,040
Here, open wide.

432
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,167
Open.

433
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,047
This is embarrassing.

434
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,425
Did I not tell you?

435
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:46,470
-We are allowed--
-Yes, fine.

436
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,180
There.

437
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,142
It is dry,

438
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:53,769
so have this.

439
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,068
Good.

440
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:10,827
Here.

441
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:31,932
Are you crazy?

442
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,769
Even if we were in such a relationship,

443
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:40,274
is it not a bit much to behave
like this out in the open?

444
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,402
We were normally like this.

445
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,598
Until the end,

446
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:15,434
you held this ring tightly in your fist.

447
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:19,938
I did?

448
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,274
What…

449
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,659
I mean…

450
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,496
Since I cannot remember,

451
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,666
it must be bothersome.

452
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,093
Should I be honest?

453
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,393
For a long time…

454
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,439
I have desperately wanted

455
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,527
to make childish jokes
and lead a mundane life with you,

456
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,781
where we worry about simple things

457
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,450
like what to eat for dinner.

458
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,996
So, in some ways,

459
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,668
these are the happiest moments
I have spent with you.

460
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:27,547
So then,

461
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,759
even if I never remember,

462
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,261
will you not leave me?

463
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,306
Me? Leave you?

464
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,601
Watch me.

465
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:42,854
Even if I die…

466
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,150
I will never leave your side.

467
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,175
Lee Jang-hyeon.

468
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,135
I have come to get you.

469
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,960
The Servant Pledge Rite

470
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,838
is for vassals
to swear loyalty to their king.

471
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,923
SERVANT PLEDGE RITE: VOW OF
UNITY BY DRINKING ANIMAL BLOOD

472
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:19,302
Today, we have drunk the same blood.

473
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,225
When Kang raised her voice in protest,

474
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,978
at first, I thought it was very strange.

475
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,022
But thinking about it now,

476
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:35,443
I am certain she did so
because she has supporters to rely on.

477
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,948
Think of what happened with Gwanghae.

478
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:44,160
Enemies are surely among us.

479
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,874
If a treasonous revolt suddenly arises

480
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,585
and the country falls, what will you do?

481
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:00,176
Depose Kang and make her die
by drinking poison in her family home.

482
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:05,307
Thoroughly weed out her supporters
and wipe them all out!

483
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,314
Your Highness.

484
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,028
Come to me.

485
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,887
Why are you so worse for wear?

486
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,473
CHOI MYEONG-GIL

487
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,142
KIM SANG-HEON

488
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,602
Do you regret what happened?

489
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,021
Regret?

490
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,942
I only made efforts
to make peace with the barbarians

491
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:23,945
for the sake of Joseon's royal court.

492
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,572
I meant

493
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:28,450
your choice to help enthrone His Majesty.

494
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,827
Do you regret it?

495
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,292
You, Kim Ja-jeom,
and Kim Ryu worked together

496
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,210
to put Prince Neungyang on the throne.

497
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,712
PRINCE NEUNGYANG: INJO'S TITLE
BEFORE BECOMING KING

498
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:44,424
Nobody thought Prince Neungyang
would try to take the throne.

499
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,343
He was gentle and full of fear.

500
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,183
But looking at him now,

501
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,060
our king is a fighter.

502
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,104
When he sensed his life was at risk,

503
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,939
he became more cunning than anyone.

504
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,109
From then on, Prince Neungyang

505
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,278
could not be stopped by anyone.

506
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,073
It is the same now.

507
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,117
Our king

508
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,621
senses that his life is under threat.

509
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,208
There are paths to death even in life,

510
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,376
and there are paths to life even in death.

511
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,129
In 1636,

512
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:27,342
we should have fought
the barbarians until the end.

513
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:33,056
Then, His Majesty would not have
become this corrupt and--

514
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,266
Did you come to say that?

515
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,647
I came because I was scared.

516
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,943
I am scared about what will happen

517
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,070
to this country.

518
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:52,659
But I could not share
these thoughts with anyone else.

519
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,125
You are the only one I could tell.

520
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,015
The traitor Kang

521
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,852
took the poison but did not die instantly.

522
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,895
She suffered for two days

523
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,856
before taking her last breath.

524
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,986
I assume you are hunting
down her supporters.

525
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,490
The interpreters are suspicious.

526
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,742
The interpreters have been

527
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,620
in close communication with the Qing.

528
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:44,377
Look into all the interpreters who were
close to the crown prince in Shenyang.

529
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,671
Yes, Your Majesty.

530
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,426
What has the nobility been doing?

531
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,554
What about Choi Myeong-gil?

532
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:59,934
It is suspicious that Myeong-gil protected
Kang until the end.

533
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:03,980
By any chance,

534
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:08,026
he is not getting
any ridiculous ideas, is he?

535
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,825
I did not protect you…

536
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,538
and get called a man who sold his country

537
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:23,208
to see you in this state, Your Majesty.

538
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:30,840
But

539
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,635
it seems this is also my fate.

540
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,475
I want to rest now.

541
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:42,977
I want…

542
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,649
CHOI MYEONG-GIL DIED
FROM OLD AGE

543
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:52,070
AT THE AGE OF 62

544
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,748
Those bastards.

545
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,417
How could they do this to a person?

546
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,796
If I run into them,

547
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,673
I will rip their hair out.

548
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,051
Their hair?

549
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:18,846
All done.

550
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,515
-Now, turn around.
-All right.

551
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:33,570
My gosh.

552
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,539
Still, your wounds are healing well,

553
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,666
so that is a relief.

554
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:50,920
-Here too…
-That…

555
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,674
That is enough.

556
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,385
Why?

557
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:59,137
-You need ointment here--
-I said

558
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,305
it is enough!

559
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,602
From now on,

560
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:09,522
I will apply the ointment myself,
so leave it here and go.

561
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,442
-But I can--
-I can do things myself!

562
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:15,653
Also,

563
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,280
I do not want to hear you say,

564
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,240
"This is how we normally are."

565
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,826
You keep touching me.

566
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:23,911
Then, I…

567
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:25,580
I also…

568
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:27,832
Anyway!

569
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:28,916
Do not ever again…

570
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,048
I…

571
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:41,554
That is not

572
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:43,640
what I meant.

573
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:01,759
Was the order given by the crown prince?

574
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:12,061
My lord.

575
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,235
I hope…

576
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:26,159
I have not acted embarrassingly.

577
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:33,750
My lord.

578
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,060
I am sorry.

579
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:57,857
I am late.

580
01:02:58,733 --> 01:02:59,984
I am truly sorry.

581
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:36,038
Have you dealt with the traitors
we confined in the palace prison?

582
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,374
That man is not Gu Yang-cheon.

583
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,501
It was the interpreter Lee Jang-hyeon.

584
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,752
What happened to that man?

585
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:44,630
Is he dead or alive?

586
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:48,384
Jang-hyeon. You are the only one
I can entrust with this task.

587
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:51,554
The Qing insist that only
Lee Jang-hyeon act as their interpreter.

588
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:53,973
Everyone is looking for you,

589
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:55,933
but you will enter the palace?

590
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:13,701
