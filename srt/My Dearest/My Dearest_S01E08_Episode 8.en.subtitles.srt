1
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,314
I know you do not love me yet.

2
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,234
I know that your heart…

3
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,783
still lies with Young Master Yeon-jun.

4
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,744
However…

5
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,500
even if you do not love me…

6
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,545
I ask that you do not forget me.

7
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,425
You must not…

8
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,472
forget this moment…

9
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,354
that we shared today.

10
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,289
I know

11
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,709
that the man I meet
in my dreams every night

12
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,504
is my future husband.

13
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,342
You must not

14
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,012
forget this moment…

15
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,308
that we shared today.

16
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,905
But I was sure
it was Young Master Yeon-jun.

17
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,198
What do you mean?

18
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,035
I must see him once more.

19
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,747
See who?

20
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,499
Where are you off to this time?

21
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,917
Goodness.

22
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,336
You ought to ride a palanquin, my lady.

23
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,963
A palanquin will take too long.

24
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,674
I even steered a wagon during wartime,
so lend me a horse.

25
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,050
I cannot.

26
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,844
I cannot, my lady.

27
00:02:58,344 --> 00:02:59,804
Lady Gil-chae?

28
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,850
I hope this is not scary.

29
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:04,976
Not at all.

30
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,270
Just please hurry.

31
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,535
Thank you.

32
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,914
I feel much safer having you
accompany us to Shenyang.

33
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,499
Once His Royal Highness
succeeds the throne,

34
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,335
he will reward you for your troubles.

35
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,630
But you could not care less, right?

36
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,381
I was only saying.

37
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,967
So it is a little odd.

38
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,638
You are not doing this
out of loyalty or to gain favor.

39
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,558
So, why are you willingly
putting yourself in harm's way

40
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,894
with the sad face of a man
who is leaving behind a lover?

41
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,021
What do you mean by that?

42
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,774
Did you think

43
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,860
that a eunuch like me
would be ignorant in matters of love?

44
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,071
I may be physically lacking,

45
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,115
but I, too, have a heart.

46
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,786
You want to know why I am leaving?

47
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,374
Let me see.

48
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,461
I do not have a reason
to stay in Joseon at the moment.

49
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,509
Also…

50
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:37,277
The crown prince grew up in the palace
and is not used to sleeping outdoors.

51
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,237
Can you make sure

52
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,990
he sleeps on heated floors?

53
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,458
While in Shenyang,

54
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,420
do not be too angry,

55
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,632
but do not appear too weak either.

56
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,767
When will…

57
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,689
I get to see you again, Your Majesty?

58
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,497
I am slightly intrigued
by what fate has in store

59
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,584
for his poor soul.

60
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:57,774
Your people cannot let you leave,
Your Royal Highness.

61
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,152
Please do not go, Your Royal Highness!

62
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,579
Your Royal Highness, please let me stay.

63
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,166
Who will take care of my children?

64
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,807
Hey!

65
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,437
Let us take her with us.

66
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,731
That pretty face will be worth something.

67
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,413
Prepare to die!

68
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,211
His Imperial Majesty has prohibited
personal prisoners since Ganghwa Island.

69
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,172
Will you defy his command?

70
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,242
Why do you always act as you see fit?

71
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,035
If you had been dragged away…

72
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,787
You took the words out of my mouth.

73
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,330
How can you be this selfish?

74
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,916
-Me?
-Yes.

75
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,960
You stole a kiss from me,

76
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,129
and now you are off to Shenyang.

77
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,048
And what was that
about "relationship limbo"?

78
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,594
Does being in limbo or whatever mean
you can act however you please, like this?

79
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,431
What are you upset about?

80
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,559
The kiss or my trip to Shenyang?

81
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,561
Or is it both?

82
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,355
Would it kill you to be serious?

83
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,233
Is everything a joke to you?

84
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,742
What is this?

85
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,538
Did you acquire a sudden interest in me?

86
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,875
Up until a few days ago,

87
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,961
you were crying over Young Master Yeon-jun
and treated me like a ghost.

88
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,927
Could it be that you have
fallen for me since the kiss?

89
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:32,803
That is preposterous.

90
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:37,975
Oh, my. I knew I was talented
in that field, but not to this extent.

91
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,435
Goodness.

92
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,104
I must have been out of my mind

93
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,649
to consider anything
with someone this flippant.

94
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,276
Why did you come here?

95
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,613
You should at least tell me

96
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,740
why you came here.

97
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,466
Do you believe in dreams?

98
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,220
-What?
-Well,

99
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,973
I dreamt that a cherished spool
was rolling away,

100
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,767
so I had to chase after it,
but there was no end to the path.

101
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,645
I had to climb mountains and cross rivers,

102
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,647
and then I lost my floral shoes.

103
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,149
They were my favorite pair.

104
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,568
Anyway…

105
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,405
there was a person.

106
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,784
-That person was--
-Are you requesting new shoes?

107
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,578
What?

108
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,205
I knew you liked
to collect shoes, but this…

109
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,748
No, that is not what I meant.

110
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,250
Jang-hyeon!

111
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,544
Jang-hyeon!

112
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,254
That is my cue to go.

113
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,756
Watch out for barbarians on your way back.

114
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,510
My floral shoes.

115
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,096
When will I get them?

116
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,934
When will you bring me new floral shoes?

117
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,814
I am in desperate need of new ones,
so come back as fast as possible.

118
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,817
Lady Gil-chae,

119
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,155
requesting floral shoes to wear in Joseon
when I am off to Shenyang…

120
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,496
Fine. I will work on it.

121
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,414
So tell me.

122
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,170
If I get you new floral shoes…

123
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,341
what will I get in return?

124
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,385
What is it that you want?

125
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,846
You know what I desire.

126
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,141
There is only one thing…

127
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,437
that I want.

128
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,775
I wish for your heart…

129
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,696
to long only…

130
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,283
for me.

131
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,831
You are quite the dreamer.

132
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,751
You wish to win me over
with a pair of floral shoes?

133
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,462
You are always like this.

134
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,172
Everything is a joke to you.

135
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,509
How am I supposed
to trust you enough to love you?

136
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,552
Everything is a joke to me?

137
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,682
Maybe that is just
what you want to believe.

138
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,939
It must hurt your pride to admit
you are interested in the likes of me.

139
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,110
A jaded, corrupted man

140
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,154
whose origin is unknown.

141
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,908
You have to see me as a joke
to allow yourself

142
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,744
to hold onto your feelings
for Young Master Yeon-jun.

143
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,415
I am sure you enjoy acting as a woman

144
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,626
who is devoted to only one man.

145
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,794
But do you know what?

146
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,049
You are not innocently faithful,

147
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,136
nor are you pure.

148
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,850
You love a man
who is betrothed to another woman.

149
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,894
What is pure and innocent about that?

150
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,565
That is why you are best suited

151
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,694
to be with a jaded man like me.

152
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:23,993
Just go!

153
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,454
Go and die.

154
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,713
If you…

155
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,343
If you promise not to think
about Young Master Yeon-jun again…

156
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,599
I will change my mind
about going to Shenyang.

157
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,854
Even empty words would suffice.

158
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,816
You can love him secretly
as much as you please.

159
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,611
However…

160
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,699
if you can offer me
even just an empty promise…

161
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,587
I cannot do that.

162
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,424
Young Master Yeon-jun

163
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,678
is not someone I can easily move on from.

164
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,883
You are the worst.

165
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,099
I mean…

166
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,229
what does Young Master Yeon-jun have

167
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,315
that I do not?

168
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,660
Hey! Come on, already!

169
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,124
I really must go now.

170
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,589
May I think…

171
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,175
that you used the floral shoes…

172
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,431
as an excuse to come see me off?

173
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,232
I will bring you
the most beautiful pair of floral shoes.

174
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,649
It is not like you
to be hung up on a woman.

175
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,861
You vowed not to marry,

176
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,238
but you would wed her today
if she proposed.

177
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,452
What is a love
one cannot easily move on from?

178
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,497
Does something like that exist?

179
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,290
Of course, it does.

180
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,420
There were two children named
Gap-dol and Gap-sun.

181
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,632
They grew up believing
they would marry each other.

182
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,552
However, life is never that simple.

183
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,306
As per her parents' arrangement,

184
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,642
Gap-sun married a rich man
from a neighboring village.

185
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,520
She had four sons and three daughters
and lived a happy life.

186
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,146
Her husband was a good man.

187
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,150
But when Gap-sun
was about to die of old age,

188
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,404
she squeezed her husband's hand
and said this.

189
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,156
"Gap-dol,

190
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,118
I will be waiting for you,

191
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,745
so take your time."

192
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,084
Gap-sun had never forgotten about Gap-dol.

193
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,046
It was not within her control.

194
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,882
No one

195
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,802
can make you stop loving someone.

196
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,304
Not ever.

197
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:55,973
Until you die.

198
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,721
Who was that man?

199
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,726
Why are you asking
when you saw everything?

200
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,743
It is time you stopped pining
after Young Master Yeon-jun.

201
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,537
To me, Young Master Yeon-jun

202
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,499
is more than just a crush.

203
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,710
Whenever I think about him…

204
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,300
I am reminded of my golden days.

205
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:15,803
Can you

206
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,264
forget the prime of your life?

207
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,308
Young Master.

208
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,984
How shameless of me.

209
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,403
My mentor died,

210
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,073
and the crown prince was taken hostage,

211
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,243
but here I am being greedy.

212
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:40,869
Greedy?

213
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,080
I lack in many ways.

214
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,749
However, there is someone

215
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,793
who still thinks highly of me.

216
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,504
When I am with her,

217
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,925
I feel like a decent man.

218
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,390
Lady Eun-ae.

219
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,395
Will you marry me?

220
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:16,321
I forgot to check on the master's meal.

221
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,964
If a woman is violated by the barbarians,

222
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,216
death is inevitable.

223
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,094
But even if a woman
only has a brief encounter,

224
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,512
how could she continue to live?

225
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,351
She wept and cried out to the heavens.

226
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,314
"I am a widow.
How could I let another hold my wrist?"

227
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,774
With that, the woman
cut her hand off by the wrist.

228
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,486
That is how a woman
should preserve her dignity.

229
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,950
Why are you not asleep?

230
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,003
Did Young Master Yeon-jun
ask for your hand in marriage?

231
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,633
Why are you not happy?

232
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,802
-For a long time, you have--
-I am not worthy.

233
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,640
Even showing your skin
to a man who is not your husband

234
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,476
is the same as losing your virginity.

235
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,438
My skin was touched by a barbarian…

236
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,026
so how could I marry
Young Master Yeon-jun--

237
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,954
I cannot.

238
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,916
I am not worthy.

239
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,587
-I--
-I do not understand what you are saying.

240
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,590
Have you forgotten?

241
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,509
That day,

242
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,305
our skin and clothes got torn
because we took the wrong path.

243
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,017
Nothing happened to us that day.

244
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,408
The one who Young Master Yeon-jun wants

245
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,576
is you.

246
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,415
And the one to make him happy

247
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,084
is also you.

248
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,463
That means the only one
who is worthy to be his better half…

249
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,843
is also you.

250
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,478
The bride will drink.

251
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,276
The groom will drink.

252
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,714
I never thought otherwise.

253
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,884
I strongly believed

254
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,428
that it was Young Master Yeon-jun

255
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,180
who appeared in my dream.

256
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:37,105
I did not mind seeing him be sweet
to a woman who was not me.

257
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,861
Maybe I was pleased to know
such a sweet man existed.

258
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:49,534
The young master in my dreams
had to be Young Master Yeon-jun.

259
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,579
However,

260
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:57,667
even though I now know
that his heart belongs to Eun-ae,

261
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,504
I am not sad.

262
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,716
Has something been lost?

263
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,301
Or could it be

264
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,888
that something new has
blossomed in my heart?

265
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,352
Head off first.

266
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,354
I need to stop by a place in Uiju.

267
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,731
Uiju?

268
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,399
I will see you in Shenyang.

269
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,527
-Let us go.
-Wait.

270
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,322
Who does he think he is?

271
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,074
Hey!

272
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,035
When the barbarians struck…

273
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,120
UIJU

274
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,455
…the people of Uiju
went to Big Brother for safety.

275
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,209
There was a blood bath
where many died and fled.

276
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,503
Since then…

277
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,719
Where did the old man go?

278
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,320
Qing soldiers invaded quickly,
which is why the looting

279
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:11,032
in the Hwanghae and Pyeongan
provinces was not severe.

280
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:15,954
However, the pillaging and extortion
in villages on their way back

281
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,998
caused great harm.

282
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:23,420
Mountain ridges and valleys
had to be crossed on the way back to Qing.

283
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,381
So the horses fainted
or died of exhaustion.

284
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,758
No words could explain
the hardships that were faced.

285
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,722
The people were taken as prisoners
during farming season,

286
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,849
and no one was left to tend to the fields.

287
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,852
The suffering of our people
is truly tragic.

288
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:44,774
Right.

289
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,026
SHENYANG

290
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,736
This is not a bad place to reside in.

291
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,613
From what I gathered,

292
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,908
the owner has a gambling habit,
so he will soon sell this inn.

293
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,160
Just my luck.

294
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,370
I think I will

295
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,831
soon have to obtain this inn.

296
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,668
I need to earn money to open

297
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:05,795
another branch of Usimjeong.

298
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:06,880
What?

299
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:08,965
Really?

300
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,050
Yes.

301
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:12,260
Ryang-eum,

302
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:16,598
find out how His Royal Highness
deals with the barbarians.

303
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,726
When going into business,

304
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:24,439
one must be aware of those
who govern the state.

305
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,193
CROWN PRINCE'S HALL IN SHENYANG

306
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,410
I speak the words of His Imperial Majesty.

307
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,746
His Imperial Majesty

308
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:44,000
considers it highly important
to capture escaped Joseon prisoners,

309
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:48,255
but you seem
to neglect this duty of yours.

310
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,758
How dare you glare at His Royal Highness?

311
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:56,012
We are not breaking our promise.
There is just nothing we can do.

312
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,639
The weeds are overgrown,

313
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,350
so there is no way
to find prisoners who have hidden.

314
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,519
Telling me will do you no good.

315
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,022
Countless prisoners have
escaped across the river,

316
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,234
but you have failed to capture
a single one of them.

317
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,998
What is the meaning of this?

318
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,167
His Imperial Majesty
prohibited cigarettes long ago,

319
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,877
but they were brought in again.

320
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,089
Do the people of Joseon

321
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,883
not even listen to their crown prince?

322
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,511
Is there no discipline?

323
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,018
Anyone with cigarettes

324
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,562
will be flogged 80 times
with a leather whip

325
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,980
and have their ears threaded.

326
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,190
His Imperial Majesty speaks!

327
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,735
Where are the promised soldiers?

328
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,196
Have you forgotten your sacred vow
or are you betraying us?

329
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,533
Do the crown prince and prince
not want to return home?

330
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,995
Has the king of Joseon
abandoned his two princes?

331
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,082
Should there come a time
for me to reject the soldiers…

332
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,128
the crown prince's life
will be in jeopardy.

333
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,224
Is that so?

334
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,519
Yes, the crown prince is stubborn.

335
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:31,191
Should I punish him for raising his chin
while your words were being delivered?

336
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,736
What can we do when the crown prince
will not live in peace with us?

337
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,281
Prince Bongrim is in Shenyang,

338
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,533
and the crown prince's son is in Joseon.

339
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,744
Even if the crown prince
suffers an unfortunate fate here,

340
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,539
there will be plenty of others
to accept my deal.

341
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:53,088
"I think upon Emperor Yao,
who accomplished great deeds.

342
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,633
He was well-spoken, bright and serene"…

343
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,011
Your Royal Highness.

344
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,681
-Your Royal Highness.
-Your Royal Highness.

345
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:08,728
-Your Royal Highness.
-Your Royal Highness.

346
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,398
-Your Royal Highness.
-Your Royal Highness.

347
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:15,443
They threatened His Royal Highness
regarding provisions

348
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,362
and the return of escaped prisoners,

349
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,116
but the crown prince
firmly stood his ground.

350
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:25,412
The Khan was offended
and berated him about all kinds of things,

351
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,416
causing the crown prince
to weep during the royal lecture,

352
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,876
and now his health is declining.

353
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,087
It is deeply concerning.

354
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,261
I worry

355
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,431
the crown prince might break.

356
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,519
Young Master,
about the new branch of Usimjeong…

357
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,105
-Yes?
-What do you think of Namwon?

358
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,023
That is a good idea.

359
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,316
I will manage the place.

360
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,777
That sounds good.

361
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:03,408
But if we open a branch in Namwon,
Ryang-eum must sing there once a week.

362
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,951
Sure. You tell him.

363
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,329
When has Ryang-eum ever done as I asked?

364
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,166
Fine.

365
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,753
Ryang-eum.

366
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,926
Have you looked into the crown prince?

367
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,012
I have. I think he is struggling.

368
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,348
The barbarians flogged
those who brought cigarettes

369
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,393
with a leather whip
and threatened the crown prince,

370
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,314
so he ended up crying
in front of his subjects.

371
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,857
He cried?

372
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,358
The crown prince?

373
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,618
He will likely die here
without stepping on Joseon soil again.

374
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,787
No way.

375
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,041
The Khan's father, Nurhaci, played
Ming's emperor against Yuan Chonghuan,

376
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,002
which led to the latter's death.

377
00:29:56,836 --> 00:30:00,590
Would his son not use
the same tactics on Joseon?

378
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,468
The barbarians

379
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,845
will most certainly

380
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,974
and deviously play Joseon's king
against the crown prince.

381
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,184
And anyway,

382
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,687
the crown prince is
asking for death by being stubborn.

383
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,233
But that does not concern me.

384
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,401
Let us go.

385
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,112
There is another reason
I am here in Shenyang.

386
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,078
That man over there

387
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:34,582
is offering to sell 6 kg of cigarettes
for 150 yang.

388
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,418
But he will not mind receiving 100 yang.

389
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,255
That man over there

390
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,883
is willing to buy 6 kg of cigarettes
with 300 yang,

391
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:47,428
but is willing to pay up to
350 yang if needed.

392
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:52,517
If I act as a bridge and help them
to meet each other halfway

393
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,270
in exchange for a commission of 50 yang,

394
00:30:56,187 --> 00:31:00,483
he will earn an extra 100 yang,
while he will save 50 yang.

395
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,820
What should one name such a clever tactic?

396
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,448
Creative economy.

397
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,533
Like this,

398
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:12,745
by bringing in items
that are rare in Shenyang,

399
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,706
we will make a fortune.

400
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,916
But if we get caught smuggling…

401
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,253
Why are you being squeamish?
This is what we always did in Uiju.

402
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,547
This is not like our time in Uiju.

403
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,132
Why is that?

404
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,136
I am here as a Joseon interpreter.

405
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,390
Those of the imperial house
that do business with me

406
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,101
will have my back.

407
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:42,901
It is top quality.

408
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,278
How much did you bring?

409
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,491
Where does one obtain
such high-quality goods?

410
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,868
We are not here to trade,

411
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,871
but to drink.

412
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,584
Harvesting ginseng across the border
will get you killed,

413
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,961
and so will trading it in secret.

414
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,671
That explains

415
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,506
the secrecy.

416
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,677
But that will not be the case
if you deal with an interpreter.

417
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,640
Of course, a small commission
shall be expected.

418
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,974
An interpreter?

419
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,644
Over there.

420
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,740
Jang-hyeon. Jackpot!

421
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,742
Right now,

422
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:35,912
all those who wish to trade wild ginseng
and cigarettes are headed here.

423
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,707
Where should we spend all the profits?

424
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,126
Ryang-eum.

425
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,921
Find me those big swords
favored by the barbarians.

426
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,676
Dorgon is suffering from a severe illness.

427
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,803
We hear Joseon's bamboo extract
does wonders.

428
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,680
Could you obtain it for us?

429
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:58,226
I was able to procure bamboo extract
and blue bamboo on short notice recently,

430
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,812
but I am not sure this time around.

431
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,941
Bamboo extract cannot be easily obtained.

432
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,780
The crown prince is giving
Jung Myeong-su the cold shoulder.

433
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,740
If we do not procure bamboo extract…

434
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,454
Maybe you should ask "the man"
regarding items from Joseon.

435
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,499
There is nothing he cannot procure,

436
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,377
and even the imperial family
wishes to befriend him.

437
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:29,048
Recently, he procured large swords
for the emperor's male relatives.

438
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,802
Who is this man?

439
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,764
Whom we do business with
does not matter that much,

440
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:41,519
but now that you are an interpreter,
the trading seems almost legitimate.

441
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,271
We are earning twice the amount as well.

442
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,234
Who is Jang-hyeon of the Lee family?

443
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,282
I hear you procure items
while frequenting Fenghuang Palace.

444
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:55,783
Have you

445
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,161
been trading for personal gain?

446
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,581
Interpreters must raise
their own travel costs,

447
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:05,418
so trading ginseng and cigarettes
has always been permitted

448
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,086
for interpreters.

449
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,171
So,

450
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,675
you prioritize accumulating wealth
over serving His Royal Highness?

451
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:18,431
You kissed up to the emperor's relatives
by procuring large swords.

452
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,978
How dare you raise your chin?

453
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,570
Is there something you need?

454
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,865
Is there someone you must

455
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:37,825
curry favors with?

456
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,702
Such insolence!

457
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,040
Dorgon is requesting bamboo extract.

458
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,000
Could you urgently procure it?

459
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,007
Dorgon received his bamboo extract?

460
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:53,966
Yes.

461
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,384
He gave some to the emperor

462
00:34:55,885 --> 00:35:00,264
and was praised for procuring
something of such high quality.

463
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,308
How did he obtain what I could not?

464
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:07,688
An interpreter from Joseon
seems to have a knack for business.

465
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,443
An interpreter?

466
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,071
Is there one I do not know about?

467
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:18,407
He rarely visits Joseon Hall

468
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,786
but frequents Fenghuang Palace
to obtain various goods.

469
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:27,125
Trading with him may be
the fastest way to obtain rare items.

470
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,545
Maybe you could take him under your wing
and have him work for you.

471
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,925
This is driving me crazy.

472
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:40,221
How can we obtain lotus leaves
that only grow on Ming soil?

473
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,777
You!

474
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,036
It has been a while.

475
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,789
I know I should have greeted you sooner.

476
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,710
I thought the smallpox got you.

477
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,463
It almost did.

478
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,967
After volunteering to go to the island

479
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,928
in the hopes of becoming a gapsa,

480
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:22,972
I ended up being captured

481
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,057
as a Joseon prisoner.

482
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,939
I thought my life had come to an end

483
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,693
but was told I could live
if I served as an interpreter.

484
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,073
You expect me to believe that?

485
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,950
Do you doubt me?

486
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,537
Choi Deuk-nam and Mak Dong

487
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,248
were once prisoners
who became state interpreters.

488
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,542
Why do you not believe me?

489
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,422
Do you think…

490
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,676
I will just let this slide?

491
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,351
You must think I am a spy,

492
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:10,978
but

493
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,814
I am not.

494
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,985
And I must not be one.

495
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,282
What would the emperor do
if he thought you failed

496
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,618
to realize I was a spy
even after pulling out six toenails?

497
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,664
Would he let you live?

498
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:43,719
If…

499
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,224
you intend to kill me…

500
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,978
tell me in advance.

501
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,357
I must inform the emperor's relatives

502
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,651
that I can no longer provide
what they need.

503
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,491
Did I…

504
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,787
tell you what happened
to the spy named Ha Seo-guk?

505
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,873
Once he was caught…

506
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,794
he was killed by having
his eyes, tongue and feet cut off.

507
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:19,797
One day,

508
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,341
I will…

509
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,013
end you the same way.

510
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,454
Will we be all right?

511
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,734
Today, I must see your face.

512
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,818
So right now…

513
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,324
No!

514
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,254
The young master
in your dream was bleeding?

515
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,882
That has never happened before.

516
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,511
They say Shenyang is the path to death.

517
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,055
You must have dreamed that out of concern.

518
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,807
Yes, it seems that way.

519
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,313
Wait. What does Shenyang
have to do with me?

520
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,148
Let me see.

521
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,693
The one who went to Shenyang
is Young Master Jang-hyeon--

522
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,612
You have it wrong.

523
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,657
I have yet to see the face
of the man in my dreams.

524
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,367
It is not Young Master Jang-hyeon.

525
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,662
Goodness. Have you not seen his face yet?

526
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,581
The next time you dream of him,
you must see his face first.

527
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,668
If only I could control my dreams.

528
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,628
I know of a way.

529
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,259
This stone has mystical powers.

530
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,553
Rinse this in the first water
of the morning,

531
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,721
wrap it in this red silk,

532
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,348
and clutch it while you sleep.

533
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,226
The young master's face
will appear before you.

534
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,645
But beware.

535
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,440
The stone must never touch the ground.

536
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,985
You believe such superstitions?

537
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,780
I will take it back then.

538
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,574
Madam Bangdu.

539
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,785
Why bother moving something so heavy?

540
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,163
Just throw it over in that corner.

541
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,331
-Shall I?
-Yes.

542
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,792
-Over here?
-Sure. Whatever.

543
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,213
I will put it here.

544
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:29,153
Does that stone
truly have mystical powers?

545
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,280
As if such a thing exists.

546
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,421
Once you get to know her,
Lady Eun-ae is actually worse.

547
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,681
Your Royal Highness,

548
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,726
an officer of Qing asked if Jung Myeong-su

549
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,562
had ever taken possession
of the goods that were meant

550
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,356
for the emperor.

551
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:09,151
General Yonggoldae
will soon be here to investigate,

552
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:10,945
so this could be our opportunity

553
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,198
to speak of the instances
where Jung Myeong-su

554
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:17,701
stole silver, persimmons and pears
that were sent from Joseon.

555
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,330
Come to think of it,

556
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,209
he did not take
1,000 of the 10,000 persimmons

557
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,795
that were set aside,

558
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,756
which provoked an inquiry from me.

559
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,050
He answered that I should not bother

560
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:38,472
since he would take what was needed
when the time was right.

561
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,308
How dare a mere interpreter steal goods

562
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,811
that were sent to the emperor
by Joseon's king?

563
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:45,771
That is not all.

564
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:48,065
While traveling to Joseon
on duty as an envoy,

565
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,901
he used a rod to beat
the assistant minister of military affairs

566
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,861
when he was of low birth.

567
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,447
He is just a lowly servant.

568
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,532
Yes.

569
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,994
I heard he used to be of low status.

570
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,250
Allow me an audience
with the crown prince.

571
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,211
Your Royal Highness,

572
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,714
maybe you should hear him out.

573
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,133
Your Royal Highness.

574
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,052
It is still not too late

575
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,972
to stop the report
regarding Jung Myeong-su.

576
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,056
Also,

577
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,268
even if you know of his indiscretions,

578
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,770
you must lie

579
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,565
-and say you are clueless.
-Then,

580
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:33,777
are you telling me
to let that rat Jung Myeong-su

581
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,070
steal from both countries?

582
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:38,157
Him being a rat
is what makes him dangerous.

583
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,035
With whom do you think

584
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,912
that rat of a man

585
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,081
shared the persimmons he stole?

586
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,127
Who has been utilizing
Jung Myeong-su's services

587
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,838
the most?

588
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,680
Your Royal Highness!

589
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,983
You will answer to His Imperial Majesty.

590
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:30,292
"It has come to my attention

591
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,461
that Jung Noe-gyeong
falsely accused Jung Myeong-su.

592
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,923
Since the people of Joseon
are now under my governance,

593
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,508
I will punish him based on our law."

594
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,604
General.

595
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,193
Your Royal Highness,

596
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,362
were you also a part of this?

597
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:02,741
Your Royal Highness,

598
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,245
the emperor entrusted me
with affairs involving Joseon.

599
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:10,124
Reporting Jung Myeong-su of stealing
is a direct attack on me.

600
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,836
And aiding Jung Noe-gyeong,
who tried to sabotage me,

601
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,505
means you are
also after my flesh and blood.

602
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:19,716
So if you

603
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,511
did not partake in this slander,

604
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,057
you must kill Jung Noe-gyeong
and everyone else involved.

605
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,234
You must kill them all.

606
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,117
Wife.

607
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:46,994
Are you asleep?

608
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,834
When the second Jin invasion broke out…

609
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,338
even though I knew
you were fleeing for your life,

610
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,550
I went to save the king
rather than protecting you.

611
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,847
There was no chance
someone like me could save him,

612
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,517
but I had to go to him
even if that meant dying.

613
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,480
Do you know why?

614
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,861
The elders of Neunggun-ri

615
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:24,281
raised me after my parents passed away.

616
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,076
For that, I was always grateful.

617
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:29,578
But…

618
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,624
my heart was never at ease.

619
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,211
I wanted to give back to them.

620
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,590
I wanted to show them
that I had become an upright man…

621
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,761
despite not having parents.

622
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,518
I am good now.

623
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,562
I have His Majesty.

624
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,483
If I can help him to be a benevolent king,

625
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,320
the elders of Neunggun-ri will be proud.

626
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,407
Wife.

627
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,161
I will be a loyal subject.

628
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,915
I will give my all

629
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,001
to help him be a benevolent king.

630
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,386
Many high-ranking officials
have been feigning illness

631
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,887
as an excuse to resign.

632
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,181
Why is that?

633
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:34,142
Are they holding me in disdain?

634
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,356
Do they consider me to be filthy

635
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,150
for giving in to the barbarians?

636
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,781
Your Majesty.

637
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,743
Ever since the crown prince
was taken hostage,

638
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,037
the people have been
shedding endless tears.

639
00:47:55,914 --> 00:48:00,919
The people are hoping for his return
so that the nation can be whole again.

640
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,589
However,

641
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:07,175
you show clear discomfort
at things you do not want to hear.

642
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,305
You are unwilling to let go
of your greed and biases,

643
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,600
and you have failed to control
your competitive nature.

644
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,561
How are those the makings of a great king?

645
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,273
Your Majesty,

646
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,402
rather than questioning
why they might be resigning,

647
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,863
reflect on your own actions and words

648
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:30,824
so that you can take the correct path.

649
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,620
A king loving his people,

650
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,873
loyal subjects giving the king
their honest opinions,

651
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,917
and the king listening to them
is the correct path.

652
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,920
By doing so,
the barbarians will be reformed,

653
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,464
and heaven and earth will grant…

654
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,051
the crown prince's return.

655
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:05,817
Of course.

656
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,612
You are right, Compiler Nam.

657
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,741
I must get myself together first.

658
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,160
I am much obliged.

659
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:18,497
I was deeply moved
by your courageous speech.

660
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,999
So I wish to entrust you with a task.

661
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:27,798
I plan to send a document officer to Qing
to deliver my regards to the Khan.

662
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:32,594
Who else could display
Joseon's strong integrity

663
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,262
in front of the barbarians?

664
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,227
Only you can do it.

665
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,359
Does the stone actually work?

666
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,986
I did not see any faces.

667
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,198
Did you hug it tight while sleeping?

668
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,200
You did not lose grip of it?

669
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,579
I think I hugged it tight.

670
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,960
Did you hear the news?

671
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,129
Compiler Nam…

672
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,297
He was incarcerated.

673
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:14,094
His Majesty appointed Complier Nam
as a document officer,

674
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:17,806
but when he refused to go to Qing
to deliver the king's regards,

675
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:21,435
the enraged king charged him
as guilty of irreverence.

676
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,187
IRREVERENCE: ONE OF TEN HEINOUS
CRIMES LISTED IN MING LEGAL CODE

677
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:48,545
Seize all the assets of Nam Yeon-jun,
the sinner charged with irreverence.

678
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,551
Barbarians.

679
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,845
The barbarians are here!

680
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,889
Barbarians!

681
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,599
Barbarians…

682
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,739
We must go to Neunggun-ri.

683
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,297
We will get a hefty amount
by selling this.

684
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,381
Not this.

685
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:34,883
You cannot.

686
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:37,427
Did you hear the news?

687
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,056
-People are returning from Shenyang.
-What?

688
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:44,017
People were sent from Shenyang
for the nation's ancestral rite,

689
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,311
and some are coming home for good.

690
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,772
You know Lord Shim's wife
from the neighboring village.

691
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:52,317
She lost the will to live
since her husband went to Shenyang,

692
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,362
but the news of him coming back
has her back on her feet.

693
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,447
Then…

694
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,033
Young Master Jang-hyeon
may return as well.

695
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,634
Husband!

696
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:18,760
-Husband.
-Wife!

697
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:24,724
-My dear wife.
-Husband!

698
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,810
Look. There they come.

699
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,104
-Goodness me.
-There they are.

700
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,568
-Jae-yeon!
-Jae-yeon!

701
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,528
There you are.

702
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,238
Have you been well?

703
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,406
Goodness.

704
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,032
Maybe he is running late.

705
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,704
I blame you…

706
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,584
for making this mess.

707
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,212
-How dare you?
-Sure.

708
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,298
What would a mere interpreter know anyway?

709
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,382
Still,

710
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:01,428
please come to me with affairs
involving the barbarians.

711
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,140
Is it not obvious?

712
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,352
Jung Myeong-su
is Yonggoldae's right-hand man.

713
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,273
Look here.

714
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,817
Will we die or not?

715
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:19,905
I doubt they will actually kill us.

716
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:25,285
So if you want to live,
bribe Jung Myeong-su or Yonggoldae.

717
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,503
Get up.

718
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,142
Interpreter Lee did not frame you.

719
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:53,063
That is right. He rarely cares
about others' businesses.

720
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,858
He knows General Yonggoldae
trusts you the most,

721
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,568
so why would he have defamed you?

722
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,195
Please believe us.

723
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,279
Is that so?

724
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:07,452
I also do not believe that Lee Jang-hyeon
is stupid enough to report me.

725
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,787
However,

726
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:13,583
the crown prince failed
to save Jung Noe-gyeong

727
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,670
despite offering
a generous amount of gold.

728
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,421
I was ordered

729
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,840
to send to Joseon
the belongings of Jung Noe-gyeong

730
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,509
and the others who will be executed.

731
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,804
Considering the order that was given,

732
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,224
it seems Lee Jang-hyeon will die.

733
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,383
Kill him.

734
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,467
Yes, General.

735
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,942
A prisoner-turned-interpreter?

736
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,527
Yes.

737
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,490
I have already told General Yonggoldae

738
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,117
all the details about how

739
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,244
I ended up here.

740
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,046
That is right.

741
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,590
It is not uncommon

742
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,218
for prisoners to become interpreters.

743
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,637
Of course.

744
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,723
However…

745
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,730
a false rumor spread in Joseon

746
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:44,776
about smallpox spreading
among the Qing soldiers.

747
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,951
Were you perhaps the one…

748
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:57,872
who spread

749
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:00,625
that rumor?

750
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,691
I hear you are looking
for an interpreter who went to Shenyang.

751
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,608
What is his name?

752
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,486
It is Lee Jang-hyeon.

753
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,656
A number of interpreters went with us.

754
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,451
Lee Jang-hyeon.

755
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,036
It seems like the name
of the interpreter who died

756
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,496
alongside Jung Noe-gyeong.

757
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:41,708
He died?

758
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,753
The office will have
the personal belongings of those who died.

759
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:49,132
If his were sent,
he is most certainly dead.

760
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:46,981
I plan…

761
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:52,111
on holding onto this ribbon until I die.

762
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:51,476
They say calling out
the name of the deceased three times

763
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:54,395
while holding the clothes they once wore…

764
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:58,983
could bring them back to life.

765
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,025
Young Master Jang-hyeon!

766
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,945
Come back!

767
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,823
If you come back…

768
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,410
I will no longer treat you harshly.

769
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,962
Young Master Jang-hyeon.

770
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,381
Please come back.

771
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:12,265
There is something I have not said.

772
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:15,768
So please…

773
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:20,147
Please come back, Young Master Jang-hyeon!

774
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:28,906
Young Master Jang-hyeon.

775
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,672
Young Master!

776
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:50,177
Young Master!

777
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:28,257
You can have my whole heart.

778
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,593
Do not leave. Stay with me.

779
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:35,139
You must live
to see better days in the future.

780
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:37,141
Gil-chae. Stop thinking
about someone who is dead.

781
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:39,602
Go around the market
and buy all the coins you can.

782
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:43,189
Look at this. Useless coins
have become precious brass bowls!

783
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:44,523
Did I not tell you?

784
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:48,527
You are way more reliable
than a bunch of feeble scholars.

785
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,488
Do not come anymore.

786
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:52,740
I plan to live a full life.

787
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:55,826
We shall meet later
in the very distant future.

788
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:12,093
