1
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,327
My lady.

2
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,131
My lord.

3
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,427
I have been released.

4
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,307
And I owe it…

5
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,102
all to you, my lord.

6
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,671
Have you come to?

7
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,844
My lord.

8
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,013
My lord!

9
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,767
My lord.

10
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,728
Lord Lee.

11
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:27,939
My lord!

12
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,025
My lord.

13
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,528
My lord.

14
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,497
-Shall we?
-Yes, let us.

15
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,137
-Here you go.
-That is not necessary.

16
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,097
It is all right. Go ahead and eat.

17
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,623
You filthy rat.

18
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,584
How dare you smile at just anyone?

19
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,505
Please!

20
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,602
Should I stay here and watch the fire?

21
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,062
Please spare me!

22
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,901
Until the day you die, you will be mine.

23
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:14,629
He will wake up soon.

24
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,426
I plan to run away.

25
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,888
Do you want to join me?

26
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,815
Where will we go?

27
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,907
Do not worry.

28
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,202
There is a strong man in Uiju
named Yang-cheon.

29
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:50,206
They say as long as you are under him, not
even the village governor can touch you.

30
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,002
Come on.

31
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,681
I did not expect to meet the woman
who saved my son in Shenyang.

32
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,476
You are our savior.

33
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,853
You protected the royal bloodline.

34
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,773
Tell me if there is anything you want.

35
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,318
You must want
to return to Joseon immediately.

36
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,903
Actually…

37
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,282
I would like to stay in Shenyang
for the time being.

38
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,310
Don't you dare touch that girl!

39
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,647
-What is this gibberish?
-I know you.

40
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,649
The last girl we bought for a hefty price,

41
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,859
you got her pregnant.

42
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,530
And killed her trying to get rid
of the baby. What a waste!

43
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,075
If you cause trouble again
with the new girl,

44
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,119
-I will throw your mother out!
-What are they saying?

45
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,411
Why do they argue all the time?

46
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,210
Pretty, is it not?

47
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,796
I am craftier than I seem.

48
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:07,301
Whenever I dressed up my lady,

49
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,096
the men of Neunggun-ri fell at her feet.

50
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,436
I will make sure
you look pretty every day too.

51
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,773
You sweet little thing.

52
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,905
You bitch!

53
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,032
Come here.

54
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,783
Stay still!

55
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,454
Get off me!

56
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,544
You little shit. How dare you?

57
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,922
Come on.

58
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,805
Those rats.

59
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,937
Mother, let go!

60
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,821
How did you get here?

61
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,031
How else?

62
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,533
I flew over here.

63
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,231
Ryang-eum seems
devastated to see you hurt.

64
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,653
I have never seen a man
cry like that before.

65
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,532
You are a lucky man.

66
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,119
The imperial princess
is head over heels for you,

67
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,706
and Ryang-eum has been
crying his eyes out over you getting hurt.

68
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,589
But do you know what?

69
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,758
Now that you are hurt…

70
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,681
I finally get my turn.

71
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,353
I am cruel, am I not?

72
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,522
To think that way when you are hurt.

73
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,837
I have always wanted…

74
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,052
to hold these hands too.

75
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,171
What is with the rain?

76
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,968
The tavern is not far from here.

77
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,434
Scoot closer. It is cold.

78
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,395
All right.

79
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,231
Come on.

80
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,447
See?

81
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,908
It is less cold this way.

82
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,202
Right.

83
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,208
Right? It is not cold at all.

84
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,834
Right.

85
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,838
Hey, by the way…

86
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,549
Why didn't you come that day?

87
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,679
How could I leave my lady behind?

88
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,806
Also--

89
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,817
I waited ages for you.

90
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,365
You see…

91
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,444
-Gu-jam is back!
-Gu-jam is back!

92
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,460
Jong-jong!

93
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,088
My lady.

94
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,766
Are you hurt?

95
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,142
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

96
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,442
I am sorry.

97
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,948
I promised to protect you
and I said nothing was going to happen,

98
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,408
but I failed to keep you safe.

99
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,036
I am so sorry, Jong-jong.

100
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,538
It's all right, my lady.

101
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,540
I knew

102
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,335
that we would meet again.

103
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,311
Thank you so much.

104
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,605
You are my savior.

105
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,566
Gosh, I did not do much.

106
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,623
Get up.

107
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:42,835
Get up already.

108
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,592
We got a message from Joseon,
and Lady Yoo's husband will soon--

109
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,428
What?

110
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,222
Honestly.

111
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,017
Look at you, Jang-hyeon,

112
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,935
pretending to be sick.

113
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,816
Do not say a word.

114
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,818
It is not like you to be clingy.

115
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,362
What do you mean, "clingy"?

116
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,741
Gu-jam, use your brain for once.

117
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,036
Once I am better,
Lady Yoo will return to Joseon.

118
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,620
Do you think she will go alone?

119
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,831
Jong-jong will go with her.

120
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,876
Oh, no!

121
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,680
His injuries must be severe.

122
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,225
At this rate, half a year…
Even that is a long shot.

123
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,686
He might be bedridden all his life.

124
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,313
That is preposterous.

125
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,899
Lord Lee will get back on his feet.

126
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,570
Jong-jong will want
to return to Joseon immediately,

127
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,531
but I cannot go anywhere…

128
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,368
until Lord Lee is better.

129
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,266
Do not slack off!

130
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,310
Faster!

131
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,313
Do not slack off.

132
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,109
Move!

133
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,652
Work faster.

134
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,489
Leave the goods here. Hurry up.

135
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,157
Faster!

136
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,619
Quickly!

137
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,124
-What are you doing? Run!
-Run!

138
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,500
-Come on.
-Hurry!

139
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,835
-Come quickly!
-Run!

140
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,711
-Come on!
-Yang-cheon.

141
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,879
Come on!

142
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,632
You are limping too.

143
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,634
It's my right foot.

144
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,760
Goodness.

145
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,953
Thank you.

146
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,997
Please tell Lord Lee too.

147
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,875
Do not get caught again.

148
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,627
Go on.

149
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,944
When

150
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,447
will we return to Joseon?

151
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,574
Why are you asking me that?

152
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,285
Who else can we ask?

153
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,999
Doesn't Lord Lee Jang-hyeon treat you

154
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,668
as his boss?

155
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,103
Goodness.

156
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,813
I feel so stiff.

157
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:50,999
Get up already.

158
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,091
Goodness, Yang-cheon.

159
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,096
Did you make sure Han-seok

160
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,598
left safely?

161
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,683
Yes.

162
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,229
Does it feel good to rest
while a cripple does all the work?

163
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,814
No, it's just…

164
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,692
that people are

165
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,778
fonder of you than they are of me.

166
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,323
They will follow Gu Yang-cheon of Uiju,
no questions asked.

167
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,243
You said we would make a fortune.

168
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,746
But we spend all our money
on freeing captives. Good going.

169
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,541
And in return, we get cursed at.

170
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,127
What?

171
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:37,671
Cursed at?

172
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,342
Someone spoke ill of me? Why?

173
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,344
They all want to know
when it is their turn.

174
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:50,392
This is why I warned you not
to get involved in helping the prisoners.

175
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,937
Is that their complaint?

176
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,567
Then, tell them
to get back to Joseon by themselves.

177
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,779
Do they not get that we are
escorting them since it is so dangerous?

178
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,282
I mean… Unbelievable.

179
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,367
Whatever.

180
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,370
Whatever!

181
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,625
Promissory notes will be used
to obtain the release

182
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,878
of those whose owners will ransom them.

183
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:22,466
Those who have no hope
will be secretly sent back to Joseon.

184
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,137
But there is an order to follow,
and that is what we are trying to do.

185
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,975
Anyway, the next in line
to return to Joseon are

186
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,020
Neop-seok, Sam-saeng,

187
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,231
-Du-nam…
-Du-nam.

188
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,692
-…and Heo-chang.
-Heo-chang.

189
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,951
I believe I heard someone speaking.

190
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,623
Jang-hyeon, you have to wake up.

191
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:00,337
Seeing you suffer like this
is breaking my heart.

192
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,174
He will wake up.

193
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,428
He will, right? He must.

194
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,349
Well, then…

195
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,958
Why is there so much cold sweat?

196
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,005
His tonic…

197
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,689
Lee Jang-hyeon is gravely injured,

198
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,568
so I will take over your affairs for now.

199
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:51,573
As he has been doing,
if your owner is willing to ransom you,

200
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,909
sign a promissory note,
and I will lend you the money.

201
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,703
When must we repay it by?

202
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,206
Can we do so once we get back
to farming in Joseon?

203
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,043
-Sure.
-Then, can it take three…

204
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,711
No, even five years?

205
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,671
Ten years is too long, right?

206
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,506
Of course, it is. Come on.

207
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,466
It is fine.

208
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,260
Just promise to repay the money
and we will lend it to you.

209
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,471
Really? You won't go back on your word?

210
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,723
Stop asking. He has already agreed.

211
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,808
What has gotten into you?

212
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,435
While Jang-hyeon
is out of commission, we--

213
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:21,561
Listen carefully.

214
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,939
Even if you are allowed
to return to Joseon,

215
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,233
you know the path back
won't be easy, right?

216
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,400
-Of course.
-We know.

217
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,027
Some die while crossing the river,

218
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,696
some are forced back
after losing their release papers,

219
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,615
and some are killed by bandits.

220
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,745
That is why it is safest
to return to Joseon with the envoys

221
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,249
and work the fields
for the crown prince in the meantime.

222
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,542
Keep that in mind

223
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,254
and work hard as you are ordered. Got it?

224
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,464
-Of course.
-Absolutely.

225
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:52,217
I can hear our money dwindling.

226
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,760
Now, get in line.

227
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,765
Thank you so much.

228
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,521
Write down your name, address,

229
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,023
and when you will repay us.

230
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,986
What is the point in promissory notes
when no one will repay us?

231
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,404
My owner

232
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,657
will never agree to pay for my release.

233
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,035
If I go back…

234
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,790
they will take my Byeong-hui away.

235
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,126
Same here.

236
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,963
They will sell off
me and my brother separately.

237
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,633
I have run away too many times,
so if I get caught,

238
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,969
they will kill me.

239
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:39,556
I cannot get release papers
since my owner cannot be found.

240
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:44,144
If I return to Joseon,
I will be treated as an escaped slave

241
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,104
and will be dragged back here.

242
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,610
Those whose owners
will not pay for their return

243
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,322
or have been abandoned or lost

244
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,741
and cannot be granted
official release documents…

245
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,954
will have to enter Joseon discreetly
when the time is right.

246
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:09,127
However, that will be difficult
for women and the elderly.

247
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,755
And to travel with a child…

248
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,173
I can make it.

249
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:16,968
Just send me home. If you do,
I will do any chores--

250
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,095
Who told you to do chores?

251
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,306
Just take care of your child.

252
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,353
What was that?

253
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:35,320
What do you wish to achieve
by assisting our master?

254
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,823
I want to erase all traces
of the barbarians in Joseon.

255
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,950
To restore the nation

256
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,120
to how it was before the barbarians
invaded our land…

257
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,625
I am willing to give up my life.

258
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,342
After years of bad harvests,

259
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,302
the recent drought
that has hit all eight provinces

260
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:03,723
has left our wheat and barley shriveled
and turned our fields brown.

261
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,768
This is a calamity
we have not faced before.

262
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:11,898
It has long been customary to grant
pardons when a strange phenomenon occurs.

263
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,652
Your Majesty, I urge you
to benevolently grant leniency

264
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,821
and placate the heavens.

265
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:21,199
Barbarians have been violating Joseon
and threatening His Majesty

266
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,243
with swords and spears.

267
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,497
How do you expect to change the world
with powerless words?

268
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:40,885
It has long been customary to grant
pardons when a strange phenomenon occurs,

269
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:44,681
not because of a belief
that there are no heinous criminals,

270
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,727
but to neutralize the people's grievances
before they reach the heavens.

271
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,606
However, governors and soldiers
carry out executions as a means to vent,

272
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,276
so how could the people live in peace?

273
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,614
Husband!

274
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,121
I am all right.

275
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,392
What is this about?

276
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:33,646
Today is the anniversary
of the death of our master's father.

277
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,359
Every year, on this day,
he falls into a deep depression.

278
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,612
YUHWON JANG SEO-IN
ANCESTRAL TABLET

279
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,407
But to make it worse,

280
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,913
his one and only son
died on the same date.

281
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,040
So, it could be

282
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,461
that he is mourning his son's death.

283
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,759
He had a son?

284
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,681
So, I am to send 1,093 yards of
assorted silk to Park of the Gallim clan,

285
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,476
and 200 sheets of white paper
to Park of the Noshi clan?

286
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,727
Yes.

287
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,479
Make sure to sweet-talk them.

288
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:18,024
That way, we will be in a stronger
position when sharing the ginseng profits.

289
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,860
-As if I have the gift of the gab.
-Are you being cheeky?

290
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:24,239
Then take Ryang-eum with you.

291
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,749
What are you doing?

292
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,918
Pardon? Oh, well…

293
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,504
My back was itching.

294
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,508
How dare you act inappropriately while
Lord Lee lies injured? Leave this instant.

295
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:45,593
Yes, my lady.

296
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,203
I see you have an adorable mole here.

297
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,432
They are farming here in Shenyang.

298
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:36,561
I hope to lend a hand
if the opportunity arises.

299
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,355
I should earn my keep.

300
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:53,453
Add more firewood.

301
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,955
It must be hotter in order to melt iron.

302
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,040
Yes, my lady.

303
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,548
I volunteered to repair our farming tools,

304
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,343
and the crown princess made me a kiln.

305
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,347
I even made pocket knives back in Joseon.

306
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,141
Patching up broken farming tools
should be a piece of cake.

307
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,773
Why is she not coming?

308
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,945
What is going on?

309
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,532
Seriously.

310
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,454
Gil-chae.

311
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,499
Where on earth are you?

312
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,043
Why…

313
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,629
Why is she not coming?

314
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,274
I told you to cool it
once it was fully heated.

315
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:50,695
How many times have I told you that
patience is key when working with iron?

316
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,655
Look at that.

317
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,074
What a temper she has.

318
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,412
You are the most impatient person here.

319
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,474
Please come this way.

320
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,483
-Let us see.
-My goodness.

321
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,359
-My gosh.
-Look at these.

322
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,695
-Here you go.
-Come on.

323
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:47,919
You are doing great.

324
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,933
Stop that.

325
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,686
Why should you farm…

326
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,150
Stop it. You will hurt your hands.

327
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,738
Goodness me.

328
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,620
By the way, what is your name?

329
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,413
Me? It is Eol-su.

330
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:28,584
I am Jeol-su.

331
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,795
-Eol-su.
-Jeol-su.

332
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,338
-Eol-su.
-Jeol-su.

333
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,094
-Eol-su.
-Jeol-su!

334
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,473
Come and have some snacks!

335
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,452
Please enjoy.

336
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,622
-Enjoy--
-Thank you.

337
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:10,168
-Jong-jong likes me.
-Wait. Take another one.

338
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,669
She likes me not.

339
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,505
She likes me. She likes me not.

340
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,756
Go away.

341
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,758
She likes me.

342
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,011
-Thank you.
-She likes me not.

343
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,096
She likes me.

344
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,806
She…

345
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,564
She likes me not.

346
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,691
She likes me!

347
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,776
Oh, please.

348
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,114
What an eyesore.

349
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,385
By the way, leave out the beans next time.

350
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,513
Why? Gu-jam loves beans.

351
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,598
Exactly!

352
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,225
Do not add them.

353
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,731
-What the…
-What was that?

354
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,043
I missed seeing…

355
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,882
you smile like that.

356
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,182
Your Royal Highness.

357
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,980
Your Royal Highness, the fields…

358
00:37:56,232 --> 00:38:00,903
Rivers and mountains

359
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:05,449
-Rivers and mountains
-Rivers and mountains

360
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:15,418
-Rivers and mountains
-Rivers and mountains

361
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:16,961
How?

362
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,005
In this barren land?

363
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,298
Did you not know?

364
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:25,720
No one in this world
can farm better than the people of Joseon.

365
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,317
This reminds me of my time in Joseon.

366
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:44,238
During the weeding season,
the village farmers

367
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,907
sang like that.

368
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,910
I had

369
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,957
no idea what my people sang
when they worked

370
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,919
and only spent my time
reading books indoors.

371
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,723
Look.

372
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,600
Do they not look appetizing?

373
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,912
The crops are ripening.

374
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,708
So, why are you still not waking up?

375
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,546
You are scaring me.

376
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,967
What if you never wake up?

377
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,938
I should have died instead.

378
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,817
If something happens to you…

379
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,821
I will have no right to live.

380
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,332
I will die alongside you.

381
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,877
In fact,

382
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,589
if I could die to spare your life,

383
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,634
I would do so in a heartbeat.

384
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,099
My lord.

385
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,977
My lord?

386
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,897
Please hold tight.
I will summon the physician.

387
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,153
Stay with me.

388
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,082
I know my body better than anyone.

389
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,837
Since I can talk and eat,
you might think I am well.

390
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,469
However, my leg…

391
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:13,971
My leg aches.

392
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:16,974
My leg

393
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,894
is killing me.

394
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,774
I know him better than anyone,
and that means the pain is unbearable.

395
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,819
Does it hurt?

396
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,405
Oh, dear.

397
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,656
Right here…

398
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,908
But

399
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,951
the arrow pierced your back.

400
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,620
So, why is your leg hurting?

401
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,545
Our body and limbs…

402
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,589
Well…

403
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,175
They are all linked.

404
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,594
Right?

405
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,679
Right! Of course.

406
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,474
The body and limbs are linked and whatnot.

407
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,059
Right?

408
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,103
Yes, of course.

409
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,522
In my case…

410
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,403
I limp even though I was hit on the head.

411
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,988
See? I limp.

412
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,198
Goodness.

413
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,374
Please grab him before he dies!

414
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,167
-Careful.
-Please be careful.

415
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,047
It hurts too much.

416
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,134
You should practice with baby steps first.

417
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:41,767
One, two, one, two.

418
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,019
-Are you all right?
-The pain is unbearable.

419
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:45,980
One…

420
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,691
There you go.

421
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:50,526
One…

422
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,361
Lee Jang-hyeon has been ruined.

423
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,155
What did I tell you?

424
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,131
I cannot believe you, Lord Lee.

425
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,593
I thought you were
doing state duties in Shenyang,

426
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,386
but you seduced an imperial princess.

427
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,514
What do you mean, "seduce"?

428
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,308
She fell for me of her own accord.

429
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,145
Are you jealous?

430
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,440
Jealous?

431
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,651
Why would I…

432
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,653
Why would I

433
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,449
be jealous of an ugly woman
with pale skin?

434
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,118
Not to mention, Ryang-eum…

435
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:48,709
Anyway, I still cannot tell
what goes on in that head of yours.

436
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,503
Are you even of noble birth?

437
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,755
Rumor has it…

438
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,012
Wait.

439
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,891
Is it true that you bought papers
to obtain a noble status?

440
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:07,102
Were you originally a commoner?

441
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,361
I was a government slave.

442
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,783
I emptied the village
governor's chamber pot

443
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,078
and kept the fire burning all night.

444
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,788
I was that kind of slave.

445
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:36,048
My mother died when I was young,
and my father…

446
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,719
I do not even remember him.

447
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,598
Still,

448
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,017
the state received rice as payment

449
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,937
and stamped the document
granting me a noble status,

450
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,772
so I am strictly an aristocrat.

451
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,069
Money sure is nice.

452
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,571
That is why

453
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,450
I work hard to earn more money.

454
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,663
Anyway…

455
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,042
Have you lost interest in me

456
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,878
now that you know I was low-born?

457
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:26,932
Actually…

458
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:32,563
It might have been better
if you had never become a noble.

459
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,857
Why is that?

460
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:39,611
I could have kept you
by my side as my servant…

461
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,283
and treated you as I pleased.

462
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,996
That would have been nice.

463
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:56,128
If I tear up the document
and return to being a commoner,

464
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,630
will you purchase me?

465
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,384
Go ahead if you like.

466
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,315
Why did you not show up that day?

467
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:23,822
Why…

468
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:27,993
did you abandon me?

469
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:50,349
I did not abandon you.

470
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,895
I could not…

471
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,442
dare to hold onto you.

472
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,573
You would live on fine without me, but…

473
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,243
Why would you think that?

474
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:16,667
Why…

475
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:24,841
did you think that I could live…

476
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,596
without you?

477
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,961
Who are you,
and why were you trying to kill me?

478
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,799
You…

479
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:50,052
I remember you.

480
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,806
You once captured escaped prisoners
with Lee Jang-hyeon.

481
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,016
Right?

482
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:03,899
I hurt your master,
so I guess you wanted retribution.

483
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,239
Relay this message to Lee Jang-hyeon.

484
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,367
I will soon

485
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,243
summon him.

486
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,299
You are here.

487
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,851
You did not have to fool me too
about being unwell.

488
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:42,979
Lady Yoo…

489
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,066
She should be sent back to Joseon.

490
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,277
What if the imperial princess
tries to hurt you again?

491
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,739
That will not happen.

492
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,408
As if.

493
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,160
She tried to kill you.

494
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,250
I would like to rest.

495
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,751
You may leave.

496
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,219
Your leg.

497
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,347
Does it really hurt?

498
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,895
Only because every part
of the human body is connected.

499
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:25,814
I am fine.

500
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,818
You almost died on Ganghwa Island
while trying to save her.

501
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,572
This time, you hurt your leg
while trying to return her home.

502
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,490
What next?

503
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,160
What else will you sacrifice
for that woman?

504
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,203
"That woman"?

505
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:44,833
Watch your tone.

506
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,501
You should just die now.

507
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,296
I cannot

508
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,425
see you ruin yourself piece by piece.

509
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,594
So just die now and be done with it.

510
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,019
You…

511
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,692
You are driving me insane.

512
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,594
Was it really taken care of?

513
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:40,514
Yes, that is what I said.

514
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:44,768
Ningqujin will pay Big Brother
without complaints.

515
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:48,146
Just wait and see.

516
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,776
I will set up a decent inn
for you to sing at.

517
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,488
Use the money you earn to get married.

518
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,116
What good is getting married?

519
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,911
I would not mind

520
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,039
spending my life listening to you sing.

521
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,849
You sure are handsome.

522
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,729
-You are back.
-Hey.

523
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,067
Where is the ledger
to send to the Japanese office?

524
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,151
Is this it?

525
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,744
I am no longer his slave.

526
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,205
What?

527
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,173
I am now…

528
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,309
-My lady, it is a secret.
-I will think about it.

529
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,519
Geez.

530
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,453
You have been released,

531
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,164
so you should return to Joseon.

532
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,251
Lord Lee's leg is still bothering him.

533
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,336
Until he recovers--

534
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,713
I will be the one

535
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,173
to nurse him.

536
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,435
Back then,

537
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,563
why did you tell me
Interpreter Lee had died?

538
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,611
I do not know why you lied to me,

539
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,281
but he will want me and not you

540
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,867
to nurse him back to health.

541
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,006
This is…

542
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,177
You probably saw the scars…

543
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,263
on Lord Lee's back.

544
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,476
Do you know how he received them?

545
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,691
The harvest season was kind to us.

546
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:06,321
Rather than letting leftover rice
rot in storage in this hall…

547
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,160
Do you wish to trade it?

548
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,795
To do business in Shenyang,

549
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:26,132
one must bribe Jung Myeong-su,
Yonggoldae, and even the princes.

550
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:28,802
However,

551
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,347
we cannot request that bribe from Joseon.

552
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,016
That is why I would like
to trade the rice we harvested.

553
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:40,522
I will help you to make a profit.

554
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:46,277
Then, could you also manage
any profits we make?

555
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,323
I cannot do that.

556
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,286
Riches that are not managed
by those who own them

557
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,496
can become poison.

558
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,457
If any profit is made,

559
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,128
you should decide who it is spent on,

560
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,047
what it will be traded for,
and where you will keep it.

561
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:10,301
I will aid you in any way I can.

562
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,346
However,

563
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,640
I have not accumulated wealth
in this way before.

564
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,517
You will learn.

565
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:22,981
Was that not the case with farming?

566
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,280
Today,

567
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,366
I will write in my diary
for the first time in a while.

568
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:37,454
I will draw in detail
the rice and side dishes

569
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:42,000
that you have bestowed on us
for our descendants to see.

570
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,837
You will write in a diary with drawings?

571
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,305
Then…

572
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,476
Then the man who rescued me in the woods…

573
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:01,853
Was it truly…

574
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,401
Yes.

575
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:12,780
He fought the barbarians
while suffering from smallpox,

576
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,491
and it almost cost him his life.

577
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,992
Now, here in Shenyang,

578
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,954
he is limping as a result of rescuing you.

579
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,626
That makes it clear to me.

580
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,426
To Jang-hyeon…

581
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,805
you are…

582
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,728
a curse.

583
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,891
I have nothing to give
to a rock that is fleeing.

584
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,896
How did he suffer those injuries?

585
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,356
Better yet,

586
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:31,609
tell me why you could not
prevent his injuries.

587
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:32,694
Lady Gil-chae,

588
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,280
how am I to blame

589
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:37,198
for his injuries?

590
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:42,829
Forget it.

591
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,122
Where are you going?

592
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,418
Do you not know you are the reason
I carried them all across?

593
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,147
Are you all right?

594
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:32,420
My lady,

595
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:35,256
I am only telling you this now…

596
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,052
but the one who saved you that day…

597
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,142
was me, not him.

598
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,900
I will bring you
the most beautiful pair of floral shoes.

599
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,162
No!

600
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,914
No. Gil-chae!

601
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,248
Are you saying

602
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:34,959
that you ate food
served by the crown princess?

603
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:38,379
What side dishes did you have?

604
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:41,549
Do they sprinkle gold flakes
on the dishes and…

605
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,620
You did not die.

606
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,999
You spared my life.

607
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:17,335
That is right.

608
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:18,795
You would be a waste to kill.

609
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,172
If you die,

610
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,759
I will lose a toy.

611
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,931
Thank you for freeing Lady Yoo.

612
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,976
I only agreed not to kill her,

613
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:37,021
not to let her stay by your side.

614
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,482
That girl

615
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,818
must now return to Joseon.

616
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,908
I am a woman of my word.

617
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,870
I would never

618
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,580
harm the girl myself.

619
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:59,502
However, bad luck can
befall Joseon prisoners

620
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:01,712
who reside in Shenyang.

621
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,299
Even if they are freed,

622
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,552
if someone else comes
and claims ownership,

623
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,846
they become slaves again.

624
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:13,683
If they lose their release papers
and are mistaken for escaped captives,

625
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,268
their ankles might be sliced open.

626
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:20,273
If they are caught with forged documents,
their ears might be threaded.

627
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,817
The unluckiest ones
even lose their heads--

628
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,031
Halt. We are sparring.

629
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:35,079
If you lay a finger on her…

630
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:40,501
I will kill you.

631
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:45,715
I understand…

632
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:49,427
how you feel.

633
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:54,599
I also felt miserable at the thought…

634
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,644
of you dying.

635
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,357
Do you want her to live?

636
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:08,237
Then,

637
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,157
send her to Joseon.

638
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,472
You wish to go with us
when we go to Joseon?

639
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,183
Your husband abandoned you

640
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,727
even though he knew you were in Shenyang.

641
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,146
But if you will not come to me,

642
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:28,776
I will take you and all the Joseon
captives under your wing and bury you all.

643
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:30,903
I will not leave.

644
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,031
If I am a curse to Interpreter Lee,

645
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:36,325
the only one who can
break that curse is also me.

646
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,411
Can you not stay here with me?

647
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,204
If you do not like it here,

648
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,832
we can go anywhere you want.

649
01:06:56,846 --> 01:07:01,851
