1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,294
Thank you for freeing Lady Yoo.

2
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,632
I only agreed not to kill her,

3
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,635
not to let her stay by your side.

4
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,096
That girl

5
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,432
must now return to Joseon.

6
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,606
I am a woman of my word.

7
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,026
I would never

8
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,195
harm the girl myself.

9
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:15,116
However, bad luck can
befall Joseon prisoners

10
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,327
who reside in Shenyang.

11
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,872
Even if they are freed,

12
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,208
if someone else comes
and claims ownership,

13
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,460
they become slaves again.

14
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,339
If they lose their release papers
and are mistaken for escaped captives,

15
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,882
their ankles might be sliced open.

16
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,636
If they are caught with forged documents,

17
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,054
their ears might be threaded.

18
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,431
The unluckiest ones
even lose their heads--

19
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,062
Halt. We are sparring.

20
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,777
If you lay a finger on her…

21
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,116
I will kill you.

22
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,496
I understand…

23
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,583
how you feel.

24
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,171
I also felt miserable at the thought…

25
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,342
of you dying.

26
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,930
Do you want her to live?

27
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,810
Then,

28
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,729
send her to Joseon.

29
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,555
I AM WRITING TO INFORM YOU
RETURNING TO JOSEON WILL BE HARD

30
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,235
Good. You are here.

31
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,572
I am writing a letter to send to Joseon.

32
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,867
Have you

33
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,703
decided to return to Joseon?

34
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,204
No.

35
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,293
I must repay my debts to my savior,

36
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,338
so I am sending word
that I cannot return for a while.

37
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,269
I will not leave.

38
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,940
If I am a curse to Interpreter Lee,

39
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,901
the only one who can
break that curse is also me.

40
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,946
If Lord Lee needs me,

41
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,614
I will stay as long as he needs

42
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,450
and help my lord recover.

43
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,252
Congratulations

44
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,379
on your victory.

45
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,507
We may have won,

46
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,635
but we lost countless men.

47
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,222
We have not even taken Shanhai Pass.

48
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,473
SHANHAI PASS:

49
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,017
A TRANSPORTATION POINT AT
THE EAST END OF THE GREAT WALL

50
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,102
Your Majesty.

51
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,979
Please enjoy your victory.

52
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,741
Now is an important moment.

53
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,705
We must prove that the Qing
have been given Heaven's Mandate.

54
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,126
To do that, we must not
lose the people's support.

55
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,337
Gakhwa.

56
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,466
I have long entrusted you
with overseeing the palace women.

57
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,594
I prohibited the abuse

58
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,055
of Joseon slave women.

59
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,683
Tell me.

60
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,686
How have the palace women
been behaving lately?

61
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,731
How could they disobey
Your Majesty's order?

62
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,317
I am keeping them under control.

63
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,448
I know I can trust you.

64
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,203
Then, Your Majesty,

65
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,165
please put me in charge
of the Joseon prisoners.

66
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,421
Gakhwa.

67
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,674
You have saved my life.

68
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,303
I could give you the whole world.

69
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,931
I am aware

70
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:54,145
that you have been disguising yourself
and hunting Joseon captives.

71
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,690
However,

72
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,776
you must not overstep.

73
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,404
If you mistreat the captives,

74
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,114
we will lose the public's favor.

75
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,533
So…

76
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,994
Your Majesty!

77
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,747
Call the royal physician. Hurry!

78
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,666
Where is the royal physician?

79
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,754
The recent reports
from Shenyang appear serious.

80
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,007
It seems the Khan is gravely ill.

81
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,009
He is gravely ill?

82
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,431
Surely, he would not change his mind
because of illness, would he?

83
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,810
Surely,

84
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,273
he would not blame me for the Ming ship
that appeared on Joseon's shores, right?

85
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:45,279
Has Choi Myeong-gil sent any word
after being taken to Shenyang?

86
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,451
Why, that…

87
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,831
Choi Myeong-gil said he would take
responsibility for everything.

88
00:06:54,914 --> 00:07:00,336
How could he still be alive and sit by,
watching me be interrogated?

89
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,964
SIM GI-WON

90
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,636
Both Kim Sang-heon
and Myeong-gil were taken by the Qing.

91
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:12,306
The nobility will once again say
that the royal court has no one of worth.

92
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,979
Seek the counsel
of Kim Jib and Jang Cheol.

93
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,107
Fill the royal court with their students.

94
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,830
Now that Choi Myeong-gil is gone,

95
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,833
Kim Ja-jeom is standing triumphantly,

96
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,626
counting on his Qing connections.

97
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,462
KIM RYU

98
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,508
Anyhow, His Majesty is
truly a frightening person.

99
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,429
He used to rely
on Choi Myeong-gil and defend him,

100
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:55,057
but now His Majesty wishes for him
to take all responsibility and die.

101
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,770
On whom can we mere subjects rely?

102
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:06,152
I will leave the royal court
before I also get burned.

103
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,172
Master.

104
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,260
His Majesty has requested your counsel,

105
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,180
ordering that whatever advice
is given by you or Kim Jib

106
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,642
must be highly regarded and respected.

107
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,060
His Majesty said that?

108
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,514
His Majesty

109
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,308
requests my advice,

110
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,853
but what can someone
lacking like me offer?

111
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,526
However, you all should go
to the royal court

112
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,737
and assist His Majesty.

113
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:35,908
But

114
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,452
if you refuse, how could we…

115
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,037
He is right.

116
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,498
Choi Myeong-gil and other high officials

117
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,042
were taken to Qing
for secret talks with Ming.

118
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,212
The king has handed over
loyal servants to the barbarians again.

119
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,131
We cannot serve such a court.

120
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,384
A wealthy household notorious
for their mistreatment of servants

121
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,761
sought out new servants.

122
00:09:55,845 --> 00:10:00,391
Everyone declined, saying they could not
work under such an evil lord,

123
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,059
but one man stepped up.

124
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:05,396
He whipped the servants
in his master's stead

125
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,898
but reduced the severity of the whippings.

126
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:13,863
The servants started
cursing this man instead of their lord.

127
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,866
Who do you think truly helped the people?

128
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,036
Was it those who declined the position,

129
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,289
or the man who held the whip
despite knowing

130
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,082
that he would be hated?

131
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,421
Which do you think

132
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,175
is the true path of a scholar?

133
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,720
High officials are

134
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,806
the king's hands and feet,

135
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,018
and advisors are his eyes and ears.

136
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:48,814
Right now, His Majesty's hands
and feet have been cut off,

137
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,067
and he is blocked in.

138
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,570
What should be done about it?

139
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,241
Go.

140
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,786
Go

141
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,999
and become His Majesty's eyes and ears.

142
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,239
Your Majesty.

143
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,460
Your Majesty.

144
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,278
So the rumors are true after all.

145
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,156
Even though we are alone like this,

146
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,199
you do not blush or stutter.

147
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,995
I guess it was true you are
a misogamist or whatever

148
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,913
because you cannot perform as a man…

149
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,630
What?

150
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,424
Is it not true?

151
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,472
In the past…

152
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,184
I was foolish, was I not?

153
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,187
You were…

154
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,065
also beautiful.

155
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,819
It seems…

156
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,408
the rumors I heard before in Neunggun-ri

157
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,203
were true.

158
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,082
You are alone with Lee Jang-hyeon,
yet you do not blush or appear nervous.

159
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,546
The rumors said you were
a white fox with nine tails.

160
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,966
It must be true.

161
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,040
Can you not stay here with me now?

162
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,754
If you do not like it here…

163
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,175
we can go…

164
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,054
anywhere you want.

165
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,103
Your husband abandoned you…

166
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,483
even though he knew you were in Shenyang.

167
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,700
So you do not…

168
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,706
need to be loyal to him any longer.

169
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,008
So now…

170
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,606
I must first…

171
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,028
ask Officer Gu about his reasons.

172
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,827
Of course.

173
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,625
You have a husband.

174
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,004
You have a husband, a father

175
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,132
and younger siblings.

176
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,054
Yes.

177
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:16,016
I have a father,
a husband and younger siblings.

178
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,605
But I have a savior too.

179
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,734
For you,

180
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,363
I can sacrifice my life.

181
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,908
-However…
-"However"?

182
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,420
You cannot love me?

183
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,143
I have never wanted you to die for me.

184
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,065
What I want…

185
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,882
My lord.

186
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,343
I…

187
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,774
Interpreter Lee.

188
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,275
Interpreter Lee!

189
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,846
What is the fuss?

190
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,140
What is going on?

191
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,517
The Khan is dead.

192
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,401
The Khan is dead?

193
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,153
Then,

194
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,073
who will succeed his throne?

195
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,215
DORGON
(HONG TAIJI'S HALF-BROTHER)

196
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,235
The Khan's six-year-old son
has ascended the throne.

197
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,739
The ninth prince, Dorgon,
has become regent.

198
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,324
REGENT: ONE WHO RULES
IN PLACE OF A CHILD MONARCH

199
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,408
Are you saying

200
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,245
that Dorgon has become
the ruler of the world?

201
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,415
Yes.

202
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,043
The world

203
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,295
is now Dorgon's.

204
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,006
However,

205
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,344
Dorgon does not have the power
to seize the throne for himself,

206
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,596
so he must act as a mere regent

207
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,849
with a young child as the figurehead.

208
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,687
Dorgon has not seized control
of all of Qing yet.

209
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,690
Just as the former king, upon ascension,

210
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,526
buried Dorgon's mother alive,

211
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,528
Dorgon will also

212
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,199
do whatever it takes

213
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,826
to strengthen his power.

214
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,665
What does…

215
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,168
this mean for Joseon?

216
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,679
What do you think
Dorgon will do with Joseon?

217
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,559
When the Qing invaded,
there were some who wanted

218
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:13,230
to kill me and put one of their people
on the Joseon throne.

219
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,857
If those people take power,

220
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,567
what should I do?

221
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,945
When the Qing invaded,

222
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,738
some proposed dividing Joseon

223
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,533
and delegating the pieces
to the Qing princes.

224
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,537
If those people stick to Dorgon
and gain power…

225
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,499
what will happen to Joseon?

226
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,047
We will soon know

227
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,509
who Dorgon chooses to keep by his side.

228
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,970
In the next few months,

229
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,806
whoever Dorgon reaches out to

230
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,184
will be those he plans
to work with in the future.

231
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,395
So,

232
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,773
we must act as well.

233
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,693
I will meet

234
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,695
with General Yonggoldae

235
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,906
and keep an eye on Dorgon's movements.

236
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,435
It is a gift from the crown prince.

237
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,187
The crown prince

238
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:39,316
made this Buddha statue just for you.

239
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,778
He made this

240
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,030
for me?

241
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,156
In Joseon,

242
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,950
when civil servants go out to work,
their wives pay to have

243
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,536
buddha statues made
to pray for there to be no trouble.

244
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,332
You are currently anxious,

245
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,542
are you not?

246
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,173
What would the likes of you know?

247
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,361
I know you are nervous.

248
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,447
Now, the ninth prince

249
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,284
has become regent.

250
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,120
NINTH PRINCE: DORGON

251
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,788
That means

252
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,166
you may be purged.

253
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,215
But that must not happen.

254
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,344
Who is it that enabled the Qing

255
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,887
to acquire Joseon?

256
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,640
It was thanks to you

257
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,268
and the regent

258
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,895
that the Qing acquired Joseon.

259
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,108
The person who knows that best

260
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,193
is our crown prince.

261
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,571
Our crown prince

262
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,782
trusts you and supports you.

263
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,743
When the Qing invaded, some princes sought

264
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,956
to divide Joseon amongst themselves.

265
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,083
Some wanted

266
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,544
to kill the king of Joseon

267
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,880
and govern Joseon themselves,

268
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,507
but only the regent

269
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,719
and you requested

270
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,639
that our court be preserved, did you not?

271
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,311
-That is…
-Do you

272
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,021
remember now?

273
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,607
So, in the future,

274
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,527
if the crown prince
becomes the king of Joseon,

275
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,281
the rights to any profit made
from Joseon's products

276
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,742
will be given to you

277
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,286
and the regent.

278
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,122
Joseon

279
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,917
will walk together

280
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,711
with you and the regent,

281
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,130
and the regent

282
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,217
will walk with you.

283
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,803
We will all…

284
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,390
walk together.

285
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,151
What?

286
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,402
Dorgon has

287
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,948
permitted the crown prince
to visit Joseon?

288
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,375
Congratulations.

289
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,043
Does this mean

290
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,380
I can go to Joseon this time as well?

291
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,091
I can

292
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,218
see my mother?

293
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,846
It is all thanks to you.

294
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,683
It is nothing.

295
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,476
No.

296
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,980
When my father passed,

297
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,358
he would not let me go
even when I offered all possible bribes.

298
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,779
But this time, you changed Dorgon's mind

299
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,407
so that I may go and see my mother.

300
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,579
Now, we have

301
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,416
the answer.

302
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,130
We know who Dorgon wants to work with.

303
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,771
Greetings, General.

304
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,734
The crown princess wishes
to send white paper

305
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,610
as a show of thanks

306
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,115
for allowing her visit to Joseon.

307
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,199
You bastard,

308
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,618
why did you anger the princess?

309
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,415
The regent wants her
to be one of his people.

310
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,959
Her Highness controls
the women in the palace.

311
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,003
However,

312
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,172
when Dorgon asked for her aid,

313
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,631
she asked for two things.

314
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,425
Her first request

315
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:18,219
was not to marry a Mongol man.

316
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,265
The second was for the right
to catch Joseon's runaway captives.

317
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,727
Her Highness knows

318
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,980
that you have been selling them
and giving me the money.

319
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,650
If the regent accepts her conditions,
she will investigate you first.

320
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,611
Then, I will get caught.

321
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,779
What will you do about it?

322
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:40,742
Who put

323
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,744
Her Highness up to this?

324
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,705
Is she targeting me?

325
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,000
Or does she want a share of my money?

326
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,002
Why are you doing this?

327
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,176
What is it…

328
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,680
that you want?

329
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,140
You.

330
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,686
What I want is you.

331
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,983
But if you will not come to me,

332
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,110
I will take you

333
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,654
and all the Joseon captives
under your wing…

334
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,825
and bury you all.

335
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,212
If you wish to possess that woman

336
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,548
at the expense of burying
all the captives,

337
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,718
that is fine by me.

338
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,324
Yong-i. 30 yang.

339
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:48,286
Once I return to Joseon and harvest rice,
I promise to repay this debt.

340
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,748
Chang-sam. 50 yang.

341
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,501
I will repay this kindness,
even if it kills me.

342
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,795
Dul-ne. 50 yang.

343
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,630
My sons are waiting for me.

344
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,470
Sam-seok. 70 yang.

345
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,888
If you send me to Joseon,

346
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,973
I will serve you as my master forever.

347
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,071
So,

348
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,281
do as she says.

349
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,574
General.

350
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,834
Do you think the regent
will just let this happen?

351
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,961
Do you not get it?

352
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:42,048
Soon, we will conquer Shanhai Pass.
Ming is falling.

353
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,301
We will advance into Beijing
and seize the center.

354
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:50,265
So, the regent will hand the captives
to Her Highness without a care.

355
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:53,977
He does not care

356
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,272
whether Her Highness kills
the captives or not.

357
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,108
The Joseon captives will

358
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,318
be forgotten.

359
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,455
You asked to see me?

360
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,546
Have you finished your urgent business?

361
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,887
My lord.

362
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,682
What happened before…

363
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,396
I mean…

364
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,482
Dorgon…

365
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,365
has permitted
the crown prince to visit Joseon.

366
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,494
You should return with him
and his entourage.

367
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:00,376
Going back with the crown prince
is the safest way.

368
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,759
But you have still not recovered.

369
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,386
Do not worry about my health anymore.

370
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,640
I do not need you to nurse me.

371
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:16,684
But…

372
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,155
Have you forgotten what you said?

373
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,831
We are…

374
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,920
nothing to each other.

375
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,053
So, do not…

376
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,933
feel indebted to me.

377
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,437
I have…

378
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,361
tried clinging onto you.

379
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,948
And I have…

380
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,995
risked my life for you.

381
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,000
I have done everything.

382
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,211
So now,

383
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,214
there is nothing…

384
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,766
left in my heart.

385
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,810
So, please return.

386
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,395
My lord.

387
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:54,240
This is because the Khan's death
has made things complicated, right?

388
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,325
-So…
-And also…

389
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:05,001
I have become sick
of you always pushing me away.

390
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,422
Yes.

391
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,095
I am fed up now.

392
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:22,852
So…

393
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,067
please go back.

394
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,822
What if I refuse?

395
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,451
What if I

396
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,536
refuse to go back--

397
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,372
Does a married woman have no shame?

398
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,337
Let us go to Joseon.

399
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:16,966
Lady Yoo.

400
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,843
It is what he wants.

401
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,804
I want to do…

402
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,266
what he wants.

403
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,282
Can you not just say
that you will stay here?

404
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,076
How could I stay when my lady is leaving?

405
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,622
Choose one.

406
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,373
Is it me or her?

407
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,417
Well, of course…

408
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,879
I choose her.

409
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,715
Jong-jong.

410
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,179
You wish to go with us

411
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,848
when we go to Joseon?

412
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,475
Yes.

413
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,770
My family is waiting for me in Joseon.

414
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,941
Yes, you should return.

415
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,162
I can never fully repay you

416
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,165
for saving my son.

417
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,585
In the future,

418
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,214
if the crown prince ascends the throne,

419
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,385
I promise to repay that kindness.

420
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,518
You have already done so much for me.

421
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,941
The time I have spent here
helping with farming…

422
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,948
has been the most joyful time of my life.

423
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,000
My lord.

424
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,878
Are you inside?

425
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,153
I have told Her Highness.

426
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,825
When she departs for Joseon…

427
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,039
I shall go back to Joseon with her.

428
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,920
That is good.

429
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,261
But I am busy.

430
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,140
I do not think I can see you off.

431
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,897
You must be…

432
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,651
very tired of me.

433
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,448
I only seem to cause you trouble.

434
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,202
It is embarrassing

435
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,412
and pathetic.

436
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,047
I have never

437
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,550
thought of you that way.

438
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,597
So…

439
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,102
go to Joseon…

440
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:03,109
forget all the hardships
you endured in Shenyang…

441
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,530
and live a good life.

442
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,537
Live loudly…

443
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,417
and vibrantly…

444
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,213
like the Gil-chae I know.

445
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,322
Yes.

446
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,076
I promise to do that.

447
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,165
I have a goal now.

448
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,546
I wish to never again…

449
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,592
cause you any trouble.

450
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:13,971
Yes.

451
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,475
I will go to Joseon,

452
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,519
and proudly,

453
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,980
bravely…

454
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,817
live a good life.

455
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,162
Thank you.

456
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,713
And I am truly…

457
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,218
sorry.

458
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,336
Goodbye.

459
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:54,840
Go…

460
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,139
and live like a flower.

461
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,314
That is all…

462
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,615
I want.

463
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,054
You must want to kill me.

464
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:11,852
Yes.

465
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,273
If you just give permission…

466
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,568
You may hate me,

467
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,654
but it is the Joseon people
who have forgotten the captives.

468
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,658
People are no longer coming to free them.

469
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,746
So, nobody will care even if

470
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,123
something happens to the captives.

471
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,666
They are

472
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,960
like orphans.

473
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,465
What I wonder

474
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,385
is why you gave up
the woman you love so dearly

475
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:50,140
for those insignificant captives.

476
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,274
Why did you do that?

477
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,155
Lee Jang-hyeon is a man

478
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:09,826
who cannot sit by and watch
as the pitiful and insignificant suffer.

479
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,079
How naive of him.

480
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,749
I am certain

481
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:18,001
that your laughable sympathy

482
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,296
will hold you back one day.

483
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,048
Do you think so?

484
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,594
I do not care for others' business.

485
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,141
Is that so?

486
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,163
What are you playing at?

487
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,000
Why…

488
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,754
Why did you save me?

489
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,050
I know you would like it if I died.

490
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,058
As I thought,

491
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,020
you are a man who saves those that fall.

492
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,151
So, Lee Jang-hyeon…

493
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,947
will you save me as well?

494
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:22,876
I am scared.

495
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,799
I have never

496
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,011
lived in a world without my father.

497
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,933
You may hate me,

498
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,310
but just for a while…

499
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:43,855
stay by my side.

500
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,819
I beg you.

501
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:08,004
The former Khan
did not let the crown prince return

502
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:11,508
for years after he was taken away.

503
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,928
So, why would Dorgon allow

504
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,807
the crown prince to visit
as soon as he became regent?

505
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,934
The crown princess's father passed away.

506
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:23,687
The crown prince requested
earnestly to offer condolences--

507
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,188
That is my point.

508
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,485
Are you saying that Dorgon
complied with the crown prince's request?

509
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,446
Darn it.

510
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,909
Your Majesty, the crown prince
has reached the capital.

511
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:55,886
Your Highness.

512
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:00,390
His Majesty is feeling ill
and cannot see you today,

513
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,184
so if you go back and wait…

514
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,686
Your Majesty.

515
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,105
I am here.

516
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,149
I am paying my respects.

517
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:12,944
Fine.

518
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,450
His Majesty will not allow

519
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,328
the crown princess
to see her widowed mother

520
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,039
nor to cry in front
of her father's ancestral tablet.

521
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,583
On top of that, in the palace prison,

522
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,168
the court ladies are being tortured daily

523
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,836
as part of an investigation
into a palace curse.

524
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,088
A palace curse?

525
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,258
Is this based on hearsay?

526
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,679
The rumors of the prison tortures
have been going around for a while.

527
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,474
Have you looked
into the root of the rumor?

528
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,352
Advisors are obligated

529
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:48,688
to inform His Majesty about any rumors.

530
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:52,692
But if you report groundless rumors
without even checking them,

531
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,153
how could your words have any weight?

532
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,864
I understand, Master.

533
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:01,493
I will get to the bottom
of the truth behind the rumors.

534
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,543
I am a Hongmungwan compiler.

535
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,712
Rumors say the court ladies
are being tortured in the palace prison.

536
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,154
I am a Hongmungwan compiler.

537
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,657
I am investigating the rumors.

538
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,254
Father, stay still.

539
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,716
There you go.

540
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,343
Move your hand this way. Yes.

541
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:07,684
Are we going to meet Gil-chae?

542
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:08,768
Yes.

543
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,729
We shall see her soon.

544
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,315
Eun-ae, do not say such things.

545
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,197
Master.

546
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:23,992
Lady Yoo is here.

547
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,952
Lady Yoo?

548
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,787
Father.

549
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,291
Eun-ae.

550
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,046
Yeong-chae.

551
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,339
Gil-chae.

552
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,885
Gil-chae!

553
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,639
What took you so long?

554
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,515
My goodness.

555
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:48,725
Madam Bangdu.

556
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:56,858
Eun-ae.

557
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:58,860
It is you.

558
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,780
It is Gil-chae.

559
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,913
It is you, Gil-chae.

560
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,099
Father.

561
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,690
Lady Yoo is here, Master.

562
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,662
Father.

563
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,613
It is warm, right?

564
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,574
Let us sleep here tonight.

565
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,242
We just changed out the sheets.

566
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:35,040
My goodness. Where do I sleep tonight?

567
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,713
Jong-jong.

568
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,133
It must have been hard.

569
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,851
So, Su-ji…

570
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,813
I said I would sleep
with Jong-jong tonight.

571
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,608
I just came to get a pillow.

572
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:03,651
So,

573
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:06,321
-Jong-jong, get some rest.
-Yes.

574
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:10,825
My gosh.

575
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,456
Leave!

576
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,714
You must still get along well
every night these days.

577
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,842
That man does not seem to tire with age.

578
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:32,055
I know you like it.

579
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,516
Me? Like it?

580
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:35,642
Never mind if not.

581
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,149
I do like it a bit.

582
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,500
Lord Gu has been

583
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,794
staying at his family home these days?

584
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:04,754
Yes.

585
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,882
He went all the way to Shenyang for you,

586
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:11,094
but a thief stole all his money from him.

587
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,473
He was getting ready to go again.

588
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,687
I see.

589
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,399
But, Gil-chae…

590
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:26,818
Yes?

591
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,320
When you were in Qing…

592
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:35,160
the barbarians did not do
bad things to you, did they?

593
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,580
Yeong-chae.

594
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,498
Why talk of such a thing
on a joyful day like this?

595
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,459
Besides, you know Gil-chae.

596
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:51,009
This is like a dream.

597
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:57,390
True. You are no ordinary person.

598
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,214
Thank you.

599
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,927
Thank you…

600
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,224
for coming back.

601
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:57,575
Let us go.

602
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:01,913
I will be late today,
so do not wait for me.

603
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:02,997
Yes.

604
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,720
My lady.

605
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,527
Is it really you?

606
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,283
Who is

607
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,159
that woman?

608
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,706
Do not worry. I will handle it.

609
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,416
But before that…

610
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,752
while you were there…

611
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,340
nothing happened to you, right?

612
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,517
What will happen now?

613
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,041
She was captured and came back
after enduring awful things.

614
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,376
-What awful things?
-Must you really ask?

615
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,836
She has come back alive,

616
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,922
-bringing shame on all Joseon women.
-Exactly.

617
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,716
How shameless.

618
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,468
You must have very thick skin.

619
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,387
-What did you just say?
-Jong-jong.

620
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,723
What did you say with that filthy mouth?

621
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:47,060
How dare a girl who was
dirtied by the barbarians talk back?

622
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,940
One should not bother
responding to utter drivel.

623
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,651
Let us go.

624
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,407
Gil-chae.

625
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,786
I talked to Lord Gu,

626
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:08,790
and he has no intention of divorcing you.

627
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,875
But first,

628
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,336
he wants to hear your answer.

629
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:19,467
If nothing happened, just tell him that.

630
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,096
Gil-chae.

631
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:27,266
Did the barbarians
really do something to you?

632
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,351
Yeong-chae.

633
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,495
His daughter was captured by the Qing.

634
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,415
When asked if anything happened,
she would not answer.

635
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:53,668
And she still wishes to move back in?

636
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:57,046
Since she could not prove her chastity,
there is no doubt about it.

637
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:00,717
If she was too scared to die,
she should have at least pretended.

638
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,385
Talk about shameless.

639
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,388
Father, what is "chastity"?

640
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,891
That hurts, Father.

641
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,082
Gil-chae.

642
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:23,382
When you were born,
I felt like I had gained the whole world.

643
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:30,306
I have felt all the happiness
in the world from raising you.

644
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,856
My precious daughter.

645
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:45,321
My treasure.

646
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,119
But now…

647
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:58,459
you must live in humiliation
for the rest of your life.

648
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,880
What should we do?

649
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:09,971
I cannot do anything.

650
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,058
So, what…

651
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:28,406
No.

652
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,537
I will help you.

653
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,708
I will save you

654
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:42,587
from living the rest of your life…

655
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,966
in humiliation.

656
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,114
Gil-chae, hold on.

657
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,659
Just endure it a little longer.

658
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:18,789
I will prove your innocence
with my own hands

659
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,083
so that you will never

660
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,586
suffer humiliation again.

661
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,757
Father.

662
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:39,936
Barbarians…

663
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,146
The barbarians…

664
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:43,648
Get the barbarians!

665
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,524
Master.

666
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:50,696
The barbarians…

667
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:53,783
Gil-chae.

668
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,118
Gil-chae.

669
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,786
My lady.

670
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,959
Can I take some daggers

671
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,837
to use against barbarian thieves?

672
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:50,214
What

673
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,466
are you saying?

674
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:01,434
Yes.

675
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,563
I was sold to barbarians in Shenyang.

676
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,191
I suffered unbearable humiliation there.

677
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:16,615
I also met Lord Lee.

678
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,744
I was freed thanks to his help.

679
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,333
The humiliation I endured

680
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:29,628
was not my fault.

681
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:31,547
If you had asked

682
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:34,258
to divorce because of that,
I would not have given in.

683
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:35,176
However…

684
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,893
I gave my heart to Lord Lee in Shenyang.

685
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,148
I am sorry.

686
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,904
That is why I am divorcing you.

687
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:12,171
My goodness.

688
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,874
The crown prince is coming to Joseon?

689
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:32,084
That means
Interpreter Lee and Gu-jam will also…

690
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:33,544
Gu-jam.

691
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:36,255
My lord. You came back.

692
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:40,801
I found I too had a place
that I longed to return to.

693
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:43,929
Now that Lady Yoo is divorced,
will she run to you?

694
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:44,930
It is only right.

695
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,016
I want to live for her now.

696
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,810
I am really craving
steamed bean rice cakes.

697
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:51,729
Steamed bean rice cakes?

698
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:55,608
Now, we can spend
the rest of our lives like this.

699
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:13,000
