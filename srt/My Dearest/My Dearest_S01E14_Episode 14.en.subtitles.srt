1
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,129
Lady Gil-chae…

2
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,299
I mean, Lady Yoo.

3
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,596
She is in Shenyang.

4
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,320
Jong-jong.

5
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,329
Jong-jong.

6
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:42,894
Yes.

7
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,021
Ryang-eum must be mistaken.

8
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:49,651
How could the wife of a respected officer
be in a place like this?

9
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,320
How could she possibly…

10
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,576
You will not find
a woman like this anywhere else.

11
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,163
She is a real Joseon noblewoman.

12
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,499
Look how fair her skin is.

13
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,252
She has a small scar,
but everything else is intact.

14
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,630
This is a perfect product!

15
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:15,760
The bidding will start at 30 yang.

16
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,471
Name your prices!

17
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,493
I keep seeing things.

18
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,350
Hey! If you want the woman, pay up!

19
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,374
Why on earth…

20
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,016
Why

21
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,059
on earth…

22
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,492
Why?

23
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:30,913
Why?

24
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,586
Why?

25
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,760
You punk.

26
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,600
My lord.

27
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,310
My lord!

28
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,312
My lord!

29
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,190
Lord Lee.

30
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,993
My lord.

31
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,918
My lord.

32
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,088
Lord Lee!

33
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,010
My lord.

34
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,012
My lord!

35
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,806
My lord!

36
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,642
My lord.

37
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,269
My lord.

38
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,348
I knew this would happen.

39
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,185
You lose all reason
when it comes to Lady Yoo.

40
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,398
How about Lady Yoo?

41
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,985
I made sure they could not sell her,

42
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,654
so get your wounds treated
before you go to see her.

43
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,757
My lady.

44
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,844
How long have you been here?

45
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,512
Who are you calling "my lady"?

46
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,056
Go away.

47
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,600
Go

48
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,478
and tell Interpreter Lee
that you did not see me.

49
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,574
She has been
in the slave market for a while.

50
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,578
She was sold once but was returned
when she bit off her owner's ear.

51
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,999
Jong-jong was sold off somewhere far away.

52
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,223
Why not leave at dawn?

53
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,934
I must bring her back as soon as possible.

54
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:41,938
I am off.

55
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,273
Do not worry.

56
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,486
I will definitely bring Jong-jong back.

57
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,886
Come out.

58
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,961
She is a rare item I have
never put out like this before.

59
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,630
So she is expensive.

60
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,801
Ten yang.

61
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,431
Fifteen if you want her all night.

62
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,499
I never thought we would
meet again in a place like this.

63
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,716
What happened in Joseon?

64
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,764
You should have lived well.

65
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,809
You should have lived
proudly flaunting your happiness.

66
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,025
More importantly…

67
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,404
why did you not look for me?

68
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,909
You knew I was in Shenyang.

69
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,538
Why did you not come to me
while enduring such hardship?

70
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,832
Why should I have looked for you?

71
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,087
I have no reason to ask for your help.

72
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,506
We are…

73
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,803
We are nothing to each other.

74
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,017
Did you…

75
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,147
pay that barbarian

76
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,608
to buy me for tonight?

77
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,573
You are no different, my lord.

78
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,412
Well then,

79
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,539
what shall I do for you?

80
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,334
Shall I pour you a drink?

81
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,545
Shall I sing and dance for you?

82
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,342
Or do you want something else?

83
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,400
Even if you show me kindness…

84
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,028
I cannot repay you.

85
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,365
So…

86
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,619
do not do anything for me.

87
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,834
It is burdensome.

88
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,680
No.

89
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,727
This time, I cannot do as you wish.

90
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,898
I will do as I please.

91
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,448
I will act as I desire.

92
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,355
Had a good time?

93
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,195
I have changed my mind.

94
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,073
I cannot sell that woman.

95
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,745
Now you say

96
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,997
you will not sell?

97
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,875
It is my choice.

98
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,212
If you really want her,

99
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,756
give me 200 yang.

100
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:06,720
She tried to escape earlier
and badly injured one of my men.

101
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,847
Considering the medical costs,

102
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,309
I should be asking for at least 300 yang.

103
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,109
No.

104
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,737
I think I would rather
keep her than sell her.

105
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,865
I will not sell.

106
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,869
Think about it…

107
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,832
one more time.

108
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,596
I cannot sell. I will not sell.

109
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,524
Really?

110
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,118
I am…

111
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,164
a merchant too.

112
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,878
I will not take your money.

113
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,175
I know you have worked hard for it.

114
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,929
But…

115
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,724
if I pay you…

116
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,314
you must…

117
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,902
hand over the captive.

118
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,367
If you cannot do that…

119
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,041
I will shove the money
into your eyeballs and then take her.

120
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,711
Yes, sir.

121
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,632
I will give you whomever you want.

122
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,552
Take them all.

123
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,159
You may go.

124
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:16,869
Go!

125
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,370
Get out!

126
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,750
Get out!

127
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,628
Get out quickly!

128
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,226
Let us go.

129
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,067
Is it not strange?

130
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,698
Whenever the moon is this bright…

131
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,204
I am always with you.

132
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,567
I am not sure where things went wrong.

133
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,655
Was it back then?

134
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,916
Should I not have left you behind…

135
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,170
and gone to Namhan Fortress?

136
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,843
Or was it after that?

137
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,306
Should I not have…

138
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,143
come to Shenyang

139
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,272
and left you behind?

140
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,822
Or…

141
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,701
was it the last time?

142
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,297
That time when you abandoned me.

143
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,956
Once we get a certificate
from the Qing Ministry of Revenue,

144
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,958
you will be officially freed.

145
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,346
So…

146
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,186
do not worry about anything.

147
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,108
Do not…

148
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,738
worry about anything.

149
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,689
How is your stomach?

150
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,316
It is fine.

151
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:06,945
Did I

152
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,198
make any mistakes?

153
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,916
I will prepare to go
to the Ministry of Revenue.

154
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,629
I should prepare new clothes too.

155
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,423
Wait here for a moment.

156
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,757
Thank you.

157
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,553
Thank you.

158
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,234
No.

159
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,447
It's my pleasure.

160
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,936
What are you doing?

161
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,277
If I had known, I would have
brought some silk clothes from Joseon.

162
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,575
These are clothes from Joseon.

163
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,827
I thought you might need them.

164
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:55,887
Thank you.

165
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,016
It is like you can read my mind.

166
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,494
My lady.

167
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,749
My lady, I am coming in.

168
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,135
The woman was sold elsewhere.

169
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,095
They took her away just now.

170
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,232
Here.

171
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,444
I will return this to you.

172
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,580
What trickery is this?

173
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,585
It was a member of the royal family.
How could I refuse?

174
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,069
You are nothing special.

175
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,616
Why would he pay so much
for someone like you?

176
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:42,535
Your Highness, the Joseon interpreter,
Lee Jang-hyeon, is here.

177
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,897
Come in.

178
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,625
Your Highness.

179
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,044
Did you come to see me,

180
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,004
or did you come

181
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,132
to find that woman?

182
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,093
Forgive me,

183
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,263
but I planned to free her
and send her back to Joseon--

184
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,347
No.

185
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,892
That will

186
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,978
no longer be possible.

187
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,981
She is my court maiden now.

188
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,361
Whether she lives or dies

189
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,780
is up to me.

190
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,831
The Joseon captives are pitiful indeed.

191
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,752
I hear that Joseon women
who are sold to Qing households

192
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,837
have their faces
disfigured with boiling water

193
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,465
by the jealous mistresses.

194
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,469
Do you want an obedient court maiden?

195
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,637
I can find one for you.

196
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,891
Whatever you need, just say the word--

197
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,184
This is not like you.

198
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,314
You are usually so calm
and impossible to read,

199
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,025
but today, you are so anxious.

200
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,196
Seeing how desperate you are

201
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,990
makes me less willing
to send her back home.

202
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,829
What if I present
that woman to His Majesty?

203
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:55,543
His Majesty's
beloved concubine died recently,

204
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,670
and he has been downcast ever since.

205
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,927
Your Highness.

206
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,266
Once upon a time,

207
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,145
there was a great emperor
with a beloved only daughter.

208
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,566
But when the princess
fell in love with a lowly warrior,

209
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,902
the angry emperor

210
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,988
decided to test the princess's love.

211
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:29,828
He made the warrior choose
between two doors.

212
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:34,082
Behind one door,
there was a peerless beauty,

213
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,917
and behind the other

214
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,336
was a starving beast.

215
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,714
He also made

216
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:47,387
the princess choose
which door to guide the warrior to.

217
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,599
To save the warrior,

218
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,811
she had to choose
the door that led to the beautiful woman,

219
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,230
but then she would suffer

220
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:01,943
the pain of watching her love
fall for another woman.

221
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,280
If she chose the other door…

222
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,368
the man would be torn apart by a lion.

223
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,206
What would you do?

224
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,090
If it were me,

225
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,012
I would rather see him
torn apart by a lion.

226
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,806
I would not lose the man I desire

227
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,601
to another woman.

228
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,591
From the royal household,

229
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,469
I have brought the court maiden
who speaks both languages best.

230
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,721
I pay my respects, Princess.

231
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,476
Sure.

232
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,021
You must convey my words
to that wench well.

233
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,235
You must have suffered greatly.

234
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,615
She says you must have suffered greatly.

235
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,994
You are right. I did suffer a lot.

236
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,124
What does it matter if I speak casually?
She cannot understand.

237
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,713
Yes. She says she suffered greatly.

238
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,342
I hear Joseon women value
their chastity so much

239
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,594
that they even take
their own lives when captured.

240
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,058
So, why did you not die?

241
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,060
Did you lack courage?

242
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,313
She asks why you did not

243
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,774
die when you were captured.

244
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,238
What do you care whether I live or die?

245
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,499
There was someone who tried to save me.

246
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,672
I will live tenaciously,
if only for that person's sake.

247
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,300
If you kill me…

248
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,473
he will not let you off.

249
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,856
She lacked the courage to die,

250
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:48,234
but she is very happy
that Your Highness has taken her in.

251
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,955
You have a coarse tongue.

252
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,068
Do you know my Da-jim?

253
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,198
Do you?

254
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,008
No need.

255
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,682
I entrusted you with Joseon's affairs.

256
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,518
So, why have

257
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,438
the military provisions
from Joseon not arrived yet?

258
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,816
Joseon has prepared the rice.

259
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,694
But they have not yet been able
to prepare laborers and carts.

260
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,697
We still have not captured Songshan!

261
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,952
Without the provisions,

262
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,037
we cannot complete this mission.

263
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,081
Make sure

264
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,542
you get the provisions from Joseon
and send them

265
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,253
to the battlefield immediately.

266
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,185
His Majesty is pressing us
to hurry with the provisions.

267
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,646
Why is there still no news?

268
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,731
Perhaps

269
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,192
Joseon does not want Qing to win?

270
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,486
Are you still loyal to Ming?

271
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,742
It is difficult to transport
720 tons of rice right now.

272
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,414
To transport just 144 kg of rice,
we need 656 yards of cotton.

273
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:11,752
To transport 720 tons at once,
we need hundreds of horses and carts.

274
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:17,300
Recently, dozens of people froze to death
on the road while transporting provisions,

275
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,219
and over a hundred horses
died from exhaustion--

276
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,221
His Majesty says

277
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,057
if the provisions do not arrive
by the deadline,

278
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,477
he will not accept them
even when they arrive later.

279
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,316
Are you threatening me again
with talk of consequences?

280
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,905
Though I am here as a hostage,
I am still the crown prince of a nation.

281
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,450
The heavens decide who lives or dies.

282
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,911
So do not try to intimidate me
with such threats!

283
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,873
-His Majesty says--
-Your Highness, I have a suggestion.

284
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,417
How dare an interpreter interrupt?

285
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,005
What if we move the provisions
in Liao to Jinzhou first

286
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,925
and then repay Liao
with provisions from Joseon later?

287
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,635
That would allow us

288
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,596
to save on carts and oxen,

289
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:06,933
and we could meet the promised deadline.

290
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,442
If we move Liao's grain to Jinzhou,

291
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:20,321
it would lessen the burden
of our spending on carts and horses.

292
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,324
But would General Zhongming
of Liao agree to this?

293
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,827
I will personally meet with him
and persuade him.

294
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,829
But, Your Highness,

295
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,291
I have one request.

296
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,546
There is a Joseon captive
that the princess owns.

297
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,590
Please help

298
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,386
to secure her release.

299
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:51,185
The Qing have a custom of rewarding
loyal subordinates with women.

300
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:56,023
Sending military provisions
and capturing escaped prisoners

301
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,859
are the matters that the Khan
considers most important.

302
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:03,864
If the provisions arrive on time,
the Khan will be very pleased.

303
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:10,663
When that happens,
would Your Highness request the release

304
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,291
of the princess's court maiden?

305
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,836
Court maiden? What are you talking about?

306
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,714
We cannot grant such a request.

307
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,758
If the king of Joseon learns of this,

308
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,845
he will reproach the crown prince
for indulging in women in Shenyang.

309
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:29,098
It is just a private matter
of releasing one woman.

310
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,684
If we ensure it is not included
in the official reports sent to Joseon--

311
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,894
I cannot lie to His Majesty.

312
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,690
This is unlike you, Interpreter Lee.

313
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,108
Why do you seem so desperate?

314
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,693
Your Highness.

315
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,114
Do you know who that woman is?

316
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,658
That woman

317
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,745
is the one who saved the young prince

318
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,248
when the barbarians
invaded Ganghwa Island.

319
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,754
That day, all the eunuchs
entrusted with the prince died.

320
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,299
One woman risked her life to save
the prince and brought him to the ship.

321
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,842
That woman has been

322
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,179
dragged here under false charges
of being an escaped prisoner?

323
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,558
And the princess intends
to present her to the Khan?

324
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,311
Yes, Your Highness.

325
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:21,525
It is common for Qing women to mistreat
Joseon captives out of jealousy.

326
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,945
If even commoners' wives
and mistresses do this,

327
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,990
imagine what
the emperor's concubines might do.

328
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:33,913
If the Khan shows even
the slightest interest in that woman,

329
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,456
that woman

330
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,542
will not survive.

331
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,757
That is why we must free her

332
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,510
before the Khan obtains her.

333
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,848
Fortunately, the Khan caught an illness
while he was in Songshan

334
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,267
and is currently recovering
at the hot springs.

335
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,395
So we still have time.

336
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,109
Your Highness,

337
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,027
I will

338
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,240
persuade General Zhongming without fail.

339
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,286
Please help

340
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:16,997
to free that woman.

341
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,135
Da-jim?

342
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,929
Old man Deok-chul's grandson Da-jim?

343
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,556
Yes.

344
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,393
Where is he? Where is Da-jim?

345
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,354
Da-jim is at my home in Joseon.

346
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,611
Thank you.

347
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,655
Thank you.

348
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,703
What is your relationship
with Interpreter Lee?

349
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,749
His Majesty's favored daughter bought you.

350
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:05,588
It seems the princess
has taken a liking to the interpreter.

351
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,382
The princess said that if Interpreter Lee

352
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,468
kept hovering around you,
she would destroy him.

353
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:40,998
My lady.

354
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:45,127
My lord.

355
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,510
Have you been waiting here all night?

356
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,346
I have seen you. That is enough.

357
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,808
I will be leaving on an errand
for His Highness for a few days.

358
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:04,480
So if you do not see me for a while,
do not worry too much.

359
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,900
Is it a dangerous journey?

360
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,986
Not at all.

361
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,322
Well, then…

362
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,790
The princess is benevolent.

363
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:27,044
It is incomparable to the slave market.

364
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,047
So, my lord…

365
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,343
please do not

366
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,679
do anything for my sake.

367
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,181
I beg you.

368
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,657
All right.

369
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,661
I will do as you say.

370
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,582
Do not worry too much, my lady.

371
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,294
There is no reason to worry.

372
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,593
Well, then I will get going.

373
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,065
I hear General Zhongming has
long been friendly with Joseon?

374
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,692
Yes, General.

375
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,532
The outcome of this war
depends on the provisions.

376
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,578
His Majesty personally went
to the battlefield to capture Songshan

377
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,872
and has now fallen gravely ill.

378
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,416
It is a battlefield
that made His Majesty bleed.

379
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,168
So we must capture Songshan at all costs.

380
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,463
If you fail to accomplish this…

381
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,135
neither you nor the crown prince
of Joseon will be safe.

382
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,907
Officer Gu.

383
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,161
What brings you here?

384
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,289
It is about Lady Yoo.

385
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,417
Since you are busy with official duties,

386
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,920
perhaps I should go to Shenyang?

387
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:40,511
If another man goes to find my wife,
what will people think?

388
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,721
Do you think that would help my wife?

389
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,975
This is a family matter.
Please do not interfere.

390
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,608
I have sent someone to Shenyang.

391
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,820
We will receive good news soon.

392
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,055
I am sorry.

393
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,183
I have been weak lately.

394
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,602
It is because you cannot sleep.

395
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,479
The living must live on.

396
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,068
Officer Gu said he sent
someone to Shenyang,

397
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,778
so let us wait for now.

398
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,823
I cannot go to get Lady Yoo

399
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,993
when her husband is here.

400
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,329
Yes, I understand.

401
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,375
Gil-chae will return soon.

402
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,173
Husband,

403
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,926
when we lived in Neunggun-ri…

404
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,765
all my friends wanted to play with me.

405
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:11,977
But I enjoyed

406
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,689
playing with Gil-chae the most.

407
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,735
Gil-chae was

408
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,945
full of jealousy,

409
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,448
full of greed…

410
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,243
and full of affection.

411
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,748
I loved the fullness of her character,

412
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,293
how lively she was,

413
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,670
like a breath of fresh air.

414
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:43,967
Not to mention…

415
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,389
Gil-chae saved my life.

416
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,892
Yes.

417
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,270
We have all managed to get by
thanks to Lady Yoo.

418
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,066
It is not just that.

419
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,530
She literally saved my life.

420
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,252
If it were not for Gil-chae,

421
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,380
I would be dead.

422
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,467
If our roles were reversed,

423
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:31,265
Gil-chae would have gone
to Shenyang herself to save me.

424
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,142
I am sure of it.

425
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,938
That is what Gil-chae would have done.

426
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,734
But I…

427
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,865
There is nothing I can do.

428
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,589
Gil-chae is probably dead.

429
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,724
You are here.

430
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,554
Please accept me as your disciple.

431
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:57,517
What is your reason
for wanting to be my disciple?

432
00:48:58,852 --> 00:48:59,853
I admire

433
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,356
your virtue and wisdom.

434
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,617
And honestly speaking,

435
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:16,536
I admire your power.

436
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,667
Every year, Joseon sends the Qing
several tons of rice and thousands of men.

437
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,336
Dozens of porters

438
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,506
freeze or starve to death on the way.

439
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,843
Hundreds of soldiers die in vain,
entangled in another nation's conflict.

440
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,097
And we do not know when this war will end.

441
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,226
I recently went to Pyeongan Province

442
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,312
and witnessed the screams of the people.

443
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:46,149
The people had their rice taken

444
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,485
and their men taken.

445
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,821
Yet, they did not make a sound.

446
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,492
But I saw the screams
they were letting out.

447
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,454
I cannot bear doing nothing
while I see the people suffer.

448
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,959
I cannot bear doing nothing

449
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,254
while the one who saved my life
is in grave danger.

450
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,759
I cannot bear living
like a useless loafer.

451
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,555
If there is anything
someone like me can do,

452
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,933
I want to do it.

453
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,853
Use me to serve our nation and people.

454
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,939
No, use me so I can live…

455
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,735
not as a useless loafer

456
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,821
but as a decent human being.

457
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,668
LIAO PROVINCE, QING

458
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,935
You came to discuss the issue
of military provisions?

459
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,494
I hear you were of high status in Joseon,

460
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,747
so you have probably
never served others before.

461
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,586
If I do not release you,

462
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,713
you will have to live like this

463
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,007
for the rest of your life.

464
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,846
So, would it not be better

465
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:44,267
for you to become
His Majesty's woman instead?

466
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,775
Who knows?

467
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,820
He might cherish you like a concubine.

468
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,865
If I present you to him…

469
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,161
His Majesty might overlook

470
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,997
your scarred body.

471
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,459
You see,

472
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,753
His Majesty cherishes me greatly.

473
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:15,966
If you refuse,

474
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,718
you will be my servant for life.

475
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:19,803
Yes.

476
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,180
I will serve His Majesty.

477
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:30,188
Poor Jang-hyeon.

478
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,943
To think he tried so hard
to free such a worthless wench.

479
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,654
You are the type

480
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,658
His Majesty would enjoy
once or twice before discarding.

481
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,830
But it will be enough to make

482
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,791
Jang-hyeon give up on you.

483
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,720
You want us to send
our rice to Jinzhou first

484
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,931
and then receive rice from Joseon later?

485
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,308
Yes, General.

486
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:11,980
The tons of rice piled up in your fortress
will spoil if left until next year.

487
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:13,648
So would it not be better

488
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,735
to send it to Jinzhou before it spoils

489
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:21,323
and then receive
fresh rice from Joseon later?

490
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:25,911
His Majesty in Songshan
would receive the provisions on time,

491
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,581
and I would get fresh rice from Joseon.

492
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,209
It seems mutually beneficial.

493
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:34,878
But

494
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,297
I cannot do that.

495
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:45,138
If we fail to deliver
the provisions by the promised date,

496
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:47,349
I will be the one
to suffer the consequences.

497
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:49,059
I cannot risk that.

498
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,646
Then, will you let the rice
in your storehouse rot?

499
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,481
Even if the rice spoils,

500
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,776
it would be better
than incurring His Majesty's displeasure.

501
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,945
I am a defector from Ming.

502
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,783
I cannot afford to make
any mistakes for now.

503
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,621
General.

504
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:15,001
Do you know why
General Yonggoldae followed me here?

505
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,130
It is because he does not trust me,
a Joseon person,

506
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:23,093
and he does not trust you,
a general who defected from Ming.

507
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,725
Why is he reacting like that?
Why does he look alarmed?

508
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,185
The Khan

509
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:36,272
still does not fully trust generals
who defected from Ming.

510
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:39,442
For now, he is keeping

511
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:44,364
defected Ming generals close to show off.

512
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,241
But do you think

513
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,536
he will keep you by his side

514
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,206
after the war ends?

515
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,171
His Majesty regards

516
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,842
the military provisions
as a matter of utmost importance.

517
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:08,763
This is your chance to prove your worth
as a general who defected from Ming.

518
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:13,268
Will you miss this opportunity

519
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,895
for fear of messing up?

520
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:17,939
Or will you

521
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,359
take a small risk

522
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,946
to earn His Majesty's trust?

523
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,118
What are you saying to him?

524
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:31,619
General,

525
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,122
how about this?

526
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,417
Let us pretend I was never here.

527
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,252
You noticed

528
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:41,963
His Majesty was in trouble,

529
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,674
and you volunteered

530
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,968
to send the provisions first.

531
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:51,681
If His Majesty learns of this,

532
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:56,478
how pleased will he be?

533
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,570
What did you say
in the Ming language at the end?

534
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,198
What did you say

535
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,533
that made him agree

536
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,037
not only to send the provisions
but also to reduce the transport fee

537
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,538
from 500 yang to 200 yang?

538
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,458
The general is originally from Ming,

539
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,169
so would he not understand
the Ming language better?

540
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:23,880
Why?

541
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:28,093
Do you want to take this chance
to learn the Ming language?

542
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,637
How dare you mock me!

543
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:43,441
I hear you are sending provisions
from Liao to Jinzhou

544
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,694
and will be compensated for it
with rice from Uiju?

545
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,155
General Zhongming,

546
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,201
I have always been
suspicious of you as a Ming defector.

547
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,204
But it seems you have finally realized
the power of Great Qing.

548
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:03,253
I wish to commend Joseon

549
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,339
for delivering the provisions on time.

550
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,466
Choose anything you want

551
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:11,261
from the recent spoils we brought over

552
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,430
from Songshan.

553
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,267
Then,

554
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:20,728
could you grant me one of
the Joseon captive women as a reward?

555
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,567
I see now

556
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,278
that you are also a man.

557
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:37,370
Very well.

558
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,124
Which court maiden
do you desire as a reward?

559
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,798
It is already too late.

560
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,428
What do you mean it is too late?

561
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:57,265
A few days ago,
His Majesty met Lady Yoo in person.

562
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,690
A FEW DAYS AGO

563
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,322
Gakhwa.

564
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,408
You have returned from the hot springs.

565
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,951
Why is your complexion still so dark?

566
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,247
I cannot stop worrying
about the military provisions.

567
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:24,542
Forget about the battlefield for a moment.

568
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:28,129
Let me present you with a woman
to comfort Your Majesty.

569
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:47,482
Your Majesty.

570
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,990
I hear she scarred herself

571
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,826
to refuse bed service.

572
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:00,954
However,

573
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:04,582
I do not look unfavorably
upon Joseon women's efforts

574
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,292
to maintain their chastity.

575
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:10,213
I also admire how the Joseon officials
are loyal to their king.

576
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:12,882
I recently saw

577
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,511
Joseon officials hitting
their own heads and weeping

578
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:19,764
as they fought to save their king,
who lost the war.

579
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,308
When I conquer the Central Plains,

580
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,852
my people should follow these examples.

581
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,490
It is truly an honor to meet Your Majesty.

582
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,663
Do you know our language?

583
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:48,459
I learned Manchu
to make an appeal to Your Majesty.

584
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,171
You learned our language

585
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,133
because you have something to say to me?

586
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,178
Well, then, what is it you wish to say?

587
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:00,680
Your Majesty,

588
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,682
I am not a captive.

589
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:04,684
I was kidnapped.

590
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,644
Please correct this injustice.

591
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:09,689
You say you were kidnapped
despite not being

592
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,566
an escaped captive?

593
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

594
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,530
I have never been captured as a prisoner,
nor have I ever escaped as one.

595
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,700
But I was kidnapped
from Joseon and brought here.

596
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,577
It is not just me.

597
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:26,539
Countless others have been
dragged here as false captives.

598
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,626
But in this place,
where we cannot communicate,

599
01:00:30,168 --> 01:00:32,420
how could we possibly
report these injustices?

600
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,464
Moreover,

601
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:37,508
the Joseon female captives
brought to Shenyang

602
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,594
are abused by their mistresses.

603
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:43,264
Their fingers are cut off,
their flesh is burned,

604
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,391
and their painful cries never cease.

605
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,227
Your Majesty.

606
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,355
You are known
for your fairness and justice.

607
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:53,024
So please do not let these injustices

608
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,902
reach the heavens
and tarnish Your Majesty's glory.

609
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,742
How audacious.

610
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,329
I have seen many Joseon women before,

611
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,249
but none who learned
our language on their own

612
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:13,378
to speak to me.

613
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,807
I have heard that
your wives and concubines

614
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,477
are abusing the women from Joseon.

615
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,232
The Joseon women

616
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,485
are spoils of war
our soldiers fought hard to obtain.

617
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,780
Yet, you cruelly torture them
by submerging them in hot water

618
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,908
and cutting off their fingers and ears,
disfiguring their faces.

619
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:46,994
There can be no display of jealousy
or cruelty worse than this.

620
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,580
PRINCE YOON (WANGYA)

621
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:50,915
If I hear

622
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:55,086
rumors of Joseon women
being tortured again in the future,

623
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,548
the women who tortured them
will be buried alive

624
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,342
when their husbands die, so be warned.

625
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:09,058
Thanks to her, Joseon women
are no longer abused.

626
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:12,687
Everyone is grateful to Lady Yoo,
though they have never met her.

627
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,856
However…

628
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,861
A FEW DAYS AGO

629
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:21,070
That wench claimed

630
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,823
she was never captured as a prisoner

631
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,117
but was wrongly brought here.

632
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,326
Your Majesty,

633
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:31,914
it is true that I sent servants to Joseon
to capture escaped prisoners,

634
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:35,084
but how could we have
kidnapped people falsely?

635
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,256
That is how it should be.

636
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,679
It is imperative
you never disobeyed my orders.

637
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,725
Surely,

638
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:54,187
you did not think I would believe
that Joseon wench over you,

639
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,231
when you have risked your life for me?

640
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:01,861
Your Majesty!

641
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,408
Joseon captives

642
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,536
are assets our soldiers
fought hard to obtain.

643
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,873
Whoever pays money
to buy them becomes their owner.

644
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:16,626
Now, you may dispose of that wench

645
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,962
as you see fit.

646
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,256
Yes, Your Majesty.

647
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:56,123
The princess took Lady Yoo away again,
and her fate is unknown.

648
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:18,145
Let go.

649
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,254
Your Highness.

650
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,386
Please punish me instead.

651
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,350
If you order me to cut off my heels…

652
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,062
in place of that woman…

653
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,232
I will do it.

654
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:07,153
If you order me to become a slave…

655
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,907
in place of that woman…

656
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:14,869
I will do it.

657
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:17,496
Please…

658
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:20,750
just tell me…

659
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:28,799
Just tell me…

660
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,054
where that woman is.

661
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:38,184
Was that woman still alive?

662
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,312
Your Highness.

663
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:43,981
If you grant my request,

664
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,068
I might tell you where that woman is.

665
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,154
Do you remember

666
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,573
when we went hunting together before?

667
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,117
That day…

668
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,371
was very enjoyable.

669
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:04,835
Will you go hunting with me once more?

670
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,382
Is that all?

671
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,593
This hunt

672
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:16,138
will involve a life-or-death wager.

673
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:18,808
Will you still do it?

674
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,019
A hunt that involves

675
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,605
a life-or-death wager?

676
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:28,818
Something is off. I have a bad feeling.

677
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,569
Do not go.

678
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,823
Do you really have to go this far?

679
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:37,743
Must you make me regret
telling you about Lady Yoo's capture…

680
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:41,706
for the rest of my life?

681
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,505
Regret?

682
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:52,591
You saved my life.

683
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,597
If something happened to Lady Yoo…

684
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:06,647
I would die.

685
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:19,744
Please stop him.

686
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:21,912
He might listen to you, Big Brother.

687
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:23,039
It is useless.

688
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:29,295
Jang-hyeon does what he wants,
regardless of what others say.

689
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:32,757
If something goes wrong,
Jang-hyeon could die!

690
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:45,352
I remember

691
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,898
when you first came with Jang-hyeon.

692
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:53,277
Jang-hyeon was

693
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,239
holding your hand tightly.

694
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,202
You were especially compliant

695
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,163
with Jang-hyeon.

696
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:08,834
You would come and go as he told you to.

697
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:15,508
Jang-hyeon cherished you greatly too.

698
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:18,010
But

699
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:20,429
to Jang-hyeon, you are just

700
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:22,932
a good younger brother.

701
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:27,770
Do not overreach.

702
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,234
I…

703
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,198
I am not…

704
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,621
I am not boldly overreaching.

705
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:50,042
I am scared.

706
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:56,215
I have never seen Jang-hyeon
act like this over a woman.

707
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,508
Why not just turn a blind eye?

708
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,176
Why come all this way to tell me?

709
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,179
If something happens to that woman…

710
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:06,642
Jang-hyeon…

711
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:11,939
Jang-hyeon might really fall apart.

712
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:20,197
I see. You did well.

713
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,116
But

714
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:25,411
if she is a woman
Jang-hyeon cares for so deeply,

715
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,454
there is nothing

716
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:29,456
you or I can do, is there?

717
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,518
His Majesty heard
of your unjust circumstances

718
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:50,853
and ordered your release.

719
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:54,481
Now you can go back to Joseon!

720
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:57,735
Is that true?

721
01:09:58,485 --> 01:09:59,737
Yes.

722
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,159
But there is a condition.

723
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:13,459
Leave Shenyang immediately.

724
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,921
You must not meet anyone from Joseon,
especially Jang-hyeon.

725
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,298
Also,

726
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:23,761
if you meet Jang-hyeon again,
he will suffer greatly.

727
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:39,401
The journey to Joseon
will be very difficult.

728
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:43,864
You cannot receive help
from the interpreter either, so take this.

729
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,163
Thank you.

730
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:53,916
No, I am thankful.

731
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,919
Thank you for taking care of my Da-jim.

732
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:05,636
You must safely return to Joseon.

733
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:10,557
When you get there, please tell him
that his mother is coming to meet him,

734
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:13,978
that I have not forgotten my son

735
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,313
for a single day.

736
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:28,158
I will.

737
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,120
I promise to tell him.

738
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:33,289
I promise.

739
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:37,293
Thank you.

740
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:04,278
If I leave now,

741
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,364
I will never see you again.

742
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,492
But perhaps

743
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:13,871
that would be better for you, my lord.

744
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:51,700
I hear you even gave her
some money separately?

745
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:54,703
Well done.

746
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:02,252
How did you know

747
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,046
that I gave her money?

748
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:45,462
Greetings, Your Highness.

749
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,549
Are you ready to hunt?

750
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:51,552
Yes, Your Highness.

751
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,720
And you are ready to risk your life?

752
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:58,392
Yes, Your Highness.

753
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,436
Good.

754
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:16,034
Did you not call me here to hunt?

755
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,119
That is right.

756
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:19,121
We will hunt for a captive.

757
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:22,541
Over there.

758
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:24,918
That woman.

759
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:43,187
That captive betrayed her owner
and even stole valuables before escaping.

760
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:48,567
Killing escaped captives
is something His Majesty has permitted.

761
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:08,962
Shall I

762
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:11,715
tell you the rules of our wager?

763
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,803
Whoever catches that captive first

764
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:18,430
wins.

765
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:21,475
If I win,

766
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,644
both you and the woman will live.

767
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,229
But

768
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:28,273
that woman will be my slave for life.

769
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:32,861
If you win…

770
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,784
I will free the woman.

771
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:39,868
But…

772
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:44,957
you will die.

773
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:58,804
Will you choose the path
where you both live

774
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:03,225
or the path where you die?

775
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:05,769
Your Highness.

776
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:07,980
Do you think I cannot kill you?

777
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,027
There is one thing I have not told you.

778
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:19,199
It is about my husband
who did not come to get me.

779
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:23,912
I killed him.

780
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:40,929
You can have a head start.

781
01:16:57,237 --> 01:16:58,572
My lady!

782
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:08,915
My lady!

783
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:13,962
My lady!

784
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,006
My lady!

785
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:18,800
My lady!

786
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:20,969
My lord.

787
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,770
If you meet Jang-hyeon again,
he will suffer greatly.

788
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:36,693
Do not come.

789
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:40,697
My lady!

790
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:46,870
My lady!

791
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:54,002
My lady!

792
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:56,755
My lady!

793
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:02,135
No!

794
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:03,387
Gil-chae!

795
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:12,270
Gil-chae!

796
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:14,064
Gil-chae!

797
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:17,025
Gil-chae!

798
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:19,695
Young Master Jang-hyeon.

799
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:27,869
No!

800
01:18:30,163 --> 01:18:31,790
No. Gil-chae!

801
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:36,461
Gil-chae!

802
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,217
No!

803
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:47,764
No!

804
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:52,144
Gil-chae!

805
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:07,617
No!

806
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:48,158
My lord.

807
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,343
I won.

808
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:12,265
Now, it is over.

809
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:24,569
My lord.

810
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:31,952
My lord.

811
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:35,163
My lord?

812
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:42,462
My lord!

813
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,174
My lord.

814
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,470
My lord!

815
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:06,570
Why

816
01:21:07,904 --> 01:21:10,323
would he risk his life for a mere woman?

817
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,288
Is it Joseon people who are strange,

818
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:18,373
or is it

819
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,167
just this man who is strange?

820
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:50,822
I am scared.

821
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:54,910
Because of that woman…

822
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:01,207
I feel like something
will definitely happen to you.

823
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:07,422
My hunches have never been wrong.

824
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,555
Interpreter Lee…

825
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:17,933
What happened to him?

826
01:22:19,476 --> 01:22:20,894
Is he alive?

827
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:25,148
It was a good experience.

828
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:29,110
For the first time,

829
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:34,074
I learned that there are things
I cannot obtain even if I want them.

830
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,665
What happened to Interpreter Lee?

831
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:58,348
If

832
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:01,059
Interpreter Lee is dead,

833
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:03,520
you will not be safe either.

834
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:09,484
As long as I am alive, I will follow
and curse you wherever you go.

835
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:14,406
And if I die, I will appear
in your dreams and curse you.

836
01:23:16,866 --> 01:23:18,827
So Interpreter Lee had better be alive.

837
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:21,871
Tell me.

838
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:25,000
Tell me where he is!

839
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:38,847
Since I lost the wager,

840
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:41,766
I will release you.

841
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,857
The reason I am keeping my promise

842
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,860
is to obtain Jang-hyeon.

843
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:55,113
Just wait and see.

844
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:58,533
Someday, Lee Jang-hyeon

845
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:00,994
will be mine.

846
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:18,178
Are you Lady Yoo?

847
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,184
Do you know Lee Jang-hyeon?

848
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:29,481
Please follow me.

849
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:47,624
Please go in.

850
01:27:03,009 --> 01:27:04,010
My lady.

851
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:21,819
My lord.

852
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:26,282
I have been released.

853
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:31,037
And I owe it…

854
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:34,791
all to you, my lord.

855
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:02,045
I have always wanted
to hold these hands too.

856
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:03,921
I failed to keep you safe.

857
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:05,214
I am sorry.

858
01:29:05,298 --> 01:29:08,134
Have you decided to return to Joseon?

859
01:29:08,217 --> 01:29:09,802
No. I will not leave.

860
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:11,512
I will help my lord recover.

861
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,265
-My lady.
-My lord.

862
01:29:15,641 --> 01:29:16,476
Oh, dear.

863
01:29:16,559 --> 01:29:18,311
My leg, it hurts so much.

864
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:22,065
Now that you are hurt,
I finally get my turn.

865
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:25,026
I missed seeing you smile like that.

866
01:29:37,121 --> 01:29:42,126
