1
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,067
Was the order given by the crown prince?

2
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,746
My lord.

3
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,129
I hope…

4
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,010
I have not acted embarrassingly.

5
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,601
My lord…

6
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,620
I am sorry.

7
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,750
I am late.

8
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,752
I am truly sorry.

9
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:32,754
My lord.

10
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,131
My lord.

11
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,968
Who are you?

12
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,101
Oh, please do not joke like that.

13
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,687
Why?

14
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,690
Are you afraid
I might lose my memory again?

15
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,485
Don't worry.

16
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,737
It will never happen again.

17
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,073
The physician

18
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:05,745
keeps scaring me, saying that you might
lose your memory forever.

19
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,753
Since you regain your memory
every time you see my face,

20
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,799
I must stay by your side at all times.

21
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,060
By the way, what happened
to the crown prince?

22
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,615
I think someone was reporting…

23
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,787
all of the crown prince's activities
to the king.

24
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,380
Pyo Eon-gyeom…

25
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,217
wants to see you.

26
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,307
I wish to leave the Office of Eunuchs.

27
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,234
Do not think of quitting.

28
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,327
Go and rest for a while.

29
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,953
Why are you giving this to me?

30
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,079
Why?

31
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,498
You deserve to receive it.

32
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,001
We owe it to you.

33
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,050
It is thanks to you that we cut down
traitor Kang's people in advance.

34
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,968
What are you saying?

35
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,939
You have worked hard.

36
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,457
Mother, since sending
your young son to the palace,

37
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,543
you have lived a life of luxury.

38
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,547
It was worth making me a eunuch.

39
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,314
I will keep it that way.

40
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,114
You will never have to worry
about getting by.

41
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,526
You have come.

42
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,902
What did you do?

43
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,912
I drank the same poison

44
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,624
that was given to the crown princess.

45
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,711
The poison was mild,

46
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,465
so the crown princess

47
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,927
suffered for two days and nights.

48
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,108
Do you think
this will atone for your sins?

49
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,866
-I must call a physician.
-It is too late.

50
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,828
It is useless.

51
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,129
Do you remember?

52
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,221
Do you remember when we first met?

53
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,389
Look here.

54
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:41,479
You should fight to win,
not pledge to die honorably.

55
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,357
If you must risk your lives,

56
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,652
should you not risk them
for a battle you can win?

57
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,408
-What are you doing?
-By protecting me,

58
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,910
you are protecting the crown prince.

59
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,249
I knew it at first glance.

60
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,256
I knew…

61
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,970
you would protect me.

62
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,933
Me and…

63
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,478
His Highness…

64
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,819
I knew you would protect us.

65
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,365
And yet you betrayed His Highness?

66
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,535
I thought it was the only way
to save His Highness.

67
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,749
I wanted to let them know

68
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:49,130
how well His Highness was doing
in the face of the Qing emperor.

69
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,511
I wanted them to know…

70
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,266
how much he cared for the captives.

71
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,940
I was deceived.

72
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,447
They deceived me.

73
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,243
They deceived me.

74
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,981
His Highness's body…

75
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,362
Black liquid flowed

76
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,531
from every orifice of his body.

77
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,080
Please make sure to avenge his grievances.

78
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,709
His Highness

79
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,130
left a letter for you.

80
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:58,968
Your Majesty,
how is your illness these days?

81
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,387
The symptoms have already improved.

82
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,475
Since even you do not believe
the traitors are guilty,

83
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,686
you have angered His Majesty.

84
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,356
Consider it fortunate that,
thanks to Jin-saeng's report,

85
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,442
the traitors' crimes
have been revealed to all,

86
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,777
and His Majesty's presence
has been preserved!

87
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,371
How is the mood among the palace people?

88
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,083
Do not worry
about the mood of the palace people.

89
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,878
They just gossip about nonsense,

90
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,506
like how the traitor, Kang,
had a secret baby,

91
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,175
or about how she left a will,

92
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,386
or how the crown prince
left a letter before he died…

93
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,347
A letter?

94
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,852
There are rumors that the crown prince
wrote a letter before he died,

95
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,146
but no one has seen it,
so it is just a rumor--

96
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,230
Find the letter.

97
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,486
Find the letter right now!

98
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,076
The crown prince must have

99
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,830
written a letter to draw in the Qing.

100
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,752
What should I do about this?

101
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,259
Search.

102
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,427
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

103
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,313
Search thoroughly.

104
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:55,084
You are the interpreters who served
the late crown prince closely in Shenyang?

105
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,504
Fine.

106
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,174
Did you send a letter
from the crown prince to the Qing?

107
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,887
We have never seen or heard of any letter.

108
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,972
Did the letter

109
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,850
perhaps go to Gu Yang-cheon?

110
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,111
He is the leader of the traitors.

111
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,905
Do not say you do not know him.

112
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,493
-If you do not tell the truth, I will--
-That man

113
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,412
is not Gu Yang-cheon.

114
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,584
That man is…

115
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,646
So, please,

116
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,482
store it preciously.

117
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,804
Jang-hyeon, read this.

118
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,077
Do you live here?

119
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,538
You…

120
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,625
Why did I come?

121
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,753
I came to take Lee Jang-hyeon.

122
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,095
How is the mood among the nobles?

123
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,389
Do not worry.

124
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,976
Since Jin-saeng's report,
everyone has quietened down.

125
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:23,649
Have you dealt with the traitors
we confined in the palace prison?

126
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,028
Yes, Your Majesty.

127
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,907
We killed them all
by smashing their heads, but…

128
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,876
Please kill me.

129
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,255
We smashed all their heads,
but one body has disappeared…

130
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,339
What?

131
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,300
Whose body has disappeared?

132
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,219
It is

133
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,596
Gu Yang-cheon's body…

134
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,435
Is Gu Yang-cheon
not the leader of the traitors?

135
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,186
No.

136
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,189
That man was not Gu Yang-cheon.

137
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,151
The leader of the traitors
imprisoned in the palace prison

138
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,862
was actually the interpreter
Lee Jang-hyeon.

139
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:12,948
An interpreter?

140
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,617
See?

141
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,663
I said the interpreters would be
closely tied to the traitors, did I not?

142
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,666
So,

143
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,752
what happened to that man?

144
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,088
Is he dead or alive?

145
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,931
I know they are purging
the crown prince's people.

146
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:44,229
Despite how hard I tried, I could not find
any trace of Lee Jang-hyeon.

147
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,233
I hope

148
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,278
nothing has gone wrong?

149
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,158
Is he alive?

150
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,792
He is alive.

151
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,135
I will take Lee Jang-hyeon with me.

152
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,429
Where is he?

153
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,606
Where is he?

154
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,575
Then,

155
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,538
can you help him?

156
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,044
Please help him.

157
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,146
Tell the king of Joseon

158
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,025
the Qing envoy will arrive soon.

159
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,862
Also…

160
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,372
He said he entrusted the letter

161
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,625
to the one who saved
the crown prince's son.

162
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,516
Gu Yang-cheon.

163
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,685
No.

164
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,062
Interpreter Lee Jang-hyeon!

165
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,867
Tell His Majesty it is an urgent matter.

166
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,536
He is currently hearing
about another urgent matter.

167
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,164
But do not worry.

168
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,542
The palace prison workers have caught
Interpreter Lee Jang-hyeon.

169
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,837
I ordered them to kill him immediately
to prevent future troubles…

170
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,923
Your Majesty!

171
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,595
Your Majesty,
you must not kill Lee Jang-hyeon!

172
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,140
Is he dead?

173
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,476
I said, is he dead?

174
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,652
Kill him.

175
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,112
Stop!

176
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:40,906
Stop!

177
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,324
Stop.

178
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,870
Stop it.

179
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,755
A Qing envoy is suddenly coming.

180
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:00,509
But the Qing insist that only
Lee Jang-hyeon acts as their interpreter.

181
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,601
Interpreter Lee Jang-hyeon

182
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,895
has brought in the Qing?

183
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,484
I thought it strange that an envoy
would come unexpectedly.

184
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,362
It turns out Interpreter Lee is behind it.

185
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,449
Jung Myeong-su has tried
to profit off both countries before,

186
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,618
but he has never brought in Qing envoys.

187
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,080
Are you certain?

188
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,749
Is it not just a rumor?

189
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:37,212
The Qing envoy insisted that
Lee Jang-hyeon must be the interpreter.

190
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,299
It seems Interpreter Lee
became close with the barbarians

191
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,301
while serving
the crown prince in Shenyang,

192
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,929
and now he intends to bleed Joseon dry
by using their power.

193
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,103
Interpreter Lee must have his reasons.

194
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,855
Reasons? What reasons?

195
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,275
I see now that Lee Jang-hyeon
is worse than women.

196
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,362
Even powerless women took
their own lives to maintain their honor

197
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,489
after coming into contact
with the barbarians.

198
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,245
Do you think

199
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,790
women should kill themselves

200
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,335
if a barbarian merely grabs their wrist?

201
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,088
It is not that they should,

202
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,759
but that is how Joseon has been preserved.

203
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:28,096
Just one drop of black ink
can turn clear water dirty.

204
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,647
But

205
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:42,444
what if only their wrist was grabbed
and nothing else happened?

206
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,907
That is not what matters.

207
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,744
Whether their wrist was grabbed

208
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,163
or they suffered something worse,

209
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,957
their chastity has been
compromised all the same.

210
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:01,963
Then,

211
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,510
do you think that by returning,

212
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,471
Gil-chae has also turned

213
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,015
clear waters dirty?

214
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,684
How could I think that?

215
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,646
I am glad

216
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,441
that Lady Yoo has returned alive, too.

217
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,320
I am grateful she is living bravely.

218
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,155
But

219
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,783
I also understand

220
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,910
Officer Gu's choice.

221
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:41,211
But have you not always pitied
the people for how they have suffered

222
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,964
at the hands of the barbarians?

223
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,091
Just because I pity the people

224
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,802
does not mean women
can forget their virtue.

225
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,179
In fact, at times like these,

226
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,431
servants should be more loyal,

227
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,559
and women should
preserve their virtue even more.

228
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,688
That is how order can be
established in this chaotic country

229
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,731
and the people can find peace.

230
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,695
Officer Gu is a man
who works for the country,

231
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,947
and to rule the world,

232
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,742
one must start
by ruling one's own household.

233
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,203
It is for this reason

234
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:20,417
that truly virtuous Joseon women,
even if just their wrist was grabbed…

235
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,045
My lady.

236
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,470
Bring in Interpreter Lee Jang-hyeon.

237
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,987
Your Majesty!

238
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,406
What is your true identity?

239
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,993
Speak.

240
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,621
What is your true identity?

241
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,415
I am an interpreter.

242
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:06,171
The Qing made an earnest request
for a mere interpreter?

243
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,758
I am not just a simple interpreter.

244
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,768
I am an interpreter whom the crown prince…

245
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,064
cherished greatly.

246
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,452
Your Majesty, the Qing envoy
has entered the capital.

247
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:44,125
The emperor is curious about
Crown Prince Sohyeon's three children.

248
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,295
He is asking about the well-being
of the crown prince's three children.

249
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:52,008
I do not know how the Great Country
deals with children of traitors,

250
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,972
but I do not think this is
a matter of concern for the Great Country.

251
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,109
Children of traitors, you say?

252
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,488
Did the crown princess

253
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,157
truly plot treason?

254
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:20,328
Is there evidence
that the crown princess plotted treason?

255
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,793
He asks…

256
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,839
if there is evidence

257
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,717
that the crown princess…

258
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,387
became a traitor.

259
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,450
I encountered barbarians while fleeing.

260
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,787
But when I was about to be
assaulted by a barbarian,

261
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,206
Gil-chae helped me…

262
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,046
You encountered…

263
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,049
barbarians?

264
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,313
I guess Jung Myeong-su is gone
and Lee Jang-hyeon has taken over.

265
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,399
Are you going to just watch?

266
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,403
No.

267
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,450
We cannot let one drop
of black ink turn clear water dirty.

268
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:45,080
HANYANG GRILL

269
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,793
You are about to try the tastiest meat.

270
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,051
See how the grease glistens?

271
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,394
Traditionally,

272
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,021
meat should be grilled over charcoal.

273
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,337
Not bad.

274
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,926
How dare you bring in barbarians…

275
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,444
Are you trying to change your fortune
like Jung Myeong-su?

276
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:45,450
Do you want to enjoy power like a king
by relying on the Qing?

277
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,748
If I could…

278
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,378
I have known for a long time

279
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,381
that you have secretly looked down on me.

280
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,843
Still, I did not dislike you.

281
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,180
Although our paths were different…

282
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,309
I believed both of us
cared for the people.

283
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,729
But to bring in barbarians?

284
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,900
Do you know?

285
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:23,655
Some people live not for food
but for a purpose.

286
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:28,409
Those people keep the world
from turning into a den of beasts.

287
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,580
Those who die
to preserve loyalty and virtue

288
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,582
prove that the world

289
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,836
does not belong just to the powerful.

290
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,634
I will dedicate my soul to purifying this
land that has been stained by barbarians.

291
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,511
So,

292
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,931
if you become like Jung Myeong-su
and oppress Joseon,

293
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,601
I will sweep our history under the rug

294
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,104
and make sure

295
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,897
to uproot you

296
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,942
from this land.

297
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,456
All else aside,
your love for this country…

298
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,503
is pitifully genuine.

299
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,296
Do you perhaps have

300
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,882
the crown prince's letter?

301
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,518
I want to keep my promise
to those who believed in me.

302
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,313
Please bring the captives…

303
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,818
back to Joseon.

304
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,156
If I cannot keep this promise,

305
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,326
I cannot call myself
a crown prince, a man,

306
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,995
or even a human being.

307
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,583
Even if something happens to me

308
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,461
and I cannot act as a crown prince
or become a king,

309
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,923
please help me

310
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,258
to retain my humanity.

311
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,971
You are the only one

312
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,473
I can entrust with this task.

313
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,040
I offer all of my wealth

314
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,836
and the crown princess's wealth to you.

315
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,090
However,

316
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,510
as we agreed before…

317
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,097
all the captives must have

318
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,558
release papers

319
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,562
approved by the Qing Ministry of Revenue.

320
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,815
Also,

321
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,527
the captives will not cross the river

322
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,655
but will enter Joseon

323
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,241
with their heads held high

324
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,660
by land.

325
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,913
If you can

326
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,416
guarantee this,

327
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,252
I will hand over this silver.

328
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,724
No one in Qing can raise any issues

329
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,269
about the Joseon captives
we shall send back today.

330
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,649
I guarantee it.

331
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,073
I guarantee it.

332
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,950
Yes, Your Highness.

333
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,529
Now, we are going to Joseon!

334
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,699
We are finally free!

335
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,410
Yes!

336
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,204
We are going!

337
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,298
We are really going home.

338
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,693
We are going back.

339
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,617
Your Highness.

340
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,662
Let us go, Lee Jang-hyeon.

341
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:35,461
While I still have power,
I will take you away from Joseon.

342
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,722
I must go to my homeland too.

343
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,187
Are you no better than a man

344
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,231
who does not even keep his word?

345
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,608
That is right.

346
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,861
I am no better than that.

347
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,829
And as a man who is no better…

348
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,297
I want to go home alive.

349
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,013
If you go to Joseon…

350
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,224
you will die.

351
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,356
You will die.

352
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,947
Is it because of that woman?

353
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,383
That woman…

354
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,888
is my homeland.

355
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,393
Now…

356
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,652
I want to go home and rest in peace.

357
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,202
Either come with me

358
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,871
or die here.

359
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,998
Those are your only choices.

360
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:41,170
You will die if you go to Joseon anyway.

361
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:47,760
My lord,

362
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,805
now I understand.

363
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:55,810
I know how you feel about me,

364
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,355
and I know how deep

365
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,358
my love runs for you.

366
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,569
My lord.

367
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,364
Our intense love will bind us together

368
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,325
even when we are apart.

369
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,663
As long as I can keep you alive,

370
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,416
my heart will be glad

371
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,544
even if you are far away.

372
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,217
Two Joseon interpreters
have already been beaten to death.

373
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,970
So, my lord,

374
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,098
please stay in Qing and…

375
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:47,862
No.

376
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,158
I miss you.

377
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,662
I miss you…

378
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,900
Then, I guess I must die
trying to get back.

379
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,390
Forgive me.

380
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:22,873
Go.

381
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,173
Go before I change my mind.

382
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,857
Your Highness.

383
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,197
I hope you live a peaceful life.

384
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,266
Farewell,

385
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,852
you useful bastard.

386
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,044
Gil-chae,

387
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:51,712
your husband is coming.

388
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:55,049
-Usimjeong in Uiju?
-That is what I heard.

389
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,843
The captives are flooding in.

390
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,804
The soldiers are
patrolling the area daily.

391
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,600
Apparently, some of the captives
plan to avenge the crown prince.

392
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:07,936
By the way, is it true
that the crown prince was poisoned?

393
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,647
Watch your mouth.

394
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,983
I wonder if this will
cause trouble in the village.

395
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,985
Let's hurry along.

396
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:33,087
UIJU

397
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:39,802
How?

398
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,472
I thought you weren't able to come.

399
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,643
I said I would return.

400
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,146
Big Brother!

401
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:54,858
Jang-hyeon!

402
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,242
Lee Jang-hyeon.

403
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:13,419
You are here now.
That is all that matters.

404
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:16,505
Have you been well?

405
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:24,096
By the way,
they say the crown prince was poisoned.

406
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,681
Is that true?

407
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,101
Lady Jo used a poisoned needle…

408
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,728
That is not what I heard.
It was His Majesty who--

409
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,355
Wait.

410
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,025
Since we are indebted to the crown prince,

411
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,820
should we not avenge him?

412
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:45,451
I am old now and have no regrets,
so I will do anything you ask.

413
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,579
Forget about the crown prince.

414
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,040
But he was our savior.

415
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,460
Whether the crown prince
was poisoned or not,

416
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,503
do not wonder about it…

417
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,674
or think about revenge.

418
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,638
I beg you.

419
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,849
That is what

420
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,519
the crown prince would want.

421
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:22,154
Captives who have heard the rumors
keep coming by crossing the river.

422
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,449
After all, there are
thousands of captives.

423
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,494
Due to the growing number of people,

424
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,706
the Uiju government office
keeps sending people to patrol.

425
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:37,961
They are worried something
might happen again like last time.

426
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,046
Like last time?

427
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:40,797
What happened?

428
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,800
This is Uiju! I am Gu Yang-cheon of Uiju!

429
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,010
Yang-cheon.

430
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,348
We must not cause any disturbances.

431
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:52,893
I will

432
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,646
take care of this.

433
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:12,871
Is it tasty?

434
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,583
I am all right.

435
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:23,840
Here you go.

436
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,638
Eat.

437
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:35,769
Jong-jong.

438
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:38,647
Gu-jam…

439
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,401
Gu-jam!

440
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,793
My lady.

441
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,337
I take it Lord Lee…

442
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,466
went to Qing?

443
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,178
That must be why you came alone.

444
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:13,724
No, Jang-hyeon will be here soon.

445
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,225
He told me to come here first.

446
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,770
I brought a letter from Jang-hyeon.

447
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,234
Also…

448
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,573
Come in.

449
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:07,110
I could not return right away,
so I am sending this letter first.

450
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,282
The captives who are now at Usimjeong

451
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,910
are people with nowhere to go

452
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,996
and no family to receive them.

453
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:23,001
If even I turn my back on them,
their future is bleak,

454
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,671
so I must stay to settle things.

455
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,756
I hope you understand.

456
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,844
When I fall asleep
after much tossing and turning,

457
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,723
I think I dream of you.

458
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,937
I wish I could remember the dreams,

459
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,023
but when I wake from my light sleep,

460
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,609
all that comes to my mind

461
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:51,238
is your name, Yoo Gil-chae.

462
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,866
Do you know how it feels for me…

463
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,412
to be so lost in thoughts of you

464
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:02,749
that I cannot distinguish
if I am asleep or awake?

465
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,825
My lady, more people are here!

466
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,583
Come in.

467
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,753
Go inside.
I have cleaned the place thoroughly.

468
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,842
My lady, you seem excited.

469
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:59,473
If I take good care of these people,
my lord will come soon, right?

470
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,850
So, you do well too.

471
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,228
Now, Lee Jang-hyeon is

472
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,397
completely mine.

473
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,610
Come on in.

474
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,451
You…

475
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:42,682
I asked Interpreter Lee for help,
as you told me to,

476
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,060
and he helped me get ransomed.

477
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,605
Well done.

478
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,732
Well done!

479
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:52,651
Is…

480
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,320
Is Da-jim…

481
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,951
A square,

482
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:05,747
and then a slanted triangle.

483
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:09,918
It is the longest square in the world.

484
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,674
Da-jim.

485
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,262
My son.

486
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,348
You have grown so much.

487
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:32,232
Da-jim.

488
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:33,984
Da-jim.

489
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,152
It is your mother.

490
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,821
I told you.

491
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,323
Your mother

492
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,618
never forgot you, Da-jim.

493
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:48,331
You are my mother?

494
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,586
Yes, I am your mother.

495
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,755
-I am your mother.
-Mother.

496
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,216
-My son.
-Mother.

497
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,596
Mother…

498
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,062
It seems it will not be easy.

499
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,274
Baedan-ri must be full by now too.

500
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,612
We must find a place, and we will.

501
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,489
It has been a while.

502
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,160
You, me, and Gu-jam used to travel

503
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,455
all over the eight provinces
and see all kinds of people.

504
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,084
That is true. It has been a while.

505
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,670
It has been a while,

506
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,214
and it will be the last time.

507
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,134
What do you mean?

508
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,719
I am tired of this now.

509
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,180
I cannot hang around you forever.

510
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:50,018
By the way,
the people here are not very kind.

511
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,437
In Neunggun-ri,

512
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:56,107
we even threw Old Man Song-chu
a 60th wedding anniversary party.

513
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,486
Come to think of it,
the elders in Neunggun-ri…

514
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:05,909
They say etiquette comes from the heart.

515
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,714
You must be tired.

516
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,508
Yes.

517
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,479
Husband.

518
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,943
When I was fleeing,

519
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,363
I almost got raped by barbarians.

520
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:53,206
But Gil-chae stabbed and killed
the barbarian, saving me from harm.

521
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,751
Do you still think

522
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,172
my virtue has been compromised…

523
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,677
because a barbarian grabbed my shoulder?

524
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,804
You are a person
who has never deceived me.

525
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,142
But you hid for a long time

526
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:57,729
the fact that you were
caught by barbarians.

527
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,441
This is

528
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,904
the terrible stain the barbarians
have left on the Joseon land.

529
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,533
Would you deny it?

530
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,643
Will he not return today, either?

531
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,297
Husband!

532
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,017
Did you just call me your husband?

533
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,729
Yes, my husband.

534
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:28,903
Good.

535
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,781
Let us now become husband and wife.

536
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,587
-How pretty!
-So handsome.

537
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,590
So pretty!

538
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,675
What a pretty bride!

539
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:09,295
On a day like today, we must drink a lot.

540
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,465
This is nice.

541
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,765
Let us have one more drink.

542
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,477
It is a good day. Let us drink a lot!

543
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:25,520
Yes.

544
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,735
Jong-jong and Gu-jam look happy.

545
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,284
They look

546
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,328
so happy together.

547
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:46,291
So, I was thinking, we should also…

548
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:48,918
I am not sure.

549
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,879
I have already been married once, so…

550
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:58,428
You said it before, did you not?

551
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:03,224
What need is there to be bound
by the formality of marriage?

552
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,729
Did you not say it was enough
just to live together while enjoying

553
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,439
passionate relations?

554
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:13,943
We are already passionate,
so there is no need…

555
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:17,071
I did say that.

556
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,992
Yes, I did.

557
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,536
That is right.

558
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:28,708
I was taken aback then,
but you were completely right.

559
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,210
I also no longer

560
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,505
care for conventional things.

561
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,175
Conventional things…

562
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:39,802
I do not care for them either.

563
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,515
I am not a conventional man.
I am not conventional at all.

564
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,985
Give me your ring.

565
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:02,867
Why did you give me this ring
just to take it back?

566
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:05,828
Here it is.

567
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:25,098
I should engrave these with a nice phrase.

568
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,563
In that unconventional way…

569
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,150
I will do it.

570
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,528
I will propose.

571
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,206
Please marry me.

572
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,294
I will make you…

573
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:01,634
the happiest man in the world.

574
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,515
Let us go to Neunggun-ri.

575
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,437
Let us live there from now on.

576
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,775
Let us live like rocks…

577
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,781
and like grass.

578
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:08,951
Let us live simple…

579
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,163
trivial lives.

580
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,249
Just the two of us.

581
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:28,948
I will tell you about Lee Jang-hyeon.

582
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:32,827
-Arrest those disrupting the peace.
-Jang-hyeon, soldiers are coming.

583
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,787
I will come back for you. Wait here.

584
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,539
Help Interpreter Lee.

585
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:37,957
They will die if captured.

586
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,667
Get him!

587
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,460
Please let them live.

588
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,713
We will live as if we do not exist.

589
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:45,965
Those leading the traitors
were eliminated,

590
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,425
destroying any trace of them.

591
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:48,801
This is it.

592
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,344
This is Neunggun-ri.

593
01:04:50,428 --> 01:04:51,929
What about your husband-to-be?

594
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,681
He will come soon.

595
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:55,099
He promised he would come.

596
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:11,532
