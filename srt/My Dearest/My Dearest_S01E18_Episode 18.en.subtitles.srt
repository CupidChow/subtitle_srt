1
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,953
Was there ever a time you hated me?

2
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,416
The day you left me forever.

3
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,504
I looked at you for a while
with a burning hatred.

4
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,964
But no matter how much I looked,

5
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,050
I could not make myself hate you.

6
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,802
Instead, I hated myself.

7
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,679
You cruel person.

8
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,017
Did you ever realize my feelings?

9
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,105
I did not realize then.

10
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,858
I merely felt

11
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,321
my heart breaking
into thousands of pieces,

12
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,533
and I just wished desperately

13
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,452
that you would not feel the same way.

14
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,532
You do not look well.

15
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,326
The journey back must have been rough.

16
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,995
No, Father.

17
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,621
It is true

18
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:47,292
that I grew more ill on my way here,
so I had to stop and rest.

19
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,419
But I am gradually
feeling like myself again.

20
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,087
Please do not worry.

21
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,297
That is as it should be.

22
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,009
Now that the hardship is over,
you should regain your health.

23
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,891
Your Majesty.

24
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,059
I have something to say.

25
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,733
There are some prisoners
in Shenyang whom I freed

26
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,277
but could not bring with me
this time as it was cumbersome.

27
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,030
Should you permit it…

28
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,076
Do you know

29
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,164
who the traitor Sim Gi-won
first wanted to serve as king?

30
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,294
It was you.

31
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,844
I was not aware of that.

32
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,971
I did not know.

33
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,181
Of course.

34
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,600
I trust you, my son.

35
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,435
However,

36
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:52,190
I hear that you accumulated wealth
while farming in Shenyang.

37
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,901
Did you spend that money
on freeing prisoners?

38
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,986
For what purpose did you purchase them?

39
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,741
The prisoners were hired
to farm and run errands.

40
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:06,204
But rather than seeing them as workers,
I pitied their situation and…

41
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,123
You pitied them? Was that it?

42
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,007
Following his decision to rebel,
Sim Gi-won's first action

43
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,676
was to form his army.

44
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:24,681
He gathered the strong
and trained them daily.

45
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,268
Their loyalty was bought
through generous payments.

46
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:34,148
You must have won over
the prisoners by freeing them.

47
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,490
If you do not want any misunderstandings,

48
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,743
you will stop bringing back prisoners.

49
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,293
The crown prince's illness is severe.

50
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,087
Prepare to escort him to the hot spring.

51
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,216
Yes, Your Majesty.

52
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,810
Will you not be placing

53
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,855
floral shoes on my feet today?

54
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,195
I threw them all away out of spite.

55
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,048
There is a task…

56
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,176
I must complete.

57
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,307
It is a promise I made to Big Brother.

58
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,273
It will take about a month,
but I will return.

59
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,508
I had these made
at the smithy a while ago.

60
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,637
Even though I thought you had died,

61
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,682
I made them…

62
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,519
and kept them on me.

63
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,070
This ring

64
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,531
has a curse placed on it.

65
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,784
Should you betray the woman
who gave this to you,

66
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,536
you will suffer from palsy.

67
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,627
What?

68
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,673
So, do not worry about me.

69
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,304
I managed to withstand the days
you were in Shenyang.

70
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,805
So, a mere month?

71
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,267
I can wait that long
with a smile on my face.

72
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,525
ONYANG TEMPORARY PALACE

73
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,284
We are all set
to bring home the prisoners.

74
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,870
-I will inform the crown prince myself--
-Never…

75
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,834
speak of the prisoners to him again.

76
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,423
What are you saying?

77
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,845
When he returned to Joseon, he promised…

78
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,600
I will talk to him in person.

79
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,393
His Royal Highness…

80
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,897
does not wish to see you.

81
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,533
Your Royal Highness.

82
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,287
Have you forgotten your promise?

83
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,833
You promised…

84
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,672
to bring the prisoners home to Joseon.

85
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,052
That promise has kept them going.

86
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,541
Your Highness.

87
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,464
I remember very well…

88
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,012
the promise that you have forgotten.

89
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,224
Now…

90
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,896
I am off to keep that promise.

91
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,984
You have been told not to do it.

92
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,704
You dare to defy me?

93
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,584
Then, I will never see you again.

94
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,510
That is…

95
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,390
what I was about to say to you.

96
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,231
I will forever dismiss myself
from your presence.

97
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,284
Stop.

98
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,120
Lee Jang-hyeon, stop!

99
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,258
Do not rush.

100
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,970
Move slowly.

101
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,348
Be careful.

102
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,607
Let me take the baby.

103
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,755
If you wish…

104
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,551
I will stay by Your Highness' side.

105
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,261
But

106
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:30,100
please grant the captives safe passage
across the river.

107
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,394
Should you grant that,

108
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,065
I will help the prisoners
return safely to Joseon

109
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,443
and then come back to you.

110
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,863
How can I trust you?

111
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,993
You already have hundreds of hostages.

112
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,204
If you break your promise…

113
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:56,210
I will actually kill you this time.

114
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,344
The prisoners have been sent.

115
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,430
Now, Lee Jang-hyeon,

116
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,768
it is time for you to return to me.

117
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,693
Here they come.

118
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,666
Hurry, but watch your step.

119
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,042
All right. We are here.

120
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,127
Careful.

121
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,757
Gu-jam!

122
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:45,926
There you are.

123
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,846
Goodness. Thank you.

124
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,145
I am here.

125
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,065
I am finally home!

126
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,483
Eol-su.

127
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,903
Jeol-su!

128
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,072
We are finally home.

129
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,325
Yes, we are.

130
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,872
Yang-cheon.

131
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,374
Lee Jang-hyeon.

132
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,835
-Yang-cheon.
-Hey.

133
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,256
Hey.

134
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,135
See? What did I tell you?

135
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:32,765
I told you I would
bring you all back to Joseon.

136
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:36,185
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

137
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,812
We are truly grateful!

138
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,980
Thank you so much.

139
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,190
Thank you, Yang-cheon!

140
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,985
What is it?

141
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,153
What is going on?

142
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,031
-Who are they?
-Huddle up.

143
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,000
Who are you?

144
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,713
Identify yourselves!

145
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,258
Who are you?

146
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,470
Bandits?

147
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,433
If it is goods you want,
we have plenty to spare.

148
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,893
Let me take her.

149
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,149
Go back.

150
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,610
Go back, or you will all die.

151
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,237
-Nonsense!
-Go back!

152
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,030
You bastards.

153
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,408
After all that we endured
to finally get here,

154
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,410
who are you to order us around?

155
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,996
Stop!

156
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,540
Kang-dal!

157
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,043
Get them.

158
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,561
Retreat!

159
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,396
Go back across the river.

160
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,439
Do not go.

161
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,150
No, I cannot go back. I will not.

162
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,693
-I will not go back.
-Eol-su.

163
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,945
But you will die!

164
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,496
We trusted you and the crown prince,

165
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,249
but you fooled us all.

166
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,334
No.

167
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,465
You are mistaken.

168
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,842
-Let go!
-Let us get going.

169
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,969
-Come on.
-No, I will not go.

170
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,971
-Hurry back.
-Move!

171
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,639
Hurry. Go back.

172
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,899
-Hurry.
-Go on.

173
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,818
Hurry.

174
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,541
In-ok!

175
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,710
Hurry. Hurry back!

176
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,630
We must go.

177
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,132
Come on.

178
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,229
My baby. No…

179
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,611
We must go. On your feet!

180
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,113
Get up!

181
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,494
Get up already.

182
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,079
Get going.

183
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,169
Yang-cheon!

184
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,608
Big Brother!

185
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,237
Get Big Brother to safety! Now!

186
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,439
Jang-hyeon!

187
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,061
Yang-cheon.

188
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,247
Lee Jang-hyeon.

189
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,332
Where is he?

190
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,392
Jang-hyeon--

191
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,940
Ningqujin?

192
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,154
Go around the back.

193
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,032
I will have a horse ready for you.

194
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,847
Dae-ho? Get up.

195
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,307
Dae-ho!

196
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,101
Oh, no.

197
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:40,942
If you are lying to me,
I will pull out your tongue.

198
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,821
Is what you are seeing not enough proof?

199
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,618
We were attacked by men
who forced us back across the river.

200
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,581
We managed to get back, but Jang-hyeon…

201
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,170
I don't even know
whether he survived or not.

202
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,465
What do you mean?

203
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,218
If he were alive, why would he
not have come back by now?

204
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,096
He must be…

205
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,064
No.

206
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,442
No.

207
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,626
On whose authority did you plot treason?

208
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,795
PALACE PRISON: CONFINES
MEMBERS OF THE PALACE

209
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,465
Was the order given by the crown prince?

210
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,309
Last month, on the 25th,
between midnight and 2:00 a.m.,

211
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:38,727
screaming was heard.

212
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,771
Armed slaves of the Palace Treasury Office

213
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,024
made their way
to the outskirts of the castle.

214
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,868
Master.

215
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,585
I have received more news from my source.

216
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,505
Servants of the Palace Treasury Office
brought in about a dozen prisoners.

217
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,800
Servants of the Palace Treasury Office?
On what charges?

218
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,636
I cannot be sure,

219
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,555
but His Majesty is accusing
the captives who crossed the river

220
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,891
of plotting treason.

221
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,520
How could he think the captives
are plotting treason?

222
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,624
Gather up

223
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,876
the scholars.

224
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,422
I will make my way to His Majesty.

225
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:54,761
If they truly are guilty
of plotting treason,

226
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,516
they should be punished according to law
by the Office of Justice.

227
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,310
DEPARTMENT RESPONSIBLE
FOR INTERROGATING FELONS

228
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,187
However,

229
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,607
if they are not guilty in any way…

230
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:13,071
I will save them no matter what.

231
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:22,539
Who instigated you to plot treason?

232
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,680
You tell us.

233
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,103
Where are we?

234
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,153
Who put you up to this?

235
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,338
Are you Gu Yang-cheon?

236
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,051
I am aware that your
head of crime is Gu Yang-cheon.

237
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,221
No.

238
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,349
This man is…

239
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:30,523
If you are not Gu Yang-cheon,
then which one of you is?

240
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,902
Is it you?

241
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,904
Please spare my life!

242
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,323
-Is it you?
-No, it is not me!

243
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,159
It is me.

244
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,792
I am Gu Yang-cheon.

245
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,380
So, you will talk to me.

246
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,013
This man is the one…

247
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:05,392
who helped us to escape…

248
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,438
and aided us across the river.

249
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,195
It is him.

250
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:24,452
Leave him and drag out the rest.

251
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,745
Yes, sir.

252
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,956
-No!
-Do not kill me!

253
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,416
Please spare my life.

254
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,251
Please do not kill me.

255
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,397
Yang-cheon.

256
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,566
Are you waking up?

257
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,244
How is everyone?

258
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,132
You betrayed us.

259
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,101
You sold us out.

260
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,730
To them.

261
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,066
You colluded with them

262
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,485
and…

263
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,324
My Byeong-hui.

264
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,244
Bring her back.

265
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,331
My daughter.

266
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,796
Byeong-hui…

267
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,634
Bring my daughter Byeong-hui back to life!

268
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,720
Bring her back to life!

269
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:52,141
-Bring her back to life!
-In-ok, please.

270
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,854
My poor Byeong-hui.

271
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,107
Bring her back!

272
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,485
Your Royal Highness!

273
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,280
Do you remember me, Your Royal Highness?

274
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,202
They killed the prisoners
who crossed the river

275
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,414
and dragged away those who survived?

276
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,458
Where?

277
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,670
Where were they taken?

278
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,505
I do not know.

279
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,552
There's no way of knowing
where Lee Jang-hyeon was taken.

280
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,515
Please save him.

281
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,894
Please save Lee Jang-hyeon.

282
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,940
Father…

283
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,112
Father!

284
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,586
Let us head to the palace.

285
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,631
Highness.

286
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,591
Highness!

287
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,303
Highness.

288
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,391
Those who are after you
are waiting for you to make a wrong move.

289
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,186
Please…

290
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,774
do not infuriate His Majesty any further.

291
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,529
Save yourself.

292
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,908
And our son.

293
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,047
Let us go.

294
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,564
I will go with him.

295
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,027
Prepare to leave.

296
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,195
Yes, Your Highness.

297
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,491
Why is it that you formed a private army?

298
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:19,956
They…

299
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,376
are not private soldiers.

300
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,212
They are prisoners.

301
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,215
All I did…

302
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,220
was bring prisoners back to Joseon.

303
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,140
Whose orders were you operating on?

304
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,939
No one gave me any orders.

305
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,818
I acted…

306
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,488
on my own to bring home

307
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,991
the freed prisoners.

308
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,798
Jong-jong…

309
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,927
likes me.

310
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,222
She likes me not.

311
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,393
She likes me.

312
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,446
Jang-hyeon, damn it.

313
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,293
My baby.

314
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,388
Let go. Let go of me!

315
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,694
What is this?

316
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,616
Then, you and Interpreter Lee…

317
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,582
I am happy for you.

318
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,958
I truly am.

319
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:12,253
I knew this day would come.

320
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,300
Why would you cry?

321
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,260
I am happy for her, that is why.

322
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:23,764
If only you had slept with him sooner
and saved yourself the heartache--

323
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,314
He will return
after finishing a task in Shenyang.

324
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,233
When he returns this time,

325
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,737
he says he will stay with me.

326
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,484
What?

327
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,112
Scholars are marching toward the palace?

328
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:03,823
Who was it?

329
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,908
Who made them take action?

330
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,785
Was it Kim Jib?

331
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,245
Was it Jang Cheol?

332
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,830
Or was it Kim Sang-heon?

333
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,917
Wait.

334
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,379
Are they acting
under the crown prince's orders?

335
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,799
It is Jang Cheol.

336
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,033
You will wait out here.

337
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,702
Please take me with you.

338
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,415
Why has the crown prince
come to His Majesty first?

339
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,127
Could His Majesty

340
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:02,298
be involved in the capture of Jang-hyeon?

341
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,800
I said I would look into it.

342
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,055
You are to wait out here.

343
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,450
The scholars running wild

344
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:34,205
is also due to the cursed objects
that have been hidden in the palace.

345
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,086
Your Highness! Your Highness!
Your Highness!

346
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,721
Lady Jo, you will leave us.

347
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,891
Crown Prince, you are being insolent!

348
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:54,975
This instant!

349
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,807
What did you do…

350
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,060
to the prisoners?

351
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,897
Are you finally showing your true colors?

352
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,274
Your Majesty.

353
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,651
Did you think I would not know

354
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:49,238
you have been bringing in
your private army from Qing?

355
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:50,948
My private army?

356
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,410
Then, what else would you call them?

357
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,581
Weapons were found on them.

358
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,667
They killed the servants
of the Palace Treasury Office.

359
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:06,922
Your Majesty. They are mere prisoners.
They are your people.

360
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,259
What? My people?

361
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,179
Are you saying

362
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,265
that it is just for a few random commoners

363
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:20,394
that you rushed over here
in this cold early morning

364
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,188
despite being so ill?

365
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,358
As if.

366
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:32,156
Are they the men
who will put you on the throne?

367
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,201
Is that why you cherish them?

368
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:39,622
Your Majesty…

369
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,584
Even if everyone else
turned their backs on me,

370
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,796
I believed you would protect me
until the very end.

371
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,175
But my own son

372
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,720
is stabbing me in the back.

373
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:01,602
Are they outside

374
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:05,022
awaiting your order?

375
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:09,026
Are they here to kill me
with swords and maces?

376
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,300
Your Majesty.

377
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:40,641
They are farmers who toiled
in the fields in Shenyang.

378
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:47,314
They are prisoners
who missed their homeland

379
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,735
and sang the songs of Joseon
to fill the void.

380
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,701
They are your people.

381
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,292
Your people who
risked their lives to seek safety.

382
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,212
How can you say…

383
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,758
they are plotting treason?

384
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,511
Please see what I saw.

385
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:04,433
They are the reason
I have grown as a person.

386
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:07,853
I…

387
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,983
smelled the sweat they shed
as they labored

388
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,279
and tasted the tears they shed.

389
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,826
It was a sight sweeter
than any delicacy of the world.

390
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:28,165
It was more beautiful than any silk robe.

391
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,379
You must see it for yourself,
Your Majesty.

392
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,508
Once you do,

393
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,761
you will understand me.

394
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,139
You will want to spare their lives.

395
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,350
Silence!

396
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,103
What kind of nonsense is this?

397
00:44:55,567 --> 00:45:01,281
Being the kindhearted person I am,
I am dealing with the matter discreetly.

398
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,452
For that, you should be grateful.

399
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,906
Your Highness! Your Highness!

400
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,539
Things are moving quickly, so hurry.

401
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:54,168
Have you not heard
from the girl who makes knives?

402
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:59,798
It cannot be anyone else.
It must be her. Do you hear me?

403
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,842
Yes, Your Highness.

404
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,733
I am

405
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:23,322
a sinner who was not able
to protect our people from barbarians.

406
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:27,242
For that, I was too ashamed
to show myself in public.

407
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,077
However,

408
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:33,207
I will no longer spend my days
writing petitions in my room.

409
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,126
That is not the way to save this nation,

410
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,295
nor will it protect the people.

411
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:41,798
Even if

412
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:48,013
His Majesty punishes me by flogging
or the people resent me,

413
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:54,102
I will do what must be done for our nation

414
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,480
and its people.

415
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:06,240
Will you join me?

416
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:08,408
Yes, Master.

417
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,327
We are with you.

418
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,704
We will join you, Master.

419
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,520
A collective appeal?

420
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,525
What is it that they want?

421
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:45,988
They are requesting that the prisoners
be handed over to the Office of Justice.

422
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,295
Bring Jang Cheol to me.

423
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,551
As for the prisoners of the palace…

424
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,122
As for him,

425
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,791
bash him to death.

426
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,711
Yes, sir.

427
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,526
You know,

428
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:53,281
I will make for him
a pillowcase embroidered by my own hands.

429
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,284
To think you once swore
you would never get involved

430
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,577
with that misogamist.

431
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:00,706
Such is life.

432
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,877
Did you not say you would rather be a nun
than marry Bak-dae?

433
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:19,141
The money I have been sending you
must not be enough to care for my father.

434
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:24,563
I am saving up as much as I can,
so I will soon bring him to live with me.

435
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,065
No, I cannot send him away.

436
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:30,360
He is a father to me and my husband too.

437
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:37,617
Once Interpreter Lee comes back,
we will all live happily together.

438
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,495
Let us not think of anything else.

439
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,585
Are you home?

440
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,213
My lady has summoned you.

441
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,760
Why must you persist like this?
I cannot do what you ask.

442
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,679
She is offering three times the amount.

443
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,973
Then, answer me first.

444
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,810
Why are you asking me
to make an item for Lady Jo,

445
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,771
and in secrecy, might I add?

446
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,149
I will not partake in shady business.

447
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,653
Once Prince Sungseon
succeeds the throne, the likes of you…

448
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,697
SUNGSEON: THE SON
OF KING INJO AND LADY JO

449
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:19,576
How can he succeed the throne
when the crown prince has returned?

450
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,412
You must not be aware
of the current situation.

451
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,874
The crown prince is done for.

452
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:30,378
Those he colluded with in Shenyang
have been caught.

453
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,431
What do you mean people
from Shenyang have been caught?

454
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,725
Are you referring

455
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:49,439
to those who were loyal
to the crown prince?

456
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:57,864
I actually heard something
from my husband.

457
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:03,203
Recently, people were dragged
to the palace prison

458
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,330
and are being tortured and killed.

459
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,380
This is the one.

460
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:19,594
Fine engraving.

461
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,722
"Honoring the virtue of the queen."

462
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,225
Are you fond of it?

463
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,020
By the way,

464
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,607
are you sure all those
who came from Shenyang

465
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,942
have been caught?

466
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,238
There must be someone I can rely on.

467
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,825
Did I not tell you to watch your mouth?

468
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:47,414
I guess I could be
the future king's mother.

469
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:53,587
That is why
you will execute my order with precision.

470
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:00,635
Hurry.

471
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,470
Of course.

472
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:13,565
Is there something going on at the palace?

473
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,111
This curiosity of yours
will someday get you killed.

474
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,822
-Are you done?
-Yes.

475
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,868
I am done.

476
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:35,337
Goodness. It reeks even from here.

477
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,881
I know.

478
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,717
To think torture is happening daily
in the palace prison…

479
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,555
You know of the affairs
of the palace prison?

480
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,850
It is common knowledge
to those in the know.

481
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,313
I hope this all ends soon.

482
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,024
You may go now.

483
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,349
Your Majesty.

484
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:16,438
I have long-awaited
the moment we would finally meet.

485
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,939
Finally, that time has come.

486
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:22,569
Your humble subject
should have requested an audience sooner.

487
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:26,322
So, why are you here
over a matter this frivolous?

488
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:32,829
May I ask why you are killing your people
over a matter that is frivolous?

489
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:38,001
Are you not interrogating the prisoners
here since it is a frivolous matter?

490
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,628
If they are truly traitors,

491
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:45,508
they should be interrogated
for their crimes by the Office of Justice.

492
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,762
There is a reason they cannot be sent
to the Office of Justice.

493
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,432
So return home with your scholars.

494
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:56,895
If you do not comply, I will have
the palace guards dissolve the gathering.

495
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:00,523
Do you wish for your pupils to be harmed?

496
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,693
If my pupils are harmed,

497
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:08,740
scholars across the nation
will rise up in arms.

498
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:12,118
Have you forgotten how Gwanghaegun

499
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:16,372
lost the favor of the scholars
and then the world?

500
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,625
Your Majesty.

501
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:22,504
This is the nation you protected
from Gwanghaegun.

502
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:27,342
Joseon is a nation where the people serve
those above them with loyalty and virtue.

503
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:33,014
And the king whom they serve
is loyal to his people.

504
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:40,063
However, by discreetly killing your own
people, you are betraying their loyalty.

505
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,690
You have been upsetting the heavens.

506
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:49,823
Until Your Majesty sends the prisoners
to the Office of Justice,

507
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:55,620
I will not move a single inch.

508
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,623
Drag him out of here!

509
00:56:58,706 --> 00:56:59,791
Your Majesty.

510
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:05,046
Please move the prisoners here
to the Office of Justice!

511
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,923
Your Majesty.

512
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,426
Do not betray your duty of loyalty!

513
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,806
Please do not upset the heavens,
Your Majesty!

514
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,308
Your Majesty!

515
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,728
Please move the prisoners here
to the Office of Justice!

516
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:21,813
How dare you?

517
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,356
Let go of him.

518
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,691
-Let go!
-Let go!

519
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:28,445
You must not betray your duty of loyalty!

520
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,405
-Let go of him!
-Your Majesty!

521
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:33,908
Please do not upset the heavens!

522
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,952
Your Majesty!

523
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:42,208
Please move the prisoners here
to the Office of Justice!

524
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:47,088
Please do not betray your duty of loyalty!

525
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,466
Your Majesty!

526
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:55,013
Please move the prisoners here
to the Office of Justice!

527
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:59,684
Please do not betray their loyalty!

528
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,577
Do not cry.

529
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:24,584
Your sister
took her own life for your sake.

530
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,943
Hold on. Are we to wait here?

531
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,279
We were ordered to vacate the prison.

532
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,406
I presume it is because of the scholars.

533
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:04,726
Lord Lee.

534
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:08,855
My lord.

535
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,440
My lord?

536
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:18,383
Please do not betray your duty of loyalty!

537
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,013
Your Majesty!

538
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:33,022
Please move the prisoners here
to the Office of Justice!

539
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,359
Move them to the Office of Justice!

540
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:41,864
Please move the prisoners here
to the Office of Justice!

541
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,734
Lord Lee.

542
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,498
Lord Lee.

543
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,751
Are you awake?

544
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,113
I should move him.

545
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,865
His body has disappeared.

546
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,116
Lord Lee.

547
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,618
Lord Lee!

548
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:54,455
The crown princess has been
implicated in a disgraceful act.

549
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,624
Treason? It is not true.

550
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:59,085
-His Highness has…
-Your Highness.

551
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,670
I heard that in Joseon

552
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:02,421
the crown prince's people
are being purged.

553
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,423
Is it true?

554
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:06,926
Lord Lee.

555
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:10,513
These are the happiest moments
I have spent with you.

556
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:14,267
Even if I die,
I will never leave your side.

557
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:30,700
