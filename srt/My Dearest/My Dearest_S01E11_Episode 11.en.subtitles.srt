1
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,136
Are you crazy?

2
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,955
Why are we taking
a path crawling with thieves

3
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,999
when there is a perfectly good shortcut?

4
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,208
Why?

5
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,714
Jang-hyeon.

6
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,383
Forget about that Gil-chae
or whatever her name is.

7
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,094
Look at me. I am fine, am I not?

8
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,804
Is Jong-jong the only woman in the world?

9
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,515
There are Jong-jongs everywhere.

10
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,652
But…

11
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,658
my body and my heart

12
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,870
are all yours, my lady.

13
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,417
Does no part of you belong to me?

14
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,089
Well…

15
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,094
This?

16
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,435
This?

17
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,355
This?

18
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,693
And…

19
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,698
this?

20
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,707
Bring it here.
I thought I would die of hunger.

21
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,833
Young lady.

22
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,086
-I mean, my lady.
-You may leave.

23
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,754
Jong-jong, you too.

24
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,051
The new bride shows no shyness.

25
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,194
I should have done that.

26
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,055
I will be a good wife.

27
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,098
Trust me.

28
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,776
My wife.

29
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,771
What are you thinking about?

30
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,874
Is Lee Jang-hyeon still not here?

31
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,710
Your Highness,

32
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,004
there are mountains of issues
to resolve right now.

33
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,506
Why are you delaying like this?

34
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,299
We need someone who is seasoned.

35
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,718
Summon Lee Jang-hyeon quickly.

36
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,888
He says to summon Lee Jang-hyeon quickly.

37
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,892
Jang-hyeon stayed behind in Joseon
to procure white paper,

38
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,602
but there is no news from him yet.

39
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,147
I am waiting for him too.

40
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,071
Otter fur, red squirrel fur, one gelding,

41
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,783
otter gall bladder, Japanese sword,
tiger skin, honey…

42
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,578
When will I see you again

43
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,912
once you leave?

44
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,958
I will surely return to Joseon

45
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,585
and atone for my filial impiety.

46
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,003
Yes, I am sure.

47
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,921
By the way,

48
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,593
I heard that Yonggoldae offered you
a red dragon robe.

49
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,138
It is because they are
uncivilized and foolish.

50
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,682
I informed them
that no one but Your Majesty

51
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,643
can wear clothes embroidered with dragons.

52
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,980
What did they say when you told them that?

53
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,773
They seemed to understand.

54
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,692
Surprisingly,

55
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,153
they admire the unwavering loyalty
of Joseon's subjects

56
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,572
and the chastity of our women.

57
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,742
It seems they think they should
learn from us in the future.

58
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,744
They admired those things?

59
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,207
I heard they also admired
your suggestion to mix other grains

60
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,083
into their military rations.

61
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,754
When they urgently demanded supplies,

62
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,798
I explained that mixing in other grains
would allow us to meet their deadline.

63
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,383
They understood.

64
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,969
My experience differed
from the things I heard

65
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,555
back when I was residing here
in the palace of Joseon.

66
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,890
I have found

67
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,142
that they are not entirely unreasonable.

68
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,852
Therefore, I--

69
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,526
Do you think I am blind and deaf,

70
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,861
sitting in this palace?

71
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,034
The Qing emperor sent me a secret letter.

72
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,747
He reprimanded me for sending
an adopted son as a hostage

73
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,998
instead of my own child.

74
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,127
And you claim you have
an understanding with them?

75
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,674
Tell me.

76
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,928
What have you been doing in Shenyang
that things would come to this?

77
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,523
Also, 12,500 g of dried chestnuts,
33 yards of red silk,

78
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:26,816
white ramie cloth…

79
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,119
Your Highness, Lee Jang-hyeon has arrived!

80
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,172
Your Highness, I pay my respects.

81
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,009
Have you been well?

82
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,596
Why are you so late?

83
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,019
As expected,

84
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,104
where else would this fellow go?

85
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,697
Did something happen in Joseon?

86
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,618
This time, your expression

87
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,203
is that of a man who has
lost the woman he loves.

88
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,873
You shrewd bastard.

89
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,003
Yes, I lost her.

90
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,006
This time…

91
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,593
I have lost her for good.

92
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,515
I have lost something too.

93
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,145
I have lost something for good.

94
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,486
But you learn

95
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,696
to live without it.

96
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,825
There is nothing

97
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,161
you cannot live without.

98
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,082
One way or another,

99
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,834
life goes on.

100
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,532
Look at you.

101
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,076
I knew you would get badly hurt
by a woman someday.

102
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,663
You had fun leading women on, did you not?

103
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,999
That is the thing about karma.

104
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,794
You can hide in the deepest corner
of the highest mountain,

105
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,297
but you still cannot escape it.

106
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,137
You should stay lying down
since you are so wasted.

107
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,721
This is for the better.

108
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,515
Since Ryang-eum is gone too,

109
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,183
let us stop this business now.

110
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,356
We must go.

111
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,691
What?

112
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,695
Let us go.

113
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,240
For goodness' sake.

114
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,709
Must we do this when Ryang-eum
is not even with us?

115
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,628
Are you talking about Ryang-eum again?

116
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,174
Do you miss him that much?

117
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,384
Who says I miss him?

118
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,511
Why not just send him a message?

119
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,805
Tell him you miss him desperately.

120
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,141
I told you I do not!

121
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,069
Are you following me?

122
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,072
It must be a woman.

123
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,284
As if.

124
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,037
Perhaps you were following me?

125
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,208
Let us see who catches more.

126
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,602
This way. Run!

127
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,567
Get up.

128
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,776
Let us go.

129
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,576
Go together.

130
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,564
Yang-cheon!

131
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,800
Yang-cheon…

132
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,585
You are

133
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,796
not selling captives, are you?

134
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,843
Please pretend you did not see this today.

135
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,223
I beg you.

136
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,158
Oh, Yang-cheon…

137
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,400
Come on. Eat up.

138
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,402
Help yourself.

139
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,678
What happened?

140
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,599
How on earth…

141
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,895
It is nothing. Eat up.

142
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,564
You are frightening the kids.

143
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,820
I thought

144
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,531
I was done for this time.

145
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,660
I did not expect to see you two here.

146
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,622
I guess I am not

147
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,415
meant to die yet.

148
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,551
During the chaos,
when the barbarians attacked,

149
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:18,806
people from Uiju
all fled to us for protection.

150
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,226
How could I ignore them?

151
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,270
I had a reputation to uphold.

152
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,519
They all died.

153
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,731
Ningqujin ran away,

154
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,568
but he must be dead too.

155
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,574
By the way,

156
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,243
how did you two

157
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,413
end up as despicable slave traders?

158
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,498
Hey, what do you take us for?

159
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,382
Cut off one heel each
and send them to their owners.

160
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:36,925
Yes, sir.

161
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,140
Spare me. Please spare me.

162
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,853
Spare me, please!

163
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,399
Let go!

164
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,777
Please!

165
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,489
-Let me go!
-Cutting off their heels

166
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,408
will decrease their value.

167
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,535
What a waste.

168
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,704
Let go! Hey!

169
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,165
They could be sold for 30 yang each.

170
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,167
We can get 30 yang for those weaklings?

171
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,127
Impossible!

172
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,629
If I sell them, it is possible.

173
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,256
If I cannot…

174
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,842
Well, we can cut off their heels later.

175
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,636
Let me go!

176
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,637
But…

177
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,974
if I sell them for 30 yang,

178
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,977
give me three yang per person.

179
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,398
I need some profit
to make it worth my effort.

180
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,566
Hold it!

181
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,326
If you deceive me,

182
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,621
I will cut off your heels!

183
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,645
Thanks for helping.

184
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:15,065
I was not helping them.
I was granting your request.

185
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,694
But

186
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,071
can you really sell
these captives for 30 yang?

187
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,409
I mean,

188
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,288
how will you sell so many for 30 yang?

189
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,097
I am shocked and dumbfounded.

190
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,559
So, you are saying we are losing money?

191
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,730
Well, did you think
that I was some god of business?

192
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,772
Did you?

193
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,275
Those people…

194
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,615
How could I sell them for 30 yang?

195
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,617
Well?

196
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:13,999
No, wait…

197
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,919
If they put on some weight,

198
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,465
we could sell them for five yang each…

199
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,389
Hey.

200
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,398
Hey.

201
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,953
Did you really sell those men
for 30 yang each?

202
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,164
Yes.

203
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,248
You truly have

204
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,502
exceptional talent.

205
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,004
Well then,

206
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,298
bring them in!

207
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,857
Can you sell these ones too?

208
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,170
Please spare me…

209
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,506
Spare me…

210
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,221
Come this way.

211
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,476
Rest here.

212
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,686
You will be safe.

213
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,065
This man will protect us.

214
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,360
It is just

215
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,653
one thing after another.

216
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:07,946
It just keeps getting worse…

217
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,915
The children are

218
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,751
half the price of adults.
So if we say 15 yang each…

219
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,340
There are 12 kids.
So, we can earn 180 yang.

220
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,259
Correct.

221
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,261
180 yang!

222
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,352
I am telling you,
it is better to be caught by me!

223
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,772
Getting caught by us
is the best option! Geez.

224
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,197
Sister!

225
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,573
Jeong-in!

226
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,117
Jeong-in…

227
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,466
Is Ryang-eum not too emotional?

228
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:29,653
You promised me
an Usimjeong branch in Namwon, right?

229
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,820
I did.

230
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,782
But if we spend like this,
when will we ever--

231
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:36,910
Gu-jam,

232
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,205
I think someone is here.

233
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,289
I will be back.

234
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,166
But…

235
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,592
I heard everything.

236
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,469
Send me to Joseon too.

237
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,555
If you kill me, I cannot send you.

238
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,439
Please save us.

239
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,151
If you do not take us in, we will all die!

240
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,404
-I have three daughters.
-Please save us.

241
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,823
-Please save us.
-Help us.

242
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,867
-Help us.
-Please save us.

243
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,681
This is all because of Ryang-eum.

244
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,892
Come to think of it,
you always give in to Ryang-eum.

245
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,605
When he looks at you
with big eyes like this,

246
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,066
it is strangely hard to resist.

247
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,651
That fox.

248
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,864
Well, since we are all together
for the first time in a while,

249
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,784
let us have some fun!

250
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,994
Let me pour you a glass.

251
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,539
Now that we are all together,

252
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:08,501
let us have a big party
like we used to in Uiju!

253
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,297
In this state, how can I…

254
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,384
Yang-cheon, when did you ever

255
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,137
make money with your heels?

256
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,848
Now, you just need

257
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,184
to give orders.

258
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,395
We will make a big profit.

259
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,564
As for you Gu-jam,

260
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,983
you can open
an Usimjeong branch in Namwon.

261
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,364
We will build

262
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,492
an even bigger tavern
in Uiju than ever before!

263
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,583
Finally, our Jang-hyeon
is back to his old self.

264
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:52,087
I thought you would die of heartbreak
after losing Lady Gil-chae…

265
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,345
Hey,

266
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,515
I am Lee Jang-hyeon.

267
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,225
Do you think

268
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,688
I am some idiot who would
cry, mope, and lament over

269
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,232
a single woman?

270
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,402
So, you have some self-awareness.

271
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,073
All right. Today,

272
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:24,202
I shall get acquainted
with Shenyang women.

273
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,330
Come in.

274
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,227
The barbarian's bald head was so shiny…

275
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,650
You should drink to your heart's content,

276
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,569
as you and I have a long night ahead.

277
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,155
What is she saying?

278
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,160
She is asking to play all night.

279
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:13,960
It is time to go now.

280
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:15,920
Okay.

281
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,638
Sweet dreams.

282
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,140
Jong-jong…

283
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,185
The Usimjeong in Namwon

284
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,145
is mine.

285
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,863
Shall I serve you, sir?

286
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:44,616
Certainly.

287
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,369
Shall we move to a private room?

288
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,080
Certainly.

289
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:56,044
Or shall I just pour you a drink?

290
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,592
Certainly.

291
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,721
Yes, certainly.

292
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,307
Certainly.

293
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,901
Call me…

294
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,823
an ugly rock, will you?

295
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,965
Say, "Hey, you ugly rock!"

296
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,720
Go on, say it.

297
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,384
I went to Uiju.

298
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,763
But by then…

299
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,309
you had already been captured.

300
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,731
I was too late.

301
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,232
It does not matter.

302
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,237
Did you have a woman?

303
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:30,823
Is she pretty?

304
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,536
Pretty? Not really.

305
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,873
Why are you so hung up on a woman

306
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,125
who is not even pretty?

307
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,090
She is just…

308
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,219
an impressive person.

309
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,138
Just like you.

310
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,853
Thank you…

311
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:05,984
for being alive.

312
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,409
You must have

313
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,663
owed me greatly in a past life.

314
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,250
Why else

315
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,628
would you be so good to me in this life?

316
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,340
Right?

317
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,006
The flowers seem like they will bloom.

318
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,390
You have another

319
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,143
woman you like, do you not?

320
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,438
I know.

321
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,025
But today…

322
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,976
Is there anything you like?

323
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,312
Well…

324
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,360
But how did a noble lady like you

325
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,612
end up doing business?

326
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,126
You look pleased.

327
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,711
You must have made a killing.

328
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,133
Well, someone from the palace
came to purchase a knife from us.

329
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,051
From the palace? Who?

330
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,803
Lady Jo, the concubine.

331
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,181
She asked how I ended up in business,

332
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,476
so I told her everything
that has happened.

333
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,567
It is strange.

334
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,737
Since you have left Hanyang,

335
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:42,366
that woman is
the closest thing there is to you.

336
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,163
So, I cannot bear

337
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,125
not seeing her every day.

338
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,837
Is that not strange?

339
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,802
You dare flirt

340
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,096
with the prince?

341
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,767
Stay with us.

342
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,674
No!

343
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,133
No!

344
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,052
No! Please spare me!

345
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,722
The prince wants high-quality tiger skin.

346
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,226
Tiger skins are not easy to obtain.

347
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,186
You are the only one I can ask.

348
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,897
Please spare me!

349
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,399
Please!

350
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,151
Again?

351
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,529
She is too jealous.

352
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,823
What is happening?

353
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,825
Hey.

354
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,619
You must not peek into the rear garden!

355
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,334
I am counting on you.

356
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,153
Be quiet.

357
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,363
Let us sleep.

358
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,783
You are overreacting.

359
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,201
I will change your towel.

360
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,956
Do not go…

361
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,089
I will be right back.

362
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,586
You saw Yeong-rang?

363
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:26,757
So--

364
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,758
So what?

365
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,011
We cannot do it.

366
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,138
It is impossible.

367
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:35,599
You may have helped runaway captives,
but do not even dream

368
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,268
of taking someone out

369
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,270
of a prince's residence!

370
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:41,814
Fine.

371
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,024
You do not have to do it.

372
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,653
Gu-jam is right.

373
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,492
Are they not women
who have bedded barbarians?

374
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,454
Even if they escape to Joseon,
they will be despised.

375
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,330
Why risk your life to help them escape?

376
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,541
Do not waste your efforts.

377
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,509
Why are you not eating?

378
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,386
Do you not like the porridge?

379
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,138
Eat.

380
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,723
Try it.

381
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,934
Gosh. This is exhausting.

382
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,853
Do not cry.

383
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:27,902
Hand the baby

384
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,779
over to me.

385
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,281
No.

386
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,118
How dare a woman
who slept with barbarians…

387
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,121
Here.

388
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,507
Try it.

389
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:50,966
Do not cry.

390
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,594
Are you sleeping?

391
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:55,763
Finally.

392
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,183
Do not wake up.

393
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,936
You are here.

394
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:31,966
Kkeut-soe and I were

395
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,343
captured together.

396
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,345
You know, right?

397
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,932
Before he became a thug,
Kkeut-soe used to mend nets.

398
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:42,184
So, he was built like a mountain.

399
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,144
But he tried to escape, got caught,

400
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,522
tried again, got caught…

401
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,191
First, they threaded his ears,

402
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,610
then they cut off his heels…

403
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,446
The last time he was caught,

404
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,075
he was half the size he used to be.

405
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,995
His eyes rolled blankly.

406
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,706
He became just a skeleton.

407
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,419
I have done…

408
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,590
bad things too.

409
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,969
And I have seen all sorts of scoundrels.

410
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,597
But the barbarians are different.

411
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,399
They are terrifying.

412
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,653
So,

413
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,573
do not foolishly risk your life

414
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:40,117
trying to save women
who have been with barbarians.

415
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,785
Got it?

416
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,078
I do not care.

417
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:47,541
If Yeong-rang wants to escape,
I will help her escape.

418
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,626
What?

419
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,965
It is Yeong-rang.

420
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,140
Thank you, truly!

421
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,062
Would you perhaps

422
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,774
consider selling
the Joseon captives you have?

423
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,360
I could

424
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,445
get you a good price

425
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,364
and make a big profit for you.

426
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,338
The Joseon maids we currently have

427
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,217
are all meant to serve
the prince in his bedchamber.

428
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,260
No amount of money will ransom them.

429
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,573
Bright and clear Yeong-rang.

430
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,536
Young master

431
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,246
Jang-hyeon?

432
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,456
Do you not wish to escape from here?

433
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,418
If you want, I will help you.

434
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,719
You never listen.

435
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:25,973
Slave hunters sometimes
appear around here.

436
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,517
You must be careful.

437
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,852
Got it?

438
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,396
Just send me to Joseon.

439
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,857
My wife is waiting for me.

440
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,867
He will take all of you too.

441
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,643
It is hard.

442
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,103
It is so hard, I could die.

443
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,508
Hang-i, hurry!

444
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,009
I do not think…

445
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,596
I can do it.

446
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,266
They said they would

447
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,769
cut off my hand next time.

448
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:10,387
Joseon white paper is very popular.

449
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,346
I am counting on you!

450
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,365
I am on my way to sell
white paper from Joseon.

451
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,291
Wait.

452
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:21,416
I will lure them away!

453
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,714
An escaped captive!

454
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,292
Go. Quickly!

455
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,504
Why did you come here?

456
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,381
You are here.

457
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:46,955
Look at that.

458
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,999
Jang-hyeon, you are still a good fighter!

459
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:59,634
Damn it. Why are they not coming?

460
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,599
Jang-hyeon!

461
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,766
Hurry.

462
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,696
Young Master.

463
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,744
If they find out you escaped,

464
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,496
they will search for you relentlessly.

465
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,834
So, you must cross
this river today without fail.

466
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,545
Steel yourself.

467
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,761
Young Master.

468
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,347
Have you cured your lower body problem?

469
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,350
What?

470
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:51,478
You do not like me anymore,

471
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,188
do you?

472
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,442
You must despise me
now that I have dirtied myself.

473
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:00,779
Dirtied yourself?

474
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,031
You know what I mean.

475
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,700
With the barbarians, I have already…

476
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,411
If a dog bit you,
would you say you dirtied yourself?

477
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,625
If a madman hit you,

478
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,670
would you say
the body part he injured was dirty?

479
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,424
No sane person would think

480
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,927
you dirtied yourself by these things.

481
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,429
So,

482
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,014
when you go to Joseon,

483
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,559
focus on meeting a decent man like that.

484
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,105
Not a eunuch like me.

485
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,942
Young Master…

486
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,530
Big Brother risked his life

487
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,782
fighting to send you to Joseon.

488
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,997
You must repay him…

489
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,542
by living well.

490
00:54:58,837 --> 00:54:59,879
I will.

491
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,144
It is done.

492
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,023
Yeong-rang, go now.

493
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:46,968
I pray…

494
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,306
that you will be safe.

495
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,480
I hear the envoy who just arrived

496
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:03,026
gave a specific order to the eunuchs.

497
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,195
A specific order?

498
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,948
They said that since our country

499
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,992
has been negligent
in recapturing escaped captives,

500
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,871
I must personally report

501
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,873
to the emperor in Shenyang.

502
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,170
Using the failure to capture
escaped captives as an excuse,

503
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,546
they are trying

504
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,299
to summon me to Qing.

505
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,844
They are using our failure
to recapture escaped captives

506
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,097
as a pretext for something unpredictable.

507
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,642
Surely, they are trying to destroy
our nation's foundation once again!

508
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,352
-Indeed.
-That must be it.

509
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:39,437
Do not act rashly!

510
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:43,066
If this information leaks,
it will cause unrest among the people.

511
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,110
We must not let this leak carelessly!

512
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,029
It is strange.

513
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,701
Even though the crown prince
is learning Manchu to please the Khan,

514
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,830
why is the Qing emperor
still pressuring us

515
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,082
about capturing
and returning escaped captives?

516
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,668
Does the crown prince

517
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:06,506
not know that I am suffering
because of this escaped captives issue?

518
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:09,592
Is the crown prince

519
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,554
thinking only of his own safety

520
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:15,223
while trying to stay on their good side?

521
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:19,769
Your Majesty,

522
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,606
for now, please show sincerity
in recapturing escaped captives

523
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,775
to appease them!

524
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,777
Yes.

525
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:33,741
Recapturing and returning
escaped captives is

526
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,119
truly heartbreaking,

527
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,122
but how can we avoid it?

528
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:43,168
Let us quickly recapture
the escaped captives

529
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,046
and send them back
with the returning envoy!

530
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,178
Escaped captives must confess.

531
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:56,806
Those who do not confess
and those who hide the captives

532
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,601
will be severely punished by the same law,

533
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:03,730
but those who report them
will be greatly rewarded.

534
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,440
Really?

535
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:09,110
They will give rewards
for reporting escaped captives?

536
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:13,364
How can you betray people who risked
their lives to escape for a bit of money?

537
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,241
Who said I would report them?

538
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,035
I am just curious.

539
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:20,163
Once again, the whole country
is in shock over this matter

540
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:23,124
of recapturing escaped captives.

541
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:27,337
Our people escaped
at the risk of their lives.

542
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,882
How could they have known

543
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:33,051
the severity of the Namhansanseong Treaty?

544
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,053
We are binding
and sending back escaped people

545
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:36,804
as if they are criminals.

546
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,265
Some are hanging themselves,

547
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:43,269
and some are even cutting off
their limbs to delay separation.

548
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,856
Moreover, officials,
under severe pressure,

549
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,775
are falsely arresting relatives,

550
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:52,612
and the court cannot verify
each case individually,

551
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,949
so people are being dragged
to their deaths with aggrieved hearts.

552
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,909
My brother was captured and escaped,
so why are you taking me?

553
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,579
No matter how much

554
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,958
those affected by this
blame and resent me,

555
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:08,545
what can I do but accept it
since I am guilty?

556
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,297
But

557
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,132
please understand my true intentions,

558
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:17,095
and do not turn your back on the state
or disobey orders.

559
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,181
I hope we can maintain at least

560
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:23,226
a thread of our
200-year-old royal lineage.

561
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,396
This is my wish.

562
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,985
Father!

563
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:36,072
I might be home late as I must entertain
the high officials at a drinking banquet.

564
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:40,368
Actually, should I come home early
and rest with you?

565
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,371
What are you saying?

566
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:46,249
You should please the high officials

567
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,543
so that you can advance in your career.

568
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,171
What happens if I advance?

569
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,257
We will become richer.

570
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,717
If we become richer?

571
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:58,219
Is it not good to be rich?
Why are you asking?

572
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:03,266
I will also work hard
to impress the high-ranking ladies.

573
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,728
So, do not go and sit dejectedly,

574
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:08,479
but have a good time.

575
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:09,731
Understood?

576
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:10,773
Yes.

577
01:00:12,233 --> 01:00:14,193
Being rich is good.

578
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,030
I will get going.

579
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,718
Returning the captives is

580
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,471
something we cannot avoid
due to their threats,

581
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:43,723
but please show Your Majesty's grace

582
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,309
by reducing labor
for their parents, wives, and sons

583
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,394
and providing them with financial support.

584
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:52,023
Also, if the state
prepares funds for ransom,

585
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:54,108
even if the people must pay taxes,

586
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,361
the people will not resent it.

587
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,488
Please keep an eye
on Jung Myeong-su's attitude

588
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,281
and find out an appropriate price

589
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,241
for the ransom of our people.

590
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:16,714
Dear husband.

591
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,175
Why did you not announce your arrival?

592
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:23,429
How could I interrupt you
while you were writing a petition?

593
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,641
But what matter does it concern?

594
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,728
They are recapturing escaped captives.

595
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,607
Do you know what
the barbarians are aiming for?

596
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,651
They are

597
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,571
manipulating Joseon people
to turn on one another,

598
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,573
to beat up and resent each other.

599
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:44,742
Yet, there are still many in the court

600
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:48,079
who want to side
with the barbarians for future benefits.

601
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,292
So, of course, no one

602
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:57,755
hopes for or desires
to receive my petitions anymore.

603
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,590
Who else but you

604
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:02,593
would courageously ask His Majesty

605
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,721
to stop capturing escaped captives?

606
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,474
I am helping with Lady Gil-chae's work.

607
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,893
So, dear husband,

608
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,146
you should take the path
that is right for you.

609
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,529
I feel happy and fulfilled

610
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,573
when I see you working hard

611
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:26,075
and worrying for the country.

612
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:33,583
Hug me, Grandpa.

613
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,169
Stop that. Go play over there.

614
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,046
Play over there.

615
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:42,383
Oh, gosh…

616
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:04,238
Take the captive away!

617
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,364
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

618
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:08,743
What? It is not me.

619
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:10,787
I am not a captive!

620
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,580
My lady!

621
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:13,998
My lady!

622
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:15,291
What are you doing?

623
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,547
Take him away!

624
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,425
My lady, please save me.

625
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,552
My lady! I am not a captive.

626
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,471
My lady, save me.

627
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,807
You have the wrong person!

628
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,683
My lady,

629
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,686
did you knowingly hide an escaped captive?

630
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,313
I did not hide anyone!

631
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:39,232
I had no idea he was an escaped captive.

632
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,150
If

633
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,820
it is revealed that you hid
an escaped captive,

634
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:47,073
you will have to face punishment.

635
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:53,454
Are you interrogating me,
knowing who my husband is?

636
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,214
I am innocent, so I am leaving!

637
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,634
What should we do about this?

638
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:16,602
My lady, please save me.

639
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,730
If I am captured again, I will die!

640
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,484
You deceived me,
and now you are asking me to save you?

641
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:26,612
Do you know how much
I have suffered because of you?

642
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,614
I do not care if I die,

643
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,575
but please, at least spare my Da-jim…

644
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,164
You knew, did you not?

645
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:40,543
You knew we had escaped
from Qing when you took us in!

646
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:41,961
Shut up!

647
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,423
How could I have known
when you deliberately deceived me?

648
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:48,342
No, you planned this
from the beginning, did you not?

649
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,806
If I am captured again, I will die.

650
01:04:56,142 --> 01:05:00,062
The prince has ordered me
to catch an escaped Joseon woman.

651
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:03,190
How can I do what even
the Joseon king cannot?

652
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:05,318
That is a problem.

653
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:09,572
That is a problem?

654
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:12,950
If we cannot catch the escaped captive,
do you think you will be safe?

655
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,994
Gosh.

656
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,746
Sir, you really lack flexibility.

657
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,958
Do you think
the other princes' servants are

658
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,420
really catching escaped captives?

659
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,506
What are you suggesting?

660
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,261
Was not the woman we saw earlier

661
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,305
rather beautiful?

662
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:39,268
If we bring the prince such a woman,

663
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:42,229
he might forget about
the escaped captives, but…

664
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,441
There might be a way.

665
01:05:56,327 --> 01:06:00,039
If we are taken to Qing, Da-jim will die.

666
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,168
What does that have to do with me?

667
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,474
Please let the child go.

668
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,893
He will only be another mouth to feed.

669
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,578
Even if a child died on the way,

670
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,330
it would not matter much.

671
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:00,850
That one looks similar.

672
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,602
Yes, sir.

673
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,813
-Bring him.
-Yes, sir.

674
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:14,405
I forgot something.

675
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:16,741
-Just a moment.
-Okay.

676
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:37,094
Who will take care of this child
you are bringing home?

677
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:39,889
Stop crying!

678
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:41,974
That will not bring your grandpa back.

679
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,063
You are alone now.

680
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,148
You must be strong. Understand?

681
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:52,526
Let us go.

682
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,035
Grandpa…

683
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,205
Grandpa…

684
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,085
Grandpa…

685
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:12,296
My lady!

686
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:27,520
Yang-cheon, eat up.

687
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:32,316
Let us live happily together

688
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,444
until we are old and gray.

689
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:37,780
What is with you? You are creeping me out.

690
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:41,117
Have you heard the news?

691
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:45,329
They say Joseon is in chaos
over capturing escaped captives.

692
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,999
They will bring them back
to Shenyang soon.

693
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:54,755
Hey.

694
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:57,967
Just eat.

695
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,556
Yang-cheon,

696
01:09:04,598 --> 01:09:07,476
I promise that will
never happen to you again.

697
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:10,604
Just trust me.

698
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,084
She is not here.

699
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,633
What do you mean Gil-chae has disappeared?

700
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:42,595
She definitely left
the smithy in the afternoon,

701
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:44,555
but she has not returned!

702
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:46,849
Gil-chae…

703
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,351
I will look for her too.

704
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:50,895
-Let us go!
-Yes.

705
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:52,104
Come on.

706
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,318
Did she not say she was going somewhere?

707
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:02,323
What about Jong-jong? Is she missing too?

708
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:08,454
My lady!

709
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,293
My lady!

710
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:16,962
-My lady!
-My lady!

711
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,839
My lady!

712
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:20,341
My lady!

713
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:25,346
My lady.

714
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:26,764
My lady!

715
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:35,814
My lady…

716
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:49,578
What is going on?

717
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:52,998
Could she be
with Young Master Jang-hyeon again?

718
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,333
Be quiet!

719
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:57,127
It was just a thought.

720
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:19,817
How did it go?

721
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,320
Let us quickly go and tell the officer.

722
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:27,283
Get out of the way. Why are you lingering?

723
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:56,729
My lady.

724
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,689
Please open your eyes, my lady.

725
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,368
Move along quickly.

726
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:15,456
What is going on?

727
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:23,422
What is happening?

728
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:26,175
Where on earth are we?

729
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:30,971
My lady!

730
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,140
Please take care of yourself.

731
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:34,350
Get back.

732
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,655
My lady, you were once a captive
in the Qing army and escaped, right?

733
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:51,075
That is why we are taking you back.

734
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:52,826
What?

735
01:12:53,827 --> 01:12:55,454
I have never been a captive.

736
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:57,915
So, let me off right now!

737
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,177
If you get off here,
you will end up like that.

738
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,347
Shall I let you down?

739
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,395
They say they are sending
escaped captives and immigrants

740
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:23,107
who were captured in Joseon
with the returning envoy.

741
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:26,360
This time, His Majesty

742
01:13:26,443 --> 01:13:29,446
has ordered the Joseon officials
to personally oversee

743
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,824
the punishment
of the escaped Joseon captives.

744
01:13:49,174 --> 01:13:50,175
Have you heard?

745
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,636
Captives from Joseon are coming this time.

746
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,681
But there is a minister who says

747
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:58,100
he cannot bear to watch
the captives being punished.

748
01:13:58,183 --> 01:14:01,353
Yes, I will take his place.

749
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,230
Would you?

750
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:08,861
What is so difficult about it?

751
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:10,863
It is not like the captives

752
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,699
will not be punished if I do not watch.

753
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:15,159
Well…

754
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,581
I cannot understand your intentions.

755
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:23,709
I will go first.

756
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:50,819
My lady.

757
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:57,743
Here they come.

758
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,023
I need your help.

759
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:53,317
-We can get them.
-Get them?

760
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,319
It is hopeless.

761
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:56,987
Your lady has already been chosen
by His Highness.

762
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:59,197
I will go with Ryang-eum.

763
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:01,450
Give up. If you do not comply,

764
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:04,202
they will cut off your fingers or toes.

765
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:05,871
Do you know Lord Lee Jang-hyeon?

766
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:08,332
Today, I truly will kill you.

767
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:09,791
If you truly believe that,

768
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,210
kill me right here, right now.

769
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,046
Your husband will come for you?

770
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:17,132
No husband ever comes for his wife.

771
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:19,176
Do not forget.

772
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,220
You must endure to the end.

773
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:23,722
Being a protector

774
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,474
is my duty.

775
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:43,075
