1
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,294
You know what I desire.

2
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,590
There is only one thing that I want.

3
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,469
I wish for your heart to long only for me.

4
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,224
If you can offer me
even just an empty promise,

5
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,394
I will change my mind
about going to Shenyang.

6
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,816
But you cannot…

7
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,239
I will give it to you.

8
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,700
You can have my whole heart.

9
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,494
So…

10
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,039
do not go.

11
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,008
Do not leave.

12
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,011
Stay with me.

13
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,723
My baby

14
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,225
My sweet, precious baby

15
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,186
My little treasure, go to sleep

16
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,398
Go to sleep, my treasure

17
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,735
Grow up well, little baby

18
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,279
How gentle is the breeze

19
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,574
Even the birds fly back to their nests

20
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,951
Sweet, precious baby

21
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,995
-Go to sleep--
-Halt!

22
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,749
His Imperial Majesty is here!

23
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,051
You…

24
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,929
Your Majesty.

25
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,946
You

26
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,114
may leave.

27
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,253
A false rumor spread in Joseon

28
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,048
about smallpox spreading
among the Qing soldiers.

29
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,720
Were you perhaps the one…

30
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,557
who spread

31
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,435
that rumor?

32
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,613
I reported everything
to General Yonggoldae.

33
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,658
Your Majesty.

34
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,166
Tatara Inguldai.

35
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,795
You speak.

36
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:56,879
Is this man…

37
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,801
a rat like Ha Seo-guk
that escaped your notice,

38
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,511
or is he a poor citizen

39
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,181
who lost his way during the war?

40
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,574
Your Majesty.

41
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,327
That man is too incapable to be a spy.

42
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,831
I wouldn't fail to distinguish a spy.

43
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,547
A capable double agent is very rare.

44
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,177
It is double agents

45
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,849
who were behind the downfall
of Yuan Chonghuan.

46
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,728
Then…

47
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,011
You bastard!

48
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:31,933
Now,

49
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,520
you have vouched for me.

50
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,191
No matter how much you hate me,
you cannot kill me.

51
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,081
Very well.

52
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,166
I will spare your life for now.

53
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,585
However,

54
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,131
you must prove that you are not a rat.

55
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:26,904
Thank you.

56
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,789
I am grateful.

57
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,292
Wash up.

58
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,043
You smell.

59
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,649
What did they say to let you go?

60
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,528
Tell me in detail.

61
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,419
From now on…

62
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,049
you will catch and turn in
escaped Joseon prisoners.

63
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,431
That is the kind of person I am.

64
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,645
I am a person…

65
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,025
who belongs to neither side.

66
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,534
Yes.

67
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,122
You do not belong anywhere.

68
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,627
But as for me…

69
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,177
I belong to you.

70
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,323
I must prove that I am not a rat?

71
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,692
You feed them this?

72
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,320
Well…

73
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,199
Give it to me. Give it back!

74
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,116
No.

75
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,577
I said give it back.

76
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,882
How embarrassing. No.

77
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:18,135
Then I will give you
half a measure more of barley.

78
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,764
What will you use it for?

79
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,726
They say if you get hold of a maiden's
menstrual cloth, you will bear a son.

80
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,813
Our lady keeps insisting on getting one.

81
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,065
Think of it as a good deed--

82
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,817
What do you think you are doing?

83
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,154
You are selling what?

84
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,328
Don't scold Yeong-chae.

85
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,419
But that is your mother's keepsake.

86
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,753
Let us sell it.

87
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,257
We'll be fine,

88
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,676
but Je-nam and Dae-bok

89
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,053
will starve to death.

90
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,435
Just the jacket?

91
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,106
What about the skirt?

92
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,524
We only have the jacket.

93
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:26,036
Only 252 grams of barley rice?
Do you know how precious this jacket is?

94
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,582
What do you expect?
It is a jacket without a skirt.

95
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,585
Jong-jong, let us go.

96
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,422
A so-called noble lady

97
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,883
must sell her jacket for money
but still has a servant!

98
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,898
I am sorry.

99
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,399
I have no choice.

100
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,817
Are you telling us to die?

101
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,362
What can I do when
the Qing Dynasty has prohibited it?

102
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,742
Is he not the military officer
who saved us on the island?

103
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,911
-Sir.
-How can this be right, sir?

104
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,207
My lady!

105
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,709
It has been a long time.

106
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,169
What brings you here?

107
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,134
If you will excuse us.
Come along, Jong-jong.

108
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,561
Is this your smithy, sir?

109
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,396
Yes.

110
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,236
Please, eat up.

111
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,520
You said that smithy was yours, right?

112
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,813
Yes.

113
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,900
It has been operated
by my family for a long time.

114
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:24,113
Originally, military officers had
to prepare their own swords and arrows.

115
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,408
But the blacksmiths are not working,
and the furnaces are empty.

116
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,910
The war is over,

117
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,663
and the Qing have forbidden
Joseon from making weapons,

118
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,540
so now there is no work
for the blacksmiths.

119
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,293
Then, why not make
other things besides weapons?

120
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,213
How many homes had their pots
and bowls stolen during the chaos?

121
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:45,384
And the burned-down houses need
nails and hinges to hang doors. Also--

122
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,596
Well, I heard that in the past,

123
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,098
our blacksmiths made
brass bowls and farming tools,

124
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,018
but I have never made such things myself.

125
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,905
How about I help you with your work?

126
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,698
What nonsense…

127
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,286
How could a lady like you
handle rough blacksmiths?

128
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,246
I can do it!

129
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,792
I can do it!

130
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,219
What do you plan to make?

131
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,221
I saw molds for brass bowls.

132
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,890
You used to make those here, right?

133
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:39,146
Yes, this place used to make brass bowls
and various farming tools,

134
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:43,609
but since the first barbarian invasion,
we have mainly produced weapons.

135
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,277
That is perfect.

136
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,862
Let us make brass bowls again!

137
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,533
To make bowls,

138
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,328
we need copper.

139
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,919
Oh, my! Ten rolls
of such precious cotton cloth!

140
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,588
This could last us three months.
No, more than that.

141
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,882
If we eat one meal a day,
we could survive a whole year!

142
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:07,967
And after a year?

143
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,803
Will you go to the military official
and beg again?

144
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,305
Well, when that time comes…

145
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,224
This is six mun!

146
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,643
Do you not know that one mun
is worth 600 grams of rice?

147
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:21,855
That was in the past! Since the war,
rice is as precious as gold.

148
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:25,859
Even ten tongbo coins
are not worth 300 grams of barley rice!

149
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,570
How pitiful. Tongbo coins
have been worthless for ages.

150
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,863
Indeed.

151
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,241
It would be better to use them
for making bowls.

152
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,538
To make bowls,

153
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,290
we need copper.

154
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,794
Go around the market with these
and buy all the coins you can.

155
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,214
If you bargain well,
you can buy them for a cheap price.

156
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,550
Are you saying we should exchange

157
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,011
this precious cotton
for worthless tongbo coins?

158
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,888
With this, we could make
meat soup for Young Master Je-nam,

159
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,683
and our Dae-bok could
at least smell the meat--

160
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,059
Do as I say!

161
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:06,734
Do you want to eat meat just once
or have meat soup for every meal?

162
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,403
If you will not take tongbo coins,
what will you accept?

163
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,238
How dare you shout like that?

164
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,490
Darn it. Just give me 600 grams of rice.

165
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,451
-Why are you not taking tongbo coins…
-You nuisance.

166
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,369
Why are you fighting?

167
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,663
-For goodness' sake.
-Come with me.

168
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,998
Unbelievable.

169
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,750
Sell your tongbo coins to me.

170
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,918
I will give you double.

171
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,380
-Double?
-How much can I buy

172
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,840
with this many tongbo coins?

173
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,425
This much.

174
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,635
Oh, please.

175
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,888
-Give me this much.
-Not for tongbo coins!

176
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,014
-Come here.
-What is it?

177
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,474
-Those are tongbo coins, right?
-Yes.

178
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,726
Why are you carrying such a heavy load?

179
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,395
-Follow me. I will sell them for you.
-Really?

180
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,154
Here are the tongbo coins.

181
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,698
One foot.

182
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,241
Form a line!

183
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,868
Please form a line!

184
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,079
Half a foot.

185
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,247
Here it is.

186
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,210
Stand in line.

187
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,295
Form a line!

188
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,594
You sold cotton cloth
to buy these useless coins?

189
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,847
Melt these to make bowls.

190
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:20,933
The coins are useless,

191
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,936
but brass bowls are in high demand now.

192
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,020
My lady.

193
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,902
Melting coins to make other items is
forbidden by the state!

194
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,237
Officer Gu.

195
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,573
You cannot even buy one roll of cotton
with a hundred tongbo coins.

196
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,701
However, if we melt these coins
to make brass bowls--

197
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,247
In these troubled times,
who would buy expensive brass bowls?

198
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,875
As a nobleman,
you know how noble women value

199
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,877
ancestral rites more than life itself.

200
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,132
All the nobility had their brass bowls
stolen amid the chaos,

201
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,552
so they must use gourds for rites,
much to their despair.

202
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,887
Wait and see.

203
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,682
While fleeing, I noticed all the women

204
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,725
still had at least
one jade ring or gold ornament.

205
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,312
They will surely give those up
to purchase a brass bowl.

206
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,071
They risked their lives to escape,

207
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,199
only to be handed over to the barbarians
by fellow Joseon people.

208
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,327
I also do not feel right about this.

209
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,371
Do we really have to do this?

210
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,840
Those guys over there are also catching
and selling escaped prisoners!

211
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,218
Must we really work
with the likes of them?

212
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,705
Go back. Move back.

213
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,999
Retreat.

214
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,254
Do not partake if you do not want to.

215
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,506
I will do it alone.

216
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,390
Go back!

217
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,476
Run!

218
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,343
If we polish it,

219
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,344
it will shine.

220
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,103
People will gossip
if you do this yourself, young lady.

221
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,272
I just want to see it quickly!

222
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,041
Look at this.

223
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,417
They are brass bowls!

224
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,961
Useless coins

225
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,255
have become precious brass bowls!

226
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,560
Why have the tongs not been repaired?
Is this how you have been working?

227
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:19,815
Officer Gu may have overlooked it,
but I cannot!

228
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,191
Yes, whatever you say.

229
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,239
Oh, dear…

230
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,080
-Work faster.
-Yes, my lady.

231
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,916
She said she would split half the profit?

232
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:43,213
If she does not, I will flatten her nose.

233
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,965
She might hear.

234
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,967
-Still, she is noble.
-Noble?

235
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,053
She must be a darn poor noblewoman

236
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,848
to be wandering around
outdoors to earn money.

237
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:58,061
And yet she dares to order us around.

238
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,146
How disgraceful.

239
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,231
-Watch your mouth, I said.
-Darn it.

240
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,201
Well…

241
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,079
Eun-ae.

242
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,342
How can you call yourself a Joseon person?

243
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,678
Are you not ashamed?

244
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,054
Gosh. Anyway,

245
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,640
Jang-hyeon, the blue guy is not here.

246
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,477
You know, the one
who always wears a blue mask.

247
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,648
That guy is so nimble and quick.

248
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,026
Do you not think so?

249
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,031
Let us go.

250
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,249
Cut off one heel each
and send them to their owners.

251
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,626
Yes, sir.

252
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,048
Spare me. Please spare me.

253
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,549
Spare me.

254
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,221
Spare me, please!

255
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,723
Let go!

256
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:20,018
Let me go!

257
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,145
You have caught quite a few.
This is useful.

258
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:27,234
Our emperor highly values the task
of catching escaped prisoners.

259
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,444
Did I not tell you

260
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,072
I would become useful?

261
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,880
Is there anything lacking?

262
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:49,965
Impudent fellow.

263
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,926
If something is lacking,
can you provide it?

264
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,886
I will do anything

265
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,847
that is within my power.

266
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:03,478
I need money
to use as bribes for higher-ups.

267
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,780
If you open the door for a ginseng trade,

268
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,865
I will provide you double
the amount you need.

269
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,370
But why are you drinking so joylessly?

270
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,832
Do you fear the drink is poisoned?

271
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,251
What?

272
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,670
There is a rule.

273
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:35,885
If a man does not enjoy women or liquor…

274
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,682
one cannot do business with him.

275
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,072
You must stop this.

276
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,327
You are strong.

277
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,330
Drink.

278
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,380
You are so cute.

279
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,299
Let us drink together.

280
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,677
That fellow is quite obvious.

281
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:21,598
General, let us go over there.

282
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,652
Drink.

283
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,495
This is boring.

284
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,622
I know.

285
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,294
I know you are an illusion.

286
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,007
There is no way you are here.

287
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,662
What is it?

288
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,790
Did you not know?

289
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,128
I have always been like this.

290
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,510
I have always been this kind of man.

291
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,356
I have always

292
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,610
been like this.

293
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,363
Bring Jang-hyeon here immediately!

294
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,617
Your Highness, that is not…

295
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,871
Summon Jang-hyeon here, right now!

296
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,133
I hear you have been secretly supplying

297
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,345
Dorgon and the imperial family
with bamboo extract.

298
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:10,433
Is that how you gained Yonggoldae's favor
and held onto your life?

299
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,393
How dare you

300
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:17,065
turn the crown prince of Joseon
into someone who flatters them?

301
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,775
It was not flattery.

302
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,861
It was offering help.

303
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,281
Who would think of it that way? Who?

304
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,702
Yes.

305
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,705
You have been like this
from the beginning.

306
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:38,127
You have disrespected me, my father
and the Joseon court!

307
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,587
And it is not just you.

308
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,925
Joseon's scholars are refusing
to work in a so-called corrupt court

309
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,511
and are retreating to the mountains.

310
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:52,225
But shall I tell you what you do not know?

311
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,937
In response to the barbarians' threat,
His Majesty ordered

312
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,648
for the royal treasury to be opened
to feed every province.

313
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:02,944
He protected Choi Myeong-gil
when the censors attacked him,

314
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,613
and when Kim Ryu advised
retreating to Ganghwa Island,

315
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,242
His Majesty ordered
the old and sick to go first.

316
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,663
But no one knows this.

317
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,708
No one.

318
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,797
One side blames
His Majesty for the invasion

319
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,841
because he failed
to please the barbarians.

320
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,802
The other side points fingers,

321
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,138
saying he bowed too low
to please the barbarians.

322
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,766
What on earth should be done
to stop them from insulting His Majesty?

323
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,018
What should be done?

324
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,896
But why are you so angry, Your Highness?

325
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,814
Do you perhaps…

326
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,193
also consider His Majesty

327
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,779
incompetent for failing to stop the enemy?

328
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,864
Shut up!

329
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,493
That is not the case, Your Highness.

330
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:57,916
It is not because His Majesty was
incompetent that they invaded Joseon.

331
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,169
As someone who has

332
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,340
done business with them for a long time,

333
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,720
it seems to me
that their looming battle with Ming

334
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,682
made them want to control Joseon
and seize our food and soldiers.

335
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,226
They would have used any excuse

336
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,313
to invade Joseon for this purpose.

337
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:26,861
All the talk about how the war resulted
from Joseon's weak complacency

338
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,780
is just

339
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,533
their tactic to shift the blame

340
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,703
onto Joseon.

341
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:42,752
Your Highness, will you
also fall for their cunning tactic?

342
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,674
Your Highness,

343
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:54,013
the Khan is more cunning
and meticulous than anyone.

344
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:59,227
The Khan grew up
fighting his own brothers for power.

345
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:03,064
He witnessed his father, Nurhaci,
killing his eldest brother.

346
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:05,525
So,

347
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,195
the first thing he did
after becoming the Khan

348
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,699
was to force Dorgon's mother

349
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,286
to loyally follow the king into his grave.

350
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,749
Those you are dealing with

351
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,877
are people who are willing

352
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,631
to throw away everything to survive.

353
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,177
They are desperate enough…

354
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,807
to kill their own sons

355
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,769
or their brothers' mothers to survive.

356
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,274
To such people…

357
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,780
what would Your Highness's life be worth?

358
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,832
Come in.

359
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,606
Why have the troops and provisions
promised by Joseon not yet arrived?

360
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,817
Send all 750 tons of rice at once,

361
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,488
and quickly send word
that it will be sent to Fenghuang Palace!

362
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,575
Since we lost to the barbarians,

363
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:44,582
the Joseon scholars are saying that
all the people can do is die with dignity

364
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,544
or live in humiliation.

365
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,342
Do you think the same way, Your Highness?

366
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,259
Then,

367
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,096
are you saying there is another way?

368
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,180
Yes.

369
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,099
It is a path

370
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,769
that requires great courage.

371
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,735
We can face the barbarians,

372
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,071
and live

373
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,116
boldly.

374
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,619
There is no time to be cowardly or to die.

375
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,289
You must live.

376
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,751
You must survive…

377
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,842
to see better days in the future.

378
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,518
General,

379
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,522
although I earnestly wish
to send provisions,

380
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:52,650
it is difficult to prepare
750 tons of rice at once,

381
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,153
so how about mixing in some millet?

382
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,656
What do you think, General?

383
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,504
Mixing rice and millet is fine,

384
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,091
but as it is urgent, do not delay.

385
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:34,317
The crown prince ordered millet
to be mixed into the military provisions?

386
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,860
Yes, Your Majesty.

387
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:39,697
It was truly difficult
to prepare 750 tons of rice at once,

388
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,493
but the crown prince's idea
has reduced the burden on our people,

389
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,496
and the Qing people
are also greatly satisfied.

390
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,501
That is good.

391
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,338
However, I heard

392
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,257
that the crown prince
has been learning Manchu script

393
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:01,427
and even followed the Khan
in observing the Wanlian ceremony.

394
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:06,057
The Khan was said to be
extremely pleased to see the crown prince

395
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,101
participate in the ritual
early in the morning.

396
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,707
This is for the master's memorial rite.

397
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,462
Please take good care of them.

398
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,048
I would like to sell them myself, but…

399
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,633
Young lady!

400
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:44,470
People are already gossiping
about a noble lady working with men.

401
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,430
How could you think
of selling them yourself?

402
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,933
Over my dead body.

403
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,479
You may have to die several times over
in the coming future.

404
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,982
Only go to the large, tile-roofed houses

405
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,442
and ask if they need brass bowls.
I am counting on you.

406
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,902
Yes, I understand.

407
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,737
Do not worry, young lady.

408
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,366
He may not know much else,
but he is excellent at haggling deals.

409
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,162
I will sell everything
and be back in half a day!

410
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,254
-I will sell everything and come back!
-Take care.

411
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,095
Brass bowls from the smithy?

412
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,638
Yes.

413
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,643
She left us one to use
for Father's memorial rite.

414
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,813
You do not know how capable Gil-chae is.

415
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,566
Women working outside…

416
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:40,651
It is my fault.

417
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:45,323
I am trying to tell you not to worry
since we are all doing well.

418
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,119
More importantly,
there is a way for you to avoid exile.

419
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,793
There is someone who can sway
the opinion of the scholars.

420
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,088
I hear that this time,
he wants to vindicate

421
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,008
those who were imprisoned
for not yielding to Qing.

422
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,803
He has been secluded
in the mountains for a long time.

423
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,725
But when the barbarians invaded,
he gathered armies to fight them off

424
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,186
and revealed himself to the world.

425
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,189
They say his scholarship

426
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,150
has reached such heights
that he is considered a sage in Joseon.

427
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:33,162
Are you the wife
of former Compiler Nam Yeon-jun?

428
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,247
Do you know my husband?

429
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,917
Nam Yeon-jun is
the upright censor who was dismissed

430
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,795
for refusing to go to Qing
as a document officer.

431
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,714
How could I not know that name?

432
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:49,470
I heard that you are gathering support
for people like my husband.

433
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,598
-So--
-Did Compiler Nam

434
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,476
send you to me?

435
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,852
No.

436
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,314
I came because I heard of your reputation.

437
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,399
This matter

438
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,819
depends not on me but on your husband.

439
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,781
How does he feel now

440
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,951
about losing the king's favor

441
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:16,330
by refusing the mission
as a document official?

442
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,380
Hey, what are you selling?

443
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,882
Are you interested in buying?

444
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:31,095
I am selling brass bowls.

445
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,557
Oh, my. Precious brass bowls?

446
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,561
You stand to make
a lot of money this time.

447
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,855
It will go to our lady, not me.

448
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:45,776
Well, if I sell everything,
she might give me enough for a drink.

449
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:52,616
By the way, is this upper road
the shortcut to Bukchon?

450
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:57,288
Hey, if you go this way,
you will go in a big circle.

451
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,290
You got lucky. Follow me.

452
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,042
I am also on my way to Bukchon.
Let us go together.

453
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,879
-No, this way--
-I am telling you, it is a long detour.

454
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:08,174
-Let us go.
-All right then.

455
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,262
Let us go sell some brass bowls.

456
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,848
Those precious brass bowls…

457
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,019
You fool!

458
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,812
You idiot!

459
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,733
Such precious objects.

460
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,611
My lady, please kill me.

461
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,821
Just kill me, my lady.

462
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:35,701
What am I going to do?
Those bowls were so precious!

463
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,871
For goodness' sake.

464
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,417
They were such precious bowls.

465
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,213
Where are they? Where did those men go?

466
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,215
-Lead the way!
-Young lady!

467
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,425
-This way?
-Yes.

468
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,054
They fled a while back.
We won't be able to find them.

469
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,722
We will find them.

470
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,057
Where did they go?

471
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:03,020
Young lady, can we not just go back?

472
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,271
Be quiet.

473
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:09,860
Young lady.

474
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,242
So what I did was…

475
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,203
Young lady, please stop.

476
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,454
He said he was selling. So…

477
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,705
Give me back my bowls!

478
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,961
-Are you here alone?
-I said give me back my bowls!

479
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,839
You came looking for those brass bowls.

480
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:31,924
Alone?

481
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,300
With just an axe?

482
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:37,888
Well,

483
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,724
come here and take them!

484
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,186
Bak-dae.

485
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:47,982
What? You came with a bat?

486
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,818
A tiny, little bat?

487
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:51,944
Hey, little bat!

488
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,862
Where are you, little bat?

489
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,906
Little bat? Those bastards.

490
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,032
What are you doing?

491
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,493
I said come and take them.

492
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,958
Well, today's catch was dull,

493
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,586
but something tasty has rolled in…

494
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,092
My bowls…

495
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,597
Young lady,
we already traded them for candy.

496
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,223
You think we would still have them?

497
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,685
You are still so naive.

498
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,861
What was that? A bat?

499
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,920
Run!

500
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,387
My lady.

501
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,973
There is only one set left.

502
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,684
My bowls…

503
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,977
Only one set…

504
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,745
Let us stop now.

505
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,332
I worry you will only get hurt.

506
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,001
One set remains.

507
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,837
I will sell it and make a profit.

508
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,173
This time, I will sell it myself.

509
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,257
My lady.

510
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,931
Now there are two sets.

511
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,352
What about our cut?

512
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,145
What will we do now?

513
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,988
What about the promised rice?

514
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,949
This is not over yet.

515
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,659
So move out of the way. Now!

516
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,299
Jang-hyeon.

517
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,511
The ginseng trade went very well.

518
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,139
We made 5000 yang.

519
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,767
Exchange 500 for white paper
and send it to the princes.

520
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:33,439
Exchange 500 for silk
and send it to the imperial women.

521
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,608
I will give General Yonggoldae
his portion myself.

522
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:42,239
You know, making money is good and all,

523
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,451
but are we not getting
too friendly with the barbarians?

524
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,496
What is wrong with pleasing
those we need to impress?

525
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:54,293
If we overdo it, we will not be treated
as humans when we return to Joseon.

526
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:57,921
Have you forgotten

527
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,549
my origin?

528
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,932
I started out as a lowlife.

529
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,061
Enjoy your meal.

530
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,607
Let us drink to our hearts' content.
Drink up.

531
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,192
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

532
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,985
This is satisfying.

533
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:23,071
Have you ever had food like this before?

534
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,656
It tastes good.

535
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,872
This is the finest bamboo extract.

536
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,708
Even Dorgon cannot easily obtain this.

537
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:39,755
I present it only to you
who are in this room.

538
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:49,473
That is all for us?

539
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:50,724
It is indeed the finest.

540
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,559
This is very satisfying.

541
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,895
It is satisfying indeed. Thank you.

542
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,104
I am satisfied.

543
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,775
-Let us drink!
-Let us drink!

544
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,127
We do need brass bowls.

545
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:23,131
But we have no rice
or cotton to pay for them.

546
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,927
But instead of rice,
you do have ornaments, do you not?

547
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,888
Those will do.

548
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,519
These are two sets
of the finest brass bowls.

549
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,521
These are not enough.

550
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,538
Young lady,

551
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,833
you got the price
of four sets for just two.

552
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:04,631
But who would buy jade rings
or silver hairpins in times like these?

553
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,300
We will go to the kisaengs' lodging.

554
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:10,137
Only kisaengs will buy these now.

555
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,597
Goodness.

556
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,974
How could you go to the kisaengs' lodging?

557
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,768
This time, I mean it when I say,
"Over my dead"…

558
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,105
Is this all?

559
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:23,108
Silver hairpins and rings
are common for us.

560
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:27,696
That may be so,
but these belonged to a noble lady.

561
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,406
The craftsmanship is unique.

562
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,532
Oh, please.

563
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:35,203
Does a silver ring
become gold when nobles use it?

564
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,043
How about this one?

565
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:47,883
How about you wear it in your hair
and dance like us kisaengs?

566
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,635
We should test how it looks.

567
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:50,844
Please stop--

568
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,764
Shall I?

569
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,573
How does it look? Does it shine brightly?

570
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,959
A noble lady catering to kisaengs?

571
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,295
That is unbelievable.

572
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:30,926
I told you she was just a noble lady
with a pretty face and nothing else.

573
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:34,179
I heard she has even
received a wedding box.

574
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,722
Oh, gosh…

575
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,475
Are you done talking?

576
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,394
What did you just say?

577
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,562
What did you say?

578
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,064
What did you just say?

579
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,691
You bastard!

580
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,984
You lost the brass bowls,
and now you are making a fuss?

581
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:48,944
What?

582
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,612
-Why, you…
-Stop!

583
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,408
I will buy it.

584
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,535
How much would you like?

585
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,578
It is not about the price.

586
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,748
I heard the Qing envoys visit here often.

587
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,168
Have you heard anything?

588
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,463
I have heard Joseon interpreters talking…

589
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:14,094
But if I speak of it, I might be punished.

590
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,807
I promise, no harm will come to you.

591
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:22,853
Just tell me what they are
planning to buy this time.

592
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:39,161
Is trading with barbarians
that profitable?

593
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:40,662
Very.

594
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,373
Of course, it takes some effort.

595
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,167
Some effort?

596
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,668
First,

597
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,131
I find field owners desperate
for workers and buy the produce early.

598
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,760
The owners avoid spoilage,

599
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:57,471
and I buy goods for cheap.

600
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:01,099
If not harvested now, the ginger will rot.

601
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,851
Why are you not harvesting?

602
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:06,354
My children all died in the chaos.

603
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,817
Without workers, everything is rotting.

604
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:16,281
If you need ginger, take what you need
and pay as you see fit.

605
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,201
Our workers will harvest.

606
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:20,952
We will pay for the ginger.

607
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,162
In return,

608
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,956
sell us all the ginger in this field.

609
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,673
It seems no one is buying ginger.

610
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,431
What would you like to buy?

611
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,475
Dried ginger.

612
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,727
-I don't have any!
-To sell.

613
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:46,812
You are selling?

614
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,358
I cannot give you much.

615
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,653
So, how much are you asking for?

616
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,617
This place was
full of dried ginger before.

617
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,953
Why is there none today? Perhaps…

618
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,080
Young lady!

619
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,792
The Qing people are buying ginger.

620
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:11,837
All the ginger is sold out,
so you can sell them at any price!

621
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,214
They are buying at three,
no, five times the price!

622
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,847
The rice is here!

623
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,559
Rice!

624
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,852
Put the rice here!

625
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,270
It is rice!

626
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,147
Rice!

627
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,483
What a joyous occasion!

628
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:37,571
I have only earned three sacks
due to my mistake,

629
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,490
so I shall share all three with you,

630
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,784
not just half as promised.

631
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,453
You go first.

632
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:57,924
I turned two sets of brass bowls
into three sacks of rice.

633
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,261
It is different
from our initial agreement, but…

634
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:05,348
Will you not trust my skills once more

635
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,602
and work with me?

636
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,147
You boasted that we would
earn half a sack each,

637
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,941
and now you are
making a show with just this…

638
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:19,112
I cannot remember the last time
I saw such white rice.

639
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,282
If you will have me, I will work hard.

640
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,367
Me too. Count me in.

641
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:25,535
Please hire me too.

642
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,621
-Me too.
-I want in.

643
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,456
I will do it.

644
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,166
Please pay us.

645
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,711
Thank you.

646
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,171
Thank you all!

647
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,352
Take a look at your leisure.

648
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,774
What do you think?

649
00:53:57,233 --> 00:54:00,070
Do you not need one at this age?

650
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:05,116
Let me try it on too.

651
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,701
The hairpin…

652
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,381
Put the cotton cloth here.

653
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,799
Put the rice here.

654
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,927
That goes there,
and the big one goes there.

655
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,767
Thank you.

656
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,653
Father, eat up.

657
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:46,616
Je-nam, make sure
to chew well and eat a lot.

658
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,827
Help yourself. There is plenty of rice.

659
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,706
Shall we eat some meat?

660
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,790
Meat!

661
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:57,961
Do you like that?

662
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,087
Have some more meat.

663
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,296
Meat.

664
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:04,426
The sleek lines
on our knives are exquisite.

665
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,344
The color is truly elegant.

666
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,139
It is not excessive, yet not dull.

667
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,348
Is that all?

668
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,268
The handles are designed
for quick drawing.

669
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:16,146
Of course, it is best not to need it.

670
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,566
What do you think?
It is incomparable to other knives--

671
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,401
Yes, it is good.

672
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,947
This is my husband's answer.

673
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,876
If you tell me to go as a document
official and bow to barbarians again,

674
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,211
I will refuse once more.

675
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:46,301
I told His Majesty that only
the correct path could save Joseon.

676
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,679
If I bow to barbarians for my own sake,

677
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:54,184
whose heart can I move
to change the world?

678
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,145
I am not defying His Majesty

679
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,106
but following a greater principle.

680
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,650
I would rather wait

681
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:06,738
for the time of a sage in exile.

682
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,950
The time of a sage…

683
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,458
Sir,

684
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:23,963
I would like to provide ink and paper
for the students at the academy.

685
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,840
Would you accept?

686
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,300
Are you trying

687
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,678
to buy my favor with wealth?

688
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,472
How could I do that?

689
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,934
My father and Eun-ae's father

690
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:39,187
once established a small academy
to teach students.

691
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,731
Compiler Nam studied there too.

692
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:45,068
During the chaos,
Eun-ae's father passed away,

693
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:48,321
and my father lost his mind.

694
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:50,990
Now we can no longer hear

695
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:55,703
their clear voices teaching students.

696
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:59,916
Seeing you here
with the young students reminds me

697
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,920
of my father in the past.

698
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:09,467
The paper and inkstone

699
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,512
represent my feelings toward my father.

700
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,514
Please accept them.

701
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:32,449
So, these are all petitions
for the release of Compiler Nam?

702
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:38,163
How did petitions suddenly flood in
from all eight provinces?

703
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:39,998
Well…

704
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:43,084
Is it Jang Cheol's doing again?

705
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,090
The scholars

706
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:53,636
spit at me for bowing to barbarians,

707
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,516
while praising Jang Cheol
for firmly rejecting them.

708
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,396
If I ignore Jang Cheol's will,

709
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,483
they will surely say
the world is too filthy

710
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,027
for a righteous man
to fulfill his intentions.

711
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,135
Did I not tell you?

712
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,930
You are way more reliable…

713
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:24,018
than a bunch of feeble scholars.

714
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:26,729
Yes.

715
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,690
Now,

716
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:33,152
watch how I feed and clothe my people.

717
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:04,475
We need to make ten knives
and twenty iron rakes today.

718
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,270
I have ordered two barrels of liquor
and ten boiled chickens,

719
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,355
so eat and drink your fill
when the work is done!

720
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,857
-Yes, my lady!
-Yes, my lady!

721
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,609
Eat to your hearts' content!

722
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,987
The liquor is plentiful!

723
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,663
Thanks to your oversight,
I have made a great profit.

724
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,294
I know.

725
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,463
You are still

726
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:35,882
a rat.

727
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,348
However…

728
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,144
I am keeping you around as you are useful.

729
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,819
Shall I tell you what you longed to hear?

730
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:01,074
His Majesty will soon allow
the crown prince to visit Joseon.

731
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,786
Do not forget my efforts.

732
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,079
Understand?

733
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,476
The Khan has

734
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,896
truly allowed a visit to Joseon?

735
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,900
I can see my father and tend to him?

736
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,027
That is correct, Your Highness!

737
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:42,407
Your Highness.

738
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:47,537
The Khan allowed
the crown prince to come to Joseon?

739
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:49,372
Yes, Your Majesty.

740
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,667
Upon hearing of Your Majesty's illness,

741
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:56,254
they earnestly requested
to visit you to pay their respects.

742
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,506
The Qing were moved by this sentiment.

743
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:03,678
I told the crown prince
it would be troublesome to come

744
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,347
and that he should not request it.

745
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,602
If the crown prince comes,

746
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:15,356
his son must go to Shenyang in his place.

747
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,736
How can the young prince endure
such a perilous journey?

748
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,076
The crown prince is going to Joseon?

749
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,580
We are going too, right?

750
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,082
Then I will go ahead first.

751
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,042
Why?

752
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,879
Usimjeong in Hanyang
has been empty for a while.

753
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:41,090
I will clean and prepare food.

754
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:42,717
Why prepare in advance?

755
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:44,552
It is hardly a special occasion.

756
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:47,972
You will complain if the food is not good.

757
01:02:48,681 --> 01:02:50,725
You think things just appear magically?

758
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,313
Then while you are there…

759
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:00,193
tell Lady Gil-chae I am coming.

760
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,571
She likes to dress up,

761
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,324
so give her time to prepare.

762
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,567
Bring some more meat.

763
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,237
Look at the marbling on this meat.

764
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,240
This place always has good meat.

765
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:55,998
Please, eat.

766
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:11,472
Grilling it on the fire
makes it even more delicious.

767
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,266
Have more.

768
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,982
Do you know what
people are saying about us?

769
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,152
Since we are often together,

770
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:28,906
they keep questioning
if something is going on between us.

771
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,285
Who cares what others say?

772
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:37,206
Madam. Please wrap up some meat for us!

773
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,624
Please eat up.

774
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,334
This side too.

775
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,752
One second.

776
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,380
There you go.

777
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,090
Oh, Je-nam.

778
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,927
Chew well, okay?

779
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,518
Did you eat with that officer again?

780
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:01,230
How embarrassing.

781
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,567
What is wrong with her?

782
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:06,944
Be careful of the barbarians.

783
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:15,453
Father.

784
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:19,999
Do you remember
when we lived in Neunggun-ri?

785
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:35,890
Now…

786
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:40,561
I will protect you, Father.

787
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,862
I will take good care
of Yeong-chae and Je-nam too.

788
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:56,994
I will dress Je-nam

789
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:01,248
in silk and leather shoes
and help him pass the school exam.

790
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,212
For Yeong-chae, I will fill up
a paulownia chest until it bursts

791
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:09,173
for her dowry so she can get married.

792
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,605
What is it?

793
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,324
Gil-chae.

794
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:41,455
Will you really fill a paulownia chest
with silk for me to get married?

795
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,542
Is it okay to accept help
from your embarrassing sister?

796
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:47,086
I was only embarrassed
because people have been talking.

797
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:50,339
Let them gossip.

798
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,425
You cannot die from criticism.

799
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:54,885
You die from not eating.

800
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:57,179
Got that?

801
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,264
I get it.

802
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,183
But

803
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,020
do you not like the officer?

804
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:06,772
He seems to like you.

805
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,024
Not this again.

806
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:10,860
Let us sleep.

807
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:18,075
Are you still thinking of that man?

808
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,499
Stop thinking about someone who is dead.

809
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:35,217
I will bring you
the most beautiful pair of floral shoes.

810
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:41,807
Liar.

811
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,689
This is a sample I made.

812
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:52,026
This knife can hold
chopsticks, an ear pick,

813
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:53,611
or small scissors.

814
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:59,492
You can peel fruit, dig herbs,
crack chestnuts…

815
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,827
So, it is for eating?

816
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,831
Well, I do not know
much about women's items…

817
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:10,419
I should have another bowl of soup.

818
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:12,838
-Madam.
-Yes?

819
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,840
-Another bowl of soup here, please.
-Yes.

820
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,258
-Give me a lot.
-All right.

821
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,597
One must eat a lot to feel full,

822
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,016
and when one feels full,
one becomes confident,

823
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:27,520
and one needs confidence to say
what needs to be said.

824
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,231
So, my lady…

825
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,863
will you marry me?

826
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:56,507
I am sorry.

827
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,102
I am so sorry.

828
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,312
I apologize.

829
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:17,611
It is nice to hear.

830
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:20,281
It has been so long.

831
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:24,827
In the past,

832
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:28,414
men would beg me to marry them on sight.

833
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,584
Some of those young men of Neunggun-ri

834
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,920
died or were injured in the war.

835
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,840
Others left Neunggun-ri.

836
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,554
I wonder where they are now
and how they are living.

837
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:46,849
-My lady, I--
-I will pretend I did not hear it,

838
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,642
so do not be embarrassed.

839
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,529
Is that person not already dead?

840
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,621
Lady Gil-chae,

841
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,666
Lee Jang-hyeon has arrived.

842
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:00,464
Like this?

843
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,675
-No, the other way.
-The other way…

844
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,970
-Like this?
-No.

845
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:07,888
Oh, come on!

846
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,182
This is really frustrating.

847
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,132
Do not come anymore.

848
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,804
I plan to taste
all the delicacies in this world,

849
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:53,559
enjoy the sights of all eight
provinces of Joseon, and live a full life.

850
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:01,984
We shall meet later…

851
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:07,865
in the very distant future.

852
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:14,580
Let us meet again then.

853
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,438
It was definitely somewhere around here.

854
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,484
-Jang-hyeon.
-Yes?

855
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:45,486
Could she have gotten married
in the meantime?

856
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:47,071
Maybe to Young Master Yeon-jun,

857
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,406
but she could not have fallen
for another man.

858
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:51,700
I meant Jong-jong, not Lady Gil-chae.

859
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:53,660
Jeez.

860
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,123
Come to think of it,

861
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:02,086
it is unfortunate for Compiler Nam,
but it might be for the best.

862
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:05,839
Lady Gil-chae must have thought a lot

863
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:09,510
about the rich Lee Jang-hyeon
while she struggled.

864
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:14,181
Now when I show up,

865
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:17,976
she will want to run into my arms.

866
01:13:22,272 --> 01:13:24,525
React a little. Come on.

867
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:26,610
Buy a wedding box!

868
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:30,030
Buy a box!

869
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:32,616
Buy a box!

870
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:35,244
I heard the new bride has quite a temper.

871
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:36,912
Watch your mouth.

872
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:38,122
New bride?

873
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:40,791
I heard she has already
been betrothed before.

874
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:43,252
-She is a used bride.
-Indeed.

875
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:44,336
Let us go.

876
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:47,589
Buy a box!

877
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,885
-Anyone want to buy a box?
-Goodness.

878
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:55,139
Let us quickly retire.

879
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:58,684
Is that not Madam Bangdu?

880
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:00,644
I cannot go in yet.

881
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:04,106
Head inside already.

882
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:06,942
-I cannot take the box inside.
-Why not?

883
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:09,194
Maybe I could if I saw the bride's face.

884
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,988
The bride is here.

885
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:27,629
A bride should not be out and about!

886
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:33,051
The bride is here, so go home now.

887
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,513
Jong-jong!

888
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:50,254
Can you not live one day without a man?

889
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:51,964
Is that wrong?

890
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:55,467
If you like men so much,
I should have also had a chance.

891
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,302
I thought you were dead.

892
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:58,220
Leave with me.

893
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:00,472
Did you ask Lady Gil-chae
to leave with you?

894
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:03,934
He is someone who leaves on a whim.

895
01:16:04,017 --> 01:16:05,477
Why should I believe him now?

896
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,689
It is not a crime for a husband
to kill an adulterous wife and her lover.

897
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:10,816
You have no idea what she means to me.

898
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,819
What if people point fingers at me
and call me a used woman?

899
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:17,489
It does not matter now.
Your thoughts do not matter either.

900
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,993
I must make you mine.
