1
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,729
How about this, then?

2
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,984
I vow this by the moonlight.

3
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,238
Go to Ganghwa Island…

4
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,701
and wherever you go…

5
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,372
I will surely…

6
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,084
come find you.

7
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,720
What would you have done
if I had refused to go?

8
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,474
Did you think I would go anywhere
just because you asked?

9
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,017
Yes.

10
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,770
By the way, did I not tell you

11
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,022
to address me like I am an older brother?

12
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:48,775
How do I

13
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,360
wear this?

14
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,403
You always rush.

15
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,533
Hey,

16
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,619
will your song work again this time?

17
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,164
Do not worry.

18
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,500
That song will surely work

19
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,710
on the barbarians.

20
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,420
You are quite confident.

21
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,091
If it fails, we shall die together.

22
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,468
What are you saying?

23
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,889
It is time to go.
You shall depart with the envoys

24
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,767
and hang back at the barbarians' camp
when the time is right.

25
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,852
Let us go.

26
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,361
I do not mind dying

27
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,197
together.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,084
Where are you from?

29
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,128
From Tosan.

30
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,005
Those darn Joseon people.

31
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,632
They are not as gentle as I thought.

32
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,468
They are ruthless.

33
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,514
They are so annoying.
Even Joseon dogs are tough.

34
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,726
This one still limps from a dog bite.

35
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,940
Look over there!

36
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:11,858
Bow down.

37
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,902
His Majesty.

38
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,241
It is the yongjeong.

39
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,161
That flag always moves with the Khan.

40
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,830
Wherever the Khan goes, that flag follows.

41
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,750
If you see that flag,
it means the Khan is there.

42
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,587
So the Khan is really here?

43
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,591
Most likely.

44
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,595
I must confirm it with my own eyes.

45
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:06,871
My baby

46
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:12,210
My sweet, precious baby

47
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,672
-My little treasure
-I will make the singing stop.

48
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,008
Go to sleep

49
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,219
Go to sleep, my treasure

50
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,681
Grow up well, little baby

51
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:30,853
How gentle is the breeze

52
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:36,859
Even the birds fly back to their nests

53
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,445
Sweet, precious baby

54
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,572
Go to sleep

55
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,657
General!

56
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,925
-Your Majesty.
-Come in!

57
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,713
It is the Khan.

58
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,269
Why is your song

59
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,814
so sorrowful?

60
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,691
Thinking of friends who died in battle,

61
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,692
my heart is sad.

62
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,444
I brought clothes

63
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,114
and food from my homeland,

64
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,034
but my heart felt empty
without the sounds of home.

65
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,080
But now, here you are.

66
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,460
Your Majesty, I am honored.

67
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,699
Come once a day to sing.

68
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,425
Our emperor is meticulous enough
to count the enemy's firewood,

69
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,595
but he can let his guard down recklessly.

70
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,975
He was very careless regarding
the soldiers in the Chahar battle.

71
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,187
How did you know we were in Chahar?

72
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,233
CHAHAR: REGION IN INNER MONGOLIA
CONQUERED BY QING IN 1635

73
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,401
Sand from Chahar.

74
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,111
You recognized it!

75
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,699
Yes, it is sand from Chahar,
the place where His Majesty

76
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,285
gained the Imperial Seal
for a great victory.

77
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,746
They say carrying sand
from there brings luck.

78
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,040
Is that so?

79
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,293
We shall see

80
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,087
if it is truly lucky.

81
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,592
General!

82
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,942
That is nothing.

83
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,319
No, it's nothing.

84
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,960
Will it be all right?

85
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,002
Do not worry.

86
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,422
I have never seen
a barbarian who dislikes money.

87
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,676
Do you know why
the Khan keeps waging wars?

88
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,179
He needs wealth to distribute
to his subordinates.

89
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,433
But that Yonggoldae
does not seem easy to handle.

90
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,393
I agree.

91
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,937
He is still a barbarian.

92
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,037
You are

93
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,248
not Mongolian

94
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,126
and definitely not a Manchu.

95
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,713
-Are you Han?
-No.

96
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,590
I am from Joseon.

97
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,508
A Joseon person?

98
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,511
I was taken captive
during the first Jin invasion.

99
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,724
I came because they said

100
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,059
if I guided well, I could become a gapsa.

101
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,480
You're leading the conquest
of your homeland?

102
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,483
Are you not ashamed?

103
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,112
In Joseon,

104
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,990
I was just a slave my whole life.

105
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,367
I spit at the thought of Joseon.

106
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,668
Where did you get this gold?

107
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,588
Do you not know

108
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,507
that an aide's possessions
belong to their master?

109
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,802
After my master abandoned me,

110
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,639
I found a box with gold in it.

111
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,809
It was big and heavy,

112
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,311
so I only brought a little.

113
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,646
There is

114
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,856
more gold?

115
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:49,940
Yes.

116
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,610
Since I am from Joseon,

117
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,820
I know where Joseon people

118
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,281
hide their valuables.

119
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,325
If you release me,

120
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,536
I will tell you where it is.

121
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,312
There was a man called Ha Seo-guk.

122
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,107
Your former king,

123
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,067
Gwanghae,

124
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,404
planted him as a spy

125
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,616
to find out about our plans.

126
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,369
He deceived me

127
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,788
and the emperor.

128
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,084
Or perhaps he was pitifully
used by both Joseon and Jin.

129
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,462
No!

130
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,691
It is you.

131
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,945
Grab this man.

132
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,793
Since it pains you
to see your friend get hurt,

133
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:37,214
I will torture him while you watch.

134
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,800
If you do not answer
my questions properly,

135
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,344
I will pull out his nails one by one.

136
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,765
General.

137
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,062
Look.

138
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,814
This one is more desperate.

139
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,358
I have a sharp eye for the truth.

140
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,787
I will ask again.

141
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,248
Where are you from?

142
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,336
How did you two meet?

143
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,756
If I sense you are lying…

144
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,637
that man

145
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,431
will die.

146
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,944
GANGHWA ISLAND

147
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,422
Why is it stuck upside down
like a bad omen?

148
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,865
My mother was
a Jurchen nomad from Hoeryong.

149
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,075
HOERYONG: NORTHERN PART
OF HAMGYEONG NORTH PROVINCE

150
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,953
My father was from Joseon.

151
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,416
My parents were killed
when the Joseon army attacked.

152
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,253
I became a slave
at the Eunsan government office.

153
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,844
I was attacked
and nearly killed by an animal

154
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,430
when this man saved me…

155
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,272
You sing quite well.

156
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,068
I just learned a few verses
of old Jurchen songs from my mother.

157
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,362
Why did you suddenly sing during the day?

158
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,660
Was it for His Majesty to hear?

159
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,745
No.

160
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,664
I never thought His Majesty would hear…

161
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,418
Very well.

162
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,503
So,

163
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,131
where are you from?

164
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,800
How did you two meet?

165
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,762
How many times
will you ask the same thing?

166
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,729
Just kill me instead.

167
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,772
Kill me!

168
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,905
I will bite my tongue and die here.

169
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:51,241
What will you do when His Majesty
wants to hear his homeland songs?

170
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,708
You are not lying.

171
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,508
Fine.

172
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,351
From now on,
sing your heart out for His Majesty.

173
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,359
You must make His Majesty happy!

174
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,735
Let us go.

175
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:49,842
Brother.

176
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,552
Brother…

177
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,057
Ryang-eum.

178
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,937
You did well.

179
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:08,652
Good job.

180
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,415
Your Highness!

181
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:22,958
Come in.

182
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,757
Your Highness,

183
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,925
a secret letter
from Jang-hyeon has arrived!

184
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,858
I have seen the Khan in the camp
by the Tancheon with my own eyes.

185
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,132
Dorgon has arrived.

186
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,134
DORGON: NURHACI'S 14TH SON

187
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,928
Who are those men?

188
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,727
Why are they sniffing like dogs
and glaring at the aides?

189
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,522
If it is a red belt…

190
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,860
Move it.

191
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,743
Dorgon's eastern army
has arrived at the fortress,

192
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,162
and the commanders-in-chief
brought Hong Ipo cannons.

193
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,249
There are 34 Hong Ipo cannons in total,

194
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:49,503
and all the Qing troops have
gathered below the fortress.

195
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,305
Hey, guy from Tosan.

196
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,599
-Have a taste.
-It is smooth.

197
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,851
Hurry up.

198
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:04,935
Quick.

199
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,019
Hurry up.

200
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,646
Drink!

201
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,253
They secured rice from Pungjeochang
and Gwangheungchang in the capital,

202
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,756
so they have plenty of provisions.

203
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,052
Their horses are so well-fed
and rested that their hairs glisten.

204
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,555
You would rather die
than have your hair cut?

205
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,474
Kill me, you jerks.

206
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,142
Just kill me!

207
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,769
Kill this one.

208
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,562
But it should not be an easy death.

209
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,358
Kill him by skinning his scalp.

210
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,836
Save me.

211
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,546
Please save me.

212
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,176
Save me.

213
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,055
They do not care about dying or killing,

214
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,723
and above all,

215
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,435
there is no fear in their eyes.

216
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,854
The Khan has come to Joseon.

217
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,983
They have come
to fight a battle they will not lose.

218
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,403
No, it is one they cannot afford to lose.

219
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,951
Now that the Khan is here,

220
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,705
we will suffer greatly if we resist.

221
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,207
Are you that afraid of the barbarians?

222
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,294
This is not about fear
but saving the nation.

223
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,629
We cannot save our nation
by bowing to the enemy.

224
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,839
Enough.

225
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,132
The Khan has arrived, no?

226
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,342
The Khan's arrival changes nothing!

227
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,302
Since…

228
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,056
the calamity we suffered
at the hands of the Hu in 1627…

229
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,933
THE HU: NORTHERN NOMADIC PEOPLE

230
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,520
…we have fearfully watched
the Jin grow in power day by day.

231
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,149
We did not anticipate they would choose

232
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,736
a direct invasion,
unlike the last time they attacked,

233
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,280
and advance south so quickly.

234
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,408
And now, I am trapped here.

235
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,120
Until now,

236
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,999
I have hesitated
about making peace negotiations,

237
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,419
but loyalist forces are now a lost cause,

238
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,464
and the Khan has settled at Tancheon.

239
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,216
Therefore,

240
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,471
I will now request peace with them

241
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,807
to prevent greater calamity.

242
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:50,535
The Joseon king is better than Zu Dashou

243
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,206
of Daling Fortress.

244
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,417
He sent a letter admitting

245
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,129
the mistakes that he has made.

246
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,175
Shall we send a reply?

247
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,763
Start it like this.

248
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,937
I am the benevolent and holy

249
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,855
Great Emperor of Qing.

250
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,067
I bestow this royal decree

251
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,861
on the king of Joseon.

252
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,741
The barbarians may have
always been arrogant and disrespectful,

253
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,619
but they have never
issued a royal decree before.

254
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:35,372
How dare they be so presumptuous!

255
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,501
We absolutely cannot
make peace with them now.

256
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,336
If we make peace,

257
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:44,047
we will be falling
into the dirty barbarians' trap,

258
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,676
and we will be criticized
by all future generations!

259
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,846
How dare they use the word "bestow"?

260
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,431
I have attained
an understanding of the universe

261
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,267
and received the will of the heavens.

262
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,020
I will generously nurture those who submit

263
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,482
and protect those who surrender,

264
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,945
but those who stubbornly refuse to submit

265
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,157
will be subjugated
in accordance with heavenly will.

266
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,125
It seems there is not enough milk.

267
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,339
Is this place truly safe?

268
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,760
Whether we win or lose,

269
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,847
I wish this wretched war
would end quickly.

270
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,223
But they say

271
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,559
if we lose to the barbarians,

272
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,062
they will capture all women

273
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,106
and rape them

274
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,609
and kill them.

275
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,487
So if we lose the war,

276
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,909
all women should commit suicide.

277
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,371
But, Lady Gil-chae,

278
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,708
I do not want to die.

279
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:02,918
Stop talking nonsense.

280
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,724
Destroy them, Your Majesty.

281
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,727
We cannot make peace with them.

282
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,272
-Destroy them, Your Majesty.
-Destroy them, Your Majesty.

283
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,567
-Destroy them, Your Majesty.
-Destroy them, Your Majesty.

284
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,152
They want us to send

285
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,864
the crown prince as a hostage

286
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:37,077
and demand that we call
their king "Your Majesty."

287
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,954
So, we must discuss

288
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,917
whether to address him
as "Your Majesty" in our letters.

289
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,338
Tell them

290
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,092
I will leave the fortress.

291
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,635
Your Highness!

292
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,805
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

293
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:12,112
If anyone speaks of sending
the crown prince as a hostage

294
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:16,199
and calling that barbarian king
"Your Majesty,"

295
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,576
I will treat them
as an enemy that killed my parents

296
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,745
and never associate with them again.

297
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,168
Your Majesty!

298
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:31,464
I have already committed
a great crime by tearing up the letter,

299
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,758
so even if you punish me first,

300
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,095
I beg you to think deeply
once more, Your Majesty!

301
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,224
What you have torn,

302
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,476
I will piece back together.

303
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,022
And if you tear it again…

304
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,984
I will piece it together again.

305
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,444
Your Majesty!

306
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,988
Once we call their king "Your Majesty,"

307
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,491
we will not be able
to avoid leaving the fortress.

308
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,493
Leave the fortress?

309
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,871
Do not speak such nonsense.

310
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,831
Once we leave the fortress,

311
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:09,294
it will be difficult to avoid
the shame of being dragged up north.

312
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,505
Throughout history,
no country or king has survived

313
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:16,593
when enemy troops
reached the fortress, Your Majesty.

314
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,530
Your Majesty. The Joseon king has finally

315
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,783
called you "Your Majesty" in his letter.

316
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,160
They will also send
the crown prince as a hostage.

317
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,121
We are almost there.

318
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,831
Now,

319
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,166
tell the Joseon king

320
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,460
to come out of the fortress

321
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,588
and become my subject.

322
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,590
But the Joseon people

323
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,928
will refuse to let that happen
even at the cost of their lives.

324
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,013
They fear that if their king
leaves the fortress,

325
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,057
they will suffer the same fate
as the Jingkang Incident.

326
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,518
JIN INVASION OF SONG
IN WHICH THE CAPITAL WAS TAKEN

327
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,602
I am aware.

328
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,312
However,

329
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,690
since I have come to Joseon,

330
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,943
the Joseon king…

331
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,906
must come out of the fortress.

332
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,158
Your Majesty,

333
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:27,247
you must not leave the fortress.

334
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,000
All of this is Choi Myeong-gil's fault.

335
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:35,213
He suggested sending envoys,
bringing immeasurable shame upon us,

336
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,090
and rushed to send replies,

337
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:41,428
scurrying about in fear
of offending the barbarians.

338
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,555
Choi Myeong-gil's crimes are so great

339
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,182
that there is nothing he could do
to atone for them!

340
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,018
Punish Choi Myeong-gil!

341
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:54,315
Punish Choi Myeong-gil, Your Majesty!

342
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,028
Punish Choi Myeong-gil, Your Majesty!

343
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,699
Punish Choi Myeong-gil, Your Majesty!

344
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:06,077
Punish Choi Myeong-gil, Your Majesty!

345
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,956
Punish Choi Myeong-gil, Your Majesty!

346
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,458
Do I really have

347
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,961
no choice but to leave the fortress?

348
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:19,466
If they intended to spare Your Majesty
and preserve our nation,

349
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,970
why would they make you
leave the fortress?

350
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,222
Surely they are

351
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,101
waiting for Your Majesty to come out

352
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,773
to repeat the Jingkang Incident.

353
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:35,857
Your Majesty.

354
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,652
No matter what it takes,

355
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,949
I will prevent you
from leaving the fortress.

356
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,619
Oh, dear.

357
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,123
I am striving to live…

358
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,462
only to experience such suffering.

359
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:03,760
Your Majesty.

360
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,516
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

361
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:12,101
Your Majesty.

362
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:16,314
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

363
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:22,070
-Your Majesty…
-Your Majesty…

364
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,496
As you wish,

365
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,708
we will expose all the officials
who opposed peace and send them out,

366
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,336
and send the crown prince as a hostage.

367
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,004
But please

368
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,715
do not make our king leave the fortress.

369
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:47,053
They will send out the officials
who opposed making peace

370
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,138
and send the crown prince as a hostage.

371
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,684
However, they say it is difficult
to send out the king.

372
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,025
Are you determined
to go against our emperor's wishes

373
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,278
and see great bloodshed?

374
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,783
Is this rebellious attitude
the Joseon king's intention?

375
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,952
No, it is not.

376
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,412
I will tell His Majesty

377
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,164
that your king continues
to disrespect our emperor.

378
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,167
I cannot be held responsible
for what happens next!

379
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,503
General.

380
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,590
This is not our king's intention.

381
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,174
It is us who are at fault.

382
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:31,639
We cannot bear to abandon His Majesty.

383
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,605
I have a duty to make
His Majesty's true intentions known

384
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,274
even if I must tear out
my intestines to prove my honesty.

385
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,487
General…

386
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,535
Their king will not even fight in the war,

387
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,288
yet they adore him that much?

388
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,873
These Joseon people

389
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,459
are a truly interesting people.

390
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,922
Tell the envoys I will never
meet with them again

391
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,425
unless they tell me
their king has left the fortress.

392
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:08,885
Yes, Your Majesty!

393
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,440
Is there still no reply from them?

394
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,443
They said not to send envoys

395
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,737
until we agreed to you
leaving the fortress…

396
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,492
I have not heard roosters crowing lately.

397
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,871
It must be because they have
all been given to me for sustenance.

398
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,458
From now on, do not offer me chicken.

399
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,514
Let us leave.

400
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,311
The Khan has threatened to reject envoys
until the Joseon king leaves the fortress.

401
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,149
But His Majesty is refusing to come out.

402
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,484
There is nothing left for us to do.

403
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:53,322
Whatever happens, we need
something to end this war quickly.

404
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,116
Why are you being like this?

405
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,201
You have never cared
for this nation before.

406
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,997
You are right.

407
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,168
But now, I am curious
about the nation's fate.

408
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,963
You are risking your life doing this.

409
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,425
But have you received
a proper reply from the crown prince?

410
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,218
Does he even trust you?

411
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,305
What does it matter
if the crown prince recognizes me or not?

412
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,407
His Majesty says

413
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,577
the Joseon king
must leave the fortress right now.

414
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,412
If you refuse,

415
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,624
we shall fight!

416
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,001
Heaven will decide the outcome!

417
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,305
The enemy is suddenly rushing
the peace negotiations

418
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,390
and intimidating us
by firing Hong Ipo cannons!

419
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,813
Surely,

420
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,732
something urgent
has happened to the enemy.

421
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,692
Perhaps the loyalist forces have arrived

422
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,277
and attacked them from behind?

423
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:14,737
If not,

424
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,574
perhaps there is
an urgent matter in their homeland.

425
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:26,499
The enemy is suddenly urging the king
to either fight or leave the fortress

426
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,876
in an effort to wrap things up.

427
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,295
Have the loyalist forces arrived?

428
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,422
Or has a problem arisen in their homeland?

429
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,299
Find out quickly.

430
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,140
They have finally contacted us
now that things are urgent.

431
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,143
If the loyalist forces had attacked,
there would be more wounded.

432
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,270
That is not it.

433
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,612
Is what you said true?

434
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,489
You put His Majesty in danger.

435
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,784
Yet you still hope…

436
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,624
to live after that?

437
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,808
I have come to sing for His Majesty.

438
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,312
There is no need to come anymore.

439
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,239
What did you say that man's job was?

440
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,407
Red belt.

441
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,118
He might be a sadugwan.

442
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,079
Sadugwan?

443
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,208
An official who discovers
and reports epidemics.

444
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,410
What are you doing here?

445
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,293
I told you there is no need
to sing anymore.

446
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,757
My sand.

447
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,426
Please return it to me.

448
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,473
It is an object that protects my life,

449
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,141
especially…

450
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,104
in a time of danger like now.

451
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,358
Most people have caught on.

452
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,113
The commanders-in-chief and chieftains
have not been seen for days.

453
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:03,906
So,

454
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,118
it seems to me I might die here.

455
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,663
So, please return it to me!

456
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,420
As a matter of fact,

457
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,965
I was worried that we were
all headed for death.

458
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,095
But this works out well.

459
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,556
You might live if you are lucky.

460
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:32,101
Help the other aides.

461
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,595
Smallpox.

462
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,191
Smallpox is spreading
among the barbarians.

463
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,321
Let the crown prince know that smallpox
is spreading among the barbarians.

464
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,948
Let us go together.
You have never had smallpox.

465
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,202
Not now. The Khan is nowhere to be seen.

466
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,749
I need to find out if the Khan has
caught smallpox or if he is just hiding.

467
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,959
So, hurry.

468
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,799
Smallpox?

469
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,219
The reason they're rushing negotiations

470
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,180
is because smallpox is spreading
in the Qing army camp.

471
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,225
They executed the sadugwan to punish him,

472
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,686
and the Khan, the commanders-in-chief,
the chieftains, and so on

473
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,563
have not been seen for days.

474
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,484
Whether the Khan is hiding
because he is vulnerable

475
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,362
or if he has been afflicted
by smallpox is still unknown,

476
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,781
but if he is alive,

477
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:13,577
the Khan will no longer
wait leisurely for surrender

478
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,288
but will use all means

479
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,125
to pressure His Majesty in the fortress.

480
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,043
If we do not hurry,

481
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,921
there will be great bloodshed.

482
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,551
What should we do?

483
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,516
The Khan promised

484
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,728
that if we surrendered,
he would preserve our nation, right?

485
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,857
Your Majesty,

486
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,901
although the barbarians
are known to lie frequently,

487
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,153
how about

488
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,448
trusting them just this once?

489
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,532
No.

490
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,453
Even though we agreed
to serve the Khan as emperor,

491
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,081
the fact that they still insist
on me leaving the fortress

492
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:03,294
means they must be plotting something
similar to the Jingkang Incident.

493
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,589
You are also aware, are you not?

494
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,717
When Huizong was being
taken to the Jin Dynasty,

495
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,887
a Jin general threw wine
and meat on the ground

496
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,597
and forced him to eat it.

497
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,682
Is that all?

498
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,978
They say they made Empress Zhou,
Qinzong's wife, pour wine for them.

499
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,190
I would rather die
than suffer such humiliation…

500
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,274
However,

501
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,944
if we do not hurry with the negotiations,
there could be great bloodshed.

502
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,779
Great bloodshed?

503
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,574
The threat they made earlier
about invading Ganghwa Island

504
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,409
might not have been just a bluff.

505
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,957
The barbarians are only strong on land.
They are clumsy on water.

506
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,252
-Ganghwa Island is safe.
-But Your Majesty,

507
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,421
now that the Khan has come here in person,

508
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,381
if you do not come out of the fortress…

509
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,717
Do you wish for me to leave the fortress?

510
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,350
I just

511
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:03,020
want to protect our nation.

512
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,691
They say they will preserve the nation
if you leave the fortress, so…

513
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,486
How could the crown prince
say such a thing?

514
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:13,531
Your Majesty, please punish me!

515
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,082
So, they have decided

516
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,710
not to send their king
out of the fortress?

517
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,379
Yes.

518
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,131
The Joseon people must think

519
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:36,345
that because I am dealing with Ming,
I do not take them seriously.

520
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,973
However,

521
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:43,519
I have risked everything by coming here.

522
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,980
By subjugating Joseon,

523
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,733
which has maintained loyalty
to the Ming all this time,

524
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,612
I can become the true emperor
with the divine right to rule.

525
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,699
Despite the smallpox epidemic…

526
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,161
I will not give up.

527
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,039
I will surely…

528
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,459
be victorious in Joseon.

529
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,214
Send a boat to Ganghwa Island.

530
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,758
Conquer Ganghwa

531
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,760
at any cost.

532
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,847
Give it back!
I told you it is our pot lid.

533
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,516
What are you talking about?
Can you not see this mark?

534
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,686
All my life, I've never seen
someone petty enough to steal a pot lid!

535
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,355
-Finished talking?
-Yes, what are you gonna do about it?

536
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,773
That darn pot lid.

537
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:33,736
What a thing to drag around
and fight over while fleeing.

538
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,280
-For goodness' sake.
-I am telling you it is mine!

539
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:40,743
People with shaved heads
are getting off the boat down there.

540
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,494
If I am a thief, what are you?

541
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,580
-What else? I am the owner of the pot lid.
-Mom.

542
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,998
Are you finished talking?

543
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,166
I asked if you were finished.

544
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,375
Go play over there.

545
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,294
-Play over there.
-But Mom…

546
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,212
Go over there.

547
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:57,051
Were their heads really shaved?
How bald were they?

548
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:03,015
Did they look like that old man
or a little different?

549
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:07,645
Their heads were smooth
except for a little tuft of hair here.

550
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,547
Go!

551
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:39,718
The barbarians!

552
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,303
They are here!

553
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,947
Get up. We must go.

554
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,449
Get up.

555
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,701
Barbarians!

556
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:05,619
Get up.

557
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,166
Everyone, take cover!

558
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,752
The barbarians are coming!

559
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,421
Stop talking nonsense.

560
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,672
What does a girl know?

561
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:19,425
If you do not want to listen to a girl,
then just die here!

562
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,093
Go. Move!

563
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,595
The barbarians are here!

564
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,100
They are Joseon people. Catch them!

565
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,936
They are running away.

566
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:32,729
Catch them!

567
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,135
This way!

568
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,846
Catch them!

569
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,282
43RD DAY OF THE JIN INVASION.
FALL OF GANGHWA ISLAND.

570
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:11,286
Hundreds of women jumped off
the cliffs to preserve their honor,

571
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:16,875
and only their headscarves are floating
on the waters of Ganghwa.

572
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,420
Kim Sang-yong, the older brother
of the Minister of Rites,

573
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,172
threw himself
into a pile of burning gunpowder

574
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,966
and committed suicide with his grandson.

575
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,426
Loyal guard Min-seong

576
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,305
killed his three sons and their wives,
then took his own life.

577
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,725
Even the wife and daughters-in-law
of the chief minister took their lives.

578
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,478
Three generations of women…

579
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,773
What about my son?

580
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:42,985
What happened to him?

581
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,202
Ganghwa Island has fallen.

582
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,123
His Majesty and the crown prince
in Namhansanseong Fortress…

583
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,794
will no longer be safe, either.

584
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,047
So now,
only the crown prince's son is left.

585
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,258
Please…

586
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:14,349
Please save my son.

587
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,613
Go.

588
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,780
Hurry!

589
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:49,926
Madam Bangdu.

590
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,638
Please leave me here.

591
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,598
Young lady,

592
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,642
I cannot walk anymore.

593
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,061
So, leave me here.

594
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,730
Please take my baby.

595
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,359
Get up.

596
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,028
If you talk like that one more time,

597
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,656
I will beat you up,
no matter if you are a new mother or not.

598
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,324
Now, come on!

599
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:45,023
This boat is not for you!

600
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,274
Stay back.

601
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,901
This boat is not for you.

602
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,781
Let us get on that boat.

603
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,116
How?

604
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,827
They are chasing everyone away.

605
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,121
Young lady.

606
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,456
Look over there.

607
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,717
No.

608
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,510
We can get on!

609
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,804
You head to the boat first.

610
00:50:58,805 --> 00:50:59,723
Gil-chae.

611
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,767
Gil-chae.

612
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:04,978
My Highness!

613
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,942
Give me the baby.

614
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,823
I saw the boat.
You were heading to it, right?

615
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,533
I will take the baby to where the boat is.

616
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,872
Please take care of him.

617
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,710
Go. Hurry!

618
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,071
I said do not come!

619
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,405
This boat is not for you!

620
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,949
It is for an important baby, correct?

621
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,327
My friend said she would bring that baby!

622
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,551
Please.

623
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:19,761
Please.

624
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,517
Protect the crown prince's son!

625
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,370
Give me the baby. Hurry!

626
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,747
I…

627
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:50,584
Please take my friends too.

628
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,712
I cannot. But I will take you!

629
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:54,921
If you do not take all of us,

630
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,715
you cannot take the baby either.

631
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,219
Gil-chae, you should go.

632
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,931
Young lady…

633
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,894
Who will nurse the crown prince's son?

634
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,938
We have a mother who has just given birth.

635
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,398
She has milk!

636
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,400
Yes, I have milk!

637
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,443
I have milk!

638
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:20,780
Let her on.

639
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,365
Yes, sir.

640
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,242
Get on quickly.

641
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,327
Move!

642
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,709
Jong-jong.

643
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,419
You go on first.

644
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,307
Please. At least take my baby.

645
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,267
Please take my child!

646
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,894
Save my baby!

647
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,396
-Please!
-Young lady!

648
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,482
Please.

649
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,400
Save my child!

650
00:53:59,027 --> 00:53:59,945
Let go!

651
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,696
Let go!

652
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,366
Get away from Jong-jong!

653
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,743
There is no room for you!

654
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,334
My poor baby.

655
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:27,449
My hands…

656
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:31,703
Something is wrong with them.

657
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,456
Do not think about it.

658
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:37,876
You got Jong-jong on the boat.

659
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:50,263
You who saved us.

660
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,600
It has always been you.

661
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,581
There are a lot more patients now.

662
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,084
Could His Majesty be affected too?

663
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,795
His Majesty is blessed by the heavens.

664
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,088
He would never catch such a disease!

665
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,715
I know. It is just that the disease
has spread to so many,

666
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,717
-so I wondered.
-Not me.

667
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:29,260
I told you. It is not smallpox.

668
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,180
I am fine.

669
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,516
The waterways are not safe to travel.

670
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:35,934
It is just a cold, not smallpox!

671
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,852
What waterways?

672
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,647
His Majesty sent a ship to Ganghwa Island.

673
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,441
I am fine.

674
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,568
It is not smallpox.

675
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,911
Where did you get this?

676
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,955
Who are you?

677
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:05,713
Where did you get it?

678
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,320
Hey.

679
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,364
Hey.

680
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,289
You cannot stay here.

681
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,790
No matter how smart or capable you are,

682
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,834
smallpox does not discriminate. So…

683
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:51,551
I…

684
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:55,054
told her to go.

685
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,813
I said Ganghwa Island
was the safest place in Joseon.

686
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:08,860
I told her…

687
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:12,697
to go.

688
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,007
Where did you get this dagger?

689
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:33,218
It is my war loot!

690
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,221
It belonged to the Joseon person I killed.

691
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:39,390
You killed her?

692
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:42,393
Really?

693
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,229
Well,

694
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:45,939
I did not see her die.

695
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,942
But she is definitely dead.

696
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,027
How could a woman escape?

697
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,076
Step forward

698
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,245
if you are familiar with the waterways!

699
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,413
His Majesty will grant a great reward!

700
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,126
Anyone who has been on a boat,
step forward!

701
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,753
Who will volunteer?

702
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:11,923
Who likes the waterways?

703
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,968
Even for a fortune, no one will do it.
I do not want to, either.

704
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,220
They say you catch
smallpox crossing the sea.

705
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,763
I will go!

706
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,350
I want to become a proud gapsa

707
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,144
by making a valuable contribution!

708
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,604
What are you doing?

709
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,856
If I become a gapsa,

710
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,943
will I also enjoy some rewards?

711
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,671
ISLAND NEAR GANGHWA

712
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,876
The baby is full of energy.

713
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,004
Now, can I feed my own baby?

714
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,547
She has been starving all day…

715
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,979
It seems the barbarians
sent out a search party.

716
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,148
Staying together is dangerous.
So, let us split up.

717
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:55,443
Do not worry too much.

718
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:59,238
Since you are all women,
I will send you on a safer route.

719
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,201
Go down that path

720
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,037
and meet us again at the dock.

721
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,623
There will be a boat waiting for us there.

722
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,042
What are you waiting for?

723
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:11,959
Go quickly.

724
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,253
You will not board the boat
if you are late.

725
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,338
Hurry.

726
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:20,635
Go now.

727
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,261
Do not worry.

728
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,317
Is that not the path
the barbarians passed through?

729
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,779
They will buy us some time.

730
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:42,657
Let us go.

731
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,629
If she is the crown prince's wife,
we cannot mess with her, right?

732
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,340
But we can have fun with the maids.

733
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,343
The maids have pale skin too.

734
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,225
After all this suffering,

735
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:11,102
we still have not enjoyed
the taste of Joseon women.

736
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,855
The Mongols have
already had all their fun.

737
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,774
We are on an island.
Let us have a little fun.

738
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,641
What was that sound?

739
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:55,980
Captain.

740
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,192
I shall check it out.

741
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:21,274
What was it?

742
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:23,192
It was a cat.

743
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,861
It was a cat?

744
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:26,863
It did not sound like a cat.

745
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,872
You punk…

746
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,915
They must be fighting among themselves!

747
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,667
Let us go. We must move now!

748
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:23,836
Go!

749
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,921
Hurry!

750
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,339
What is going on?

751
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,219
What?

752
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,265
Chase them!

753
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:19,809
Catch them!

754
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,046
From now on…

755
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,676
no one can gets past this point.

756
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:09,400
Someone save us!

757
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:20,953
Gil-chae! Hurry!

758
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:44,518
I vow this by the moonlight.

759
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:48,564
Wherever you go,

760
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:51,734
I will surely…

761
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:55,404
come find you.

762
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,284
Go ahead first.

763
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:02,036
What are you saying?

764
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:03,120
Young lady.

765
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,372
Gil-chae!

766
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,513
You saved us.

767
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,390
Could it be that you have fallen for me?

768
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:48,184
No. Who? Me?

769
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,226
You have not changed.

770
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,978
Our king will leave the fortress.

771
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:52,479
We also desire peace.

772
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,607
The war is over.

773
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,234
I will soon propose to Lady Eun-ae.

774
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,653
My lady. Shall we go to the Qing Dynasty?

775
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:01,655
I have been wondering for a while…

776
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:02,656
What are you doing?

777
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,451
Have you ever liked me as a woman?

778
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:08,204
Can you feel it? Why does my heart race

779
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:09,705
whenever I see you?

780
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:25,554
