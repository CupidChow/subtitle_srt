1
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:56,765
From now on…

2
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,478
no one gets past this point.

3
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,655
I vow this by the moonlight.

4
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,659
Wherever you go,

5
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,954
I will surely…

6
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,583
come find you.

7
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,555
You saved us.

8
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:05,977
My lady.

9
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,148
I thought you had abandoned us,
so I resented you.

10
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,776
-Well…
-It seems I misunderstood.

11
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,487
Thank you so much.

12
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,491
We must not delay here. Let us move.

13
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,743
Come on.

14
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,480
My lady.

15
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:51,981
Right.

16
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:29,894
I told you…

17
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,157
I told you I would

18
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,827
come find you.

19
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:17,108
THREE DAYS AGO

20
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,111
This is the last letter

21
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,322
Jang-hyeon sent.

22
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,078
Your Highness.

23
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,164
Please end this war soon.

24
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,834
How insolent.
You dare tell the prince what to do?

25
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:38,588
But Jang-hyeon will go
to the island tomorrow.

26
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,299
If the war continues, we do not know

27
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,801
when or if he will return.

28
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,011
Your Highness.

29
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,437
I will go and meet him myself.

30
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,231
Hurry.

31
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,983
Move quickly.

32
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,492
Excuse me.

33
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,619
I have a stomach ache.

34
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,205
-Go.
-Yes, sir.

35
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,374
Move quickly.

36
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,509
Are you crazy?

37
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,845
What are you doing here?

38
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,956
So, you are the one who wrote the letter.

39
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,961
I am amazed

40
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,257
that someone of such a high rank
has risked his life to see me.

41
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,718
I reported everything I knew
in the letter.

42
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,304
Was it not enough?

43
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,098
I know you said in the letter

44
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,892
that you were concerned
about Ganghwa Island's capture.

45
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,646
But the royal court feared
a repeat of the Jingkang Incident,

46
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,565
so we were not able to act quickly.

47
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,736
Now that Ganghwa Island has fallen,
if the king leaves the palace,

48
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,073
how can we avoid
what happened at Jingkang?

49
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,410
Is there a way to save our king?

50
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,345
You are truly something.

51
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,725
Is the king's life so important
in this situation?

52
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,103
Young soldiers are freezing to death.

53
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,691
Upstanding scholars are
getting their scalps skinned.

54
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,487
And countless women in Ganghwa
have killed themselves.

55
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,908
I would rather you asked me
how to save your own neck.

56
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,494
Then, I would do my best to help you.

57
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,121
You may be acting cruel out of spite,

58
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,957
but you risked your life
and came here

59
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,501
for the people too, did you not?

60
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,543
However,

61
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,671
a king must live for his people to live.

62
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,468
If the war ends with the king
dying at the hands of the enemy,

63
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,222
we subjects will become sinners
who could not save him,

64
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,184
and the people will become citizens
of a country with no king.

65
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,817
Do you know the misery of an orphan?

66
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,612
Do you know the pain
of a people with no king?

67
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,782
How can you not know?

68
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,659
Or are you just feigning ignorance?

69
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,169
Fine.

70
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,923
I will play along this time.

71
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,926
If you really want to save the king…

72
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,973
use the smallpox.

73
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:13,779
I want a clear answer on whether
we can save our king and his court.

74
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:18,242
He wants a clear answer on whether
they can save their king and his court.

75
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,119
That depends on our emperor.

76
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,205
He says that depends on the emperor.

77
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,166
Then, grant me an audience
with the emperor.

78
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,586
He is asking to see the emperor.

79
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,213
You can talk to me.

80
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,924
Then let me see Do-do.

81
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,593
I said you can talk to me.

82
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,721
Is it because they have
never had smallpox?

83
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,975
I know that smallpox is going around.

84
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,311
I also know that is why His Majesty

85
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,564
and others who are susceptible
have gone into hiding.

86
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,317
He says he knows
that smallpox is going around.

87
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,281
Who spread such a ridiculous rumor?

88
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,158
Ganghwa Island has fallen.

89
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,160
Your king cannot hold out much longer.

90
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,288
Do you not fear the news
of the epidemic spreading?

91
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,168
Use the smallpox?

92
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,004
The Khan has brought ritual offerings.

93
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,757
He will make Joseon surrender

94
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,511
to prove he has the Mandate of Heaven.

95
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,762
I am sure of it.

96
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,932
But smallpox is spreading.

97
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,060
Do you know what that means?

98
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,607
A smallpox epidemic usually means
that the heavens are angry.

99
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,403
You are much smarter than I am,

100
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,530
so I am sure you now know

101
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,533
what you need to do.

102
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:44,286
His Majesty treasures
the Imperial Seal he got

103
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,289
from the Chahars
after he defeated Mongolia.

104
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:52,294
Legend says that the Imperial Seal
goes to whoever will rule the world.

105
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,922
Since His Majesty has the Seal,

106
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:59,218
does that not mean he has truly
received the Mandate of Heaven?

107
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,595
However,

108
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,765
if news of the smallpox epidemic
spreads in Joseon,

109
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,310
who will believe he has been
appointed by the heavens?

110
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,105
Is smallpox not

111
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,108
the mark of heaven's rage?

112
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:19,238
Do you not know
that we can wipe you all out?

113
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,449
Do you not know that we can

114
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,826
tarnish the Khan's dignity
before that happens?

115
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,832
General, do not be angry.

116
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,584
We also desire peace.

117
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:33,836
However,

118
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,338
we have conditions.

119
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,177
They will not give up
on making the king leave the fortress,

120
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,928
so you must accept that.

121
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,516
If you refuse,
they will storm the fortress

122
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,728
with Hong Ipo cannons.

123
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,105
However,

124
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:58,569
if you promise to keep quiet
about the smallpox epidemic,

125
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,989
even if the king leaves the fortress…

126
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,201
they will not be able

127
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,370
to repeat what happened at Jingkang.

128
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,998
What they want most…

129
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,919
is for Joseon's king…

130
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,964
to surrender voluntarily.

131
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,968
Our king will leave the fortress.

132
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,263
However, if what happened
at Jingkang is repeated,

133
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,975
even if you rip my body apart,

134
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,270
I will tell the whole world
of the smallpox

135
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,900
and prove you have lost
the Mandate of Heaven.

136
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,497
They know

137
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,124
about the smallpox

138
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,670
and that you are hiding because of it.

139
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:01,674
Thus,

140
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,468
in exchange for keeping quiet,

141
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,805
they will send three subjects
who oppose peace,

142
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,808
and we are to take no more
captives after peace is agreed upon.

143
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,518
They also ask

144
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,272
that the Jingkang incident
not be repeated.

145
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,611
I did not know Joseon had
a skilled negotiator.

146
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,950
The smallpox persists.

147
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,161
If we do not withdraw soon, you--

148
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,122
I am the son of the heavens!

149
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,167
I will never be infected.

150
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,383
I will kill them all.

151
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,723
I will chew them down to the bone.

152
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,656
Do they still sit in the snow

153
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,367
in silence?

154
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,706
They risk their lives to oppose
me leaving the fortress.

155
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,209
Should I be thankful for their loyalty…

156
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,756
or should I resent their loyal resolve

157
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,884
to die with me?

158
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:27,927
Your Majesty.

159
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,306
I do not know whether my son lives.

160
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:36,101
You are our last remaining hope.

161
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,396
I beg you.

162
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,484
Please leave the fortress

163
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,236
and preserve the state.

164
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,784
Do you believe the Khan will let me live
after dragging me out of here?

165
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,208
Your Majesty.

166
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,962
The Khan is not trying to drag you out.

167
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:08,050
He is pressuring you to leave the fortress

168
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,221
to prove to the world
that you have become his subject.

169
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,597
All right.

170
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,811
I should leave the fortress.

171
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,191
But even if they let me live,

172
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:29,154
a king who has bowed down
to the barbarians is as good as dead.

173
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,786
I deposed Gwanghae for communicating
privately with the barbarians.

174
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,248
If I bow down to them now,

175
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,543
who will serve me?

176
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,754
Who will consider me their king?

177
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,177
Even if everyone misunderstands you,

178
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,681
I know.

179
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:02,604
I know that you are enduring humiliation
for your country.

180
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,066
Only the brave…

181
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,155
can endure humiliation

182
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,325
to save lives.

183
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,247
Yes.

184
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,294
Only you

185
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,006
can understand how I feel.

186
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,843
Even if the entire world turns on me,

187
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,429
only you,

188
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,057
my son…

189
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,201
Your Majesty, please do not trust them.

190
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:02,414
If you leave the palace, they will
repeat what happened at Jingkang.

191
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,083
The barbarians initially said

192
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,211
they would make peace
if we sent the crown prince.

193
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:11,048
But after we agreed to send him,
they made you bow to them,

194
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,343
and after you bowed to them,
they asked you to leave the fortress.

195
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,722
They are surely trying
to drag you away, Your Majesty.

196
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:24,353
Please do not leave, Your Majesty.

197
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,648
Please do not leave.

198
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,651
Where are you going?

199
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,987
The chaos is over.

200
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,072
Over?

201
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,742
Did the king end up being taken away?

202
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,537
Or has he lost his life?

203
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,080
No, it is not that.

204
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,126
The king left the fortress,
but they allowed him to live.

205
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:33,422
His Majesty bowed down
to the barbarians nine times.

206
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,673
How humiliating.

207
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,843
Well, because of that, the war is over.

208
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,179
Or would you rather flee your entire life?

209
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,014
I never said that.

210
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,473
You fool.

211
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,435
The war is over.

212
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,229
Lady Gil-chae.

213
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,452
Let us go.

214
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,330
Let us go home.

215
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,166
What is this?

216
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,594
Honey?

217
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:05,973
Honey!

218
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,393
My dear wife! My goodness.

219
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,898
You suffered a lot.

220
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,111
Our baby…

221
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,363
My goodness.

222
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,826
Gil-chae.

223
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,290
Gil-chae.

224
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,879
Gil-chae.

225
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,882
What took you so long?

226
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,927
I didn't think you would come back.
I thought you had died.

227
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,262
I thought you…

228
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,351
It's all right.

229
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,320
Father.

230
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,322
Gil-chae.

231
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,411
Father.

232
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,706
Father.

233
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,546
Father, it is me. Gil-chae.

234
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,256
Gil-chae?

235
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,260
Do you know my daughter?

236
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,821
We met the barbarians

237
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,240
as soon as we crossed the river.

238
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,910
Eun-ae, your father…

239
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,748
said he would lure the barbarians
and slip away.

240
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,503
Thanks to him, we lived…

241
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,549
but your father was captured.

242
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,226
The barbarians got angry

243
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,147
when they realized their captive
was just a weak old man.

244
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,197
They killed him on the spot.

245
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,288
We were hiding, so we saw all of it.

246
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,375
Our father could not intervene
because of us…

247
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,922
so he became…

248
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,897
-Lady Eun-ae!
-I'm sorry.

249
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,775
-I'm sorry, Eun-ae.
-Lady Eun-ae.

250
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,988
Lady Eun-ae.

251
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,835
I call those who made significant
contributions amidst the chaos.

252
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,964
Those who pierced through enemy forces
and reached the fortress

253
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,633
to serve the king.

254
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,011
Scholar Nam Yeon-jun.

255
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,680
Scholar Choi Dae-o.

256
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:29,277
I call the meritorious envoys
who guided His Majesty to the fortress.

257
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,281
Seo Heon-nam,

258
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,118
Yoon Yeo-ui, Sun Se-gyu.

259
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,830
I call the distinguished soldiers

260
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,041
who slew the enemy
and exalted the country.

261
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,378
Commander An Bok-cho.

262
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,505
Officer Gu Won-mu.

263
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,181
Commander Gu Won-mu, in particular,

264
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,851
single-handedly killed dozens
of enemy soldiers

265
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:05,230
and saved the crown prince's son.

266
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,325
Split into groups of four
and search from the shore upward.

267
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,243
Get moving.

268
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:19,995
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

269
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,207
Wait until I catch that guy, I will…

270
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,090
Hey.

271
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,719
Hey.

272
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,226
Jang-hyeon!

273
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,900
My goodness.

274
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,320
My goodness, Jang-hyeon.

275
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,990
Why are you crying? He is not dead.

276
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:20,972
I do not know whether the tenant farmers
are dead or have been captured.

277
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,016
There is no guarantee they will return.

278
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,144
The harvested grain was all
taken by the barbarians.

279
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,771
There is none left to sow.

280
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,107
They will receive divine punishment.

281
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,361
But you have returned.

282
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,738
Of course. I had to.

283
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,658
By the way, everything we earned
was taken by the barbarians.

284
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,911
I apologize.

285
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:46,456
Of course. Even if I die,
I must do it by my lady's side.

286
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:53,046
It will take years for the farmers to
return, till the land, and produce crops.

287
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,589
What should we do?

288
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,635
Leave, you barbarian.

289
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,221
-Go away!
-Father.

290
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,431
-Go away!
-Father.

291
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,643
I told you. I came from Hanyang
to deliver a letter.

292
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,396
Where is Master Gyeong Geun-jik's house?

293
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,362
Master,

294
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,989
are you safe?

295
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,993
Dae-o and I were able
to reach the fortress

296
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,246
and serve the king.

297
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:30,417
His Majesty has appointed me
as a Hongmungwan compiler.

298
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,712
The royal court is very busy
sorting out the chaos.

299
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,132
So, I may not return
to Neunggun-ri for a while.

300
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,719
His Majesty has granted me a house,

301
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:45,140
so if Neunggun-ri has become
too devastated to reside in,

302
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,475
I would like to bring you

303
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,894
and Lady Eun-ae to Hanyang.

304
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
Young Master Yeon-jun is alive.

305
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,825
Eun-ae.

306
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,287
My goodness.

307
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,510
Father.

308
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,138
Let us go together.

309
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,689
I suppose we are parting ways forever.

310
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,817
What are you talking about?

311
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,863
I will not go without you.

312
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,073
My father is gone.

313
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,658
Are you going to leave me too?

314
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:51,289
Lady Gil-chae planned this
to go to Hanyang, right?

315
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,373
What are you saying?

316
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,126
Lady Eun-ae begged her to go.

317
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,337
Gosh.

318
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,089
Do you not want us to go?

319
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,549
I did not say that.

320
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,011
I meant, I am happy.

321
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,180
After all we went through…

322
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,352
You treated me far better
than that annoying jerk.

323
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,937
And by "you",

324
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,356
I mean you and the two ladies.

325
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,443
But still,

326
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,987
if your lady tries to steal
Young Master Yeon-jun--

327
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,364
Madam Bangdu!

328
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,420
It is so pretty.

329
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,068
You look even more dignified
than usual today.

330
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,365
I will write it for you now.

331
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,243
The ghost of a widow?

332
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:13,872
A ghost?

333
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,349
Here we go.

334
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,519
How refreshing.

335
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:38,897
There we go.

336
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,532
Who will fix this now?

337
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,536
Gil-chae.

338
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,547
Thank you for coming with me.

339
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,724
I would go anywhere if it's with you.

340
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,739
Let us go.

341
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,034
Where are we going?

342
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,911
We need to go to Neunggun-ri.

343
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,205
Are we going to Neunggun-ri?

344
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,415
Yes, we are going to Neunggun-ri.

345
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,583
Do not worry.

346
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,735
What a mess.

347
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,905
Even after a war, Hanyang is still lively.

348
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,075
The ladies here have
even fairer skin than you.

349
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,369
Is the water different here?

350
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,040
Still, I do not see
anyone prettier than me.

351
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,710
People do not change.

352
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,504
Lady Gil-chae, look over there.

353
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:56,993
Thank you.

354
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,134
Do not give up.

355
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,721
You cannot give up.

356
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,642
Please…

357
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,398
Father.

358
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,108
Father!

359
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,986
Father!

360
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,784
Father, please.

361
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,330
Father!

362
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,417
Father.

363
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,337
Father, please…

364
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,632
Father, please…

365
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,884
Father.

366
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,304
Father.

367
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,639
Look out.

368
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,224
Father.

369
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,812
Come here.

370
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,021
Hurry.

371
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,606
Hurry over here.

372
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,452
Where are you going?

373
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,248
Are you leaving me again?

374
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,766
Have I told you?

375
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,981
When you smile…

376
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,863
I hear the flowers bloom.

377
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,079
Did I ever tell you that?

378
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,509
Young Master.

379
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,852
Where is he?

380
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,563
That is a good question.

381
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:31,981
Right?

382
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:43,284
-Who did you think I meant?
-Young Master Jang-hyeon.

383
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,828
Gosh, you are funny.

384
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,664
Why should I care where he is?

385
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,082
Never mind, then.

386
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,084
It is worth minding.

387
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,628
He has lovers everywhere

388
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,255
and is into misogamy
and "relationship limbo" or whatnot.

389
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,673
Why would I care about him?

390
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,426
Moreover, why is it
my business where he is?

391
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:04,096
What was it he said?
He would come and find me wherever I was?

392
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,350
All he does is speak nonsense.

393
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,771
Consider yourself lucky.

394
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:15,566
You are about to hear
the voice of Joseon's greatest singer.

395
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,903
It can only be heard
in places like Usimjeong in Hanyang.

396
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:11,998
You are alive.

397
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,874
I knew you would be.

398
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:23,134
This place is called "Usimjeong,"
as in "to be joyful and sorrowful"?

399
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:26,846
What an unusual name for an inn.
There is one in the Japanese office too.

400
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:27,930
JAPANESE OFFICE:

401
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,640
OFFICE FOR JAPANESE
TRAVELERS, DIPLOMACY, AND TRADE

402
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,142
Why are you here?

403
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,403
His Highness is going
to Shenyang as a hostage.

404
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,949
I worry if I will be able to serve him
in such an unfamiliar and barren place.

405
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,952
That is why I am asking this.

406
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,747
Will you come with me to Shenyang?

407
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,875
If you come, I will feel as safe
if I am protected by a thousand troops.

408
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,423
I am not interested.

409
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,884
Enjoy your time here.

410
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,514
His Highness will reward you.

411
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,686
-My lord, what took you so long?
-Song-yi!

412
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,688
Set up a lavish table.

413
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,321
It is morning, yet they are already rowdy.

414
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,239
The war has barely ended.

415
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,077
Over there.

416
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:36,332
What are you doing?
This is Young Master Yeon-jun's house.

417
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,168
Yes.

418
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,130
I am sure Jong-jong
and Lady Gil-chae live here too.

419
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,591
Right.

420
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,468
So, why aren't you going in?

421
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,805
I am going in now.

422
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,348
-Let us go in.
-Okay.

423
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,686
No, let us go back.

424
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,148
Gu-jam.

425
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,778
Young Master Jang-hyeon?

426
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,200
How have you been?

427
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,702
We heard you had
disappeared from the fortress,

428
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,788
and we were very worried.

429
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,206
Well,

430
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:22,002
I have been here and there,
doing this and that.

431
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:25,423
But where did Gil-chae go?

432
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,632
She is late.

433
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,636
Jong-jong. Is Gil-chae not back?

434
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,887
Lady Eun-ae.

435
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,932
I am not here to see Lady Gil-chae.

436
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:41,063
These days, she always goes out
and returns after the sun sets.

437
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,941
She said something
about exploring Hanyang.

438
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,402
She went to explore Hanyang?

439
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,319
Well,

440
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,614
I am merely stopping by,
but where did she go?

441
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,327
You have been through a lot.

442
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,997
What?

443
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,001
I mean,

444
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,838
you must have been through a lot more.

445
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:09,675
Well, we enjoyed
our time at Mount Gwanggyo.

446
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,385
After that…

447
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:20,186
You know, Lady Gil-chae insisted
on going to Ganghwa Island.

448
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,564
She is incredibly stubborn.

449
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,109
We asked why, but she would not answer.

450
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:31,822
She just kept insisting on going
to Ganghwa Island no matter what.

451
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,952
We went through so much at Ganghwa Island.

452
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,248
I will take my leave now.

453
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,667
Gu-jam, let's go.

454
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:47,463
Darn it.

455
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,594
We may as well stay longer
while we are here.

456
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,346
Why are you chickening out?

457
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,555
Did you commit a crime?

458
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,682
You are alive.

459
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,519
Who do we have here?

460
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,605
Well, you look perfectly well.

461
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,402
Why should I not?

462
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,489
Do you know how much I went through?

463
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,450
You told me to go to Ganghwa Island.

464
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,869
You said it would be safe there.

465
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,540
And you are perfectly fine.

466
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,460
You are as feisty as ever too.

467
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,713
I almost died.

468
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,763
Did you wait for me?

469
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,228
When did I say that?

470
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:34,445
Well, we were fine without you.

471
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,031
A great military officer saved us.

472
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:44,913
-Is that so?
-Yes.

473
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,498
The barbarians almost took us,

474
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,960
but that officer beat
17 of them alone and saved us.

475
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,838
You were very lucky, then.

476
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,676
But

477
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,430
that officer said something odd.

478
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,223
What did he say?

479
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:07,144
He said he did not
kill all those barbarians alone.

480
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,105
So, I was wondering.

481
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:13,442
Did we ever…

482
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,616
cross paths on the island?

483
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,583
Island?

484
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,544
What island?

485
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,589
I thought so.

486
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,967
No one could
become a barbarian in that time,

487
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,844
no matter how unusual they were.

488
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,976
I heard you disappeared
from Namhansanseong Fortress.

489
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:51,438
Did you flee because you feared
it would be taken?

490
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,151
Seeing as you are fine,
it seems you chose well.

491
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,780
Anyway, now that we meet again--

492
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,989
Are you glad?

493
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:02,991
No.

494
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:04,910
Are you happy?

495
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:06,745
Who? Me?

496
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,455
What a shame.

497
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:14,128
I am very happy to see you again.

498
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,966
Whoever that military officer was,
who saved you

499
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,926
by fighting the barbarians 17 to one,

500
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,887
I am grateful.

501
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,681
What?

502
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:31,061
Do you like that officer
instead of Young Master Yeon-jun now?

503
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,064
Listen here, Young Master.

504
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:38,110
Unlike someone else,
I do not collect several lovers.

505
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,114
And I do?

506
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,867
You visit places like this.

507
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,869
You would know best.

508
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,056
What are you doing?

509
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,980
I have been wondering for a while…

510
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,356
About what?

511
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,942
Your fan.

512
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,738
Do you not get cold
fanning yourself in the winter?

513
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,077
It seems like you are trying
to look sophisticated.

514
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,871
But you look cold.

515
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,464
I happen

516
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,091
to run hotter than most!

517
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,972
I see.

518
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,682
You run hot.

519
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,227
Then, keep cooling yourself down.

520
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,436
I will leave now.

521
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,915
Why did you lie?

522
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,292
You said you saved her
by fighting 17 to one.

523
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,127
Why did you not tell her?

524
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,341
I just…

525
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:27,803
feel embarrassed.

526
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,395
He is so frugal.

527
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,272
So, he stopped by here?

528
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,567
He left this for you.

529
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,527
Why is this for me?

530
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,823
Did he say to give it to me?

531
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:53,287
Well, he did not say that, but it could
hardly be for me or Jong-jong.

532
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,329
Maybe it is for me.

533
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,128
Forget it. He would have mentioned it
earlier, if it were for me.

534
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,797
You met him?

535
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,841
-Where?
-Where do you think?

536
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,843
He is as promiscuous as they say.

537
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:11,305
He was walking into Usimjeong,
where they sell liquor and laughs,

538
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,015
like it was his own home.

539
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,644
But what were you doing there?

540
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,189
Usimjeong?

541
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,442
Was that why you
asked Young Master Dae-o about it?

542
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,986
-What?
-My goodness.

543
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,779
You went there yourself?

544
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,364
To see Young Master Jang-hyeon?

545
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,533
My ears are suddenly itchy.

546
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,868
Has something gotten inside?

547
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,579
What are you chattering about?

548
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:39,166
Young Master Jang-hyeon stopped by.

549
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,917
You met Young Master Jang-hyeon?

550
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,629
-Is he well?
-Yes.

551
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,797
Where is he now?

552
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,758
I must see him as well.

553
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,600
It has been a while.

554
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:58,852
Please, come in.

555
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,604
Young Master Jang-hyeon.

556
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,190
I am upset.

557
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,983
You did not contact me at all.

558
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,570
I heard you have become
a Hongmungwan compiler.

559
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,821
I have.

560
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:18,955
Let us not delay and go inside.

561
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:23,627
Perhaps not a place like this,
but somewhere else…

562
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,463
"A place like this"? This is my home.

563
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,882
You live in a kisaeng house?

564
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:31,802
It is my friend's house,
so it may as well be my home.

565
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,098
You know Ryang-eum, right?

566
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,724
Ryang-eum, the master singer.

567
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,311
It has been a while.

568
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,033
Now, please eat.

569
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,870
Not much is left since the war,
but it should taste good.

570
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:00,956
Really?

571
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:15,804
It is good.

572
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,851
Young Master Yeon-jun, do you remember

573
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:25,313
when we met on the way to Mount Gwanggyo?

574
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,523
I mean,

575
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,985
your clothes were tattered

576
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:33,363
and you were limping,
but you were determined to save the king.

577
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,785
And then,

578
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,289
as if you had starved your whole life,
you ate those…

579
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,291
What were they again?

580
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:51,006
You devoured those rice balls
and spilled rice all over yourself.

581
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,388
Devoted scholars go through
such hardships.

582
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,099
He is not like others,
who focus on fleeing.

583
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:04,144
No, Young Master Jang-hyeon is right.

584
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,313
I looked like a total mess.

585
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:10,108
It is thanks to him that I am alive today.

586
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,035
Madam Bangdu.

587
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,246
Why did she drink so much?

588
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,707
Did you not know?

589
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,709
My young lady has a high tolerance.

590
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:28,960
She just never drinks.

591
00:51:40,096 --> 00:51:41,056
I will

592
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,100
soon propose to Lady Eun-ae.

593
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,815
It must be heartbreaking for her

594
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,943
to marry when her father
is no longer here.

595
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,740
Please watch over her.

596
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:09,459
If only Sun-yak had returned alive,

597
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,047
a joint wedding as we discussed
would have been nice.

598
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:20,971
I should be the one
to dress Eun-ae up for the wedding.

599
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:24,933
I suppose you and I will
never talk in private again.

600
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,771
Before Sun-yak died,

601
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,440
he asked me something odd.

602
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,280
You

603
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,117
like Lady Gil-chae, right?

604
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,080
I could not answer no.

605
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,838
Why do you think that was?

606
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,179
It is late.

607
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:06,224
What could you not answer?

608
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:13,857
It is nothing.

609
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,151
I am drunk.

610
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:17,819
It was nothing.

611
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,031
Please…

612
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,451
answer me.

613
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,126
My lady.

614
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:35,754
I know.

615
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,466
Your feelings for me

616
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:44,846
are like those of a child who cannot have

617
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:47,724
a toy she wants.

618
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:50,894
Once you have me,

619
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,646
your feelings will wither.

620
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,813
Are you saying

621
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:59,152
you will not choose me
because my feelings might wither?

622
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,405
Do not dismiss me like that.

623
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,575
I can be genuine too. I can…

624
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,078
Let us stop.

625
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,670
You can marry Eun-ae.

626
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,255
But just once,

627
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:21,758
for the last time,

628
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,845
be honest with me.

629
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,516
Have you ever…

630
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,980
liked me…

631
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,401
as a woman?

632
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,702
We will never have…

633
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:53,373
a conversation like this again.

634
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:43,673
What kind of a man are you?

635
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,553
Young Master Jang-hyeon.

636
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,600
I know men like you very well.

637
00:55:56,644 --> 00:56:00,106
You think too much to follow your heart…

638
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:05,361
and you feel too much to follow your head.

639
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,279
So,

640
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:12,118
you leave the decisions to the poor women,
hide behind their skirts…

641
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,915
and enjoy seeing their yearning looks.

642
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,669
You go around talking

643
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,839
about doing great things for the country,

644
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:29,135
but in truth, you cannot do anything
without a woman's help.

645
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,766
You are drunk.

646
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,188
Let us not do this
but go to my house and drink some more.

647
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:53,451
You have not changed.

648
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,917
You are so naive,
you still cannot tell friend from foe.

649
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,009
If you were not
Lady Eun-ae's husband-to-be,

650
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:14,639
I would break that pale neck
with my own two hands.

651
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,943
So, this is the palace
I have heard so much about.

652
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,991
Please leave a spot for me at Shenyang.

653
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,327
Why did you change your mind?

654
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,455
Shenyang is considered the road to death.

655
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,541
I am going because I might die.

656
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,752
The fear of death will keep me

657
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:47,964
from thinking of other things.

658
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:54,429
Where have you been on an empty stomach?

659
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,014
Shall we…

660
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,517
go to the Qing Dynasty?

661
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,271
We just barely got to Hanyang.

662
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:04,647
I do not want to.

663
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,358
Then, you do not have to go.

664
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,236
-Young Master.
-When do we go?

665
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,822
Is there time for me to get my clothes?

666
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:16,034
Would you follow him to the toilet too?

667
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,244
He said he would go.

668
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,579
See?

669
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,040
Ryang-eum is a true friend.

670
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:40,350
You must be uneasy, seeing
Young Master Yeon-jun rush to marry.

671
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,312
What do you care?

672
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,609
When will you develop better taste in men?

673
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,905
Will you have better taste when I return?

674
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,034
Are you

675
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,203
going somewhere again?

676
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,706
Why?

677
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,543
Are you upset I am leaving?

678
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,045
I never said that.

679
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,339
But you look

680
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,925
a little upset.

681
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:20,932
I don't care at all
whether you come or go far away.

682
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,396
Is that so?

683
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,691
You have lovers everywhere.

684
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:34,988
Will you go see flowers in Jeolla Province
or sing songs in Gyeongsang Province?

685
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:39,826
You will surely return after a month
and try to charm me again.

686
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,160
But there is no use.

687
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,746
I am going to the Qing Dynasty.

688
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,749
I will escort the crown prince.

689
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,128
The Qing Dynasty?

690
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,630
It is not somewhere
you can return from in a month.

691
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,968
Why so suddenly?

692
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:58,219
You see?

693
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,972
You are upset I am leaving.

694
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,141
I said I am not.

695
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,855
I suppose you will
date a barbarian woman this time.

696
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,483
It would be nice if I had the time.

697
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,153
If I go to Shenyang,

698
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:19,157
I heard the barbarians may kill me.

699
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,621
Regardless,

700
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,415
if I am lucky enough to live

701
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,753
and meet you again, then we should

702
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,172
have a serious conversation.

703
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:39,719
Even though

704
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,848
I had resolved to live unmarried,

705
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,143
if marriage were…

706
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:54,192
the only way to make a certain woman mine,

707
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:55,610
then…

708
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:00,073
I may be willing to marry.

709
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,328
You call that a marriage proposal?

710
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,417
There is no rush.

711
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,130
I can wait a long time.

712
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:24,347
I always say this,
but you still have some growing up to do.

713
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:38,569
How strange.

714
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,321
What is?

715
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:43,574
Looking into the mirror
is not making me feel better.

716
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,828
Even when Young Master Yeon-jun
joined the army,

717
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:51,249
I cheered myself up by looking
at my pretty face in the mirror.

718
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,876
But why is it not working today?

719
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,004
Look a little while longer.

720
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:01,384
That should make me feel better, right?

721
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,689
You scared me.

722
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:15,940
I must go talk to him.

723
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:25,700
I like this one better than this one.

724
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,870
You have no eye for horses.

725
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,539
You can tell by their buttocks.

726
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:35,460
This one has a fuller rear,
so it will travel farther.

727
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:43,801
Lady Gil-chae.

728
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,303
Why are you here?

729
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,476
I have something to say.

730
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,919
I came to say it
since I could not yesterday.

731
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:20,797
Say what?

732
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,216
You are truly ambitious.

733
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:26,636
Do you think if you return,
I will still see you?

734
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:32,183
-You came to say that?
-Yes.

735
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:35,102
Just know I will never meet with you.

736
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,147
That is all I have to say. I will leave.

737
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,274
Why will you not see me?

738
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,487
Did you not give me

739
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,782
your accessory to keep me safe?

740
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:49,909
Who? Me?

741
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:58,751
That ribbon is not mine.

742
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,423
I did not say it was a ribbon.

743
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:11,806
I see.

744
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,392
So, this ribbon is yours.

745
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,394
-No.
-I…

746
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:18,271
You cannot take back what you gave.

747
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:21,691
-I did not give it to you. I lost it.
-Goodness.

748
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:24,819
It seems you lost it
by hiding it in my water bottle.

749
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,404
Give it to me.

750
01:04:26,487 --> 01:04:27,530
Now.

751
01:04:28,447 --> 01:04:29,866
My goodness.

752
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,475
I plan

753
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:01,063
on holding onto this ribbon until I die.

754
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:05,443
If you really want it, take it from here

755
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,821
with your own hands.

756
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:15,036
You are truly
a lowlife, miscreant, and a scumbag.

757
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,205
Let go.

758
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,005
What are you…

759
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,381
Can you feel it?

760
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:36,515
I do not understand it either.

761
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,728
Why does my heart race…

762
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,025
whenever I see you?

763
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:37,827
My lady.

764
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,621
Did you really want to kiss me?

765
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,502
A man like you

766
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,547
could die, and I still would not…

767
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:37,386
I know you do not love me yet.

768
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,307
I know that your heart…

769
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:47,480
still lies with Young Master Yeon-jun.

770
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,193
However…

771
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,907
even if you do not love me…

772
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,577
I ask that you do not forget me.

773
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:06,874
You must not…

774
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,837
forget this moment…

775
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,719
that we shared today.

776
01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,520
I must see him once more.

777
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:13,065
There is only one thing that I want.

778
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,316
I wish for your heart.

779
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,943
I cannot do that.

780
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:18,821
You love a man
who is betrothed to another woman.

781
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,322
What is innocent about that?

782
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,949
Just go!

783
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:23,576
Go and die.

784
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:28,080
The young master in my dreams
had to be Young Master Yeon-jun.

785
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:33,627
What does Young Master Yeon-jun have
that I do not?

786
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,213
He is not someone
I can easily move on from.

787
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:39,091
You are the worst.

788
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:57,651
