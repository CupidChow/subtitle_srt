1
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,213
What is on your mind?

2
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,552
At Song-chu's wedding anniversary banquet,

3
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,974
did you see who Lady Gil-chae looked
at when we heard about the war?

4
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,810
They have

5
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,938
imprisoned the king!

6
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,239
She looked at Young Master Yeon-jun.

7
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:19,871
I knew it.

8
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,207
I looked

9
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,751
at that rock?

10
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,679
I also happened to see
who Gil-chae was looking at.

11
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,152
This is the fastest way to Heomcheon.

12
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:54,322
On the way, there is an inn
before the intersection.

13
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,826
If you mention my name,
you will get extra soup--

14
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:58,743
Thanks.

15
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,204
Now, let us hurry.

16
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,082
Let us get going too, Gu-jam.

17
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:05,834
All right.

18
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,418
Will you not come with us?

19
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,878
Did I not tell you?

20
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,298
I have no intention of joining the army.

21
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,260
I merely followed you here

22
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,138
to see how you handle
my precious horses and armor.

23
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,057
It seems you have learned
how to handle the horses,

24
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:21,975
so I will leave.

25
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,476
Let us go.

26
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,359
A man so cowardly
could not possibly be a real noble.

27
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,654
The rumors of him
buying fake certification must be true.

28
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,697
Listen here.

29
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,074
He is a savior who lent us horses.

30
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,827
He only did that to impress the women.

31
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,581
Now, let us go.

32
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:59,095
I boasted to Jong-jong
that I would be joining the army.

33
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,097
But look at me now. How embarrassing.

34
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,016
Gosh, I am hungry.

35
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,976
Shall we prepare the food first?

36
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,562
By the way, why are we here?

37
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,608
If we want to flee,
we should be going farther away.

38
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,696
This is the only way
the barbarians can get to the village.

39
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,478
Your Majesty.

40
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,772
Things have gotten desperate.

41
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,274
We must ask for reinforcements.

42
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,653
They promised to preserve our government

43
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,488
if Joseon became their subject.

44
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,989
Have you learned nothing?

45
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,575
Do you trust the barbarians' words?

46
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,244
Do you not remember the Jingkang incident?

47
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,578
JINGKANG INCIDENT:

48
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,790
JIN INVASION OF SONG
IN WHICH THE CAPITAL WAS TAKEN

49
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,211
When the Jin besieged the palace of Song,

50
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,380
Song's Emperor Qinzong left the palace,

51
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:19,050
trusting the Jin's promise
to preserve the government.

52
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,843
But the Jin barbarians

53
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,388
took Emperor Qinzong
and 3,000 of his men to Jin

54
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,809
and made the women
of the emperor and the high officials

55
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,061
their concubines and prostitutes.

56
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,023
But you want to leave the palace

57
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,484
with trust in their promise
to preserve the government?

58
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,237
Can you not see that they are trying

59
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,283
to get us to leave to do
the same thing they did back then?

60
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,619
Your Majesty.

61
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,870
Emperor Qinzong

62
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,456
did not listen to General Chong Shidao's

63
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,542
suggestion to attack the retreating Jin.

64
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,294
He dismissed him instead.

65
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,630
Thus, the soldiers' morales were lowered,

66
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,799
and they never recovered.

67
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,593
You must raise the morale of the soldiers

68
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,929
by pledging to fight until the end.

69
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,360
Your Majesty.

70
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,545
The thought of you protecting the palace…

71
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,049
in this bitter cold,

72
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:44,302
with tattered clothes
and barely enough food…

73
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,140
pains me as if
needles are piercing my entire body.

74
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:54,270
However, reconciliation is impossible,
and war is our only option.

75
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,566
When reinforcements arrive
from all directions,

76
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,611
we will definitely be able
to defeat our enemies,

77
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,281
so hold out until then

78
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,408
and bring us victory.

79
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,285
That is

80
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,455
a noble command, Your Majesty.

81
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,292
-That is a noble command, Your Majesty.
-That is a noble command, Your Majesty.

82
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,002
That is a noble command.

83
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,983
Sun-yak.

84
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,029
-Jeez, Father.
-Why, you little…

85
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,126
Why must that rock get in the way?

86
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,839
But why did I look at him

87
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,257
when I heard the news?

88
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,510
No, it is ridiculous.

89
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,512
Eun-ae must have seen wrong.

90
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,763
Right, Jong-jong?

91
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,056
I saw it too.

92
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,391
What?

93
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:17,645
When I heard about the war,
I looked at you in shock.

94
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,940
But you were looking
at that useless misogamist…

95
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,276
I mean, Young Master Jang-hyeon.

96
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,527
Me?

97
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,778
Why?

98
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,197
Why would I look at that misogamist,

99
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,491
who is useless like a rock
or a blade of grass?

100
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,452
Gil-chae.

101
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,331
Did you put your hair up?

102
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,334
Although we only talked about marriage,

103
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,171
I am as good as married
to Young Master Yeon-jun.

104
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,923
You are essentially his wife.

105
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,634
Unbelievable.

106
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,054
Anyway, Gil-chae,

107
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,516
I am going to pray at the seonangdang.
Do you want to come?

108
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,978
We should pray
for the young masters' safe return.

109
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,318
I have never done this before.

110
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,785
That is cold.

111
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,502
There.

112
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,719
Dear gods, as you watch over us,

113
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,263
please keep our young masters
warm in the cold,

114
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,473
-light their paths,
-Light them.

115
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,767
-and protect them from evil swords.
-Please…

116
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,310
When they meet the barbarians, help them

117
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,187
-to break their limbs and bones,
-Bones…

118
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,941
burst their brains, flay them,
and twist their necks

119
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,818
so that they never
invade others' lands again.

120
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,986
Dear gods,

121
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,112
as you watch over us,

122
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,490
please keep our young masters
warm in the cold,

123
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,866
light their paths…

124
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,478
My arm.

125
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,606
My arm.

126
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:27,858
My arm!

127
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,110
My arm.

128
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,198
Hey! Hey!

129
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,287
Sun-yak.

130
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,580
How strange.

131
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,420
I brought Lady Gil-chae's sachet…

132
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,842
Is there a physician?

133
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,221
You

134
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,891
like Lady Gil-chae, right?

135
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,478
Lady Gil-chae

136
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,231
liked you too.

137
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,152
But thanks to you

138
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,531
becoming engaged to Lady Eun-ae,

139
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,118
she gave someone like me

140
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,411
a chance too.

141
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,871
Sun-yak.

142
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,165
I was lucky.

143
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:32,506
If I had known this would happen,
I would have told her.

144
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,925
Look.

145
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,303
I fixed the swing. See?

146
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,523
-Give me a little push.
-Pardon?

147
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,733
Come on.

148
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,736
Right.

149
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,904
Here we go.

150
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,990
There.

151
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,867
Harder.

152
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,410
-Push harder.
-Harder?

153
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,579
Here we go.

154
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,874
How refreshing.

155
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,627
There we go.

156
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,049
My lady.

157
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,430
She does not know

158
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,558
she is the reason

159
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,477
I became

160
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,979
a real man.

161
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,316
To me,

162
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,277
she…

163
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,951
Sun-yak.

164
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,661
Hey.

165
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,955
Hey!

166
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,332
Hey!

167
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,254
Sun-yak.

168
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:12,481
Gangwon's General Kwon Jeong-gil's forces

169
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,068
and Governor Jung Se-gyu's forces
in Chungcheong have all lost.

170
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,114
Even Lee Ui-bae's
reinforcement forces were defeated.

171
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,076
What are they trying to do?

172
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,663
Why are they putting more effort
into attacking reinforcements

173
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,499
instead of striking the fortress
where I am?

174
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,714
I know now what they are trying to do.

175
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,886
Do you remember the battle
at Dalinghe Fortress?

176
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,265
In 1631, a Jin troop of 40,000 soldiers

177
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,142
sieged Ming's Dalinghe Fortress.

178
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,020
They dug trenches around the fortress,

179
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,898
killed all the support units
and isolated the fortress.

180
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,069
It is no different
to what they are doing right now.

181
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,949
The isolation of the fortress
led to a food shortage,

182
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,452
and the soldiers killed
and ate the workers

183
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,496
who had been building the fortress.

184
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,755
When Dalinghe Fortress surrendered
and opened its gates,

185
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,592
of the 30,000 people
who had been living there,

186
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,427
only half were alive.

187
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,015
15,000 Dalinghe people

188
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,935
died not from fighting

189
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,269
but from starvation.

190
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,653
They are trying…

191
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,991
to trap us in this fortress
and starve us to death.

192
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,552
My arm.

193
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,929
My arm.

194
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,600
Where is my arm?

195
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,102
My arm.

196
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,353
My arm.

197
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,106
Where is my arm?

198
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,857
My arm.

199
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,570
Jun-jeol, you must live.

200
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,197
My arm.

201
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,284
My arm. My arm.

202
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,954
We did all we could.

203
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,999
Let us go back now.

204
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,754
You want to go back
when we are this close to the king?

205
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,132
I am going to return.

206
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,680
I want to return to Neunggun-ri.

207
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,563
Return if you want.

208
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,692
I will continue alone if I must.

209
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,758
No one is here.

210
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,062
Where did he go this time?

211
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,071
Jang-hyeon.

212
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,116
What?

213
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,707
I hear horses galloping.

214
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,502
They are coming.

215
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,384
They will loot villages
on their way up here.

216
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,222
I will light a fire up there
and send a signal to the villages.

217
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,184
You take Ryang-eum
and hide where I told you.

218
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,479
But Ryang-eum went down to the village.

219
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,815
What?

220
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,734
When?

221
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:29,238
He said he needed to get something.

222
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,748
I will go get him.

223
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,335
Go up the hill in my place
and raise the smoke signal.

224
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,839
Keep it going for a few hours. Got it?

225
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,007
Yes.

226
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,552
Welcome.

227
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,179
Take a look at these.

228
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,556
I have new items.

229
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,808
Look at all these precious items.

230
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,060
Take your time.

231
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,782
Gosh, this is an old blade.

232
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,496
Sorry. I lost the dagger you gave me.

233
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,217
How…

234
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,060
Let us go.

235
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,479
Sorry.

236
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,942
You said you lost your dagger…

237
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,860
Did I ask you to buy another one?

238
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,371
If something happens to you…

239
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,461
Let us go.

240
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,261
He saved me…

241
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,139
again.

242
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,644
-Please protect them…
-Dear gods…

243
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,895
Please protect them

244
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,022
-so that they can return safely.
-Please…

245
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,024
Please help them…

246
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,152
-Please…
-Please help them return…

247
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,362
Keep them safe…

248
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,036
Do their legs not hurt?

249
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,455
Be quiet.

250
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,667
Please…

251
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,012
-Please protect them.
-Please protect them.

252
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,185
Anyway, I have a favor to ask.

253
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,477
Look over there.

254
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,981
If you see smoke on that hill,

255
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,234
promise to flee the village
and head to safety.

256
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,992
However,

257
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,830
even during the last invasion,
the barbarians did not reach our village.

258
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,375
Are you sure
that smoke is signaling their arrival?

259
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,794
That is what Lee Jang-hyeon told me.

260
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,130
He said if there was smoke,
we had to flee.

261
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,299
She says Jang-hyeon said so.

262
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,301
Lee Jang-hyeon.

263
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,304
He is hard to read,

264
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,015
but he has never
said anything meaninglessly.

265
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,073
Madam Bangdu.

266
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,908
Do not forget this.

267
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,730
-Yak-sun, pack the silk first.
-Okay.

268
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,741
Come on.

269
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,868
Leave the pot.

270
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,679
Dig deeper.

271
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:46,972
Yes, my lady.

272
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,940
My lady, that is not what is important.

273
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,443
Nothing is more important than this.

274
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,973
Where are you going?

275
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,642
I am thinking of going to Uiseong.

276
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,269
Be careful.

277
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,979
Please be safe.

278
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:36,938
Listen carefully.

279
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,524
In times like this,

280
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,652
the only thing women must protect
is their chastity.

281
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,740
If a woman is violated by the barbarians,
death is inevitable.

282
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,159
But even if a woman
only has a brief encounter,

283
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,453
how could she continue to live?

284
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,415
That is enough. Let us go, Eun-ae.

285
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,752
Do not forget that.

286
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,110
Right.

287
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:27,489
I forgot to put the lid on the jar.

288
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,867
Go ahead with the ladies to the dock.

289
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,078
Okay?

290
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,538
Go ahead.

291
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,843
Madam, please get on.

292
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,803
Get on first.

293
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,638
Gil-chae, go ahead.

294
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,473
-Eun-ae, you too.
-No.

295
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,560
I do not want to.

296
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,232
You two cross first
with Yeong-chae and Je-nam.

297
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:05,402
I will follow behind with Jong-jong.

298
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,071
He does not want to go with me.

299
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:13,076
We need to protect you two.
I will go with Gil-chae.

300
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,327
Eun-ae.

301
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,598
Where did old lady I-rang go?

302
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,735
Why are you here?

303
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,613
My goodness.

304
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,244
The barbarians are
always accompanied by crows.

305
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,330
It was like that ten years ago too.

306
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,125
It seems they are close.

307
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,550
On the day of the banquet,
you saw it too, right?

308
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:15,305
The academy masters
all wore their best clothes.

309
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,144
Considering how slowly
the ladies and the elders walk,

310
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,480
they will surely get caught soon.

311
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,735
I killed many barbarians back in my day.

312
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,571
Let us get rid of them and hurry.

313
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,715
They have all fled.

314
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,761
Find any hidden silk

315
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,514
and women who have not yet left.

316
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,723
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

317
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,240
Silk!

318
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:41,933
Who is it?

319
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,518
Find who is ambushing us!

320
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,839
-Father.
-We cannot take the boat.

321
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,799
We need another…

322
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,552
We need to go another way.

323
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,887
Where?

324
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,638
Get up. We have to go.

325
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,515
We have to go.

326
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,201
It is him.

327
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,129
No!

328
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,482
These old fogies

329
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,234
bought time by messing with us.

330
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,654
The women and riches must be nearby.

331
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,697
Find them!

332
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,528
Let us go.

333
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,988
Let us go to the physician.

334
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,323
Okay?

335
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,049
It is meaningless.

336
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,969
You must meet someone better next time.

337
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:15,647
All right.

338
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,609
In the next life,

339
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,488
let us meet as husband and wife again.

340
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,617
I will own lots of land and give you

341
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,452
a good life.

342
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,836
It does not matter.

343
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:42,465
Even if you cannot talk,
I do not care.

344
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,551
I love everything about you.

345
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:37,270
Footprints.

346
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,607
Follow them.

347
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,238
We have to go.

348
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,537
We have to go.

349
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,580
That is enough.

350
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:23,960
It is fine.

351
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:25,670
They are gone.

352
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,050
Madam Bangdu.

353
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,805
My baby…

354
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,915
What is going on?

355
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,752
Fortunately, it seems they have all fled.

356
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,837
No. This is…

357
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,638
Old lady I-rang. Song-chu.

358
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:39,387
Do not cry.

359
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,683
They wanted to die together.
They got their wish.

360
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,573
I will have to hunt them down.

361
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:03,327
Hunt who down?

362
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,372
The barbarians who killed
old man Song-chu.

363
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,672
They must have spread out
to loot what they can.

364
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,886
-With the three of us?
-Why?

365
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,890
Did you not say men should wield swords

366
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,185
and teach evil guys a lesson?

367
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,231
I have no interest in saving the king,

368
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,485
but I will not forgive those
who killed old man Song-chu.

369
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,821
I will go with you.

370
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,753
Darn it.

371
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,844
I told you not to make any sound.

372
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,429
Please…

373
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,098
Please be quiet.

374
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,894
What do we do? What should we do?

375
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,229
Jong-jong.

376
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,522
You can deliver the baby, right?

377
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,898
Me?

378
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,191
I cannot.

379
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,777
I have only waited on you my whole life.

380
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,362
I have never done a manual task.

381
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,114
Then who will deliver the baby?

382
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,414
All right.

383
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,499
I will try it.

384
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:23,467
Check how dilated I am.

385
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,312
There is blood.

386
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,065
Lady Eun-ae.

387
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,444
Lady Eun-ae. My lady.

388
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,615
What do we do?

389
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,943
Can you see the baby's head?

390
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:24,862
I am not sure.

391
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,698
All I see is blood…

392
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,951
Touch it to feel how dilated it is.

393
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,286
You want me to touch it?

394
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,641
This much.

395
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,227
It has dilated this much.

396
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,520
Then,

397
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,106
we still have a while…

398
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,498
I can see it.

399
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,708
I can see the head.

400
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,835
-How much…
-It is

401
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,711
the size of a persimmon.

402
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,296
It is this big.

403
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,342
Push just a little harder.

404
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,718
But do not make any noise.

405
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:43,816
Almost there.

406
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,818
Push a little more.

407
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,823
Pull the baby out.

408
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,116
Pull it out?

409
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,341
I got it.

410
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,885
I am holding it.

411
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,580
Lady Gil-chae.

412
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,756
Baby.

413
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,615
Baby, do not cry.

414
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,866
Do not cry.

415
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,785
You must not cry. Please.

416
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,204
Please…

417
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,122
Do not cry.

418
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,690
Gil-chae.

419
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,651
You delivered it.

420
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,488
I knew you would…

421
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,674
It is cold.

422
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,135
It is too cold.

423
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:19,054
If we leave my baby like this,

424
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,432
it will die.

425
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,019
Bangdu.

426
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,527
Madam Bangdu.

427
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:37,406
What is wrong? Madam Bangdu.

428
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,499
Please, no…

429
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,590
Jong-jong, stick to Madam Bangdu.

430
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,633
What?

431
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:59,011
Eun-ae. Eun-ae.

432
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,679
Eun-ae.

433
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:04,850
Keep Madam Bangdu in your arms
or the baby will freeze to death.

434
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,311
I will go look for something.

435
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,229
Now.

436
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,488
Excuse me.

437
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,324
The barbarians…

438
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,957
I am sorry.

439
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,629
Madam Bangdu…

440
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:00,132
Madam Bangdu has a baby.

441
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,552
The baby might freeze to death.

442
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,849
I am really sorry.

443
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,936
I am really… I am really sorry.

444
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,038
Look what I got.

445
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:37,836
Jong-jong.

446
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,923
Mix the ground grain with water
and give it to Madam Bangdu.

447
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,424
I will go look around again.

448
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:45,677
Gil-chae.

449
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:47,513
Gil-chae.

450
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,473
Gil-chae.

451
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,687
Gil-chae.

452
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,025
Gil-chae, is that you?

453
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,697
Are you alone?

454
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,157
Where are the other girls?

455
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,201
Damn.

456
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,620
I heard there was silk
and fair-skinned women in Joseon.

457
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,914
That is why I came,
and it nearly cost me my life.

458
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,458
My family is waiting for me

459
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,086
to bring back silk and hostages.

460
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,933
You are pretty.
I can sell you off at double the price.

461
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,605
But before that…

462
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,193
I will have some fun first.

463
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:36,223
If a woman is violated by the barbarians,
death is inevitable.

464
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:39,101
But even if a woman
only has a brief encounter,

465
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,686
how could she continue to live?

466
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,211
Gil-chae.

467
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,216
Nothing happened to me today.

468
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,137
But people might not believe that.

469
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,807
So can you keep what happened…

470
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,715
You and I

471
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,967
fell down the mountain,

472
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,720
so our skin and clothes got torn.

473
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,096
You have never

474
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,057
met a barbarian.

475
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,267
And I have

476
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,437
never killed anyone.

477
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,293
Nothing…

478
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:31,963
happened…

479
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,510
to us at all today.

480
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:22,556
Lady Gil-chae.

481
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:27,811
Madam Bangdu.

482
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,412
Lady Gil-chae, I am sorry.

483
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,955
Do not talk to me.

484
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,582
I will get hungry if I talk.

485
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,084
Lady Gil-chae.

486
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,882
We just have to cross that mountain.

487
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,759
Let us go to Bul-gang,

488
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,596
who lives on our field in Geumdure.

489
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:06,433
Bul-gang's wife is a great cook.

490
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,853
We will ask her for white rice

491
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,522
in seaweed soup with beef.

492
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,026
We will ask her for some taffy,

493
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,445
and some sikhye too.

494
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,656
Sounds good, right?

495
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,618
Hang in there

496
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,620
a little longer.

497
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,436
What is that?

498
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,481
Go check.

499
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,541
Kill him!

500
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,929
I know you.

501
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,600
You are to become my husband, right?

502
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:56,644
But

503
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,689
where are you right now?

504
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:02,859
I am…

505
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,905
scared and exhausted.

506
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,645
He is here.

507
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,856
My husband-to-be is really…

508
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:49,030
Who is that ugly thing?

509
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:50,949
There are women!

510
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,662
Jong-jong, take the baby and run!

511
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,205
Hurry. Get up!

512
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,586
This way!

513
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:10,385
Run!

514
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:17,851
No!

515
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,317
No!

516
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:34,988
Are you all right?

517
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:42,203
Lady Gil-chae.

518
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,336
Husband, look out!

519
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,649
Are you all right?

520
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,193
Are you hurt anywhere?

521
01:00:21,075 --> 01:00:22,201
Blood…

522
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:27,624
But, my lady,

523
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,459
did you just

524
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,711
call me "husband"?

525
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:21,010
You have been secretly
wanting me as a husband.

526
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,011
Are you going to keep teasing me?

527
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,263
I do not want to disregard your feelings.

528
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,391
How about we spend some time
in a relationship limbo?

529
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,601
How long would we be in limbo for?

530
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,353
Rumor has it that the Khan is here.

531
01:01:30,436 --> 01:01:31,938
Do the people of Joseon stand a chance?

532
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,439
Despite the risk of death,

533
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,483
I will find out
if the Khan is really here.

534
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:36,484
Where are you off to?

535
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,945
We are not done
hunting down the barbarians.

536
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,446
I see now that a relationship limbo

537
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,657
is just an excuse to be unreliable.

538
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,118
My lady. Do you want me to stay?

539
01:01:55,795 --> 01:02:00,800
