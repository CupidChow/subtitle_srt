1
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,294
-Jong-jong. Let us do this.
-All right.

2
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,338
Here we go.

3
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,811
So, my point is

4
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:07,609
that even the Neunggun-ri woman
with 99 tails cannot impress me.

5
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,614
Is he coming? Is he on his way?

6
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,827
He is coming! He is here!

7
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,830
Remember what I told you?

8
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,583
But it could be dangerous.

9
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,127
You can do it, Jong-jong!

10
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,879
I believe in you, Jong-jong!

11
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,090
Have you ever heard the sound

12
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,134
-of flowers blooming?
-What are you doing?

13
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,097
But…

14
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,598
I was just trying to help,

15
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,184
-and this is what I get?
-Who? Me?

16
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,728
When did I ever ask for your help?

17
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,855
What?

18
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:27,981
Well, then,

19
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,109
was someone else supposed to catch you?

20
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,694
Of course…

21
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,043
You are a lucky man.

22
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,714
I am the lucky one? Not you?

23
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:56,217
You are lucky to have indulged
in my company when we have only just met.

24
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,637
I do not know where you rolled in from,

25
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,681
but you may roll back
and continue on your way.

26
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:03,766
Your luck ends here.

27
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,687
But should you not thank me
at the very least…

28
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,856
Excuse me, I am still talking…

29
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,818
Did you not say you would fix the swing?
Young Master, I am truly disappointed.

30
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,404
I told you it was not fully fixed yet…

31
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,949
I will fix it properly this time!

32
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,785
It will not happen again!

33
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,999
You should have fixed it properly!

34
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,001
-I told you to do it properly!
-Dae-o!

35
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,252
-Gosh.
-Me?

36
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,173
The sound of that flower
is quite boisterous.

37
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,550
Give it back.

38
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,469
Flower?

39
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,347
Who are you calling a flower?

40
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,849
I don't see any flower.

41
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,532
My lady…

42
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,665
Those two seem to be having
another boring conversation.

43
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,918
Let us call it a day.

44
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,212
I am not satisfied with these socks.

45
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,263
There she is.

46
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,889
-I should go and confront her.
-But…

47
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,646
Why does she

48
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,731
look so deflated?

49
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,067
She was fiery just a moment ago.

50
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,404
Indeed. It looks like someone
slapped her and made her cry.

51
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,197
Or perhaps

52
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,741
she wants to slap someone
and make them cry?

53
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,037
What are you talking about?

54
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,253
It is me.

55
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,182
Why is he all riled up?

56
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:20,069
That lady who lives in this village…

57
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,864
There's more than one lady
in Neunggun-ri, you know.

58
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,409
I mean the haughty one
who thinks she is pretty.

59
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,995
You mean Lady Gil-chae?

60
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,413
That is the one.

61
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,623
Wait.

62
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,251
Gil-chae, you said?

63
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,087
Yes. Yoo Gil-chae.

64
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,922
Daughter of Master Yoo Gyo-yeon.

65
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,092
They say she has broken
many a man's heart.

66
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,013
You too?

67
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,351
What do you mean, "you too"?

68
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,772
He has fallen hard for Lady Gil-chae.

69
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:02,236
I suppose you are
no different from the rest, Young Master.

70
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,281
Why are you laughing?

71
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,035
What is so funny?

72
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,288
What do you mean no different?

73
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,003
I have finished my work
and come back home.

74
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,379
Hi, honey.

75
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,466
-Let me untie your ribbon…
-Gosh.

76
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,343
That old man.

77
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,513
He cannot go a single day
without doing something cringey.

78
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,140
Each to their own.

79
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,478
Hey, stop that needlework
and go and find out

80
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,772
what's happening
with my admission to the academy.

81
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,651
They do not want to accept you.
So, why force your way in?

82
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,822
You submitted a blank answer sheet.
Have you no shame?

83
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,200
You said you were embarrassed

84
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,910
to serve a master
who could not enter an academy.

85
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,872
Did you not hear the words
of that 99-tailed woman,

86
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,833
Lady Gil-chae, or whatever her name was?

87
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,503
She said I rolled in from nowhere

88
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,214
and then told me to roll away.

89
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,637
I will put down roots here
just to show her.

90
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,522
You will pay three times
the price of persimmon in rice

91
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,649
if we let him into the academy?

92
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,692
Yes.

93
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,818
You fool!

94
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,820
Even if our storehouse is empty,

95
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,364
do you think someone can
buy their way into this academy?

96
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,491
No, I mean…

97
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,249
We do not have an abundance of rice,

98
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,919
nor can we let the rice
he is offering go to waste.

99
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,964
I guess we have no choice
but to accept it.

100
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,385
You have made a wise decision.

101
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:55,766
But why are you so desperate
to enter our academy?

102
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,144
If you want to pass
the civil service exam,

103
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,688
there are more prestigious academies.

104
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,732
I have no interest
in the civil service exam.

105
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,901
But…

106
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,570
I have one request.

107
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,448
What? Another request?

108
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:14,410
What did I say?
I told you this guy had some other scheme.

109
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,120
You know old man Song-chu, right?

110
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,250
This December
is his 60th wedding anniversary.

111
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,753
So, I would like to hold
a celebration for him.

112
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,798
Since he has farmed
the academy's land his whole life,

113
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,302
I was hoping we could hold
the celebration here at the academy.

114
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:36,265
Of course, I know that such celebrations

115
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,059
are usually only for the nobility.

116
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,228
So, it might not be fitting
for old man Song-chu--

117
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,397
Has it really been 60 years
since old man Song-chu got married?

118
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,944
-They are a reverse age-gap couple, right?
-Are you saying his wife is older?

119
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,403
She looks young for her age.

120
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,280
Have you heard the rumors?

121
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,740
Even now, the two of them at night--

122
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,284
Do not be ridiculous.

123
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,620
Is it really true?

124
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:07,129
But why should you hold the celebration?

125
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,341
Since old man Song-chu
oversees our academy's land,

126
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,592
we should hold it.

127
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,638
It is true such celebrations
are typically for the nobility.

128
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,889
But they say…

129
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,561
etiquette comes from the heart.

130
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,940
"Etiquette comes from the heart"?

131
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,987
You can really smell
the bamboo in this village.

132
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,240
Oh, my goodness!

133
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,044
Were you… waiting for me?

134
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,716
I had a matter to deal with
at the academy--

135
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,551
Let us not do this.

136
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,678
How did you know
I would be passing by here?

137
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,597
Listen here.

138
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,099
Enough is enough.

139
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,726
As I said,

140
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,145
I was not waiting for you.

141
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,606
I happened to be going this way.

142
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,151
I was just walking forward,
minding my own business--

143
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,235
I am sure.

144
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,321
That is what they all say.

145
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,573
I bet the fool Ondal
used the same tired trick

146
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,492
to seduce Princess Pyeonggang
a thousand years ago.

147
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,746
Anyway, I am in a hurry.

148
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,750
Fool Ondal?

149
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,752
Trick?

150
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,920
How absurd.

151
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,716
This entire day has been absurd!

152
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,112
My lady.

153
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,907
I apologize for saying this,

154
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,660
but women are not allowed
to enter the academy--

155
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,620
Do not be so old-fashioned.

156
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,832
As always, I cannot stop you.

157
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,806
Do not be like that.
I mean, do not do what you just did.

158
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,810
Do not try so hard to ignore
the feelings you have.

159
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,526
You smiled at me
earlier today, did you not?

160
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,195
I know well

161
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,030
what that smile meant.

162
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,118
Yes.

163
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,830
I could not help but smile when I saw you.

164
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,957
Who could see you and not smile?

165
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,208
Young Master.

166
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,793
You, my lady,

167
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,878
could have any man you want.

168
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,880
However,

169
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,259
Lady Eun-ae only has me.

170
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,788
Geun-sam once said to me

171
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,541
that I could live without him,

172
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,209
but Yak-sun could not.

173
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,838
Then, he dumped me and went to Yak-sun.

174
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:41,343
When men say such things,
their true feelings are actually--

175
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,970
I have been too complacent.

176
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,851
I do not know much about
Young Master Yeon-jun's life in Hanyang.

177
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:50,853
Think about it.

178
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,273
Sungkyunkwan scholars
sit the highest exams

179
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,650
and work closely by the king's side,

180
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,944
so matchmakers must
have their eyes on them.

181
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,072
I need help.

182
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,366
Someone who is worldly

183
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,703
and understands the refined tastes
of Hanyang people.

184
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,710
Gosh!

185
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,337
What an absurd thought!

186
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,506
No, that will not do.

187
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,508
What is the matter?

188
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:27,264
No matter how worldly
and knowledgeable he is about Hanyang,

189
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,059
I could never accept
the help of that misogamist.

190
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,987
Listen. I definitely was not
waiting for you here,

191
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,113
so do not misunderstand…

192
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,282
No, wait.

193
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,285
This is old man Song-chu's house.

194
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,790
Were you waiting for me?

195
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,503
If you want to spend more time with me,

196
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,506
I will give you a chance.

197
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,815
I need your help.

198
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,444
What reason do I have to help you?

199
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:27,908
The master of the academy
you are desperate to join is my father.

200
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,538
But I am already set to enter the academy.

201
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,708
You are buying your way in, are you not?

202
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,251
I know about that.

203
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,212
But if you help me this time,

204
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,172
I will help you too.

205
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,976
Come closer.

206
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:06,322
I will secretly show you
the questions for the next exam.

207
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,795
You will really…

208
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,843
show me the next exam questions in secret?

209
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,637
That is what I said.

210
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:34,058
I heard you could not write
a single word on the last exam.

211
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,976
That is why people are whispering

212
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,062
that you might be a fake nobleman.

213
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,026
So, what kind of help
do you want from me in return?

214
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,576
I was born and raised here in Neunggun-ri,

215
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,162
but honestly, I do not fit in here.

216
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,833
I belong somewhere
more glamorous and grand.

217
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,379
Somewhere… like Hanyang, perhaps?

218
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,342
So, I am curious about life in Hanyang.

219
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,344
What do people there talk about,

220
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,720
what clothes do they wear,

221
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,013
and what do they like?

222
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,474
I want to know what kind of things

223
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,143
they find attractive in a partner.

224
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,898
But why would you seek help

225
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,484
from someone like me,
who is no better than the fool Ondal?

226
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,487
I was shortsighted.

227
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,783
I thought you had scandalous intentions,

228
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,952
but then I remembered that you claim to be

229
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,246
a misogamist or whatnot.

230
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,624
Then, there is no issue.

231
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,419
There is nothing between us.

232
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,130
We could never marry each other,

233
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,132
so we are not a man and a woman…

234
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,341
Well, obviously,

235
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,676
I am a woman.

236
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,845
But I am not a woman to you.

237
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,763
And you are a man.

238
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,807
But you are not a man to me.

239
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,559
You are just…

240
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,603
like a rock

241
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,440
or a blade of grass to me.

242
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,447
So, we can help each other
without any reservations.

243
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,577
You will help me, will you not?

244
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,026
Welcome!

245
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,034
Welcome!

246
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,994
Welcome!

247
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,039
These days,

248
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:06,251
it is fashionable to wear socks
that are a size too small.

249
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,426
And all the daughters
of the top three officials of Hanyang

250
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,969
think this color of rouge--

251
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,262
I had a feeling

252
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,889
this color would suit me.

253
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,516
They think this color is tacky.

254
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,398
They prefer this color instead.

255
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,997
These are the most
popular novels in Hanyang.

256
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:48,710
They reflect the desires and wishes
of Hanyang people.

257
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,675
Here, take it.

258
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,596
The Tale of Un-yeong?

259
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,476
It is a story about a scholar
who meets a beautiful woman

260
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,395
named Un-yeong in his dream.

261
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,480
A dream?

262
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,733
You know,

263
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,196
I sometimes have very vivid dreams too.

264
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,618
Sometimes they feel so real.

265
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,621
In those dreams, there appears…

266
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,003
What are you doing?

267
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,478
What is the matter?

268
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,860
Change your clothes.

269
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,781
Noble ladies cannot enter
the place we are going to next.

270
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,534
Let us see.

271
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,244
Will it fit?

272
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:08,957
Are you telling me
to wear a man's clothes?

273
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,792
Do you not want to live in Hanyang?

274
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,631
No.

275
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,675
Raise it higher, then roll it.

276
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,764
Like this?

277
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,225
-No, the other way.
-The other way…

278
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,269
-Like this?
-No.

279
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,772
Oh, come on!

280
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,357
This is really frustrating.

281
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:35,984
Sit down.

282
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,188
Will this take much longer?

283
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,649
It is done.

284
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,659
I would have made a very handsome man.

285
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,163
Is that so?

286
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:41,026
Ryang-eum, when are you coming out?

287
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,402
Come out now!

288
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,946
-Come on out!
-Come out!

289
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,490
-Come on!
-Ryang-eum!

290
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,325
-Yes, there he is!
-He is here!

291
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,954
Who is Ryang-eum?

292
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,124
Consider yourself lucky.

293
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,045
You are about to hear
the voice of Joseon's greatest singer.

294
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:04,341
It can only be heard
in places like Usimjeong in Hanyang.

295
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,469
He is putting on
a special performance here today.

296
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,637
Of course…

297
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,933
since all you do in Neunggun-ri
is frolic at flower festivals,

298
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,560
I am not sure you will know
how to appreciate good singing.

299
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,626
I gaze into the distance

300
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:47,717
At your dear face

301
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,306
Carried on

302
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,894
A distant wind

303
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:02,607
The memory of a face

304
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,694
I long to see again

305
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:13,076
You must be just like me

306
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:21,668
Waiting with your head

307
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:27,591
In your hands

308
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:31,386
I wait for you

309
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:36,558
To come down

310
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:41,021
That path

311
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:44,691
At the slightest rustle

312
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:48,820
Of a bamboo leaf

313
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:55,327
In the twinkling moonlight

314
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,578
Are you crying?

315
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:02,000
I see

316
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,337
You standing with your back to me

317
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:12,385
But then you turn

318
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,888
And smile at me

319
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:18,600
I put what remains of my longing

320
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,562
Into the memories of back then

321
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,149
One drop at a time

322
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:31,363
I pour in every last drop

323
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:35,408
I love you

324
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:39,412
With only my heart

325
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:44,542
I love you

326
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:48,713
With only my heart

327
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,200
He is the best.

328
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,411
He is truly a master singer.

329
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,415
That was wonderful.

330
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,712
I have never heard something so beautiful.

331
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,443
He is a true master!

332
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,154
Let us go now.

333
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,223
What is it that you dream of?

334
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,685
Pardon?

335
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,605
Did you not say
you had dreams that felt real?

336
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,192
Well…

337
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,863
It is nothing.

338
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,448
What?

339
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,177
So, the rumors are true after all.

340
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,971
Even though we are alone like this,

341
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,516
you do not blush or stutter.

342
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,894
I guess it was true you are
a misogamist or whatever

343
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,938
because you cannot perform as a man…

344
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,441
What?

345
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,785
Is it not true?

346
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,203
It must be.

347
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,627
What is so funny?

348
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,262
Nothing, my lady.

349
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,098
Let us go.

350
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,273
My lady.

351
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:59,362
I imagine all the men you have met
have been timid young scholars

352
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,742
who know nothing of the world.

353
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,828
That is why they get flustered

354
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,831
when you throw them a glance.

355
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,127
But, my lady…

356
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,214
I am different.

357
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,803
Well,

358
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,306
you will see soon enough.

359
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,692
What is it?

360
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,945
Do I suddenly look like a person to you

361
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,406
instead of a rock or blade of grass?

362
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,215
Here, take this.

363
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,807
These clothes…

364
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,478
When should I return them?

365
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,440
I am leaving tomorrow
to exchange persimmons for rice.

366
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,150
I may be away for a few months.

367
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,820
Then, I will see you off tomorrow

368
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,738
since I need
to return these clothes anyway.

369
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,074
That sounds good.

370
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,527
What am I thinking right now?

371
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,092
MOON LINGERING ON PEAR BLOSSOMS
THE ONE ENGRAVED IN MY HEART

372
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,930
"The one engraved in my heart"?

373
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,476
What is that?

374
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,356
It seems some woman gave it to him.

375
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,734
How could he leave it
lying around so carelessly?

376
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,736
What was I doing
thinking about such a man?

377
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,322
By the way,

378
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,200
Young Master Yeon-jun
is in the guest house.

379
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,730
My young lady cannot come.

380
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,857
Some young masters are visiting.

381
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,704
Let us go.

382
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,420
Then, I will submit the petition as it is.

383
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,047
Let me read it to you.

384
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,718
He hardly compares
to the bold Young Master Yeon-jun.

385
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,012
What was I thinking?

386
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,723
"The king of the barbarians
has declared himself an emperor."

387
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,892
"If Joseon, a nation of propriety,
sits back and does nothing,

388
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,645
we too will be no different from beasts,

389
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,773
and the people
will lose their faith in us."

390
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,985
"Therefore, Your Majesty,
we ask that you prepare to fight…"

391
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,079
Your Majesty,

392
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,624
petitions are pouring in
from all eight provinces,

393
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,293
pleading for us to fight the barbarians.

394
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,919
Why do you insist on sending envoys

395
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,047
to assess the situation
in the Jin royal court?

396
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,632
If we do not send envoys to appease them,

397
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,927
they will surely use that
as an excuse to invade.

398
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,429
Fine.

399
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,890
But the letter we deliver

400
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:22,935
should rebuke them for breaking
the terms of the peace treaty.

401
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,064
Once we lose the people's faith,
it cannot be easily regained.

402
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,567
Do you not know that is
more fearsome than the barbarians?

403
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:39,911
Your Majesty,

404
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:44,415
if you rebuke the Jin
about keeping the peace treaty,

405
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,167
it will ruin everything.

406
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,254
I know. How could I not know?

407
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,340
But

408
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,551
I seized the throne from Gwanghae

409
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,595
because of his pro-barbarian stance.

410
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,182
If I now try to appease the Jin,

411
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:04,644
how will the young officials
and scholars react?

412
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,855
You need not follow
all the advice of the young officials.

413
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,192
Perhaps

414
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:14,695
a war is inevitable.

415
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:22,161
I still clearly remember our escape
to Ganghwa Island ten years ago.

416
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:33,089
They will certainly try
to capture Anju Fortress.

417
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:37,677
Give a thousand cotton rolls
from the royal storage to the soldiers

418
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,221
and send the rest
north of Cheongcheon River

419
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,473
to prepare for an invasion.

420
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,061
We have fortified the fortresses
since the last Jin invasion.

421
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,522
Now, we have no choice
but to trust in them.

422
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,901
Even if things go wrong,

423
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,737
we still have Ganghwa Island, do we not?

424
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,371
QING DYNASTY'S SHENYANG PALACE

425
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,146
Your Majesty,

426
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,607
the Joseon king is preparing for war,
strengthening fortress defenses,

427
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,611
and stocking Ganghwa Island
with cannons and supplies.

428
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,822
Ganghwa Island
is all they have ever relied on.

429
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,117
However, Your Majesty,

430
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,204
though their nation is small,
during the Goguryeo era,

431
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,664
they defeated the Sui Dynasty's
army of 100,000,

432
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,500
and in the end,
they won the seven-year war

433
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,336
against the Japanese invaders in 1592.

434
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:56,380
That is why our first invasion
failed to advance further.

435
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,966
I know.

436
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,469
They are small but fierce.

437
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,473
So, this time,

438
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,558
we must come up with

439
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,019
a different approach.

440
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,231
I can wait.

441
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:17,235
I waited for Father to choose me
over my seven older brothers,

442
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:22,573
and after becoming Khan,
for my brothers to acknowledge me.

443
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,783
So,

444
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,161
I can wait for Joseon's rivers to freeze.

445
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,872
Being patient

446
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,459
has never failed me.

447
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,173
Do you know how to save a dying man?

448
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,844
If you feed him grains first,
his stomach will be shocked,

449
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,721
and he will vomit to death.

450
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,847
So,

451
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,392
you must feed him a bowl of dung water.

452
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,894
Feed him well-fermented dung water,

453
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,771
and when his complexion turns yellowish,

454
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:57,149
that is when you feed him rice porridge
to get him back on his feet.

455
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,859
That bastard

456
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,697
survived by drinking my dung water.

457
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,240
And he repays me

458
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,576
by reporting me to the authorities
to steal my business?

459
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,120
So,

460
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,455
you want me to give Kkeut-soe a beating?

461
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,499
A beating is not enough.

462
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,044
I want him dead.

463
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,775
-No.
-No?

464
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,569
What do you mean? Why not?

465
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,738
I do not pay you bribes for nothing!

466
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,698
Kkeut-soe pays bribes too.

467
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,199
He pays more than you.

468
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,662
Do you have proof Kkeut-soe betrayed you?

469
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,706
Well, Sueda said--

470
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,125
You fool.

471
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,835
You believe what Sueda says?

472
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,171
Are you mocking me?

473
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,632
Do you think I am still
just a nomad Jurchen?

474
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,559
Ningqujin,

475
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,020
do not forget.

476
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,396
You can only play

477
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,692
in the dung water I tell you to play in.

478
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,695
Die!

479
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,038
Let us call it a day.

480
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,211
So,

481
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:43,756
will Big Brother
side with Ningqujin or Kkeut-soe?

482
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,965
Who knows?

483
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,188
Prepare 600 grams of these for me.

484
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,192
I will pay with ten boxes
of the finest persimmons from Neunggun-ri.

485
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:06,278
Ten boxes of persimmons
for 600 grams of tobacco?

486
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,198
That is unacceptable,
no matter how lofty you act.

487
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,200
If you agree,

488
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:16,288
I will sell the old tobacco
piled up in your storehouse.

489
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,166
I heard you once
crossed the river to sell tobacco

490
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,169
but only got robbed
and did not get a fair price.

491
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,296
Will you really sell it for me?

492
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,341
What will you do with all that tobacco?

493
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,178
I will exchange it for rice
to send to Neunggun-ri.

494
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,889
We have a problem!

495
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,267
My lord,

496
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,644
Sueda has been stabbed.

497
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:16,807
Move aside.

498
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,602
Move!

499
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,145
Big Brother is in a bad mood today.

500
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:24,190
So try not to speak out of turn.

501
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,858
-Move!
-Move!

502
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,735
Move aside!

503
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:40,498
It is good to see all of you
Joseon, Jurchen, and Tsushima bastards

504
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,919
gathered like this
for the first time in a while.

505
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,924
So, Sueda has been killed.

506
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,386
For guys like us,
even if we meet a sudden demise,

507
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,515
the best we can hope for
is to die painlessly.

508
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,935
But here in Uiju,

509
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:05,022
there should not be
any knife fights I do not know about.

510
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,317
A few days ago, Sueda sent word

511
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,903
that he had something urgent to tell me.

512
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,781
But he died on his way to see me.

513
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,157
Someone

514
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,327
killed him to shut him up.

515
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,581
Surely, it is the work of someone
coveting my business.

516
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,960
Who would covet

517
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,378
something so petty?

518
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,381
Can you really call
diverting tax rice a business?

519
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,716
TAX RICE: RICE PAID AS TAX TO THE STATE

520
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,343
To divert tax rice,

521
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,679
there are so many officials you need

522
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,098
to bribe from the bottom to the top.

523
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:43,060
You benefit by using the officials

524
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,187
that we work hard to bribe,

525
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,314
but you claim we have no right
to meddle in your business?

526
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,734
Is that why you reported me
to the authorities?

527
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,613
And you killed Sueda to cover your tracks!

528
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:55,906
Do you have proof?

529
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,703
If anyone here

530
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,455
killed Sueda,

531
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,083
I will deal with them personally.

532
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,507
We need to take care of Kkeut-soe

533
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,301
before he makes his move.

534
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,205
You vile bastard.

535
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,374
You are asking to die.

536
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,251
You bastard.

537
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,420
You think you will be safe after this?

538
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:55,799
I am the great Ningqujin.

539
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,678
You are quite good at cursing in Joseon.

540
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,723
But let me ask you something.

541
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,352
Do you think the barbarians
will invade Joseon?

542
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,645
What?

543
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,813
Why are you asking me that?

544
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,523
Why are you asking--

545
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,401
Why? Because you are a barbarian too.

546
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:18,489
Even the Qing barbarians once treated

547
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:22,159
Joseon as their older brother.

548
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,535
But now that they have some power,

549
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,954
they want to attack their former brother.

550
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,748
What do you think?

551
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,377
Is it not the same as what you are doing?

552
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,341
What is it?

553
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,222
While you were loudly
threatening to kill Kkeut-soe,

554
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,432
you were secretly plotting with Kkeut-soe…

555
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,103
to kill Big Brother.

556
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,313
Did you think I would not know?

557
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,566
And

558
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,654
Sueda acted as a messenger for you two.

559
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,573
Now that he's dead,
your friendship with Kkeut-soe

560
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:05,494
is no longer worth more than a beggar's
foot wrapping. That is what I am saying.

561
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,037
No.

562
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:11,375
I told him I did not want to do it.

563
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:15,337
It was all Kkeut-soe's idea!

564
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,728
Do not believe him.

565
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,647
I said I would rather die than do it!

566
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,233
It was all this bastard's doing!

567
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,776
You bastard!

568
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,778
Shut that mouth of yours!

569
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,613
You shut up, you barbarian scum!

570
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,532
You shriveled-up looking bastard!

571
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,160
I have hated you from the start!

572
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,495
You insolent little shit!

573
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,207
I will tear you apart!

574
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,131
Your underlings are on their way.

575
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,258
Save me.

576
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,469
Save me.

577
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,305
Do not worry,
I called your underlings too.

578
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,891
They said they would
catch and kill Ningqujin.

579
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:12,436
Now that you two are enemies,

580
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,480
fight to your heart's content.

581
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,986
Hey, Gu-jam, they are coming.

582
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,601
USIMJEONG

583
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,990
Are you hurt?
You must have put yourself out.

584
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,700
Hardly.

585
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,286
All he did was sit back
and enjoy the show.

586
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:12,996
Where is Big Brother?

587
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,600
You are here.

588
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:37,312
Big Brother, please spare me!

589
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,440
Please spare me!

590
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,489
Hey, can you dance?

591
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,782
What?

592
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:50,742
Dance?

593
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,386
Do you want to be my son?

594
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,681
We should live side by side

595
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,183
as father and son

596
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:21,481
until our black hair turns gray
right here in Uiju.

597
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,943
Have you grown senile?

598
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:27,613
Do you not want to?

599
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,740
I do not.

600
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,908
Why not?

601
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,084
Okay,

602
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,378
I will make sure
you put down roots in Uiju.

603
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,922
That old man and his temper…

604
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,429
Do not stop.

605
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,806
Keep going.

606
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,307
Are you awake? Then…

607
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,476
What are you doing?

608
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,104
Who are you?

609
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,522
My name is Yeong-rang.

610
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,899
It means I am bright and clear
like the morning dew.

611
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,984
Stay still. I know what to do.

612
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,778
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

613
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,781
Shall I undress you?

614
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,242
Stop, do not do that.

615
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,661
Move back. Move back.

616
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,080
Good.

617
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,044
Right. So…

618
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,715
What did you say your name was again?

619
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:10,757
It is Yeong-rang.

620
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,719
Right, it means bright and clear.
I get that.

621
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:17,305
But why are you trying
to take off clothes here?

622
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,808
Why? Because I am here to serve you.

623
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,059
Serve me?

624
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,646
When they mentioned your name,
all the kisaeng fought to come.

625
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,898
Stop. Put down your hands.

626
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:32,571
Your cheeks are still round with baby fat.

627
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,866
How old are you?

628
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,409
I am 15 now.

629
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,121
Actually, I am 16,

630
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,582
but I still look 15.

631
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:48,503
That darn old man.

632
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,548
My lord!

633
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,091
I will catch you.

634
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,968
Come this way.

635
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,887
Come!

636
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,764
Come this way.

637
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,515
Got you!

638
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,643
Oh, my. I caught one, too.
You old bastard.

639
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:06,855
You are here.

640
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,607
Leave. Leave.

641
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,277
Geez.

642
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,197
Why would you send
such a young girl into my room?

643
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,032
Why? Was she not your type?

644
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,868
Should I send a different girl?

645
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,954
You old jerk.

646
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,625
Do you think this will get me to stay?

647
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,211
What?

648
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,671
Do you plan to leave Uiju again?

649
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:36,760
Did you not say last time
you would be back after a month?

650
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,553
You were away for over a year!

651
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,827
I am getting old now.

652
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:05,831
Now, I too…

653
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,839
What happened to Gu Yang-cheon,
King of Beggars?

654
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,343
This time, I mean it.

655
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,639
I will come straight back
after paying for the persimmons.

656
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,530
Why is he bringing him?

657
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:41,658
My lord! My lord!

658
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,661
My young lord, Jang-hyeon!

659
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,833
Bright and clear Yeong-rang.
You came to see me off?

660
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,919
Yes! People have been
treating me so nicely

661
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,588
since I put my hair up for you!

662
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,006
Is that so?

663
00:52:56,882 --> 00:53:00,844
But why is there a rumor
that I am impotent?

664
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,430
That wench, Ae-ok…

665
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:06,057
I told her not to tell anyone!

666
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,392
-Yeong-rang.
-Yes?

667
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:10,186
Let me be clear.

668
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,688
I am not…

669
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,901
I am not…

670
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:20,447
I am not leaving you behind
because I am you-know-what.

671
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,286
Are you sorry?

672
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:28,538
If you are sorry,

673
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,707
will you grant me one request?

674
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,751
Anything. Just say the word.

675
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:35,921
Until you lose your baby fat,

676
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,547
do not even think about

677
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,425
doing up your hair.

678
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,509
Why not?

679
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,511
You are too young--

680
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:46,932
Do you perhaps want
to have me all to yourself?

681
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:52,729
Then, you will return once you have cured
that lower body illness, right?

682
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,648
I told you, I am not…

683
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,107
-I am not…
-Let us go.

684
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,026
It is already out in the open now.

685
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,527
But it is not true.

686
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,612
How would I know?

687
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,614
You know it is not true.

688
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:05,492
Stop it. She thinks you are being serious.

689
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,077
Come on.

690
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,788
My lord, I will wait for you!

691
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:12,499
I will wait five years, even ten.

692
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,669
So, you must cure your lower body illness!

693
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:19,339
You must come back
with a healthy lower body!

694
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,174
It is not true!

695
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,343
I am telling you, it is not!

696
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,520
The weather is fine,
and the breeze is lovely.

697
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,610
I can say this now that it is over,
but Sueda dying was for the best.

698
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,697
That rat was always switching sides,

699
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,365
using lies to turn people
against each other

700
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,034
and getting them killed.

701
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,037
And Kkeut-soe is not much better,

702
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,416
putting on that innocent face
and denying he killed Sueda.

703
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:57,043
He has turned into quite the con man too.

704
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,801
But then again,

705
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:09,806
Kkeut-soe has always been too dumb to lie.

706
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:17,939
Was the person who ordered Sueda's death…

707
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,042
Why did you do it?

708
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,255
Because I am also a bad guy.

709
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,515
Gosh.

710
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,142
We are nearly there.

711
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,435
Raise it up.

712
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,687
-Like this?
-Just like that.

713
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:58,813
Give me that.

714
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,732
-Take this.
-All right.

715
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,238
Sixty years ago,

716
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:53,076
I was working in the fields
when they said the bride was coming.

717
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,830
I quickly washed my face
in the stream and went down.

718
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,583
I thought,
"Who would marry a man like me?"

719
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:04,671
But there she was,

720
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:08,216
floating along like a full moon,

721
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:11,594
carrying just one small bundle of luggage.

722
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,514
I could not say a word.

723
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:18,810
I just took the bundle from her
and trudged along.

724
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,354
I did not enter
the nuptial chamber that night.

725
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,189
I just drank.

726
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:25,900
People whispered

727
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,113
that it must be

728
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,198
because my bride was mute.

729
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:35,618
But that was not it.

730
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,038
It was because I was sorry.

731
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,709
I was sorry that a woman so beautiful

732
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:47,672
had to marry a farmhand like me,
who did not own a patch of land.

733
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,427
Leave her in my hands.

734
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,431
I will make you the most
beautiful bride in the world.

735
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,422
And the other side…

736
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:45,355
That Lee Jang-hyeon said
he would come for the celebration.

737
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:49,442
Did I not tell you
we could not trust him?

738
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:52,737
It is here! It is here!

739
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,031
The rice is here!

740
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,287
The rice is here!

741
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:48,334
Here comes the groom!

742
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,432
Welcome. Welcome.

743
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,480
Here comes the bride!

744
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:21,242
Here comes the bride!

745
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:54,651
May you live a long life together.

746
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:10,583
May your union be blessed.

747
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:23,179
May you have a hundred years
of happiness together!

748
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:26,349
May you live a thousand years!

749
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,031
-What is this?
-Who is that?

750
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:45,493
For this special occasion,
I will sing a song.

751
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:47,453
He is going to sing!

752
01:01:55,545 --> 01:02:01,926
I gaze into the distance

753
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:09,142
At your dear face

754
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:14,731
Carried on

755
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:18,609
A distant wind

756
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:23,239
The memory of a face

757
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:26,325
I long to see again

758
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:33,374
You must be just like me

759
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:39,213
Waiting with your head

760
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:42,633
In your hands

761
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:46,721
I wait for you

762
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:50,725
To come down

763
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:55,688
That path

764
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:59,192
At the slightest rustle

765
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:03,571
At the slightest rustle

766
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:06,741
Of a bamboo leaf

767
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:13,331
In the twinkling moonlight

768
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,588
Was there a man you liked?

769
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,469
Why do you always…

770
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:34,560
Today, I will make Young Master Yeon-jun
an offer he cannot refuse.

771
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:37,438
What offer can he not refuse?

772
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,023
I will kiss him.

773
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:42,360
What if your father finds out?

774
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:44,028
How would he?

775
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:47,031
Now, quickly go
and bring Young Master Yeon-jun.

776
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:50,785
Tell him I suddenly
turned pale and collapsed. Hurry!

777
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:53,663
Go on, my dear Jong-jong.

778
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,339
Young Master…

779
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,893
Young Master…

780
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:17,728
Young Master…

781
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:24,819
My lady!

782
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:27,154
My lady!

783
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:28,823
Young Master.

784
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:31,033
Why are you sweating so much?

785
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:33,369
Do you want water?

786
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,413
-Jong-jong.
-No, I am fine.

787
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,916
I was just a little startled.

788
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,710
Jong-jong.

789
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,343
Startled?

790
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:51,637
What could startle a brave woman like you?

791
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:55,766
Brave? What do you mean?

792
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,937
I am even afraid of small flies…

793
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:04,442
Oh, my!

794
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,783
You little…

795
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:14,994
This is so embarrassing.

796
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,873
I chased it away.

797
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:20,124
Are you all right?

798
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,264
Young Master,

799
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:40,061
all this time,
I have only been testing your heart.

800
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:43,064
You must have been frustrated
that I did not show my true feelings.

801
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,400
Let me tell you now.

802
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:50,363
Yes, I feel the same way as you.

803
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,619
What?

804
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,271
My lady,

805
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:26,816
I am to marry Lady Eun-ae.

806
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:30,361
Is a childhood promise
really that important?

807
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:33,239
I am not with Lady Eun-ae
because of a childhood promise.

808
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:37,410
I truly care for Lady Eun-ae.

809
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,081
Then,

810
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,959
what was the meaning
of those looks you gave me

811
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:47,169
and your sweet words?

812
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:49,005
Were you toying with me?

813
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,798
You are my master's daughter

814
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,842
and Lady Eun-ae's dearest friend…

815
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:56,679
So, you were just being kind?

816
01:06:58,264 --> 01:06:59,390
Liar.

817
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:01,308
You are lying.

818
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:02,601
I know.

819
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,270
I know how you feel for me--

820
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,940
Let us pretend this never happened.

821
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:18,451
I was first!

822
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,244
I liked you first.

823
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:22,496
I am the one who introduced you to Eun-ae!

824
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,874
-I was the first to love--
-Gil-chae.

825
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,421
Gil-chae?

826
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,716
Gil-chae.

827
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:54,612
I just saved you from a lifetime
of being a laughingstock.

828
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,039
Gil-chae.

829
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:09,919
Gil-chae!

830
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:13,839
How could she disappear in that state?

831
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,008
Gil-chae!

832
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,094
Yes, how strange…

833
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:19,804
My lady?

834
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:30,606
Did you eavesdrop?

835
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,483
Eavesdrop?

836
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,945
How could I not hear
that loud love confession?

837
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:38,280
You rude scoundrel.

838
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,700
Something about falling
for a friend's friend, was it?

839
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:46,247
It is like the plot
of a cheap play I saw in the market.

840
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,958
A relationship between two people

841
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:52,253
that is wrong and forbidden,
or something like that.

842
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,964
The plot of that cheap play
went like this.

843
01:08:57,049 --> 01:09:00,803
"I trusted both of my friends."

844
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:05,516
"So, I introduced them to each other
without any worries.

845
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:09,145
We would get together

846
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,689
and enjoy each other's company.

847
01:09:11,772 --> 01:09:14,942
That is all it was supposed to be."

848
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:24,660
So, you liked Young Master Yeon-jun?

849
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:26,704
Was he

850
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:29,957
the man you hoped would catch you
when you fell from the swing?

851
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:35,546
I was excited to hear there was
a 99-tailed fox in Neunggun-ri.

852
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:38,090
But you cannot even win
one man's affections.

853
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,508
Are you

854
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:41,760
done talking?

855
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:43,721
About what?

856
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:50,186
You mean about the fox with 99 tails?

857
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:55,858
Well, I could talk about that
until I am old and gray.

858
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:58,819
But what I really want to say is this.

859
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:04,158
I do not think you have any chance
with Young Master Yeon-jun.

860
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:06,577
Shut your mouth.

861
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,912
So, do not hold onto false hope.

862
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:09,496
I told you to shut it.

863
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:11,457
Come to me, instead.

864
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:25,095
Are you proposing to me?

865
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,723
Proposal? Not at all.

866
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:31,185
You know I am a misogamist.

867
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:33,229
Right. You hate marriage.

868
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,022
Why kill the romance

869
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:37,316
with something like an engagement?

870
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:40,236
Even the most passionate love fades

871
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,738
after a few encounters.

872
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:44,448
So what I am saying is

873
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:47,826
we should forget
cumbersome stuff like marriage.

874
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:50,579
Instead, let us engage in a hot…

875
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:51,997
Hot?

876
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:57,211
A hot and intimate love affair.

877
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,132
I do not make offers like this
to just anyone.

878
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:05,594
Other women do not understand
this kind of talk.

879
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:08,347
But since you are

880
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,891
an unusually gusty lady,

881
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,060
I sense that you understand me.

882
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:20,776
So, you finally show your true colors.

883
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,822
Have you fallen for me?

884
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:26,907
You are a man, after all.

885
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,576
It is only natural for you
to feel that way about me.

886
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:32,037
One look from me takes your breath away.

887
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,373
Two looks make you yearn.

888
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:39,670
Three looks make you so lovesick
that you cry to your parents like a child.

889
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:44,341
That is the affliction all the men
in this village suffer

890
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:47,636
as a result of falling for me.

891
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:51,348
But guess what?

892
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,437
I really

893
01:11:57,021 --> 01:11:58,856
do not like you.

894
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,153
You do not like me?

895
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:05,612
You "really do not" like me?

896
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,323
That is right. I do not like you!

897
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:11,535
I hear you like to revel
in making women laugh and cry.

898
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:12,661
But it will not work on me.

899
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,663
So when you've had your fun,
roll off to somewhere else

900
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:17,249
-and stop muddying our waters.
-Wait, wait, wait.

901
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:21,211
Why exactly am I not good enough?

902
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:23,589
Are you curious?

903
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:27,426
Can you handle what I am about to say?

904
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,891
You shamelessly associate with barbarians

905
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:37,311
and mislead elders with honeyed words,
playing with their hearts.

906
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:40,105
You hide like a rat
and eavesdrop on others,

907
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:43,776
you dare to grab
an unmarried woman's wrist,

908
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,362
and you steal women's hearts

909
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:50,157
only to cowardly back out,
claiming to be a misogamist.

910
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:51,992
A "bachelor for life."

911
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,912
But above all,

912
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:58,040
I dislike that gaunt face of yours.

913
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,170
You are ugly!

914
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:19,144
Oh, my husband

915
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:23,607
Oh, my husband

916
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,949
My love

917
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:36,120
You are my love

918
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:40,374
Oh, my love

919
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:44,628
You are my love

920
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:48,799
Oh, my love

921
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:53,053
Oh, bright moon

922
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:57,808
No matter how busy you are

923
01:13:57,891 --> 01:14:02,396
They seem to be gossiping about me again.

924
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,064
What are they saying this time?

925
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:09,445
They say you will
surely end up like Eoudong,

926
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:13,282
who was executed in King Seongjong's time.

927
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,077
Those nasty gossipers.

928
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:27,796
If only I could love many men
like Eoudong did.

929
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:32,968
All I want is a man
who is constant and steadfast,

930
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:35,804
whom I can love constantly.

931
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:42,978
You think Young Master Yeon-jun
is a steadfast man?

932
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:45,314
Yes.

933
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:47,774
Young Master Yeon-jun is constant.

934
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:51,528
Men are naturally fickle and unfaithful.

935
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:54,948
They always look for a prettier flower.

936
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:57,701
But Young Master Yeon-jun
is not like that.

937
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,084
I just want to be with the one I love.

938
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,672
We would view flowers in the spring,

939
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,468
dip our feet in streams in the summer…

940
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,639
make wine out of wild grapes in the autumn

941
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:20,849
and drink it in the winter.

942
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,154
We would grow old together.

943
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:43,872
Is that how you want to live?

944
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:52,798
Do not let us grow old

945
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:57,010
It is love

946
01:15:57,094 --> 01:16:01,181
My love

947
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:05,519
You are my love

948
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:11,316
Oh, my love

949
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:19,199
They say snow on a wedding day
means lifelong happiness.

950
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,869
May you both live long and prosper.

951
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:25,956
May you live long and prosper!

952
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:29,501
May you live long and prosper!

953
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:46,393
Disguise yourself as a merchant,

954
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:49,146
press forward through day and night.

955
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:52,733
And surround the palace
of the Joseon king!

956
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:39,988
Do not waste time
battling at every Joseon fortress.

957
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:43,283
You must enter Hanyang
before the Joseon king flees to Ganghwa

958
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:47,371
and wait for my arrival.

959
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,644
The barbarians have invaded!

960
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,272
The barbarians…

961
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,692
The barbarians have invaded!

962
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:01,820
They have

963
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:04,448
imprisoned the king!

964
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:05,991
What did he say?

965
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,701
What?

966
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,830
What should we do?

967
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:15,751
Is it true, Sun-yak?

968
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:04,424
People of Joseon, let us rescue our king.

969
01:20:04,508 --> 01:20:06,593
Those with burning hearts, step forward.

970
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:08,386
-I will go.
-Anyone else?

971
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,096
I can help.

972
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,681
Young Master Yeon-jun could die.

973
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,141
We must stop him.

974
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:15,227
Please do not join the volunteer army.

975
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,605
My lady, our country is falling,
and the king is already captive.

976
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:21,525
If you go to battle against those
brutal barbarians, you might…

977
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:22,567
Then,

978
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,903
if I am lucky enough to return alive,

979
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:28,532
kiss me once with those precious lips.

980
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:45,090
