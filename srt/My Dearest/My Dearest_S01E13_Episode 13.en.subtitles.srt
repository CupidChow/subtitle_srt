1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,584
Ttaeng-ttaeng.

2
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,504
My goodness.

3
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,257
You are bursting with energy.

4
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,969
Why are you crying?

5
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,305
Why are you crying? My goodness.

6
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:56,931
Gosh.

7
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,808
My gosh.

8
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,062
Are you hungry?

9
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,022
Are you full?

10
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,690
Are you sleepy?

11
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,192
My goodness.

12
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,277
Stop crying, Ttaeng-ttaeng.

13
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,491
Boys should not cry this much.

14
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,409
The porridge is savory.

15
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,213
There is no need.

16
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,675
I had some breast milk left.

17
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,094
Thank you for calming the baby…

18
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:40,099
but I cannot let my Ttaeng-ttaeng
feed from the same breast

19
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,268
as the child of the enemy
that killed its parents.

20
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,813
What enemy?

21
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:58,993
My baby!

22
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,621
-My baby!
-Come here.

23
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,498
My baby!

24
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,127
The barbarians are
Ttaeng-ttaeng's enemies.

25
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,841
Is your baby not the child of a barbarian?

26
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,011
Never feed my Ttaeng-ttaeng
your milk again.

27
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,234
My baby…

28
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,449
is not the child of a barbarian.

29
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,623
-It is smallpox!
-It is the plague!

30
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,708
It is the plague!

31
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,752
-It is smallpox!
-It is the plague!

32
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,338
-Smallpox!
-It is smallpox!

33
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,549
-It is the plague!
-Smallpox!

34
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,108
Catch them!

35
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,406
My lady, come out!

36
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,277
Have you been well?

37
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,535
It has been a while.

38
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,490
How dare you get in my way?

39
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,284
I am sorry.

40
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,579
I am still not good with a bow.

41
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,000
Who are you?

42
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,336
Who can say?

43
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,758
Why should I tell someone
who hides behind a mask?

44
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,729
Let us meet again.

45
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,233
I think I will be very sorry
if I do not get to see you again.

46
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,124
Jong-jong.

47
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,051
My lady…

48
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,018
Jong-jong, come on.

49
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,411
Please go, my lady.

50
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,330
Come with me!

51
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,500
I will not make it far in this state.

52
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,587
Thank you so much

53
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,757
for saving my grandson.

54
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,637
Please go. Hurry.

55
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,756
If we get caught,

56
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,800
our bodies will be tarnished.

57
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,179
So,

58
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,847
I would rather…

59
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,267
-No!
-No!

60
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,567
No.

61
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,913
What do you think you are doing?

62
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,376
To return with a tarnished body
is to sin against my parents.

63
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,838
What does my wanting to live
have to do with my parents?

64
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,216
Jong-jong.

65
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,470
Before, at Ganghwa Island,
everyone else jumped, but we lived.

66
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,680
I was happy to live.

67
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,349
But

68
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,769
if the barbarians catch us now…

69
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,063
That will not happen.

70
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,773
I will protect you.

71
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,818
Take my hand.

72
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,612
Take it.

73
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,708
Take my hand.

74
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,598
There is nowhere to run.

75
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,728
Die!

76
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,439
You Joseon bastard.

77
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,945
Die!

78
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,453
You darn wench.

79
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,747
My lady.

80
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,291
My lady.

81
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,500
Take her!

82
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:46,961
Let go!

83
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,045
-My lady!
-Jong-jong!

84
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,714
-My lady!
-Jong-jong!

85
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,133
-My lady!
-Where are you taking her?

86
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,594
Jong-jong!

87
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,221
Jong-jong!

88
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,515
Jong-jong!

89
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,059
Jong-jong!

90
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,188
-Is anyone there?
-Yes.

91
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,941
-Do you have a room?
-Of course.

92
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,818
-Come this way.
-Thank you.

93
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,323
Let us go in.

94
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,799
Are you going
to Shenyang to free a captive?

95
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,594
-How did you--
-It is obvious.

96
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:42,016
Everyone going to Shenyang
to free a captive goes through here.

97
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,480
So, who are you freeing?

98
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,440
Your parents? Your children?

99
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,239
Give it to me.

100
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,993
What an incredible beauty.

101
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,745
Is she your wife?

102
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,420
-Why are you laughing?
-Must I say it?

103
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,507
A noble lady was taken captive.

104
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,843
Have you checked
the list of captives in Shenyang?

105
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,096
Well, I…

106
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,891
It may be different if she was sold
in the crown prince's hall.

107
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,228
But if she was taken to the slave market,

108
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,688
her body will have been used
by many other men.

109
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,690
Do you still want to get her back?

110
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,234
-What?
-My goodness.

111
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,819
Save me.

112
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,570
Sir!

113
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,905
Please calm down.

114
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,244
You punks.

115
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,121
Please save us.

116
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:34,253
I sold all my land and went to Shenyang
with 50 yang to free my captive son,

117
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,756
but they suddenly demanded 100 yang.

118
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:42,761
They said other wealthier families
freed captives by paying 100 yang.

119
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:47,266
So they refused to give him back
unless I also paid 100 yang.

120
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,771
Even if I sell myself,
I won't get that much money.

121
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,402
That does not justify
stealing the ransom for my wife.

122
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,778
My lord.

123
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:04,033
My lord, your wife will
already have lost her chastity.

124
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,784
What is the point of freeing her?

125
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,622
You can always get another wife,

126
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,833
but how can I replace my son,
who is my flesh and blood?

127
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,918
Be quiet.

128
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,794
Please save my son.

129
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,298
If you lend me money now,
I promise to repay you.

130
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:23,344
My son is close to dying from sickness.

131
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,930
My lord.

132
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,521
The boat will be arriving soon.

133
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,106
My gosh, where is he?

134
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,154
My lord!

135
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,948
My lord.

136
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,741
Did you get our things back?

137
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:52,248
Your wife will
already have lost her chastity.

138
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,166
What is the point of freeing her?

139
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,965
Master!

140
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,467
My goodness.

141
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,096
Master, there you are.

142
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,264
Young lady.

143
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,182
He is here.

144
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,561
Father, why are you out again?

145
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,770
Get up.

146
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,274
My goodness.

147
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,903
Father.

148
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,282
Did the barbarians
really take Gil-chae this time?

149
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,868
Yes, Young Master.

150
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,369
This time,

151
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,248
the barbarians really took Lady Gil-chae.

152
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,001
Sorry.

153
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,629
She was taken by barbarians.

154
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,883
She kept leaving her house.
I knew something would happen.

155
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,428
Let's go.

156
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,850
Was she really taken by barbarians?

157
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,602
That is what I said.

158
00:14:55,603 --> 00:15:01,483
Officer Gu sold all his products
at low prices to pay for the ransom.

159
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,695
Gosh. What did I say?

160
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:09,658
If a woman runs around making a spectacle,
she is bound to get in trouble.

161
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,577
Watch your mouth.

162
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,622
Why should I watch my mouth?

163
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,963
Get our lady's name
out of your dirty mouth.

164
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,214
What?

165
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,676
You reported one of our workers
as an escaped captive

166
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,387
and caused everyone
at this smithy great harm.

167
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:34,224
We will not let someone like you
get away with that.

168
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,226
What are you talking about?

169
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,270
-My goodness.
-My goodness.

170
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,897
-Goodness.
-What are you doing?

171
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,649
-Goodness.
-You should have been careful.

172
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,445
My goodness! Why are you doing this?

173
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,406
Dear gods, I pray to you.

174
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,953
Please help Gil-chae return safely.

175
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:57,498
Please watch over Officer Gu,
who has gone to get her.

176
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:04,004
Please help Gil-chae and Jong-jong
to return with no injuries.

177
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,257
Dear gods, I pray to you.

178
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,845
Please help Gil-chae return safely.

179
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,770
SHENYANG, GIL-CHAE,
OFFICER GU WON-MU

180
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:23,524
I have confirmed that Officer Gu's wife
was unjustly taken by the Qing.

181
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,777
So I request the state's intervention.

182
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,280
Officer Gu has rushed to Shenyang,

183
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,866
but we do not know
if he will find his wife.

184
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,577
-Please inform the royal court--
-Was this really

185
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,621
written in Lady Yoo's blood?

186
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,708
-Your Honor.
-What?

187
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,002
"Inform the royal court"?

188
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:48,215
What if we report that the Qing arrested
someone who was not really a captive,

189
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,843
only for it to turn out
she really was an escaped captive?

190
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,094
What will you do then?

191
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,639
If things go wrong,
the Qing will not forgive me.

192
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,434
Will you take responsibility
for the consequences I will face?

193
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,270
My goodness.

194
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,832
You remember the man
who helped you not get exiled, right?

195
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:27,463
I heard he recently helped free
some captives as well.

196
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,342
What about seeking him out
and asking him to help free Gil-chae?

197
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,262
I am not sure.

198
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,473
Did you know his family was

199
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,100
recognized as the great contributors
during the last king's reign?

200
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,606
Then you likely do not know
what they did to be considered that.

201
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,193
On top of that, he makes many appeals

202
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,820
that interfere with
His Majesty's every affair.

203
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,740
It is hard to tell if he is really

204
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,701
a loyal subject or someone trying

205
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,079
to earn honor.

206
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,086
What should we eat?

207
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,047
We can go to the place
we went to last time.

208
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,341
-May I go as well?
-Of course.

209
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,967
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

210
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:15,636
I have something to ask.

211
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,680
Would you tell Lord Jang

212
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,267
that Nam Yeon-jun, who he helped before,
is here to pay his respects?

213
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,645
Nam Yeon-jun?

214
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,106
Are you the Nam Yeon-jun
who was imprisoned

215
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,607
for protecting his integrity?

216
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,697
I finally get to see you.

217
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,242
Forgive me.

218
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:42,621
You helped me greatly,
but I am late to pay my respects.

219
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,498
No.

220
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,626
The one who helped you
was His Majesty, not me.

221
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:49,711
But why

222
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,298
have you come to see me now?

223
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,677
To be honest,

224
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,681
my wife's friend, whom you met before,

225
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,226
was falsely arrested by the Qing
as an escaped captive.

226
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,271
The paper and inkstone

227
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,232
represent my feelings toward my father.

228
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,067
Please accept them.

229
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,407
She was a truly intelligent woman.

230
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,828
How could such a thing happen?

231
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:30,627
Our academy has made appeals
and helped free captives before.

232
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,089
But they were taken captive
while protecting the fortress

233
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,674
when the Jin invaded.

234
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,968
In a case like this,

235
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,805
where someone has been
falsely arrested as an escaped captive,

236
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,560
since we cannot find evidence
of her not being an escapee,

237
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,688
even I cannot help you.

238
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,190
But--

239
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,609
Our academy cannot raise appeals

240
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,779
based on our personal connections.

241
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,241
I have no justification.

242
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,996
I am embarrassed we are unable to help.

243
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,708
It is all right.
Thank you for letting me meet him.

244
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,336
By any chance…

245
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,465
have you thought of joining us?

246
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:22,054
If a scholar renowned for his loyalty
were to join us, it would be much help.

247
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,558
What help could I be?

248
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,686
The country is collapsing.
Will you stand by and watch?

249
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:35,776
Even if you are not a civil officer,
as a scholar, you should help the country.

250
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,572
Our master has that much power.

251
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,451
Our master raised a petition to the king

252
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,995
that resulted in rice
being sent to Pyeongan Province.

253
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,665
And his appeal for medical supplies
to be sent to each province

254
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,874
will also take effect soon.

255
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,003
There are

256
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,590
many things someone like you can do here.

257
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:05,430
Look how strong its teeth are.

258
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,350
Look, it is getting up.

259
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,520
We tried to bring 25 cows, as you ordered,

260
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,481
but we sent back the sick
and skinny ones on the way,

261
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,692
so we only brought 23.

262
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,696
You truly brought the best cows.

263
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,532
Good work.

264
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,211
Thanks to you,
I did not have to go to Mongolia.

265
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,296
Thank you.

266
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,380
Me too.

267
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,676
If you are that grateful, can you give me
100 sheets of white paper?

268
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,263
How did you know
I secretly brought in white paper?

269
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,724
You cannot fool Interpreter Lee.

270
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,643
But we cannot give it immediately.

271
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,854
We need it to free captives.

272
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,397
Do you mean Lady Yoo?

273
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,690
Yes.

274
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:00,610
I do not know when she got dragged here,
but she is now a maid of the prince.

275
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,405
What…

276
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,575
are you talking about?

277
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,161
It was around a month ago.

278
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,456
I went to deliver a message to the prince,

279
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,084
and a maidservant told me
a Lady Yoo from Joseon was here.

280
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,963
But I did not properly catch
who she wanted me to inform,

281
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,092
so I asked if any interpreters
knew a Lady Yoo.

282
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,094
This guy stepped up.

283
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,643
She is the daughter of the man
who raised me like a son.

284
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,271
I must help as much as I can.

285
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,404
Right.

286
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:48,075
The princess is here!

287
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,955
The princess is here!

288
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,797
The princess is here!

289
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,471
The princess is here!

290
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,237
Raise your head.

291
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,209
Now that you have seen my face,
tell me who you are.

292
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,971
So,

293
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,516
the hunter of captives
hidden behind that mask…

294
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,769
Yes. It was me.

295
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,814
Now, tell me.

296
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,775
What did you do
with the captives you caught?

297
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:08,572
General Yonggoldae tasked me
with catching escaped Joseon captives.

298
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,449
I was merely following his orders.

299
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,578
This is a bothersome turn of events.

300
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,663
Bothersome?

301
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:24,754
Should I make things

302
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,882
really bothersome for you?

303
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,348
What?

304
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,474
Are you surprised?

305
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:43,064
I am well-acquainted
with the language and people of Joseon.

306
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,736
If you lie to me again…

307
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,740
I will cut off your tongue.

308
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:55,619
So tell me.

309
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,538
What did you do with the captives?

310
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,625
You should ask General Yonggoldae

311
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,962
where he got the silver

312
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,840
he has been pocketing privately.

313
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,061
I did hear there was
a snaky Joseon interpreter

314
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,563
looking out for the royal family's gain.

315
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,566
I see that interpreter is you.

316
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,988
They say that you are
the fastest at procuring

317
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,491
whatever is needed in the palace.

318
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,331
Is there something you need?

319
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,253
There is one thing.

320
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,843
Give me

321
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,012
your time.

322
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,734
Please tell me.

323
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,611
Tell me where you took Jong-jong.

324
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,321
Tell me.

325
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,865
Where did you…

326
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,326
Where did you take my dear Jong-jong?

327
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,682
I am half Joseon myself,

328
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,560
so I do not want
to mistreat a Joseon person.

329
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,729
But you leave me no choice.

330
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,357
Now your fate depends on your actions.

331
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,740
Lady Yoo.

332
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,579
CROWN PRINCE'S HALL

333
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,748
There is no Lady Yoo
on the list of captives

334
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,959
the Qing are willing to trade for ransom.

335
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,295
I am certain she was captured by the Qing.

336
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,548
It took me a month to get here.
Please check again.

337
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:18,094
Three of the captives caught escaping
had their heels cut off,

338
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,681
and the rest have been returned
to their owners.

339
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,684
The owners who want their slaves returned

340
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,103
hand over a list
to the crown prince's hall,

341
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,272
but those who do not

342
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,067
do not even give a list.

343
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,362
We have no way to help.

344
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,156
Go to the slave market.

345
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:44,079
I heard a Joseon woman was thrown out
into the slave market recently.

346
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,956
I heard she was a great beauty,

347
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,126
but she inflicted a wound
on her own forehead.

348
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:07,352
It may be different if she was sold
in the crown prince's hall,

349
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,647
but if she was taken to the slave market,

350
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,024
her body will have been used
by many other men.

351
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,665
Follow me!

352
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,958
Move!

353
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,168
Get up!

354
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,255
Faster!

355
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,132
Walk properly!

356
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,262
Faster!

357
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,893
Walk faster!

358
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,899
Go ahead. Get to it.

359
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:55,984
Yes, sir.

360
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:04,659
Excuse me. Take a look at this.
Have you seen this person?

361
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,584
Have you seen this person?

362
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:13,918
This person.

363
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,670
That woman.

364
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,255
You have seen her?

365
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,883
It is her, right?

366
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,177
No, it is not her!

367
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,814
So I grabbed him
by the neck with one hand,

368
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,941
tripped him and made him fall.

369
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,652
Then I shoved raw meat into his mouth.

370
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,037
How strange.

371
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,626
Do you feel nothing around me?

372
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,545
Pardon?

373
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,174
That is the only way
to explain your behavior.

374
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:06,888
Most men stutter in my presence

375
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,808
or avoid my eyes.

376
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,572
So, the rumors are true after all.

377
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,408
Even though we are alone like this,

378
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,410
you do not blush or stutter.

379
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,931
It has been a while

380
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,100
since I laughed like this.

381
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,988
When did you learn the Joseon language?

382
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,532
No, more importantly,

383
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:13,872
why is a princess catching captives
while wearing a disguise?

384
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,543
I have visited Joseon often
since I was young.

385
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,172
If I said it was me who told His Majesty
about Joseon's situation,

386
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,508
would you believe me?

387
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,351
But now, His Majesty

388
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,104
does not seem to need my help.

389
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,483
He seems to increasingly dislike
women roaming outdoors.

390
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:47,697
He told me to just
keep the palace women under control.

391
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,993
I got bored,
so I started to hunt captives.

392
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,248
The thing about me is that

393
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:04,714
even if my country were to lose a war,
I would rather die than become a captive.

394
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,594
The sight of people
wanting to live even as captives

395
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,472
is pathetic to me.

396
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,655
It seems you have never experienced
something not going your way.

397
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,079
There are things in this world
you cannot control.

398
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,251
It does not matter how determined you are.

399
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,303
There are some things that can…

400
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,224
never be guaranteed.

401
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,233
You must be

402
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,444
speaking from experience.

403
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,358
Move.

404
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:49,027
I can walk fine on my own.

405
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,135
I thought all Joseon people

406
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,221
fell into one category or the other.

407
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,684
They either fear us for being barbarians

408
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:25,480
or look down on us for being barbarians.

409
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,233
But…

410
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,737
you are strange.

411
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,282
You do not fear us,

412
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,534
but

413
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,121
you do not look down on us either.

414
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,126
How could I look down on someone

415
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,712
as beautiful and smart as you?

416
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,272
We are outside.

417
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,070
Then,

418
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,905
shall we go inside?

419
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:23,746
You can

420
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,457
serve me in bed as well.

421
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,546
Since the royal family
makes Joseon maids serve them in bed,

422
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,342
I should make a Joseon man
serve me in bed as well.

423
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,682
I am not a captive

424
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,309
or a palace attendant.

425
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:51,399
If a mere Joseon interpreter like me
gets involved with the royals,

426
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,734
I may lose my head.

427
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,946
Please

428
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,198
spare me my life.

429
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,881
Was it not enough
that they forced us to farm?

430
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,467
Now they are demanding
immediate military provisions?

431
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,929
We should inform Joseon.
What does Your Highness think?

432
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:43,784
Call Lee Jang-hyeon.

433
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:58,174
Have you called me to give me
the rest of my punishment?

434
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:00,551
You dare to jest?

435
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,767
The Qing have demanded

436
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,313
that daily military provisions
be sent to the Songshan battlefield.

437
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,776
We have given everything
from Pyeongan and Hamgyeong.

438
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:21,030
How can they demand men and horses
to carry an extra 720 tons of provisions?

439
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,204
Yonggoldae is trying
to intimidate me again.

440
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,875
You praised me for enduring his treatment,

441
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,046
but a crown prince being humiliated
like this in a foreign land is…

442
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,923
Your Highness…

443
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,094
I do not think the Joseon captives

444
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,597
in the slave market
are enduring humiliation.

445
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,101
They are people who have chosen to live.

446
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,020
They are fighting starvation,

447
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:57,108
whippings and extreme cold
with more resolve than ever

448
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,568
to survive.

449
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,657
If they survive one more day,

450
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,035
they become proud warriors

451
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,497
who have won another day of battle.

452
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,793
You say increasingly strange things.

453
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,586
Did Joseon's scholars

454
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:22,675
request that you remain
firmly loyal to the Ming?

455
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,552
Your Majesty,

456
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,430
you are the country's future.

457
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,181
CROWN PRINCE:
THE HEIR APPARENT TO A THRONE

458
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:32,143
By being here and appeasing the Qing,

459
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,937
you are doing your loyal duty.

460
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,734
By being here,

461
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,237
you are preventing another war in Joseon.

462
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:47,742
Your Highness painstakingly reducing
the people's burdens like this

463
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,370
is the true

464
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,374
show of loyalty to your people.

465
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,337
I will

466
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,091
do my best to gather men
and wagons to transport provisions,

467
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,260
even if there are not enough.

468
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,013
This is

469
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,349
my loyal duty

470
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,477
of serving Your Highness.

471
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,440
I am being loyal

472
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,734
to Your Highness,

473
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,362
and you are being loyal

474
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,032
to your people.

475
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,839
The crown prince of Joseon
seems to favor him.

476
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,801
I saw them talking in private
for a long time.

477
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,430
Joseon people are strict
about class boundaries,

478
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,892
yet their crown prince
converses with an interpreter?

479
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,395
What else?

480
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:00,147
He is not friendly with any women.

481
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,526
He merely drinks alone in his spare time.

482
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,657
I guess he was being honest
about not having a lover.

483
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,619
But

484
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,789
he rejects me?

485
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,297
I am looking for someone.

486
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,717
Have you seen this person?

487
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,971
Excuse me, have you seen this person?

488
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,560
I am looking for this person.
Have you seen her?

489
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,620
Bak-dae.

490
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,300
Looking for a captive?

491
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,135
What do you need?

492
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,138
A woman? A man?

493
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,398
Do you know her?

494
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,647
This country

495
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,818
has suffered two invasions
by the Jin Dynasty.

496
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,864
Our crown prince has been taken,
and our people are dying.

497
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:18,410
His Majesty has been troubled ever since.

498
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:25,292
In times like this,
what must we Sarim scholars do

499
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,921
to unite the people's fragmented faith?

500
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:37,179
We must return to the basic teachings
of our saints and sages,

501
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:42,059
who agonized over turbulent times.

502
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,538
Please help Gil-chae return safely.

503
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:06,333
Please guide Officer Gu,
who went to find her.

504
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:11,964
Please watch over Gil-chae and Jong-jong
so they may return safely.

505
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:12,965
Lady Gyeong.

506
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,302
Lady Gyeong.

507
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,679
Officer Gu is back.

508
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,483
Officer Gu, where is Gil-chae?

509
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,124
My goodness.

510
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,503
You should have returned with Lady Yoo.
How could you come back without her?

511
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:55,799
Officer Gu said we should just come back.
What was I supposed to do?

512
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,885
My goodness.

513
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,102
Su-ji--

514
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,271
Do not call my name.

515
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,358
Su-ji, I missed you a lot.

516
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,443
My gosh, you smell. Go away.

517
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,487
What are you smiling for?

518
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,500
She has already been sold.

519
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,002
Want to know who I sold her to?

520
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,175
She is probably
sitting somewhere exhausted

521
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,804
after getting her fill of men.

522
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:47,976
Lord Gu.

523
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,069
Dear husband,

524
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,197
I am going to Shenyang
to bring Gil-chae back.

525
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,700
While I am gone,

526
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:48,078
please watch over Master Yoo,
Yeong-chae and Je-nam.

527
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,375
Wife!

528
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,545
-Lady Gyeong.
-Let us hurry.

529
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,717
Wife.

530
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,635
Why are you doing this?

531
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,929
I have to go myself.

532
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,848
Wife…

533
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,309
So, should I just leave her there?

534
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,102
Please let me go.

535
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,480
Someone has to bring her back.

536
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,122
You have no idea what she means to me.

537
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:50,974
You are leaving?

538
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,310
So-ya.

539
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,106
No. You cannot go.

540
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:08,408
Are you going

541
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,994
to that woman?

542
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,748
Yes.

543
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:16,959
Maybe.

544
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,671
Even if…

545
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,299
we are separated…

546
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,011
and I cannot see them ever again…

547
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,224
I am tied to that person.

548
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,187
I am sorry.

549
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,031
I know

550
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,741
what that woman means to you.

551
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,160
Like I am to you,

552
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,371
you are tied to her.

553
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,208
If something happens to her…

554
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,962
you might go mad.

555
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,478
This woman did this to me.

556
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:20,939
Give me my money.

557
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,316
Give it to me now!

558
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,033
What a troublesome wench.

559
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,377
Where did you send Jong-jong?

560
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:48,050
Tell me where you sent Jong-jong.

561
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,474
Your husband came looking for you.

562
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,242
Greetings, Your Highness.

563
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,080
How dare you make me wait?

564
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,084
For this offense,
you must no longer wish to see me.

565
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,795
So I will take my leave.

566
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:29,716
Not a chance.

567
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,095
You will go hunting with me today.

568
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,740
If I make a mistake,
will those men kill me?

569
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,118
Yes.

570
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,537
How scary.

571
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:02,874
I know you are a man who fears nothing.

572
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,253
But seeing as you come when I call,

573
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,672
you must not dislike me.

574
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,805
When I look at you…

575
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,477
I am sometimes reminded of someone.

576
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,236
I have a husband.

577
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:37,200
He brought around 400 servants.

578
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:43,248
He pitched a tent in the imperial garden
and offered dozens of cows, camels,

579
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:47,210
and even horses with saddles
to His Majesty to request my hand.

580
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,756
He was a Chahar prince,

581
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:54,676
and when His Majesty
conquered the Chahars,

582
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,220
he was the only one
who could defeat His Majesty.

583
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:01,808
He left after seven days
and nights of festivities,

584
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,228
saying he would soon return for me.

585
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,106
I trusted him.

586
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,152
But years passed,
and he still did not come.

587
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:18,492
The daughters of emperors
are bound to enter political marriages,

588
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,746
and I have no problem with my fate.

589
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:25,832
However,

590
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,667
that night…

591
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:34,257
it felt like my husband truly wanted me.

592
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:40,263
I just wonder if that look
in his eyes was fake.

593
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:56,947
I may have to follow His Majesty's wishes
and get married to a Mongolian prince.

594
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,492
But until then,

595
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,537
I am going to have my fun.

596
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,499
So tonight,

597
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,377
you have to serve me in bed.

598
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,444
I can give you my body,

599
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,906
but I cannot give you my heart.

600
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,285
Do you have a woman?

601
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,337
Yes.

602
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,676
She left me and married another man.

603
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:01,803
And yet

604
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,681
you still love her?

605
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,352
I told you before.

606
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,274
It does not matter how determined you are.

607
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,696
Some things

608
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,033
are out of your control.

609
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:27,996
So, are you saying

610
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,458
you cannot serve me in bed?

611
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,885
I am different from that woman.

612
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:47,015
I will never abandon you.

613
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:55,315
Even if I marry another man in the future,

614
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,984
I will take you with me.

615
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,823
So today…

616
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,294
you must serve me…

617
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,090
in bed.

618
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,707
Did you sleep well?

619
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:07,846
In Joseon, we drink water
with honey for hangovers.

620
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,183
I do not get drunk.

621
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,844
Last night…

622
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,598
I mean, did you and I…

623
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,269
Do not worry. Nothing happened.

624
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,075
Did you tend to the fire all night?

625
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:14,037
So that I would not be cold?

626
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,915
Early mornings are still cold.

627
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,017
No. There is no way.

628
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,227
I am sure.

629
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,271
If you did not see it, then do not say it.

630
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,066
Jang-hyeon may look carefree,

631
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:46,528
but he acts like a total fool
when it comes to Lady Gil-chae.

632
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,488
Is the woman called Gil-chae?

633
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,781
She is not just a woman.

634
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,158
She is a noble. A real noble.

635
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:56,037
Well, Jang-hyeon is a noble too,
although he paid to become one.

636
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,456
I knew it the moment I saw her.

637
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,417
She is a white fox with 99 tails.

638
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,503
But Jang-hyeon blindly fell
head over heels for her

639
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,755
and gave her everything.

640
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,090
Gosh, do not get me started.

641
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,093
There's no way
Lee Jang-hyeon fell for a woman.

642
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,220
It is true.

643
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,433
Yang-cheon, I was not going to say this…

644
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:22,814
What?

645
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:23,898
He cried?

646
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,942
-Lee Jang-hyeon cried?
-Yes.

647
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,653
It was my first time seeing him cry too.

648
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:29,737
That says everything.

649
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,994
That is more reason for him
to see another woman.

650
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,662
I am certain

651
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,623
he spent last night with another woman.

652
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,084
I am telling you, there is no way.

653
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,254
Do you want to bet?

654
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:49,007
You punk.
You are taking after Lee Jang-hyeon.

655
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:50,800
What do you mean "a bet"?

656
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:53,845
-Are you not confident?
-Fine, then.

657
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:09,360
What is it?

658
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,738
Where have you been?

659
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:13,573
Tell the truth.

660
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,619
You look like you were sucked dry.

661
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:21,206
Sucked dry? Watch your words.
There are children here.

662
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,291
Were you with a woman?

663
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,543
You were not, right?

664
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,669
There is no way.

665
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,297
You just got drunk and blacked out, right?

666
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:30,632
No.

667
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,842
He was having fun moving about all night…

668
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,636
What do you mean "moving about"?

669
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,638
I spent…

670
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:40,517
I spent the night…

671
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,353
Well, I was with…

672
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,605
I was with a woman, but we just…

673
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,357
We just talked all night.

674
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,069
That is all.

675
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,446
I was right.

676
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,115
Did you really spend the night
with a woman?

677
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,700
Well…

678
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,411
I…

679
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:04,082
I did, but we just

680
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,751
talked all night. Got it?

681
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,087
We just talked.

682
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,849
Your husband came looking for you.

683
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:26,104
Some military officer
came by with your portrait.

684
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:27,230
Really?

685
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:31,776
My husband really came here?

686
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,863
But he went back.

687
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:42,453
He heard you had been sold to another man
and decided to give up on you.

688
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,916
Nothing is going right.

689
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,793
Things keep getting messy.

690
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,173
Let me see.

691
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,848
He must still run hot.

692
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,693
What a turn of events.

693
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,529
Your husband

694
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,740
has come back for you.

695
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,869
I have never seen a man like this.

696
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:52,537
What am I thinking?

697
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:56,624
I asked everywhere,

698
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,211
but there is no way to get wagons
for so many tons of rice

699
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:01,546
unless we build some.

700
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,885
Jang-hyeon,
remember when we lived in Uiju?

701
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:12,807
When Jeolla rice was needed,
the Japanese office sent silver to Jeolla

702
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,851
and we sent the office Uiju silk.

703
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,728
We needed no wagons.

704
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:22,441
Jeolla would send us
wagons filled with rice.

705
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,076
What is wrong this time?

706
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,456
It seems you can teach
an old dog new tricks.

707
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,459
Did you just call me a dog?

708
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:00,897
Ryang-eum!

709
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:05,860
Have you been well?

710
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:14,160
I am not calling you a dog.

711
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:16,162
What I mean by teaching
an old dog new tricks

712
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:17,747
-is that--
-You just did!

713
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,332
You just called me a dog.

714
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,208
I did call you that.

715
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:24,170
-I said you are an "old dog," meaning--
-Ryang-eum is here!

716
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:27,840
Gosh, it is Ryang-eum.

717
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,801
Why did you not send word you were coming?

718
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,521
I came to tell you something.

719
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:50,488
You!

720
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:52,907
Big Brother!

721
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,161
Why is your leg…

722
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:01,207
Yang-cheon.

723
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,710
Yang-cheon.

724
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,963
Why are you crying?

725
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:08,047
Stop crying.

726
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,131
Right.

727
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:12,843
He can still get around
and have fun, so do not worry.

728
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:16,806
Yes, he is alive and well.

729
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:19,642
I am glad you came.

730
01:06:22,269 --> 01:06:23,688
I am not here to see you.

731
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,612
I have something to tell you.

732
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,366
What is it?

733
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:41,956
Lady Gil-chae…

734
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:45,167
I mean, Lady Yoo.

735
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:50,339
She is in Shenyang.

736
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:32,214
All right!

737
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,800
Get excited!

738
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,011
This is a very valuable product.

739
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,096
It is a real

740
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,766
Joseon noblewoman!

741
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,312
-A woman!
-She is pretty.

742
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:53,944
It is a Joseon woman.

743
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:56,363
This real Joseon noblewoman is for sale!

744
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:00,534
She is a Joseon noblewoman.

745
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:05,748
You will not find
a woman like this anywhere else.

746
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:08,876
She is a real Joseon noblewoman.

747
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:11,629
Look how fair her skin is.

748
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:14,381
She has a small scar,
but everything else is intact.

749
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:17,176
This is a perfect product!

750
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,765
The bidding will start at 30 yang.

01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:25,351
Name your prices!

752
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:47,456
I keep seeing things.

753
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:52,021
Hey! If you want the woman, pay up!

754
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,420
Why on earth…

755
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,062
Why

756
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:17,231
on earth…

757
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:33,664
Why?

758
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:38,085
Why?

759
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:43,549
Why?

760
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,773
Is it not strange?

761
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,983
Whenever the moon is this bright,

762
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:45,778
I am always with you.

763
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:49,281
The princess said
she would destroy Interpreter Lee.

764
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:54,411
My lord, please do not
do anything for my sake.

765
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:56,497
No.

766
01:12:57,289 --> 01:12:58,999
I will act as I desire.

767
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:02,711
If it were me,
I would not lose the man I desire

768
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:04,797
to another woman.

769
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:07,257
Do not worry too much, my lady.

770
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:09,093
There is no reason to worry.

771
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:10,302
Gil-chae!

772
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,055
Let us go.

773
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:29,863
