1
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,061
Are you all right?

2
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,401
Lady Gil-chae.

3
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,576
Husband, look out!

4
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,389
Are you all right?

5
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,350
Are you hurt anywhere?

6
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,942
Blood…

7
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,322
But, my lady,

8
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:55,740
did you just

9
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,992
call me "husband"?

10
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:18,555
You know, with every swing of my bat,
I made the barbarians' heads fly off

11
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,932
in all directions.

12
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,228
It was a hassle trying to dodge them,

13
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,606
-you know?
-Talk about brutal.

14
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,025
Tell me about it.

15
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,821
I thought they were cowards
who did not want to fight battles.

16
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,156
Those frauds.

17
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,740
Frauds like that

18
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,285
are welcome.

19
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,412
I would not mind being conned
now and again.

20
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,289
Same here.

21
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,459
Then,

22
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,421
have you not heard
about Young Master Yeon-jun

23
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,006
since his departure?

24
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,969
Do not worry too much.
I am sure they made it to the fortress.

25
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,637
I hope so.

26
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,723
Truly.

27
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:09,564
The barbarians were so surprised
to see a batter like me in Joseon

28
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:14,027
that they named me the Batter of Joseon.

29
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,070
As if.

30
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,488
It is true.

31
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,034
I heard something peculiar earlier.

32
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,243
Someone

33
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,330
called me her husband.

34
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,789
Who?

35
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,666
Beats me. Who could it have been?

36
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,877
Was it not you?

37
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,795
"Husband,

38
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,006
look out!"

39
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,758
That is what I heard.

40
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,010
Young Master, please.

41
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,846
Your fear of the barbarians
must have affected your hearing.

42
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,101
How odd. I know what I heard.

43
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,854
Jong-jong. You heard it too, did you not?

44
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,815
Well…

45
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,234
Gu-jam.

46
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,652
I am sure you heard it.

47
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,529
Well…

48
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,074
Excuse me, Lady Eun-ae.

49
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,451
-Yes?
-You heard it, did you not?

50
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,787
"Husband, look out!"

51
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,705
Yes, I heard it.

52
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,585
Have you all lost your mind?

53
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,883
Lady Gil-chae.

54
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:21,135
Wait.

55
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,388
You sure are clueless for a servant.

56
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,722
Watch it.

57
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,974
Let them be.

58
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:30,061
So, why did you say, "Husband, look out"?

59
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,437
Were you afraid

60
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,481
I might get hurt or be killed?

61
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,359
Wait. That is not what is important.

62
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,403
Why did you call me your husband?

63
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,533
I see. You have been secretly
wanting me as a husband.

64
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,659
Me?

65
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,910
Want you?

66
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,620
As my husband?

67
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,623
That is the most absurd thing
I have ever heard.

68
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,583
Rather than marry you,

69
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,044
I would shave my head
and join the monastery.

70
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,796
I hate to break it to you,

71
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,466
but like I said before,

72
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,260
I am

73
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,304
not interested in marriage.

74
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,266
My motto is,

75
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,270
"Dating is essential,
but marriage is a choice."

76
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,023
Or something like that.

77
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,443
Is that why you have lovers
in all eight provinces?

78
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,528
To always have someone
to fool around with?

79
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,947
Do I have lovers in all eight provinces?

80
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,742
Yes. It is a well-known fact.

81
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,119
Did you think I did not know?

82
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:32,457
So that is why the ladies of Neunggun-ri
saw me as a disgusting beast.

83
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,667
Then,

84
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,587
why is it that you

85
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,007
want me as your husband?

86
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,217
I did not mean it.

87
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,802
I blurted it out by accident…

88
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,180
By accident?

89
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,392
Finally, you recall.

90
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,936
You clearly…

91
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,231
referred to me

92
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,484
as your husband.

93
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,490
Lady Gil-chae.

94
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,952
Do not be embarrassed.

95
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,914
You probably called me that

96
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,375
because, deep down,
you see me as a suitable husband.

97
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,377
In which case,

98
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,880
even though I wanted to stay unmarried,

99
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,966
if you desperately want me
as your husband--

100
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,721
I must have mistaken you for Yeon-jun.
That is why I called you "husband."

101
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,224
As if

102
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,143
I would have said that to a fool
who never wants to marry.

103
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,819
You mistook me for Young Master Yeon-jun?

104
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,422
Madam Bangdu.

105
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,229
Thanks to them,
we will not sleep in the cold tonight.

106
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,607
The baby was born with good fortune.

107
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,193
Maybe we should name him Dae-bok.

108
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,820
Dae-bok?

109
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,322
What a sweet little baby.

110
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,824
He must not take after his mom.

111
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,993
Tell me about it.

112
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,484
What is on your mind?

113
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,112
Young Master Yeon-jun.

114
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,655
You petty man.

115
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,574
I speak the truth.

116
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,951
Is Young Master Yeon-jun

117
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,246
also thinking about the two ladies
who are waiting for him back home?

118
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,664
Or is he

119
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,293
still only thinking about His Majesty?

120
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,878
That was what I was wondering.

121
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,838
Anyway,

122
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,840
thank you

123
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,302
for informing me
of when to flee the village

124
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,929
and for saving us today.

125
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,975
It is true that I am grateful.

126
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,062
Are you truly

127
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,772
grateful?

128
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:45,942
Then,

129
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,818
maybe you will grant me

130
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,654
your lips--

131
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,030
This again?

132
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,702
I am not a serious man, my lady.

133
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,664
The kind of strong feelings

134
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,208
you have for Young Master Yeon-jun

135
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,709
are a burden to me.

136
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,756
Like I said…

137
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,720
all I want is to feel your hot lips--

138
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,390
You make it impossible

139
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,059
for me to be kind to you.

140
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,103
You are a dirty, rude libertine.

141
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,110
A dirty, rude libertine.

142
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,415
We will leave you a horse and cart,

143
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,125
so Madam Bangdu can ride in it.

144
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,419
-All right.
-Where are you off to?

145
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,215
Dae-bok.

146
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,467
Lady Gil-chae is scary, is she not?

147
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,970
Here.

148
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,102
We are not done
hunting down the barbarians.

149
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,228
What about us?

150
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,688
What about you?

151
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,190
Do as you have been doing so far.

152
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,027
You now even know how to wield a dagger.

153
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,657
You should be careful

154
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,909
not to drop such a handy item.

155
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,372
I never used this…

156
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,378
Lady Gil-chae.

157
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,381
I am proud of you.

158
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,801
Remember what I said?

159
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,388
I said you were more reliable

160
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,474
than those feeble scholars.

161
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,768
If you think about it,

162
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,397
you are the one who saved my life.

163
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,736
Thanks to you mistaking me for Yeon-jun
and yelling at me to watch out,

164
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,821
I managed to dodge the barbarian.

165
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,324
Are you going to keep teasing me?

166
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,412
Once you have matured,

167
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,998
I will stop with the teasing.

168
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,750
-Off we go. Giddy-up.
-But…

169
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,301
I will get going.

170
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,677
As if I care.

171
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,323
I wonder if they made it
across the mountain safely.

172
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,950
Jong-jong is pretty weak.

173
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,662
You are really quite cruel.

174
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,290
Do not worry. She will do better than you.

175
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,130
Are they fleeing villagers?

176
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,841
They look like they have been
starving for days.

177
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,635
Wait.

178
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,901
-Here. Have some.
-Thank you.

179
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,237
That is hot.

180
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,617
Eat up.

181
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,751
I heard General Jung's royal forces
suffered a great defeat.

182
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,212
So, tell me.

183
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,631
Where were you headed?

184
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,300
To His Majesty.

185
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,305
But first, we will hunt the barbarians
to offer their heads to the king.

186
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,059
We heard General Kim Jun-ryong's forces
were camped at Mount Gwanggyo.

187
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,354
Will you not join us?

188
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,608
I already told you I am not interested
in rescuing His Majesty.

189
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,360
Anyway,

190
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,447
where are Young Master Sun-yak
and the others?

191
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,301
They had only just joined the battle.

192
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,637
How could they die so soon?

193
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,599
Never have I seen
a more ragtag group of men.

194
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,066
Right?

195
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,486
At this rate, they will all die
just like Sun-yak.

196
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,226
I ran into Lady Eun-ae on my way here.

197
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,315
She was fleeing with the other ladies
without her parents.

198
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,818
Is everyone all right?

199
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,531
That is why I say this.

200
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,284
Why not quit this nonsense
about rescuing the king

201
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,122
and protect Lady Eun-ae instead?

202
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,544
I cannot do that.

203
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,424
I do not believe we can possibly
defeat the barbarians.

204
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,300
There is a good chance

205
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,096
I might die
before I get to meet His Majesty.

206
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,390
Just like Sun-yak.

207
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,726
However,

208
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,187
I cannot lead a life
that goes against my education.

209
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,108
All my life, I have learned
that it is a scholar's duty

210
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,526
to fight for his nation.

211
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,405
Women should obey men.
Children should serve their parents.

212
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:15,075
Subjects should be loyal to their king.
It is a beautiful order.

213
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,328
In return, men must protect women.
Parents must protect their children.

214
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,206
His Majesty and the nobles
have a duty to protect the people.

215
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,960
I will die while trying
to save His Majesty.

216
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,546
If I die for him…

217
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,929
he will protect his people in return.

218
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,350
That is all I believe in.

219
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,995
Let us head together to Mount Gwanggyo.

220
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,502
But I am not doing this for His Majesty.

221
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,462
Then, why…

222
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,724
Bul-gang.

223
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,435
Bul-gang!

224
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,022
Bul-gang?

225
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,535
You know,

226
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,080
I never thought I would
have to do things like this.

227
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,582
Goodness.

228
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,751
Look at the calluses on my hands.

229
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,547
-My hands are chapped and dirty--
-Would you rather I did it?

230
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,674
Would you?

231
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,925
Why, you…

232
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,181
Burning wet firewood
is causing all this smoke.

233
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,307
Madam Bangdu.

234
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,934
You should not be out in the cold.

235
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,853
Did you blanch the dried radish leaves?

236
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,148
You must add a pinch of salt.

237
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,774
Then, squeeze the water out.

238
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,568
Add soy sauce and sesame oil,

239
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,820
then boil in a broth after seasoning them.

240
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,280
Once it comes to a boil,

241
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,615
-it will be ready to eat.
-You are impossible.

242
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,741
-Got it?
-Come on.

243
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,004
Never have I

244
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,340
ever eaten food like this before.

245
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,634
Is that right?
Then, I will eat yours too--

246
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,760
I meant I was excited

247
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,054
to try a new type of food.

248
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,141
You forgot the sesame oil.

249
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,811
Sesame oil must be added
to mask the off-putting smell

250
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,229
so it tastes pleasant--

251
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,315
Where would we find sesame oil?

252
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,443
Peekaboo.

253
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,113
At this rate,

254
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,617
we will starve to death
before the barbarians get to us.

255
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,246
The loyalist forces are here?

256
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,470
General.
We received the order requesting aid--

257
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,763
Is this all the men?

258
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,389
Pardon?

259
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,559
It is an ambush!

260
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,812
General, we are being ambushed.

261
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,857
Can you fight?

262
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,943
Yes, we can fight.

263
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,489
But we just got here.

264
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,661
They must enjoy fighting.

265
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,663
Tell me about it.

266
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,290
I guess they cannot wait to die.

267
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,959
I suggest you stay alert,

268
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,710
or the barbarians will eat you alive.

269
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,879
Hey. Do you not know
I am the Batter of Joseon?

270
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,130
Wait for me!

271
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,343
What do you think you are doing?

272
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,928
That horse belongs to us!

273
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,138
I see it had an owner.

274
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,394
Where are you headed?

275
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,771
The loyalist soldiers who retreated

276
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,190
will join General Kim Jun-ryong
at Mount Gwanggyo.

277
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,400
We are headed there.

278
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,235
Toward the battlefield?

279
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,653
That would be more dangerous.

280
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:22,990
I would feel safer
staying near our own soldiers.

281
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,368
All of my sons went to join the fight.

282
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,453
I cannot sit by and do nothing.

283
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,915
I will aid those who treat the wounded.

284
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,876
In any case, do not covet our horse.

285
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,219
Those do-gooders.

286
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,096
They should just keep fleeing.

287
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,014
I wish to go.

288
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,724
What?

289
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,685
I want to be of help.

290
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,854
I do not want to flee like a coward.

291
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,564
Eun-ae, do not even think about it.

292
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,274
You heard the rumors.

293
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,775
General Jung was defeated,

294
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,610
and the men had to scatter.

295
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,198
Young Master Yeon-jun
may also be at Mount Gwanggyo.

296
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,327
And that is near Heomcheon.

297
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,040
I still say no.

298
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,679
Why did these bastards

299
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,683
have to appear out of nowhere?

300
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,686
Sound of flowers, my ass.

301
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,904
I should be resting somewhere
on a nice, warm floor.

302
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,744
Forget this.

303
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,997
I will just let him die.

304
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,966
Keep your eyes open!

305
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,494
Do not touch it.

306
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,126
Move that out of the way.

307
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,717
I have had enough.

308
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,389
My gosh.

309
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,641
No…

310
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,813
Hold him, will you?

311
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,657
No, please do not let me die.

312
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,742
Mother!

313
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,886
Mother,

314
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,263
are you still there?

315
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,266
I am not your mom.

316
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,227
You are still here,

317
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,771
Mother.

318
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,691
Do not go anywhere.

319
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,443
I am not your mom.

320
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:53,033
Sure. I will not leave you.
I will stay right here.

321
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,827
Is there a physician here?

322
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,664
We need a physician!

323
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,632
Young Master Yeon-jun.

324
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,347
Young Master.

325
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,475
How…

326
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,478
Young Master!

327
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,650
-Young Master. Oh, no.
-Young Master.

328
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,402
Try to stand.

329
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,613
Young Master, what happened?

330
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,698
Young Master.

331
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,574
My goodness.

332
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,538
Please lie down.

333
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,542
Physician!

334
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,313
What?

335
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:16,968
Look here!

336
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,142
You should at least explain what happened.

337
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,773
I could ask you the same.

338
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,486
Why are you here
instead of across the mountain?

339
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,488
Eun-ae insisted on helping the wounded,

340
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,031
so I came with her.

341
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,492
Of course.

342
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:45,038
It is not like you to be interested
in helping others.

343
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,999
Do you know how many people
I have saved here?

344
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:52,128
Just a moment ago, a young soldier
grabbed my hand asking for me to save him.

345
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,088
Sure.

346
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,590
It must've been a hassle
since you couldn't care less.

347
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,592
Who said I did not care?

348
00:27:57,675 --> 00:28:00,804
Are you telling me
you genuinely care for the wounded?

349
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,222
Of course.

350
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,933
I feel anxious and heartbroken for them.

351
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,310
That is as likely
as the sun rising in the west.

352
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,895
Unbelievable.

353
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,398
How can one be this twisted?

354
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:15,318
That is rich coming from someone
who harbors feelings for another's fiancé.

355
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,236
Hey!

356
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,870
Did you just rudely yell at me?

357
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,498
You rudely yelled at me too.

358
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,377
I…

359
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,630
I am

360
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,048
older than you!

361
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,432
Now, tell me.

362
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,184
How did he suffer those injuries?

363
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,269
Better yet,

364
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,187
tell me why you could not prevent

365
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,022
his injuries.

366
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,527
Lady Gil-chae,

367
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,363
how am I to blame

368
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,031
for his injuries?

369
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,534
You said you knew
a lot about the barbarians.

370
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,662
You should have put your money
where your mouth is.

371
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,314
So much for knowing what you are doing.

372
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,110
The cut you got last time
has gotten worse.

373
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,278
Whatever.

374
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,031
I have to get back up there.

375
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,115
Wait.

376
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,703
For goodness' sake.

377
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:50,997
Sit.

378
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,834
Do not go anywhere, and stay right here.

379
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,588
Do not move.

380
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:07,180
As if this is anything to fuss over.

381
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,692
The cut in your thigh is deep.

382
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,736
You might not be able

383
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,030
to reproduce in the future.

384
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,074
-What?
-What?

385
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:30,954
It is all right.

386
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,914
Who cares?

387
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,209
We are lucky
you were able to return alive.

388
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,419
Wait, I…

389
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,631
I was wrong. Although it was close,

390
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,008
the wound is slightly to the side.

391
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,344
You can still have children someday.

392
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,181
What a relief.

393
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,608
Young Master Jang-hyeon.

394
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,072
Thank you for helping
Young Master Yeon-jun.

395
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,657
How could I ever repay you?

396
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,119
Well, I can't take credit for saving him.

397
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,580
It seems he's fated to live
longer than you'd think.

398
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,916
I know for a fact
that you protected him out there.

399
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,420
He studied books his whole life,

400
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,504
so his swordsmanship…

401
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,011
You must be frustrated
that Gil-chae cannot see that.

402
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,975
The other day, I told you to think about
who she looked to at the banquet.

403
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:39,022
She was looking at Yeon-jun.

404
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,026
Not this again.

405
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:48,573
You think the first person you look to
when you're scared is the person you love?

406
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,659
Lady Eun-ae.

407
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,037
That is preposterous.

408
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,623
How could any fool believe such--

409
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,917
It was you she looked at.

410
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,047
Me? She turned to me?

411
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,131
Yes.

412
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,342
Who else

413
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,177
did you think she turned to?

414
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,597
Young Master Yeon-jun?

415
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,809
Gil-chae may adore Young Master Yeon-jun,

416
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,811
but her love for him is not romantic.

417
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,614
Ask her if you do not believe me.

418
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,170
I may not be a physician,

419
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:47,423
but I say this as someone
who has treated dozens of men.

420
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,760
This is not a wound that will heal easily,

421
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,388
so you should stay and rest
for at least a month.

422
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,308
Do you want me to stay?

423
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,644
That is not what I meant.

424
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,771
I am explaining
the severity of your wound.

425
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,440
So, this minor wound

426
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,527
requires your utmost care and attention?

427
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,696
Is that it?

428
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,031
Oh, dear.

429
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,783
Look, it is bleeding.

430
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,244
It has been bleeding all this time.

431
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,464
This is not how Lady Eun-ae does it.

432
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,675
I know what I am doing.

433
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,679
Everyone thinks Eun-ae
is better than me at everything,

434
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,639
but there are things I can do better.

435
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,811
By the way,

436
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,314
Lady Eun-ae said something odd to me.

437
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,360
During the banquet at Neunggun-ri,

438
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,946
when everyone was shocked

439
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,906
to hear about the barbarians,

440
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,617
is it

441
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:01,080
true that you looked at me…

442
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,461
and not someone else?

443
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,679
You can be quite silly, Young Master.

444
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,976
Is it written in some book
that you look to the person you love

445
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,853
when you are scared?

446
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,481
Do you honestly believe that?

447
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,192
Unbelievable.

448
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,408
Either way…

449
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,288
it was me that you first turned to, then.

450
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,806
Even though you claim
to love someone else,

451
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,433
you turned to me
during that desperate time.

452
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,353
I do not want to disregard your feelings.

453
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,270
What?

454
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,149
So,

455
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,820
let us look at this
from a broader perspective.

456
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,865
There is a thin line
between being strangers and lovers.

457
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,033
But

458
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,701
do you know what exists

459
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:21,786
between those two?

460
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,499
There is a limbo

461
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,835
of hesitation.

462
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,214
If you are not sure how you feel,

463
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,383
how about we spend some time

464
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,261
in a relationship limbo?

465
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,515
When a man and a woman are in limbo,

466
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,810
they do not have to define
the relationship,

467
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:49,647
nor do they have to sever ties right away.

468
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,484
We can slowly get to know each other,

469
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,530
enjoy each other's company
from time to time, and decide

470
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,659
whether or not
to take it to the next step.

471
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,203
Then,

472
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,415
how long would we be in limbo for?

473
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,585
Until one of us
desperately yearns for the other…

474
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,131
or deems the other one undesirable.

475
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,677
You and your antics.

476
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,721
I do not have to see it to know

477
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,764
how many women
you must have stringed along

478
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,600
with this dating logic of yours.

479
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,977
Do not even think
about treating me that way.

480
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,105
But Lady Gil-chae…

481
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,568
It is not what you think.

482
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,075
Lady Gil-chae.

483
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,076
Lady Gil-chae?

484
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,828
Are you asleep?

485
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,457
If you are having trouble sleeping,
we could always talk.

486
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,599
It may be a coincidence…

487
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,728
but I am always with you

488
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,356
when the moonlight is bright.

489
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,697
I will probably think of you from now on
whenever the moon shines brightly.

490
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,805
The others…

491
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,474
Goodness.

492
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,062
Jong-jong, it is you.

493
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:57,400
Are the others walking about just fine?

494
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,693
The others?

495
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,529
Oh, I see.

496
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,616
The handsome Ryang-eum is fine,
so he did not need to come here.

497
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,742
Not Ryang-eum…

498
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,376
That is odd.

499
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,670
What do you mean?

500
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,172
Lady Gil-chae.

501
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,801
She cannot sleep wherever we go
due to the smell and discomfort,

502
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,139
but she sleeps like a baby
when you are around.

503
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,810
She also slept this well
when we ran into you on the mountain.

504
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,770
I wonder why.

505
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,783
Anyway,

506
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:53,122
you do not have to tell Gu-jam
how I am doing.

507
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,361
Who knew that snoring
could sound this dulcet?

508
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,125
Gosh.

509
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,670
Madam Bangdu, you should rest.

510
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,339
Everyone is pitching in,

511
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,758
so how could I rest?
Of course, I should help.

512
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,261
My arms are killing me.

513
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,723
If these herbs can cure
Young Master Yeon-jun,

514
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,601
I do not mind getting blisters
on my hands for days.

515
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,397
Lady Eun-ae,

516
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,024
these are not herbs.

517
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,254
Goodness.

518
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,672
I see you gathered a lot.

519
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:25,756
Let me.

520
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,425
-Thank you.
-Madam Bangdu,

521
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,677
you should not lift heavy things

522
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,804
when your body is still recovering.

523
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:32,888
Shall we?

524
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,061
Mine is heavy too.

525
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,354
Lady Eun-ae.

526
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,106
These are precious herbs.

527
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,316
Is there anything you cannot possibly do?

528
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,123
Shall we?

529
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,013
Lady Eun-ae.

530
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,097
Allow me.

531
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,076
Allow me.

532
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,835
Am I next?

533
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,269
Allow me.

534
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,282
Allow me.

535
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,760
Forget it.

536
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,679
Where are you going?

537
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,267
Don't you know you are the reason
I carried them all across?

538
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,062
Being in a relationship limbo

539
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:49,108
involves the man carrying the woman
across the stream and such.

540
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,860
Does that mean you are

541
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,655
also in a relationship limbo
or whatever with the others?

542
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,739
That is different.

543
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:56,907
How so?

544
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,788
My feelings are not the same.

545
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,518
Those who have recovered
will join the fight.

546
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,770
It is an all-out war.

547
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,773
If you can walk, you will fight.

548
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,157
Jong-jong asked about you.

549
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:26,413
Women cannot help themselves
when it comes to handsome men.

550
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,040
You, not Ryang-eum.

551
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:29,958
Me?

552
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,587
Last night, the people
who were coming to us to seek refuge

553
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,464
died at the hands of our enemy.

554
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,925
Those vicious barbarians

555
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,679
see our people as nothing more
than weeds in a field.

556
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,265
Even the young and the old

557
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,184
were slayed and trampled on.

558
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,812
So, what can we do?

559
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,899
Who will rescue His Majesty
from the fortress,

560
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,985
and who will protect our innocent people?

561
00:44:58,695 --> 00:44:59,696
However,

562
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,532
do not fear.

563
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,955
Lady Gil-chae, where is your ribbon?

564
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,839
Reinforcements have yet to arrive
with provisions and weapons,

565
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,925
but we have

566
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:22,344
one chance to fight them.

567
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,723
Until every remaining soldier falls,

568
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,976
we will fight

569
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,270
down to the last arrow.

570
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,856
It is a suicide mission.

571
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,024
Let us get out of here.

572
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,609
He is saying we will all die.

573
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,611
Then, this is where I will die.

574
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:43,782
As men of Joseon,

575
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,492
we can defeat the barbarians.

576
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,619
You should leave and get to safety.

577
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,289
I appreciate

578
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,748
all you have done for us.

579
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,625
You are not weak.

580
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,669
With our deaths,

581
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,380
we will repay His Majesty's generosity.

582
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,340
Are you ready?

583
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,605
Look here.

584
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,275
You should fight to win,

585
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:21,236
not pledge to die honorably.

586
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,322
If you must risk your lives,

587
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:27,284
should you not risk them
for a battle you can win?

588
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,412
How dare you speak
so insolently before the general?

589
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,622
Is there a way

590
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,708
for our men to win without dying?

591
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,878
Do you know what that smoke is?

592
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:42,799
You have fought the barbarians
for ten years in the north,

593
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,177
so you will probably know.

594
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:55,479
The smoke is caused by the barbarians
burning the bodies of their soldiers.

595
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,773
The barbarians…

596
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,778
are proud of dying in battle,

597
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,989
but they are ashamed
of having their bodies

598
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,033
taken by enemies.

599
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:09,785
That is why

600
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,621
the barbarians will never…

601
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,834
leave the bodies
of their comrades on enemy soil.

602
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:38,564
Just like our ancestors of Manchu

603
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:42,192
Let us shoot our arrows

604
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:46,029
At this moment in this tumultuous time

605
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,491
You pass by

606
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,953
Let us go

607
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,123
Let us leave

608
00:47:56,206 --> 00:48:01,837
To shoot our arrows

609
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,590
What we have obtained in battle

610
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,467
will be shared
among the families of the fallen.

611
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,762
So, do not fear death.

612
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:15,684
Those who die in battle
will share the emperor's glory forever!

613
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,109
Burn them!

614
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,107
Stop him!

615
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,969
Now!

616
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,192
Their commander has fallen!

617
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,820
Charge!

618
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,205
Kim Jun-ryong's unit
has achieved great victory!

619
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:04,626
Yangguri, Nurhaci's son-in-law
and most treasured subject,

620
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,170
was killed by a bullet
fired by a Joseon soldier.

621
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,432
We defeated the barbarians!

622
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:42,164
We have bought some time
with this great victory.

623
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,125
We will rally once reinforcements arrive

624
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,627
-and penetrate the fortress--
-General!

625
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,712
General.

626
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,884
The support troops bringing the provisions
and arrows were attacked by Qing soldiers.

627
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,136
They cannot reach us anymore.

628
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,813
Although we wish to fight,

629
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:11,985
we cannot due
to a lack of provisions and arrows.

630
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:14,070
That is why

631
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,699
I will lead a vanguard to Suwon
on a supply mission.

632
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,162
Those remaining will scatter

633
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,499
to procure more food and arrowheads

634
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:29,419
so that we can rescue His Majesty
from Namhansanseong Fortress.

635
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:39,763
Your Majesty.

636
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,558
What should we do, Your Majesty?

637
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:46,561
Your Majesty.

638
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:49,981
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

639
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,943
Your Majesty.

640
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:56,279
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty…

641
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,616
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty!

642
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,369
Your Majesty!

643
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,788
JANUARY 6TH 1637
KIM JUN-RYONG UNIT DISSOLVES

644
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:13,880
What are you doing?

645
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,131
Let us go.

646
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,016
I am headed to the palace.

647
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,438
I am Pyo Eon-gyeom,
one of the crown prince's eunuchs.

648
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,275
While visiting my mother,
I encountered barbarians.

649
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,111
I will return to the palace
and report to the king.

650
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,154
and the crown prince about Mount Gwanggyo.

651
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,365
Who will come with me?

652
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,160
I will.

653
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,372
Thank you.

654
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,456
Anyone else?

655
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,792
Is there no one else

656
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,586
who will join me?

657
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,714
Let us go.

658
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,095
Are you going to let me die?

659
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,014
What is your problem?

660
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,182
If I am killed by a barbarian,

661
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,811
I will tell the crown prince
it was because you turned your back on me.

662
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,814
You talk like I am the enemy.

663
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,134
I heard you were curious
about how I was doing.

664
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,971
I get how you feel,
but I have high standards.

665
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,057
You're talking nonsense.

666
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:48,934
Jong-jong.

667
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,436
Why were you so curious?

668
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,190
I will leave once the day breaks.

669
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:58,818
I shall accompany
a eunuch serving the crown prince.

670
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,739
Please be understanding.

671
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,700
I cannot

672
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,203
give up on His Majesty.

673
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,496
I understand.

674
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,032
This is new.

675
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,952
It is not like you to bid me farewell.

676
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,248
I see.

677
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,709
You are not getting your turn.

678
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,168
Should I call him for you?

679
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,630
-Young Master Yeon-jun--
-Please stop.

680
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,347
Anyway,

681
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,558
why are you also going?

682
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,395
I thought you were not interested
in saving the king.

683
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,772
I am not.

684
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,315
Then, why are you going?

685
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,028
Do you want to know why?

686
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,507
What did you and Lady Gil-chae talk about?

687
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,176
You were whispering for ages.

688
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:50,055
Whispering?
You are getting cheekier by the day.

689
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:02,734
But Lady Gil-chae,

690
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,569
why do we have to go there?

691
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,155
Just push.

692
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,281
Keep pushing.

693
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,073
It is an ambush!

694
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,599
What are you doing?

695
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,060
By protecting me,
you're protecting the crown prince.

696
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,491
You filthy scum!

697
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,869
-Darn it.
-Move!

698
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,371
Move!

699
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,915
They must all be headed there.

700
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,002
Gil-chae.

701
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,880
Must we go there as well?

702
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:55,388
Yes, we have to go.

703
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,056
We must.

704
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,540
Barbarians have built
a wooden fence at the fortress

705
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,375
and added bells as an extra precaution.

706
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,961
But they are also humans
who make mistakes.

707
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,464
The warrior monks
were able to go in and out.

708
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,842
Will we actually be able
to meet His Majesty?

709
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,553
Normally, an audience
would not be granted.

710
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:38,598
However, even His Majesty
would want to meet the men

711
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,558
who made it to the fortress.

712
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,567
We can move now.

713
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,467
Your Majesty.

714
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,178
I will die a happy man now that I know

715
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,515
-you are in good health--
-Thank you.

716
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,976
I am proud of you.

717
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,563
Even many officials of the royal court

718
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:30,942
fled to safety in fear of dying
at the gates of the fortress,

719
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:34,988
but you risked your lives
to come and protect me.

720
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,615
See this?

721
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,410
As long as scholars like them exist,

722
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:42,620
the nation will prevail.

723
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,373
It will be preserved
for centuries to come.

724
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:47,375
You are absolutely right, Your Majesty.

725
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,877
The nation is greatly blessed.

726
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:52,755
-The nation is blessed.
-The nation is blessed.

727
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:54,799
Right.

728
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,984
Your Majesty,

729
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:16,696
the scholars have brought
the head of a barbarian from afar,

730
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:19,282
which symbolizes
the strong spirit of Joseon.

731
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:22,285
Please do not lose hope,

732
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:24,495
and motivate soldiers
within and beyond these walls--

733
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:25,663
Minister of Rites,

734
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:28,082
do you see the men
from Neunggun-ri as our hope?

735
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:32,170
General Jung Se-gyu's
troop of 15,000 men has scattered,

736
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:34,547
and only seven of them
infiltrated the fortress.

737
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,383
They are proof of the people's disloyalty,

738
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:41,512
and since we are in a crisis,
now is not the time to be noble.

739
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:43,931
Your Majesty.

740
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,892
Our men will not come for you anymore,

741
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:50,021
so it is time you sent someone
to negotiate peace with the enemy.

742
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,148
Will they

743
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,859
even respond to such a request?

744
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,527
Since long ago,

745
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,655
invading the heart of another's nation

746
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,157
has been deemed dishonorable,
even in warfare.

747
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,576
They will also want

748
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,411
to reach an agreement.

749
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:09,832
It is still too soon
to negotiate mutual peace

750
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:13,503
or commit to a full-on war.

751
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,133
Did you confirm

752
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:24,013
if they meant what they said
when we delivered liquor and meat?

753
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,851
He appreciates the gesture

754
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:32,772
but deems this unnecessary

755
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:36,275
since Joseon's animals and grains
are ours anyway.

756
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,114
There is nothing more
for our two nations to discuss.

757
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:43,157
His Imperial Majesty

758
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,326
is on his way.

759
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:04,595
Is the Khan…

760
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,349
truly here?

761
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,810
I cannot believe it, either.

762
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,813
The barbarians are still at war with Ming,

763
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:18,443
so why would the Khan leave the Ming
to travel to the heart of Joseon?

764
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,914
How much longer
can they hold out in that fortress?

765
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:36,627
Ming's Dalinghe Fortress held out
for 82 days while surrounded by our men,

766
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,796
so the same should apply here.

767
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:44,343
Eighty-two days.

768
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,393
The Khan could not possibly be here.

769
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,855
Their men must be bluffing.

770
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,567
However,

771
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,112
if the Khan is actually here…

772
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:15,541
If only there was someone
who knew more about the barbarians.

773
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,378
There is someone

774
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,464
who does.

775
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:28,930
Make repairs while you can since we
don't know when we'll have to fight again.

776
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:30,640
He sure is diligent.

777
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,560
Does it get on your nerves?

778
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,813
That is why the ladies love him.

779
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:39,065
He is every woman's type.

780
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,900
For what reason?

781
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:42,777
Well,

782
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,113
he seems like the type of man
who will only love one woman.

783
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:47,949
Unlike someone I know.

784
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:56,457
That fraud.

785
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,125
-He will hear you.
-Let him.

786
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,836
Did I say anything amiss?

787
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,051
Look at him smile.

788
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,183
Now, he looks even more like a fraud.

789
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,565
You. Come with me.

790
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,242
I am sure the journey here was not easy.

791
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:32,451
It was all right.

792
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:34,787
Thanks to a warrior monk,

793
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,330
we arrived here with no fuss.

794
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:37,415
Is that so?

795
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:40,334
I see monks are not entirely useless.

796
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:43,170
Yes, Highness.

797
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,383
With a war going on,
those bald monks are rather useful.

798
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,886
Before,

799
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:53,306
all they did was make tofu
and paper for noblemen

800
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:55,558
and occasionally get beaten up.

801
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:57,476
They had no other use.

802
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,187
But is it not odd?

803
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,567
Even though the nation looks down on them,

804
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,570
the monks take it upon themselves
to risk their lives in the fields,

805
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:09,864
where the sun shines on their bald heads,

806
01:05:09,947 --> 01:05:11,532
whenever the nation is in crisis.

807
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,368
-Watch it.
-Goodness.

808
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,370
I apologize.

809
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:18,205
I am known for my big mouth.

810
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,502
Risking your life to come here
is surely a commendable act,

811
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:26,881
but I am highly disappointed

812
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,217
that it was only a handful of you.

813
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,094
How can the people of this nation

814
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:34,680
prioritize their own lives
and drag their feet

815
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,265
when the king is in this fortress?

816
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,353
At first,

817
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,897
I heard you were also reluctant.

818
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:48,027
Did you also think that coming here
was a suicide mission?

819
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:50,029
No, Your Royal Highness.

820
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:51,113
Then,

821
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:57,286
did you think of us as pathetic fools
who let the barbarians overpower us?

822
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,496
No, Your Highness.

823
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:01,207
His Majesty

824
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,459
was shrewd enough to flee to safety

825
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,294
before the people had a chance.

826
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:08,589
So, I believed he did not need assistance
from someone like me--

827
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,135
Your Royal Highness!

828
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,682
His Majesty is not a commoner.

829
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,643
He does not hang onto his life

830
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:23,437
for the sake of his own survival.

831
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:26,941
It is because he is Joseon itself.

832
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:30,152
And preserving his life
is essential to preserving the nation.

833
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:32,863
But you…

834
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:35,992
Are you such a lowlife
that you do not know that?

835
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,411
Are you that ignorant?

836
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,454
This is the man you chose
to bring before me?

837
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,956
Your Royal Highness!

838
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,124
Show me no mercy.

839
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,543
Kick him out of here.

840
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,003
Remove him…

841
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:49,296
Remove him away from my sight!

842
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:59,348
How dare you speak so disrespectfully?

843
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:01,350
I never asked to be summoned.

844
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,727
It is because I saw you.

845
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:06,772
Your clever tactic
led us to victory against Yangguri.

846
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,651
Still,

847
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,989
the unit scattered
due to a lack of reinforcements.

848
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:16,824
It was all for nothing.

849
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:20,161
No. Thanks to you, we bought time,

850
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:23,330
and our people hiding nearby
were able to flee to safety.

851
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:27,293
You and the men who fought
saved hundreds of lives.

852
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:32,256
I am aware you are indifferent
about protecting the royal family,

853
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:34,675
which is why you spoke
so disrespectfully to His Highness.

854
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:38,095
However, you pity the people.

855
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:39,972
Am I wrong?

856
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,105
Rumor has it that the Khan is here.

857
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:50,941
We are not certain, though.

858
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:53,569
An envoy was sent to find out,

859
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,781
but he was told the Khan
was patrolling the camp.

860
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:58,282
It is obviously a bluff.

861
01:07:58,365 --> 01:07:59,366
However,

862
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:02,369
if the Khan is truly here,

863
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:05,915
do the people of Joseon stand a chance?

864
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,967
Where were you?

865
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:21,847
Why are you hurt?

866
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,443
Apparently, the Khan is here.

867
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:36,946
What?

868
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:40,157
That cannot be.

869
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:43,702
It is only a rumor.

870
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:46,872
-However--
-If the Khan is in Joseon,

871
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:50,209
his goal might be
to burn it to the ground.

872
01:08:52,878 --> 01:08:55,422
Let us leave this fortress
and depart from Joseon.

873
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:59,009
Our only objective was
to help Young Master Yeon-jun get here.

874
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,434
Lady Eun-ae said something odd to me.

875
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:10,062
Is it

876
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:14,775
true that you looked at me…

877
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:20,030
and not someone else?

878
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:30,332
Either way…

879
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:35,087
it was me that you first turned to, then.

880
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:47,391
Damn it.

881
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:52,980
I shall head to the barbarians' camp.

882
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,357
What?

883
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:58,027
I will find out
if the Khan is really here,

884
01:09:58,110 --> 01:09:59,862
and if he is, why,
despite the risk of death,

885
01:09:59,945 --> 01:10:02,573
he would turn his back
on the Ming to come here.

886
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,284
I will get answers.

887
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:07,411
Is that not what you wanted?

888
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:11,498
If you do that,
His Royal Highness will be pleased--

889
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,751
This is not to please the crown prince.

890
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:18,005
Two things in this world
do more damage when prolonged.

891
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:21,217
The time you spend in an outhouse

892
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,718
and war.

893
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:27,223
If I return with actionable intel,

894
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,769
I am hoping you will use that
to swiftly end the war.

895
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:33,229
Of course.

896
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:34,939
Just tell me what you need.

897
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,398
I do not need anything

898
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,193
except for Ryang-eum.

899
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,289
Every armed barbarian warrior

900
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:56,168
has one or two aides who serve them.

901
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,712
If the aides get injured or die,

902
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,631
they are abandoned on enemy soil.

903
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:04,760
Ryang-eum and I will
disguise ourselves as abandoned aides.

904
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:30,494
Anyway,

905
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:33,205
why are you also going?

906
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,583
I thought you were not interested
in saving the king.

907
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,004
Do you want to know why?

908
01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:42,423
You see…

909
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:47,428
I hate seeing you cry.

910
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:51,098
You are leaving
because you do not want to see me?

911
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,600
I said I hated seeing you cry.

912
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:55,102
How is that different?

913
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:58,731
Why are you assuming
you will see me cry, anyway?

914
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,154
Let us just say I know.

915
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,034
By the way,

916
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:11,785
I have a request.

917
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,205
Since Mongolian soldiers
are swarming the place,

918
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:16,540
head to Ganghwa Island.

919
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,879
The barbarians are formidable on land
but not on water.

920
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:26,342
That is why His Majesty stored
enough artillery and provisions there

921
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,552
and sent the crown prince's son there.

922
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:31,430
Joseon may end up
in the barbarians' hands,

923
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:34,266
but Ganghwa Island will be safe from them.

924
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:40,189
I see now that a relationship limbo

925
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,027
is just an excuse to be unreliable.

926
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:51,533
Do not burden yourself with my business.

927
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,912
It is not like you care.

928
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,665
You know about the trouble we must endure,

929
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,877
but you're heading off yet again.

930
01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:10,427
How about this, then?

931
01:13:12,846 --> 01:13:15,307
I vow this by the moonlight.

932
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,686
Go to Ganghwa Island,

933
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:24,024
and wherever you go…

934
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,946
I will surely…

935
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:32,908
come find you.

936
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,205
A secret letter
from Jang-hyeon has arrived!

937
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,458
Something urgent has
happened to the enemy.

938
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,168
You were heading to the boat, right?

939
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:27,880
-Let us get on that boat.
-Lady Gil-chae, I do not want to die.

940
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,339
You head to the boat first.

941
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,967
What about those on the boat?

942
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,260
Send a boat to Ganghwa Island.

943
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,888
Stay back. This boat is not for you!

944
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,265
I must confirm it with my own eyes.

945
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:39,266
Everyone, take cover!

946
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:41,518
The barbarians are coming!

947
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:43,979
They have come
to fight a battle they will not lose.

948
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:45,564
One they cannot afford to lose.

949
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,900
Please.

950
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:48,984
From now on,

951
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:50,861
no one gets past this point.

952
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:06,752
