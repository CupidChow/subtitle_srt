1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,252
So, my lady…

2
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,089
will you marry me?

3
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,436
I will pretend I did not hear it,

4
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,812
so do not be embarrassed.

5
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,696
Is that person not already dead?

6
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,620
Since he is dead, give me--

7
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:19,829
Do you like me?

8
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,623
Since when?

9
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,584
Since I first saw you.

10
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,712
If you do not take all of us,
you cannot take the baby either.

11
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,799
Your will to live was incredible.

12
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,552
Our paths are tough, are they not?

13
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,680
But, Officer,

14
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,391
you and I

15
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,103
are not meant to be together.

16
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,250
Gil-chae.

17
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,793
Yeong-chae.

18
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,962
What is going on?

19
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,172
The master has disappeared.

20
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,509
Gil-chae.

21
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,970
Gil-chae.

22
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,891
Gil-chae.

23
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,518
Excuse me.

24
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,355
Have you seen my Gil-chae?

25
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,232
-Father!
-Master!

26
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,400
My goodness.

27
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,526
-Father.
-Father.

28
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,820
-Father!
-Sir!

29
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,238
Sir!

30
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,782
-Father.
-Father.

31
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,951
Father.

32
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,123
Have you seen my Gil-chae?

33
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,626
The barbarians have taken my Gil-chae.

34
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,838
This old man is crazy.

35
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,675
Barbarians…

36
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,554
It's a barbarian!

37
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,602
You took my Gil-chae away.

38
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,438
You old man. Have you lost your mind?

39
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,399
Let go, you crazy old man!

40
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,525
Darn you!

41
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,279
Sir!

42
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,715
The barbarians will take you

43
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,636
and crush Je-nam's skull in.

44
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,346
Let us go quickly.

45
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,932
We have to go to Neunggun-ri.

46
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,558
-Father.
-We have to go…

47
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,644
-Father.
-We have to go to Neunggun-ri.

48
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,437
We have to go to Neunggun-ri.

49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,442
Master, this sword has slain
100 barbarians.

50
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:59,405
So if they invade again,
I will cut them down with this sword.

51
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,158
Has this sword killed

52
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,662
that many barbarians?

53
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,331
Of course.

54
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:13,002
Both Lady Gil-chae and Je-nam are safe.

55
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,295
All right.

56
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,880
That is a relief.

57
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,843
It is a relief that you are here.

58
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,679
Please do not worry

59
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,514
and get some sleep.

60
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,516
Here.

61
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,534
Thank you.

62
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,411
Thank you for letting me help.

63
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,372
My lady,

64
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,582
I can keep helping you.

65
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,918
No, please let me help you.

66
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,796
If you are suggesting marriage again,

67
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,008
I have nothing more to say.

68
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:05,138
What exactly does that man have
that I do not?

69
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,766
What does

70
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,602
Young Master Yeon-jun have

71
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,564
that I do not?

72
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:27,869
Nothing happened

73
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,455
to your father overnight, right?

74
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,167
How is your injury?

75
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,502
I made some ointment for you.

76
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,631
It is merely a scratch,
but you made ointment for me?

77
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,843
You made it yourself?

78
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:44,969
I am okay.

79
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,097
My goodness. My lady, stay back.

80
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,640
My gosh.

81
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:03,946
That is hot.

82
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,242
I brought some clothes…

83
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,206
Thank you.

84
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,549
Let me.

85
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,449
Did you get this scar

86
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,328
when you were saving us on the island?

87
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:53,996
What?

88
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,915
Well…

89
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,044
Then, why did you say
it was not you who saved us?

90
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:02,338
Well, the thing is…

91
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,008
I was embarrassed.

92
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,353
It is done.

93
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,614
My lady.

94
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:37,165
It always broke my heart
to see you do such tough work.

95
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,250
If you marry me,

96
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,295
I will make sure you never have
to do such work…

97
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:55,933
When I smile,
men think that I will be a gentle wife,

98
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,146
and when I am kind, they think
I will be a good daughter-in-law.

99
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,316
Even if I appear devious,

100
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,861
they think I will change
once I am a wife or daughter-in-law.

101
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,531
But I will not change.

102
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:19,081
There are many men who like my smile
but not many who like my bad side.

103
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,084
But, sir,

104
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:28,257
I cannot keep some parts of me
while abandoning others.

105
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,843
So you should abandon

106
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,596
your feelings for me as well.

107
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,602
Then come to me without abandoning
your feelings for that man.

108
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,147
He is already dead,

109
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,191
so it does not matter to me.

110
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,795
Look!

111
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,172
It's Ryang-eum. It really is him.

112
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,508
-You are here.
-Yes. Hello.

113
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,593
I heard you went to Shenyang.

114
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,262
Why are you here so suddenly?

115
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,305
Excuse me.

116
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,725
Are you the famous Ryang-eum?

117
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,687
I am the singer, Ryang-eum.

118
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,273
I am Gu Won-mu
of the military training office.

119
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,819
I am getting married soon.

120
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,697
Would you be able
to come and sing at my wedding?

121
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,867
My wife-to-be says
she cannot forget your singing

122
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,412
from long ago,
so I ask you for this favor.

123
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,665
She has heard me sing before?

124
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,252
It has been a while
since I left Usimjeong, so where…

125
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,380
She said she heard it
when she lived in Neunggun-ri.

126
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,881
Neunggun-ri?

127
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,264
You have something on your lips.

128
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,475
Wait. I will wipe it for you.

129
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:06,981
There.

130
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,818
You are messier than you look.

131
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,029
Eat up.

132
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,122
What is the matter?

133
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,087
Wait, Ryang-eum.

134
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,174
Ryang-eum, wait.

135
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:40,848
It is you, right?

136
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,976
You are Lady Gil-chae, are you not?

137
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,312
I heard you went to Shenyang.

138
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,648
I am stopping by Joseon.

139
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,613
So…

140
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,076
How did Young Master Jang-hyeon…

141
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:05,081
How did he end up like that?

142
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,919
What kind of grave sin did he commit to…

143
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,215
He didn't…

144
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,138
die in a lot of pain,

145
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,266
did he?

146
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,212
Lady Gil-chae,

147
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,465
Lee Jang-hyeon has arrived.

148
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,812
The crown prince
will arrive in Joseon soon.

149
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,906
They would not dare
return the crown prince

150
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,242
and request I come instead, would they?

151
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,952
Your Majesty.

152
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:34,295
Wherever you go, please take me with you.

153
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,088
All right.

154
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,382
No.

155
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,719
The crown prince will
just visit me and go back.

156
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,763
But it is odd.

157
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,727
Initially, they mistreated him
and broke my heart.

158
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,938
So, why are they treating him so well now?

159
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,110
When the crown prince left Shenyang,

160
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,155
Yonggoldae offered him
a red coat with embroidered dragons.

161
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,364
But that is…

162
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,658
Is that not

163
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:09,622
a coat that only a king can wear?

164
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,422
Do you know

165
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,510
what Gwanghae feared the most?

166
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,346
It was treason.

167
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,348
However,

168
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,477
despite fearing treason so,

169
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:37,191
when there were rumors that I,
Neungyanggun, would start a revolt,

170
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,567
he did not believe them.

171
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,444
However,

172
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,321
those who were smart

173
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:46,367
started treating me differently,
as if I were already king.

174
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:50,996
These days, my subjects

175
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,667
treat the crown prince like that.

176
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,727
Your Majesty,
the crown prince has arrived.

177
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,817
KANG SEOK-GI:
FATHER OF THE CROWN PRINCESS

178
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,446
When the crown prince visits,

179
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,409
will His Majesty treat him badly?

180
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:36,876
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

181
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,588
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

182
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,633
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

183
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,928
-Your Highness.
-Your Highness.

184
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,109
Your Majesty.

185
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,613
I offer my greetings.

186
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,450
Come in.

187
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,975
Father.

188
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,853
The heavens have not abandoned me

189
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,315
but blessed me with the chance
to see Your Majesty again.

190
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,193
Raise your head.

191
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,158
Why do you

192
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,577
look unwell?

193
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,245
I am fine.

194
00:15:56,205 --> 00:16:00,876
I was more worried
when I heard that you were unwell.

195
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,461
That is right.

196
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,423
I have not slept well

197
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,802
since I sent you so far away,
and it has made me ill.

198
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,096
However,

199
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,473
now that I have seen you again,

200
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,226
I think I will get better.

201
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,109
Crown Prince.

202
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,113
My son.

203
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,250
These are for the king,
so do not leave anything out.

204
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,090
Why not take some old clothes
for the crown prince to wear?

205
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,300
What do you mean?

206
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,344
We should bring his best.

207
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,680
His Majesty

208
00:16:56,056 --> 00:17:01,061
has exiled the envoy that requested
the crown prince's visit to Joseon.

209
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,649
He was angry the crown prince's son
would suffer on the path to Shenyang.

210
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,527
He should know
how the crown prince has suffered.

211
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,837
This is a great blessing from the skies.

212
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,340
-This is a great blessing.
-This is a great blessing.

213
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,802
-This is a great blessing.
-This is a great blessing.

214
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,180
-This is a great blessing.
-This is a great blessing.

215
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,278
What a load off my mind.

216
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:56,075
The barbarians can try, but they could
never separate a father and his son.

217
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,285
I guess so.

218
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:03,624
I thought His Highness would never
be able to step foot in Joseon again.

219
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:07,044
Do you think you are always right?

220
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,713
It would be nice to be wrong.

221
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,717
By the way,

222
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,428
I do not see Compiler Nam.

223
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,515
Are these all for me?

224
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,225
Probably.

225
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,606
These?

226
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,401
No. Wait, not these. These first?

227
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,373
For goodness' sake.

228
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,875
Stay still.

229
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,436
My lady.

230
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:51,190
Come to me in these shoes.

231
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,817
What do you take me for?

232
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,569
I may like floral shoes, but…

233
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,447
Let us stop this.

234
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,741
It is about time you stop

235
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,784
playing hard to get.

236
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,830
Now that Young Master Yeon-jun is married,

237
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,167
you must know who will
stay by your side until the end.

238
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,793
You must know

239
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,296
who will make you happy.

240
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,174
If you asked Young Master Yeon-jun

241
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,843
to buy you floral shoes,

242
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,679
he would tell you not to be greedy.

243
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,141
If you asked for silk clothes,

244
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,771
he would tell you to think first
about the people's suffering.

245
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,024
But, my lady,

246
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,319
I am different.

247
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,614
If you ask,

248
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:47,204
I, Lee Jang-hyeon, will bring you
the world's most beautiful floral shoes,

249
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,123
and if you want silks,

250
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:54,169
I will bring you silk clothes
more precious than the queen's.

251
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,964
Really?

252
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,799
Of course!

253
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:03,595
So it is time for you
to declare that the man for you,

254
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,807
the one who can get you
everything you desire,

255
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,809
is me, Lee Jang-hyeon.

256
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,480
Declare it.

257
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,359
Come on.

258
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,902
Say it.

259
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,822
Say it.

260
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,118
I am telling you to declare…

261
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:32,833
Come on. Are you too shy to say it?

262
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,418
-What are you doing?
-What?

263
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,962
Why are you talking to yourself?

264
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,840
No, I was just…

265
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,010
Can you not announce your presence?

266
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,428
But I did.

267
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,721
Sit down.

268
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,556
My gosh.

269
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,809
So, did you look into it?

270
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,145
Yes, I did, and it seems

271
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,606
Compiler Nam's family has gone bankrupt.

272
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,691
What?

273
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,777
Now when I show up…

274
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,866
she will want to run into my arms.

275
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,791
Laugh.

276
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,877
-Buy a wedding box!
-What is it?

277
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,671
Buy a box!

278
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,423
Someone must be getting married.

279
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,008
Buy a box!

280
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,509
What did I say?

281
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,304
People find a way to get married
even in times of chaos.

282
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,056
I guess so.

283
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:35,353
Only we are constantly slaving away
until our crotches rot.

284
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,647
Buy a box!

285
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,902
-Anyone want to buy a box?
-Goodness.

286
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:47,866
Have one last drink,
then let us quickly retire.

287
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:48,950
Shall we?

288
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,953
Is that not Madam Bangdu?

289
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,122
I cannot go in yet.

290
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,751
Head inside already.

291
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,587
-I cannot take the box inside.
-Why not?

292
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,507
Maybe I could if I saw the bride's face.

293
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,008
The bride is here.

294
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,069
A bride should not be out and about!

295
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,574
The bride is here, so go home now.

296
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,661
Jong-jong!

297
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,930
You must be tired from the long journey.

298
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,287
-Young lady.
-You saw him too, right?

299
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,456
It was

300
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,625
definitely him.

301
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,794
Yes.

302
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,131
He's alive?

303
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,842
He's alive.

304
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,305
The gifts are here. You cannot leave.

305
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,351
You cannot leave, young lady.

306
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,069
Young lady.

307
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,513
Is anyone there?

308
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,641
Is anyone inside?

309
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:14,197
It really is you, Young Master.

310
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,160
You really are alive.

311
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,662
Can you not live…

312
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,500
one day without a man?

313
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,511
I asked you a question.

314
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,389
Can you not live…

315
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,061
one day without a man?

316
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,941
Is that why you couldn't wait
and why you're getting married?

317
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,029
Yes.

318
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,740
You see right through me.

319
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,035
I cannot go one day

320
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,997
without a man.

321
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,373
Without a man,

322
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,544
my body and heart get unbearably lonely.

323
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,171
Why?

324
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,423
Is that wrong?

325
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:21,014
If you like men so much,
I should have also had a chance.

326
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,851
If you just needed a man,

327
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,979
regardless of who it was,

328
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,232
you should have come to me at least once.

329
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:42,452
I can go to any man except you.

330
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,790
I cannot share anything with someone

331
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,460
who does not mean anything he says.

332
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,117
We will be married in a few days.

333
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:31,209
So I want to keep a record
of your face before the wedding.

334
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,671
Can I call a painter
to paint your portrait?

335
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,258
But why do you look unwell?

336
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:43,346
I must be tired from hosting guests.

337
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,307
It is nice to see you smile.

338
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,770
When you smile,
it feels like the whole world is smiling.

339
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,362
You should go inside.

340
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,330
Go inside first.

341
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,875
Go on inside.

342
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,501
I shall head off.

343
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,531
Is it him?

344
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,744
Are you marrying him?

345
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,124
He seems kind.

346
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,918
He is a good man.

347
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,087
He saved my life as well.

348
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,853
You saved us.

349
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,939
My lady.

350
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,109
Is that why…

351
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,114
you are marrying him?

352
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,159
Because he saved you?

353
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,412
My lady.

354
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,290
I am only telling you this now…

355
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,422
but the one who saved you that day…

356
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,263
was me, not him.

357
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,980
You said you had not been
to the island when I asked before.

358
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,482
Now you tell me

359
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,818
it was you

360
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,696
who saved me?

361
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,907
I only denied it before

362
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,037
because you went
to Ganghwa Island trusting my words.

363
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,917
And you nearly died as a result.

364
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,504
I felt awful and embarrassed.

365
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,433
Do you use such shallow tricks
with other women too?

366
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,187
I was naive and believed you.

367
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,609
I trusted you meant it

368
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,237
when you asked me not to forget you.

369
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,447
But…

370
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,451
why did you forget me?

371
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,206
Were Shenyang women more entertaining
than Joseon women?

372
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,917
Were you so busy…

373
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:05,214
making moves on those women
that you forgot about me?

374
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,384
I have never forgotten you.

375
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,388
Not even once.

376
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,973
You should have told me.

377
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,226
You should have told me
you had forgotten me.

378
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,355
You should have told me

379
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:25,068
not to wait for you,
miss you, or yearn for you.

380
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,574
I knew nothing. I thought you were dead.

381
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,080
You thought…

382
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,208
I died?

383
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,292
Yes.

384
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,836
I thought you died.

385
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,506
I thought

386
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,134
that I would never get to see you again.

387
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,277
Tell him.

388
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:14,200
You have no idea
how much my lady cried then.

389
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,160
She held onto your fur vest

390
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,664
and cried out your name again and again.

391
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,001
She begged for you

392
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,878
to return.

393
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,091
I had never seen her grieve before.

394
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,180
Besides, it was not just anyone
but Ryang-eum

395
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,850
who said you had died.

396
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,102
How could she doubt him?

397
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,368
He did not…

398
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,789
die in a lot of pain,

399
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,959
did he?

400
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,303
Fortunately, no.

401
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,974
Good.

402
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,021
Did he

403
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,567
not leave a message for me?

404
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,404
No.

405
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,700
Truthfully, I am not sure

406
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:42,705
if another woman attended
to Young Master Jang-hyeon in Shenyang.

407
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,350
When I saw Young Lady Gil-chae…

408
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:08,064
she was already betrothed to another man.

409
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,944
I should have told her then
that you were alive.

410
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,698
But I did not want to.

411
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:22,995
That woman…

412
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,749
makes me uneasy.

413
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,044
Just date another woman.

414
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,713
What?

415
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,299
You almost died…

416
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,679
because of her.

417
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,515
She will hurt you

418
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,144
and make you miserable.

419
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,813
Look at what is happening now.

420
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,691
She is already marrying another…

421
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:58,906
You…

422
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:03,911
Who do you think you are?

423
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,873
I have no regrets.

424
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,128
If I went back…

425
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,340
I would do it again.

426
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,311
Stop, Jang-hyeon. Please stop.

427
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,611
I was wrong.

428
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,071
I just thought…

429
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,535
that if she was by your side,
you would be miserable.

430
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,207
That is why I did that.

431
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,586
Miserable?

432
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,133
You have no idea what she means to me.

433
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,825
I had business in Shenyang.

434
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,374
I wanted to return early, but I could not.

435
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:34,961
Business?

436
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,632
I am always an afterthought to you.

437
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,886
You say you want my whole heart,

438
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,431
but you always prioritize
other things before me.

439
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,602
I should have known

440
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,939
waiting for you was a mistake.

441
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,401
You left without promising
to return, after all.

442
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,987
What about you?

443
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,866
Are you without fault?

444
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,744
I told you

445
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:13,165
that if you just said you would forget
Young Master Yeon-jun…

446
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,045
I would not leave,

447
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,549
and I would stay by your side.

448
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,011
But…

449
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,225
you were so cold to me.

450
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,354
Now you are marrying another man.

451
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,901
That seems to be our fate.

452
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,739
We are out of step.

453
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,408
It is already too late.

454
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,246
The wedding box is here,
so the marriage is all but confirmed.

455
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,087
I do not care anymore.

456
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:06,594
I do not care whether you love
Compiler Nam or have a fiancé or even…

457
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,183
what you think.

458
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,104
I must…

459
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,156
make you mine.

460
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,757
This is the Lee Jang-hyeon I know.

461
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,302
Someone who does whatever he wants…

462
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,931
whenever he wants.

463
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,113
My lady.

464
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,535
Please give me one chance.

465
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,789
I will never

466
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,334
leave you again.

467
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,548
I will never…

468
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:32,012
make you wait again.

469
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,850
So…

470
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,105
please give me one chance.

471
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,330
I will get a boat ready.

472
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,085
Leave with me.

473
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,257
Young Master Jang-hyeon is alive?

474
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,219
He wants me to leave with him.

475
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,222
He is ambitious.

476
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,227
He even lied about how
he saved us at Ganghwa Island.

477
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,023
But it is too late.

478
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,487
He has already left me countless times.

479
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,739
Why should I believe him now?

480
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,116
I will not go.

481
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,285
I will never go.

482
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,085
USIMJEONG

483
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,636
You are alive.

484
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,811
We all thought you were dead.

485
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,565
It is a relief to see that you are alive.

486
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,692
Why are you here?

487
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,152
Did you ask Lady Gil-chae

488
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,321
to leave with you?

489
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,325
The Lee Jang-hyeon
I know is like the wind.

490
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,828
You may dwell by her side now,

491
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,248
but if you take off again on a whim,

492
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,333
what will she do?

493
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,378
What?

494
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,713
You know nothing about her.

495
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,882
Lady Gil-chae

496
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,010
is more responsible than most.

497
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,681
She cannot leave everything behind
to be with the one she loves

498
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,267
and live happily.

499
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,313
If you upset her family
by swaying her heart,

500
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,359
you will only make her miserable.

501
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,242
Young Master Yeon-jun.

502
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,996
Are you scared
of Lady Gil-chae becoming mine?

503
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,292
-What does…
-You knew, did you not?

504
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,588
You knew that she loved you.

505
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:17,011
You ignored her and married Lady Eun-ae.

506
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,054
Why?

507
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:24,518
Because you could not handle
a woman like Lady Gil-chae.

508
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,522
But do you not still hope
that a small piece of her heart

509
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,610
still holds you dear?

510
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,823
That is why
you linger by her shamelessly--

511
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,087
You know how to use your fists?

512
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,090
How dare you appear
from nowhere after all this time

513
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,801
and try to separate her from her family?

514
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:00,888
I am now…

515
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,438
paying dearly for that.

516
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,529
There was a time…

517
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:23,243
when I wanted to wait
until she had erased you

518
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,289
completely from her heart

519
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,500
before making her mine.

520
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,629
But I cannot wait anymore.

521
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,465
Even if I only get half

522
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,219
or even a quarter of her love…

523
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,352
I will keep her by my side.

524
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:00,072
-Come on.
-Hurry.

525
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,532
Have a drink, my lady.

526
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,743
No, thank you.

527
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,017
Let me ask one thing.

528
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,481
What are you doing?

529
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,278
Can you live regarding me as a stranger?

530
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,176
If you can be happy with someone else…

531
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,847
I will leave.

532
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,058
If you want…

533
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,396
another man and not me…

534
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,236
I will abandon all my feelings.

535
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,615
However…

536
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,788
if that is not the case…

537
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,462
leave with me.

538
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,234
If you do not take this hand,

539
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,403
I will leave you…

540
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,785
and never see you again.

541
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,696
You have not changed.

542
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,783
Did you think I would get scared

543
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,619
at the thought of never seeing you again?

544
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,206
You are always like this.

545
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,876
You taunt me with your wicked tongue,

546
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:04,673
make me anxious, make me wait
and make me worry.

547
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,218
Have you once thought about

548
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,721
how that could make me feel?

549
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:11,888
No.

550
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:15,517
You were the one who made me wait.
I know you.

551
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,396
You get bored of everything
you get your hands on.

552
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,150
Do you know why you cared
for Young Master Yeon-jun for so long?

553
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,696
It was because he was out of your reach.

554
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,072
Is that not so?

555
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,702
I thought you would

556
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,498
get bored of me
if I was caught too quickly.

557
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,669
So I decided

558
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,132
that I would become a man
you could not catch.

559
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,886
Is that why you left me while we fled?

560
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,390
Is that why you threw me aside
after kissing me?

561
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,309
I did not abandon you.

562
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,270
I did not push you away.

563
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,438
I…

564
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,484
I was here.

565
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,238
I never left. I was always here.

566
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,534
I waited for you and missed you every day.

567
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,583
Did you…

568
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,128
really

569
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:27,964
miss me?

570
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,300
Did you wait for me?

571
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:31,927
No.

572
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,680
Not anymore.

573
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,642
I will not wait for you

574
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,852
or miss you anymore.

575
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,563
I will hate you forever.

576
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,358
I will hate you until I die.

577
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,654
I hope you cry and wait for me
until you wilt too.

578
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,132
Leave.

579
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,221
Leave, and do not look back.

580
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:21,101
That is what you do best.

581
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,736
I will not be fooled again.

582
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,113
Not again.

583
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,075
My lady.

584
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:42,456
I will take your punishment
and die by your hand.

585
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,710
So…

586
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,924
So please leave with me.

587
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,529
Officer.

588
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,578
Everyone is looking for you.

589
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,580
Right.

590
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,452
The barbarians…

591
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,705
-The barbarians…
-Gil-chae!

592
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,293
-Is she still missing?
-Yes.

593
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,671
Something must have happened.

594
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,799
Many women have been kidnapped lately.

595
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,512
Search again around the house.

596
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:21,596
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

597
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,143
They took Gil-chae.

598
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,563
The barbarians took Gil-chae.

599
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,169
Check inside.

600
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,359
-Gu-jam.
-Jong-jong.

601
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,403
I cannot talk for long.

602
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:21,489
I am going to the Samgang docks.
Your lady is going there too.

603
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:23,950
So you might as well

604
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,494
come with us too.

605
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,580
How could I?

606
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:31,416
What do you mean? You can just come.

607
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,668
Come with us. I will go now.

608
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,386
You promised to come with us. Okay?

609
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:58,693
Excuse me.

610
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,572
Hello.

611
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,409
Do you have a room?

612
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,827
We have a shared room.

613
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,706
SHARED ROOM: THE BIGGEST ROOM IN
A TAVERN FOR MULTIPLE TRAVELERS

614
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,046
We cannot share a room with others.

615
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:27,097
Then we will give you our room.

616
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,682
This way, please.

617
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,376
Come in.

618
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,010
Sit here.

619
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,368
Excuse me.

620
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:36,041
You look like a noble lady,
but you are not wearing a head cape.

621
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,125
Are you perhaps

622
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,171
secretly running away in the night…

623
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,672
Running away?

624
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,550
-He is my husband.
-Right?

625
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:47,302
Of course.

626
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,638
Of course. Get some rest.

627
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:06,905
Why are you smiling?

628
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,284
It's nothing.

629
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,369
I said, why are you smiling?

630
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,753
Sorry. I could not help it.

631
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,683
This is uncomfortable, right?

632
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:38,812
Try to get a little shut-eye.

633
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:43,358
Gu-jam is waiting for us at the dock.

634
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,442
When the sun…

635
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,120
Good night.

636
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,151
Are you going to become my husband?

637
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,446
Who knows? Let's see.

638
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,116
You are mine now. I can do what I want.

639
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,660
What?

640
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:28,671
Husband is nothing.

641
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,468
I will become your servant.

642
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,597
My body is yours,

643
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,807
my feelings are yours…

644
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,270
and my heart…

645
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,107
is also yours.

646
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,577
Gil-chae.

647
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,545
Lady Gil-chae.

648
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:28,022
-Have you still not found her?
-We apologize.

649
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:36,030
But something strange happened
the day the wedding box was delivered.

650
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,158
Something strange?

651
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,663
The bride seemed shocked
to see a certain man.

652
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,456
What?

653
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,920
-You saw it too, right?
-Sorry?

654
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,299
Did the bride not freeze
when she saw a certain man?

655
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:58,094
I know nothing about this.

656
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,596
Say what you know.

657
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,015
I truly do not know.

658
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,766
I only heard he returned alive--

659
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,059
Bak-dae!

660
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,646
What nonsense are you saying?

661
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:18,239
How did you know?

662
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,618
Jong-jong heard from Gu-jam.

663
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,246
I doubted it, but it is a relief.

664
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,126
Officer Gu has men out looking for you.

665
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:34,047
So you cannot go to the Samgang docks.

666
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:41,679
You can…

667
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,683
curse me out.

668
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,852
How could I do that?

669
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,739
Do not worry.

670
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,908
I will handle everything.

671
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:11,084
Did that man we thought was dead
really return alive?

672
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:12,960
Do you really think

673
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:16,381
Lady Gil-chae would have followed him?

674
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:17,757
You know

675
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,468
that it is not a crime

676
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:24,055
for a husband to kill
an adulterous wife and her lover.

677
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:35,775
The wedding box was sent,
so Lady Gil-chae is already my wife.

678
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,904
If she truly did follow him,

679
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:45,493
I will kill that man, and as for the lady…

680
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:46,661
Officer Gu.

681
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:49,914
Let go.

682
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:21,529
You are being rash. What if
Young Master Jang-hyeon takes off again?

683
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:25,324
I brought some clothes that you like.

684
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,202
You did not even have time
to grab a head cape.

685
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,704
When I settle down,

686
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:32,165
I will come get you.

687
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,459
Right now…

688
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:35,626
It is all right.

689
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:40,131
If I follow you, the rumors
about you will only get worse.

690
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,974
You have to come get me.

691
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:54,520
I will wait for you without marrying.

692
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,614
Jong-jong.

693
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:08,034
Lady Gil-chae.

694
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:15,374
I promise to come for you.

695
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,510
You should go back now.

696
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:28,971
Yes.

697
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:35,269
I am sorry, Lady Eun-ae.

698
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,940
I know best how much Gil-chae

699
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,359
missed you.

700
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:46,322
So today is a good day.

701
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:49,617
Please…

702
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,412
make our Gil-chae happy.

703
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,341
Wife.

704
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,803
Husband.

705
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,223
Then…

706
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:15,685
Yes.

707
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,355
Gil-chae and Young Master Jang-hyeon…

708
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:24,777
So, it ended up

709
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,280
like this?

710
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,538
This is good.

711
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,958
This is what Lady Gil-chae wanted.

712
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,847
They took Gil-chae.

713
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,892
The barbarians took Gil-chae.

714
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,894
-Sir.
-Master.

715
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:00,104
They took Gil-chae.

716
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:02,815
The barbarians took Gil-chae.

717
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,692
-They took Gil-chae.
-Sir.

718
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:06,611
I will take care of Father.

719
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:07,945
Gil-chae…

720
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:11,782
The barbarians took Gil-chae.

721
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,993
Gil-chae.

722
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:16,454
Gil-chae.

723
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:19,081
They took my Gil-chae.

724
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,542
-Gil-chae…
-Lady Gil-chae might

725
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,587
come to see you, Father.

726
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,505
They took Gil-chae.

727
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:30,259
The barbarians took Gil-chae.

728
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:32,553
Gil-chae.

729
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:38,392
Gil-chae.

730
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:41,062
Gil-chae.

731
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,148
Seeing as we cannot go
to the Samgang docks,

732
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:46,817
I will go to Jinmot Road
and get a boat and boatman.

733
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:50,738
I will go with you.

734
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,366
It is cold outside.

735
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:54,533
Stay here.

736
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,285
Look.

737
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:59,330
I have already received the wedding box.

738
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:02,625
What if, later on,

739
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:06,295
people point fingers at me
and call me a used woman?

740
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,505
Are you afraid?

741
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,632
Not really.

742
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,592
I can ignore it.

743
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,972
But what if you come to hate me

744
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,475
because I am shameless?

745
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:21,435
What if you leave again?

746
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:33,823
You are unaware.

747
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:41,706
I like you because you are shameless.

748
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:46,752
I will get going.

749
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:33,591
What about Father?

750
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:38,763
He is going around yelling
that the barbarians took you again.

751
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:42,141
Do not worry.

752
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,352
Madam Bangdu will take care of him.

753
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,757
I am going to say goodbye to my father,

754
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:17,134
so please wait at the docks.

755
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:35,027
Please help me find my Gil-chae.

756
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,405
The barbarians have taken my Gil-chae.

757
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:41,700
Gil-chae!

758
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,454
Gil-chae!

759
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:48,874
Gil-chae.

760
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,178
Father.

761
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,354
Father.

762
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:14,316
I was not taken by barbarians.

763
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,985
But

764
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:18,696
I have to leave for a while.

765
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:21,073
So do not worry about me.

766
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:25,286
Please eat.

767
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:29,290
-Please eat properly.
-Eat?

768
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:30,583
Yes, eat.

769
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:35,171
If you do not eat properly,
I will not come back.

770
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:38,382
And please

771
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:41,760
do not go looking for me alone.

772
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,390
You have to stay at home.

773
01:09:47,808 --> 01:09:48,809
Home?

774
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,355
Are you going to Neunggun-ri?

775
01:09:55,149 --> 01:09:56,150
Yes.

776
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,736
I am going to Neunggun-ri.

777
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,364
So please wait for me at home.

778
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,326
Sir!

779
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,329
-Sir!
-Gil-chae.

780
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,999
One person is not here yet.

781
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:15,461
We will pay you extra,
so can we wait one more hour?

782
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:16,629
Yes.

783
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,066
Be quiet.

784
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:38,734
Can you not be quiet?

785
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:41,487
Do you think she will come?

786
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:45,282
What?

787
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:48,035
The sun is setting.

788
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:51,497
You act all smart,
but you really are naive.

789
01:10:58,295 --> 01:10:59,755
Sir!

790
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,008
Sir!

791
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,818
-Sir!
-Gil-chae.

792
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,205
My Gil-chae.

793
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:18,792
You went through a lot, did you not?

794
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,006
Do not worry about me anymore.

795
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:27,259
Father.

796
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:31,156
What are you doing here so early?

797
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:34,785
Eat breakfast while you are here.

798
01:13:44,378 --> 01:13:45,379
My lady.

799
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,392
The soup looks good.

800
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:03,522
Lady Gil-chae.

801
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:10,446
Lady Gil-chae.

802
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:24,751
Why?

803
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:43,228
Watch this.

804
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:46,190
My goodness.

805
01:14:58,118 --> 01:14:59,995
The food was very good.

806
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:03,540
Thank you.

807
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:05,602
Get your fans.

808
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,187
Young Master.

809
01:16:08,021 --> 01:16:09,314
Young Master Jang-hyeon.

810
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,824
This is from Lady Gil-chae.

811
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:44,433
Though I did waver briefly,

812
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,270
I do not trust you or love you enough

813
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:52,774
to abandon everything and go with you.

814
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:57,487
If you have any affection left for me,

815
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:01,325
please forget all about me.

816
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:28,018
I will bring you the world's
most beautiful floral shoes.

817
01:18:20,737 --> 01:18:24,074
I asked you once
if you have ever hated me.

818
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:26,326
You answered,

819
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,372
"The day you left me forever,

820
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:33,417
I looked at you for a while
with a burning hatred.

821
01:18:35,335 --> 01:18:37,087
But no matter how much I looked,

822
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:39,715
I could not make myself hate you.

823
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:42,134
Instead, I hated myself."

824
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:45,053
Then you asked me,

825
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,431
"You cruel person,

826
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:50,726
did you ever realize my feelings?"

827
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,312
I must admit now

828
01:18:55,647 --> 01:18:57,816
that I did not realize then.

829
01:19:00,026 --> 01:19:01,111
I merely felt

830
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:05,407
my heart breaking
into thousands of pieces,

831
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,577
and I just wished desperately

832
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,872
that you would not feel the same way.

833
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:34,603
SHENYANG, 2 YEARS LATER

834
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:54,956
Have you been well?

835
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:01,880
It's been a while.

836
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:16,199
