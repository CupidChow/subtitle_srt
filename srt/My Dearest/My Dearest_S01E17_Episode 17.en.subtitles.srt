1
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,806
My goodness.

2
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,407
Can I take some daggers

3
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,327
to use against barbarian thieves?

4
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,621
What

5
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,956
are you saying?

6
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,924
Yes.

7
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,470
I was sold to barbarians in Shenyang.

8
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,681
I suffered unbearable humiliation there.

9
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,105
I also met Lord Lee.

10
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,234
I was freed thanks to his help.

11
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,824
The humiliation I endured

12
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,119
was not my fault.

13
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:03,623
If you had asked to divorce because
of that, I would not have given in.

14
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,666
However…

15
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,466
I gave my heart to Lord Lee in Shenyang.

16
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,638
I am sorry.

17
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,561
That is why I am divorcing you.

18
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,536
My lady.

19
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,789
Thank you for everything.

20
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,904
Gil-chae.

21
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,075
No, you cannot go.

22
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,286
You cannot go anywhere now.

23
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,871
Let me go.

24
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,499
If I stay here,

25
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,419
it will get in the way
of Yeong-chae getting married

26
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,087
and Je-nam sitting the state exam.

27
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,673
It will also reflect badly
on Compiler Nam.

28
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,303
I will leave Father in your care for now.

29
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,307
But I will take care of this child.

30
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,061
No.

31
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,979
Do not go.

32
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,731
I will live well.

33
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,442
I will live well

34
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:59,739
and repay the person who saved my life.

35
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,620
I will contact you when I am settled.

36
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,917
Let's go.

37
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,670
Don't go, Gil-chae.

38
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,506
Gil-chae, don't go!

39
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,968
Gil-chae, don't go…

40
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,067
Is this the place?

41
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,111
Why?

42
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,321
I bought this house
by selling all my jewelry.

43
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,616
Let's eat.

44
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,079
It's no wonder I worry
about my retirement.

45
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,456
I am happy now.

46
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,041
Do you like it?

47
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,051
How should we

48
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,053
live now?

49
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,764
-Good question.
-Good question.

50
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,650
Treason?

51
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,777
Did you say treason?

52
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,117
Sim Gi-won committed treason?

53
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:30,872
According to the record of his confession,
Sim Gi-won spent thousands of yang

54
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,707
on brewing liquor and slaughtering cattle.

55
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,752
He gathered over 70 strong men
in the mountains behind his house

56
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,380
to practice archery
and plan for the future.

57
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:45,261
So, Sim Gi-won has been
secretly training private soldiers?

58
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,723
Does he intend to sit
on the throne himself?

59
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,975
It does not seem so.

60
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,060
Then?

61
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,688
Who does he intend to make king?

62
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,816
At first…

63
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,199
he intended to serve
the crown prince in Shenyang

64
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,785
but changed his mind
and decided to support Prince Hoeeun.

65
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,329
PRINCE HOEEUN (LEE DEOK-IN):
GREAT GRANDSON OF KING SEONGJONG

66
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,937
We are tracking down
all of Sim Gi-won's relatives

67
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,355
and those who have fled--

68
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,482
Summon the magistrate
of Uiju for questioning.

69
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,150
The magistrate of Uiju

70
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,569
has no connection to this treason.

71
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,405
-So, why…
-Did the magistrate of Uiju…

72
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,533
MAGISTRATE: PROVINCIAL
GOVERNMENT OFFICE HEAD

73
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,035
…not cover up the fact
that the crown prince

74
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,662
was traveling with hundreds of captives?

75
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,000
What does His Majesty intend?

76
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,878
He is suspicious of the crown prince.

77
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,257
Well, that goes without saying.

78
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,510
But why is he suddenly punishing
the magistrate of Uiju?

79
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,595
It seems His Majesty

80
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,766
is afraid of the captives
following the crown prince.

81
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,435
Why would he fear mere captives?

82
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,145
That is what I am saying.

83
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,411
Who ordered you to bury cursed objects
all over the palace?

84
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,247
Who were you trying to curse?

85
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,499
I do not know anything.

86
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,960
I know nothing about this.

87
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,564
The palace prison guards are trying

88
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,150
to find the mastermind
behind the cursed objects in the palace.

89
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,068
The mastermind?

90
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,112
If you do not believe me,

91
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,781
check the records on the court ladies
executed by the Office of Justice

92
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,368
on orders from the Palace Treasury Office.

93
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,164
The Office of Justice took orders
from the treasury office?

94
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,166
How could an order
as serious as an execution

95
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,586
be delivered by the treasury office
and not the Privy Council?

96
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:28,883
It seems there were reasons the justice
office could not formally interrogate.

97
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,177
I have nothing more to say.

98
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,353
Someone sent me an anonymous letter.

99
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,272
Far more court ladies
are being interrogated than I thought.

100
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,776
It says many have even died
from severe torture.

101
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,451
Since the nation's king
has become so cruel,

102
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,291
great calamity will soon
befall the country.

103
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,256
Our king is terrified.

104
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:14,470
Did you know that fear
can turn a person cruel?

105
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,653
So…

106
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,615
go to Joseon.

107
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,497
Forget all the hardships
you endured here in Shenyang…

108
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,043
and live a good life.

109
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,050
Live loudly…

110
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:57,930
and vibrantly…

111
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,935
like the Gil-chae I know.

112
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,814
I am sorry

113
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,775
for not living that way.

114
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,225
You…

115
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,353
Have you come to die too?

116
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,022
Take my hand.

117
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,736
If this is how it would be,

118
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,489
why did you not let me die back then?

119
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,328
I came to draw water,

120
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,288
but you came to die?

121
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,543
That's right.

122
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,921
I want to die.

123
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,549
I finally made it back alive,

124
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,177
but I was kicked out for being
a disgrace to the family.

125
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,097
It would have been better
to die back then.

126
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,018
Fine.

127
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,230
Do as you wish.

128
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,273
But go die somewhere else.

129
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,613
What are you doing at the well
everyone in the village uses?

130
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,033
Jong-jong.

131
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,963
Do you want to eat before you die?

132
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,470
Thief.

133
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,388
What?

134
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,976
It is you. I have caught you at last.

135
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,935
Let go!

136
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,771
-Let go!
-No.

137
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,734
Why touch something
so hot with bare hands?

138
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,698
If you want to eat, bring firewood.

139
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,825
I'll give you a bowl of rice.

140
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,828
-You are lying.
-I mean it.

141
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,708
But if you get caught stealing again,
I will really punish you.

142
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,418
Don't lie.

143
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,137
What is that?

144
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,600
I made all of these.

145
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,895
When I got divorced,
I took a few as my share.

146
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:57,693
I wonder how I can sell these
for a good price.

147
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,820
If we sell all of these, what will we eat?

148
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,448
Give me rice.

149
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,037
Give me rice.

150
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,206
You said you would.

151
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,210
Hurry up.

152
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,129
Give me one bowl.

153
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,760
We will share it among ourselves.

154
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,348
I am hungry.

155
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,567
Where are your parents?

156
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,861
They are all dead.

157
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,280
The barbarians killed them.

158
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:45,991
Me too.

159
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,454
I told you that is not the case.

160
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,748
Your mother will surely come for you.

161
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,168
You are lying.

162
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,133
Seung-a, give them more rice.

163
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,218
What?

164
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:05,886
Oh, right.

165
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,054
Chew well,

166
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,098
okay?

167
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,685
I will give you more.

168
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,603
There is more rice.

169
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,689
Eat plenty.

170
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,711
I will never play baduk with you again.

171
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,174
You have said that 126 times already.

172
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,551
I mean it this time.

173
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,931
I enjoy playing baduk with Your Highness.

174
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,268
You enjoy playing with me?

175
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,729
Then, will you

176
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,064
serve me in bed this time?

177
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:05,070
Since you make me laugh like this,
how can I not enjoy it?

178
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:27,593
You said before that when you look at me,
you are sometimes reminded of someone.

179
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,096
Do you still think of her
when you look at me?

180
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:33,933
Or…

181
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,230
Let us go.

182
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,399
This time I will play a game I can win.

183
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,903
Let us do this.

184
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,657
If I win,
you will stay by my side forever.

185
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,952
You know the regent
treats me very well, don't you?

186
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,747
I can provide you with luxury
and riches for the rest of your life.

187
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,834
Then, if I win,
what reward will you give me?

188
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,003
That will not happen.

189
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,799
Soon, the Qing will conquer
the Central Plains.

190
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:10,469
Then, all Joseon people
will have to obey the Qing.

191
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,179
That applies

192
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,723
to you too.

193
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,564
See?

194
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,804
What are you doing?

195
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,640
I am a merchant.

196
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,934
I repay people.

197
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,022
I repay those who helped me make money
with more money.

198
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,192
I repay those who caused me losses

199
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,155
with bigger losses.

200
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,407
So,

201
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,410
I must repay the person

202
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,038
who shot me with an arrow.

203
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,749
You wicked,

204
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,876
selfish…

205
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,547
foolish woman.

206
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,052
Because of you…

207
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,513
Lee Jang-hyeon.

208
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,185
But it is strange.

209
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,482
Is it because I am so angry?

210
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,488
Is that why I think of you so much?

211
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,924
What did you mean just now?

212
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,636
Are you angry at me

213
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,223
or do you think of me a lot?

214
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,494
Lee Jang-hyeon.

215
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,287
Stop there.

216
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,580
Stop.

217
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,007
That crazy woman.

218
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,510
How dare a mere woman
demand the position of a prince?

219
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,512
She still thinks
her father is the emperor.

220
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,098
How long will Dorgon keep
the daughter of the former emperor

221
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,225
who had his mother
buried alive by his side?

222
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,979
With the way she is acting up,
Gakhwa will soon be sold to Mongolia.

223
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,897
If she is married off to Mongolia,

224
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,650
no one will care
whether she dies there or is neglected.

225
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,987
I heard her former husband abandoned her
after having fun with her once.

226
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,162
Such men are not worth

227
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,873
getting my hands dirty.

228
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,711
If I tell the regent,
he will have them killed for me.

229
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,466
What is it?

230
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,179
Do you also see me as an easy target

231
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,723
now that my power ties have weakened?

232
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:44,933
Do not underestimate me.

233
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,978
The regent still needs me,

234
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,480
and I still have

235
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,276
enough power to have you killed.

236
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,694
Your Highness,

237
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,115
I have not
stayed by your side all this time…

238
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,162
because I fear you.

239
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,246
Then, why?

240
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,792
Was it out of pity,

241
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,254
like how you help the captives?

242
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,716
No matter what they say,
you are still a princess.

243
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,220
I am who I am?

244
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:26,058
Wicked, foolish,

245
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,602
and selfish?

246
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,686
Yes.

247
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,440
That is who you are, Princess.

248
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,194
You are foolish…

249
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,531
and selfish.

250
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,871
But that is why…

251
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,505
Why what?

252
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,676
Your Highness.

253
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,305
-I…
-Enough.

254
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,060
I don't want to hear it.

255
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,775
You pushed me away before,

256
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,320
and you hesitated today,

257
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,489
but someday, you will fall into my arms.

258
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:12,748
Dorgon will soon send
the crown prince back to Joseon for good.

259
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,125
You will stay, right?

260
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,879
No.

261
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,964
You must stay.

262
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,061
Is that true?

263
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,229
Yes, Your Highness.

264
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,191
Congratulations, Your Highness.

265
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,235
You are returning to Joseon.

266
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,869
Your Highness.

267
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:02,005
Congratulations, Your Highness!

268
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:06,009
Congratulations, Your Highness!

269
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:10,138
Congratulations, Your Highness!

270
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,102
Your Majesty.

271
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,773
Enter.

272
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:55,160
Your Majesty, the Qing emperor is
sending the crown prince back to Joseon.

273
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,425
They must be experienced farmers.

274
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:18,683
That old man
spent his life savings to buy seven fields

275
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,770
but was captured
before he could even sow seeds.

276
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,523
He says his only wish is to farm
those fields just once before he dies.

277
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,194
Looking at him now, it seems hopeless.

278
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,616
It is not hopeless. He can go to Joseon.

279
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,535
Yang-cheon.

280
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,831
The crown prince is returning to Joseon.

281
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,875
He will take

282
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,670
all of us with him.

283
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,005
What?

284
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,179
Hey!

285
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,891
The crown prince is going back to Joseon.

286
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,269
-What?
-Now, we can all go back to Joseon too!

287
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,604
We can go to Joseon?

288
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,022
We are all going back?

289
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,358
-Yes.
-We are going!

290
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:12,153
Let us go back!

291
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,048
The food tastes good.

292
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,428
I DO NOT HAVE LONG TO SEE
MY FATHER - I WILL WORK HARD

293
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,017
Jang-hyeon.

294
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,102
We are going to Joseon?

295
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,187
Yes.

296
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,816
I finally feel at ease.

297
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,901
These people…

298
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,281
are all going to Joseon, thanks to you.

299
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,074
What did I do?

300
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,868
It is because of you.

301
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,037
Jang-hyeon did not
use to care much about others.

302
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,123
He only helped the captives
because you kept whining about it.

303
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,752
This has delayed the opening
of the Usimjeong Namwon branch.

304
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,546
So, if you think about it,
the reason I am not rich yet is

305
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,256
also because of your meddling, you punk.

306
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:19,179
If I had become rich earlier,
Jong-jong would not have left so quickly.

307
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:24,267
But once the Namwon branch opens,
all the Joseon women will…

308
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,769
Right. Put all this away.

309
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,068
You do not care about me at all.

310
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,279
We cannot take
the captives back to Joseon?

311
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:40,658
Do you know that His Majesty in Joseon
recently punished the magistrate of Uiju?

312
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,287
It was for failing to report in time

313
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,290
that Your Highness
would travel with hundreds

314
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,876
of officially redeemed captives
when you visited Joseon.

315
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,130
The magistrate was punished

316
00:27:55,673 --> 00:27:57,050
because I took captives back?

317
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,512
Yes, Your Highness.

318
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,472
Therefore,

319
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,850
apart from the 150 farmers
who have already been reported,

320
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,604
the hundreds of captives
you privately paid for and hired…

321
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,691
cannot be brought to Joseon.

322
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,487
No.

323
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,116
I promised them.

324
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,911
I promised that when I went to Joseon
I would surely take them with me.

325
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,455
Your Highness.

326
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,791
You must not take the captives with you.

327
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:32,210
His Majesty in Joseon does not wish it.

328
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,337
Your Highness.

329
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,301
Leave the captives behind?

330
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,513
What are you saying?

331
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,016
We are not leaving them forever.

332
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,893
We will bring them later.

333
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,648
Later?

334
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,193
His Highness is returning
to Joseon for good.

335
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,612
If they do not come with us now,

336
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,824
who knows when the captives will ever

337
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,453
be able to enter Joseon again.

338
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,537
His Majesty…

339
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,624
dislikes the idea
of the captives that have been

340
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,043
under His Highness's care
in Shenyang entering Joseon.

341
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,254
He must be under some misunderstanding.

342
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,674
Trust the crown prince and wait.

343
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,342
Once we return to Joseon,

344
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:24,012
he will surely clear up
the misunderstanding with His Majesty.

345
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,684
What? He is abandoning us?

346
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,519
He is not abandoning us.

347
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,272
The crown prince
is not that kind of person.

348
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,524
Lee Jang-hyeon.

349
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,110
Since when do you side with the royalty?

350
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,154
I am not taking sides.

351
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,907
Just sit down first.

352
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,991
Okay?

353
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,455
Yang-cheon.

354
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,251
Without the cooperation of the
Joseon court, even if we cross the river,

355
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,296
we will be dragged back to Qing.

356
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,968
Many of the people we have with us
have not been officially ransomed,

357
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,222
and some are escaped prisoners, right?

358
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,431
So, Yang-cheon…

359
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,394
let's go to Joseon first together.

360
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,774
And then later,
once the crown prince gets permission,

361
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,276
I will take responsibility

362
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,655
and bring over all the other captives.

363
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,532
I shall stay here too.

364
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,952
-Yang-cheon.
-Think about it.

365
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,747
They kidnap even normal people
and claim they are prisoners.

366
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,332
Do you think the Joseon people

367
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:37,252
will be safe in Shenyang
after the crown prince has left?

368
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,754
If people are arrested again
as escaped captives,

369
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,214
how will we stop it?

370
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,925
What if their ears are threaded

371
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,553
or have their ankles cut
and are even killed?

372
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,724
Then I will stay.

373
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,476
So, Yang-cheon--

374
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,769
That will not work.

375
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,354
You must go

376
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,191
and make sure to get
a promise from the crown prince.

377
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:04,404
I will stay here
and take care of the captives.

378
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,741
You go to Joseon
and get a promise from the crown prince.

379
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,830
You won't abandon me, right?

380
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,380
If everyone leaves,

381
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,507
what will happen to us?

382
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,468
Are they leaving us all behind?

383
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,221
-I knew this would happen.
-When will we ever be able to go?

384
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,890
You said they would take us all!

385
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,684
-Quiet down.
-Yes, be quiet.

386
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,603
It is just doubtful.

387
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,729
Hey!

388
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,986
You may not trust the crown prince,
but do you trust Lee Jang-hyeon?

389
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,863
I trust Lee Jang-hyeon.

390
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,575
So, I shall stay behind too.

391
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,579
I will stay here
and return with all of you.

392
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,497
I promise to take you,

393
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,750
your children,

394
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,543
your siblings,

395
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,254
and your parents…

396
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,218
back to Joseon.

397
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,639
If you stay, then it is fine.

398
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,682
That's right.

399
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,643
We should trust him.

400
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,686
If you stay, it will be all right.

401
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,146
Right.

402
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,564
We'll be able to go eventually.

403
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,942
If we just endure a little longer,
we'll be able to go back.

404
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,151
That is right.

405
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,913
-Your Highness.
-You have decided to stay, right?

406
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,585
Are you leaving?

407
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,759
That woman has already
gone back to her husband.

408
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,969
Yes.

409
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,014
I have no intention of causing trouble

410
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,768
by hanging around a married woman.

411
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:00,895
So…

412
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,399
if you wish,

413
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,944
I will stay by Your Highness's side.

414
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,530
But

415
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,949
I have a request.

416
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,253
I hear you were kicked out
by your husband?

417
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,382
The truth is I left on my own,

418
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,468
but no one believes me,
so I have given up trying to explain.

419
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,680
You are like me.

420
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,890
Whenever something
bad happens in the palace,

421
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,809
they all blame me,

422
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,520
but I just let them
because I also cannot be bothered.

423
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,482
So, how much
will you sell this dagger for?

424
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,193
That dagger

425
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,696
was engraved after our master blacksmith

426
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,407
dreamed of receiving a peach
from Grandmother Samsin.

427
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,492
They say any woman
who owns this mystical dagger

428
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,703
will give birth to 12 sons
as healthy and strong--

429
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,413
You are making strenuous effort
to make a living.

430
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,749
I guess you have to.

431
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,795
Who would buy a dagger sold by a woman
who was humiliated by the barbarians?

432
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,008
Fine.

433
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,135
I will buy it at a high price.

434
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,057
But there is something you must do for me.

435
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,812
Soon, the crown prince
will return to Joseon for good.

436
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,106
So…

437
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,526
The crown prince

438
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,488
is coming to Joseon?

439
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,909
Lady Jo is giving you work?

440
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,702
What kind of work?

441
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,166
He told me to live loudly and vibrantly.

442
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,336
I will never let him
see me living like this.

443
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,047
Pardon?

444
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,257
The crown prince is coming.

445
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,886
That means
Interpreter Lee and Gu-jam will also…

446
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,730
-He has come.
-The crown prince has come.

447
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,419
See?

448
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,421
He is not coming.

449
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:37,593
The Qing princess has claimed him,
so why would he come here

450
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,846
when he can live well there?

451
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,598
Just wait and see.

452
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,018
Someday, Lee Jang-hyeon

453
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,479
will be mine.

454
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,190
I guess you are right.

455
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,360
It seems he is not coming after all.

456
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,614
Gu-jam.

457
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,236
You came back.

458
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,290
Your Highness.

459
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,043
Crown Princess.

460
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,393
Father.

461
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,354
Mother.

462
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,442
Come here.

463
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,960
His Highness is smiling.

464
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,721
Are you glad to be back in Joseon?

465
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,183
Do you need to ask?

466
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,854
I grew up here.

467
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,819
This palace is my hometown.

468
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:25,136
Everyone was happy
to hear they would be going home.

469
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:32,226
I thought I had no hometown,
so I had nowhere to go.

470
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,314
But I found I too had a place

471
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,317
that I longed to return to.

472
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,783
Sleep well.

473
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,005
It seems you will be
drawing water all night.

474
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,635
So, are you happy after leaving me?

475
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,097
-Gu-jam.
-You did not come, so I came to you.

476
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,359
Why are you crying?

477
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,819
And if you are going to cry,
why did you leave?

478
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:24,987
You do not know.

479
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,782
You do not know my heart.

480
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,950
You do not know.

481
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,452
Fine, hit me.

482
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,580
Hit me as much as you missed me.

483
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,960
I met Jong-jong.

484
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,296
Lady Gil-chae does not even
work at the smithy anymore.

485
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,841
Even so, is she not out and about?

486
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,220
I do not have much time, so hurry.

487
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,765
You just came here.
What do you mean you do not have time?

488
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,309
I have to go back to Qing.

489
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,522
Anyway.

490
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,150
I need to quickly check
if Lady Gil-chae is doing well.

491
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,361
So, try to arrange a meeting
through Jong-jong.

492
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,363
I am telling you, it is difficult.

493
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,989
Since the barbarians invaded,

494
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,492
they have been strict
about women going out,

495
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,202
especially noblewomen.

496
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,000
Then, I will have to check for myself.

497
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,671
Jeez.

498
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:58,205
How did you know I live here?

499
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,460
You know Lord Lee
has returned to Joseon, right?

500
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,548
Do you want to meet with him?

501
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:13,345
You want me to meet with Lord Lee?

502
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:16,307
I do not want it.

503
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,184
But

504
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,061
Lord Lee wants to meet with you.

505
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,063
So,

506
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,942
you should seek him out first.

507
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,321
I do not want to.

508
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,114
You probably do not want him

509
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,659
to see you living like this, right?

510
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:43,334
It is only a matter of time
before he finds out about your situation.

511
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,670
So, go to him first.

512
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,299
You need to show him you are living well.

513
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,970
Only then, can Lord Lee
completely give up on you.

514
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,395
There is not a single
noblewoman to be found.

515
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,527
Jong-jong? Jong-jong!

516
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,778
Gu-jam.

517
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,408
-What are you doing?
-Just looking.

518
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,666
What are you doing?

519
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,742
So, did you meet other women in Shenyang?

520
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:01,745
There were many women who liked me.

521
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,540
You know I am the Batter of Joseon.

522
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,668
But, you know,

523
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,254
I am a very upright person.

524
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,552
Hey.

525
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,430
I had my fortune told.

526
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,974
I will make big money soon.

527
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,185
Hold on to me tight.

528
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,478
Hold on very tightly.

529
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,863
I am so bored being served
in my room all the time.

530
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:41,619
Officer Gu fusses too much over me,
not letting me walk or stand freely.

531
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:45,205
So, I came out today
by pretending to visit my father.

532
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,794
My sweet baby,
your mother told a little lie today.

533
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,630
Pretend you did not hear anything.

534
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:01,180
How have you been, my lord?

535
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,518
I did not think you would come to Joseon
since the Qing princess is so possessive.

536
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,814
I will be going back to Qing soon.

537
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:16,737
I came back briefly
because I wanted to visit my hometown.

538
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:18,989
I did not realize,

539
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,493
but it turns out I have a hometown too.

540
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,834
Are you okay?

541
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:34,922
This will not do.

542
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,132
-I will call a palanquin bearer--
-No.

543
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,968
I told you I wanted to walk.

544
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,555
Besides, I am really craving
steamed bean rice cakes.

545
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,392
Steamed bean rice cakes?

546
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,769
Yes.

547
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,690
No matter how much I make them at home,
they do not taste like the ones sold here.

548
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,945
Why is Jong-jong taking so long
to buy rice cakes?

549
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:03,867
Where did Jong-jong go?

550
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,161
Please wait here for a moment.

551
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:10,124
I will go look for Gu-jam and Jong-jong.

552
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,292
-Jong-jong!
-Lord Lee.

553
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,295
Jong-jong!

554
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,715
Please buy this.

555
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,759
Take a look.

556
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,846
Come and buy some.

557
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,764
Come and try some.

558
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,559
This tastes great.

559
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:42,072
That Gu-jam must be off
somewhere with Jong-jong

560
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,532
cooking beans or something…

561
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,451
I cannot find them anywhere.

562
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,371
Oh, this is…

563
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:54,960
On the way back,
I met an old lady selling rice cakes.

564
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,837
You can try one if you like.

565
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,488
Yes.

566
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,198
This hits the spot.

567
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:26,825
Have some sikhye too.

568
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,251
It is refreshing.

569
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,421
You should try some.

570
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,717
I am fine. You eat it all.

571
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,559
Put the bowl here.

572
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,854
I will have some more.

573
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,577
Why did you quit working at the smithy?

574
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,122
You know why.

575
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,584
Since being captured and taken to Qing,

576
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,212
I have been very careful
about going outside.

577
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,006
What else can I do?

578
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:28,178
Anyway, Lord Gu said he would
send ahead a palanquin.

579
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,473
There it is.

580
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,065
Okay.

581
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,901
I guess it is time to go then.

582
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,949
I would like to look around
the market more, but what can I do?

583
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:53,704
My lord cannot even eat dinner without me.

584
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:56,832
Well, then…

585
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,548
Let me make one request.

586
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,183
Soon, Ryang-eum

587
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,353
will host a gathering
to celebrate returning to Joseon,

588
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,731
at which he will perform a song.

589
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,233
Will you

590
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,736
be able to join us?

591
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,114
Please.

592
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,077
It is my last request.

593
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,168
Stop.

594
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:46,965
My lady.

595
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,597
Your clothes are pretty.

596
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,891
Who knew Gil-chae could look pretty?

597
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,143
There you go, speaking rudely again.

598
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,813
Which house is it? Is it here?

599
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,690
This is the right place.

600
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,776
This one or that one? Which woman is it?

601
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,363
That one there.

602
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,828
What are you doing?

603
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:20,749
Do women who have slept with barbarians
have no shame?

604
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,461
How dare you flirt with my husband?

605
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,546
All I did

606
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,175
was answer when he asked for directions.

607
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:33,095
How dare a wench
stained by barbarians talk back?

608
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,347
-Are you done talking?
-Not yet. Move!

609
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,890
-"Stained by barbarians"?
-Move!

610
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,934
-Get out!
-Get out of here!

611
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,686
-Get out!
-Go away.

612
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,200
Let us wash.

613
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,245
Look how dirty you are.

614
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,832
You little rascal.

615
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:03,500
Blow.

616
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:05,919
Harder. One, two, three.

617
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,964
A little more. One, two, three.

618
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,215
Look at that gunk.

619
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,425
Goodness.

620
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,892
Hey, you!

621
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,019
You come here.

622
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,023
You too.

623
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,401
Come here, all of you.

624
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,029
What?

625
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,656
-Come here.
-Gil-chae!

626
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,826
Come here.

627
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,079
She got divorced?

628
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:43,874
Yes.

629
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,838
Please stop.

630
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,425
Look.

631
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,302
Lady Yoo is smiling.

632
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:57,804
Gil-chae!

633
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,474
Get over here.

634
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,017
If you go over there now…

635
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,645
she will want to cry.

636
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:31,797
USIMJEONG

637
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:37,761
I gaze into the distance

638
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:46,436
At your dear face

639
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:52,025
Carried on

640
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:55,904
A distant wind

641
00:51:55,987 --> 00:52:01,493
The memory of a face

642
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:04,120
I came because you said
it was your last request.

643
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,206
But I will never again--

644
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,749
Thank you.

645
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,001
It has already started. Let us go in.

646
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:20,428
Waiting with your head in your hands

647
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,851
I wait

648
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:30,021
For you

649
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,900
To come down

650
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:39,447
That path

651
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:43,618
At the slightest rustle

652
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:47,122
Of a bamboo leaf

653
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:53,920
In the twinkling moonlight

654
00:52:56,548 --> 00:53:00,468
I see

655
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:04,347
You standing with your back to me

656
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:09,185
But then you turn

657
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:13,189
And smile at me

658
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:17,652
I put what remains of my longing

659
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,487
-Into the memories
-You were once enamored…

660
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,740
Of back then

661
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,242
-One drop at a time
-…by Ryang-eum's singing.

662
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,202
-I pour in
-So…

663
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,329
I cannot…

664
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:29,998
Every last drop

665
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:33,919
I love you

666
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,881
-What is going on?
-Why did the singing stop?

667
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,800
-What is he doing?
-Why did he suddenly stop?

668
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,053
-What happened?
-Why is there no sound?

669
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,430
What is going on?

670
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,558
I am sorry.

671
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,019
My morning sickness is still severe.

672
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,901
Do you think such a world could exist?

673
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,363
A world cast in moonlight,

674
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,783
filled with the sound of Ryang-eum singing

675
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,495
and the sound of flowers blooming.

676
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,622
A world like that.

677
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,876
What sound do flowers make?

678
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,629
Have you not heard it?

679
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,090
I have heard it.

680
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,970
It was truly a precious sound.

681
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,851
I should

682
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,145
get in the palanquin now.

683
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:40,360
Do you remember

684
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,279
what I said before?

685
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:51,204
I said I would never again
cause you any trouble.

686
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,793
I am so glad…

687
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,923
that I can keep that promise.

688
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,051
So…

689
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:08,596
Please…

690
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,976
be at peace.

691
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,487
How long do you plan to deceive me?

692
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,493
How long…

693
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,415
do you think you can keep this up?

694
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:48,428
I was so foolish to think
that I could deceive you, of all people.

695
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,597
My lady.

696
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,309
I am living well in my own way.

697
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,020
So, do not pity me.

698
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,147
Do not feel sorry for me.

699
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,274
That is

700
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,818
what I want.

701
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:05,820
No.

702
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,407
I cannot do that.

703
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,700
You must.

704
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,120
I left Shenyang…

705
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,543
because it was what you wanted.

706
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,714
Now, it is your turn.

707
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,845
Please pretend you did not see me.

708
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,607
Things did not work out.

709
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,110
But do not worry about Lord Lee.

710
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,487
I explained it to him
so he would understand.

711
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,864
"Understand"?

712
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,534
You are

713
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:36,828
truly impressive.

714
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,080
You really are.

715
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:43,084
-What?
-Why?

716
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,587
Will beat me for speaking informally
to a noblewoman?

717
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,382
Once again,

718
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:53,720
you only care about
your own pride and feelings, right?

719
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,807
You do not care at all
about Lee Jang-hyeon's pain, do you?

720
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:03,646
I hate seeing Lee Jang-hyeon sad
because of a woman like you.

721
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,233
It drives me crazy to watch Lee Jang-hyeon
get hurt because of a woman like you.

722
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:09,611
If I were you…

723
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,992
If I had even a fraction
of Lee Jang-hyeon's heart…

724
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:19,621
Then…

725
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,210
Why on earth are you…

726
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:26,920
You have no right.

727
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,423
You have no right
to be loved by Lee Jang-hyeon

728
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,966
or even to be ignored by him.

729
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,011
You…

730
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,892
have no right to take
anything from Lee Jang-hyeon.

731
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,169
What do you know?

732
00:59:33,027 --> 00:59:34,028
So,

733
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,532
now that Lady Yoo is divorced,
will she run to you?

734
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,538
She does not want that, right?

735
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,957
I knew it.

736
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:47,792
That woman

737
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:50,628
thinks she is the most
important person in the world.

738
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,880
So, she can play with your feelings--

739
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,048
Watch your words.

740
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,435
I shall be going to Uiju soon.

741
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,062
It is only right…

742
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,275
that I go and bring back Big Brother.

743
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,612
Then, are we going back
to Uiju like before--

744
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,114
And then, I will cross over to Qing.

745
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,243
I shall finish things
with the princess and come back.

746
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,539
What promise did you make to the princess?

747
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,708
What did you say to get her

748
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,878
to take care of the captives in Shenyang

749
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,672
and let you go so easily?

750
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,926
I told her I would go to her side.

751
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,053
However…

752
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,770
Things have changed now.

753
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:50,855
I did not know then…

754
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:55,568
that Lady Yoo was divorced.

755
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,615
So?

756
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,961
Can we…

757
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,425
go back to before we met that woman?

758
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:23,096
You and me

759
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:26,349
with Gu-jam and Big Brother…

760
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,977
Things were good, right?

761
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,064
Do we…

762
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,276
mean nothing to you?

763
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,362
Of course not.

764
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:51,916
Ryang-eum.

765
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,753
I would…

766
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,094
die for you.

767
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,139
But…

768
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:15,440
I want to live for her now.

769
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:19,402
And…

770
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,699
if anyone gets in my way,

771
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:26,868
whoever they are…

772
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,668
I will never see them again.

773
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:44,635
Then, I will go with you too.

774
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:48,556
Fine.

775
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,059
You live for that woman.

776
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:55,229
As your younger brother…

777
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,108
I will follow you…

778
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,946
wherever you go, Brother.

779
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:51,744
I have been waiting.

780
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,185
Do you know

781
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:20,273
what I wanted to do most
when I saw you again?

782
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,820
I wanted to serve you a meal I cooked…

783
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,241
with my own hands.

784
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,881
It feels like…

785
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,427
we have become newlyweds.

786
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,221
Now,

787
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:37,516
we can spend
the rest of our lives like this.

788
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:42,897
My Lord.

789
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:47,485
Yoo Gil-chae.

790
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,537
Now, there is nothing standing…

791
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,834
between you and me.

792
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,138
So, no one can stop me either.

793
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,665
That was a great meal.

794
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,459
I am so full.

795
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:51,966
I have fulfilled my wish.

796
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,595
This is enough for me.

797
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,516
I wish for nothing more from you.

798
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:02,852
So…

799
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,395
Why did you get divorced?

800
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,745
You never asked me.

801
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:25,541
And I never told you.

802
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,006
But in Shenyang…

803
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:33,215
Yes?

804
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,849
You can say it if you want to.

805
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:46,062
It does not matter to me.

806
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:01,619
Do you still not know me?

807
01:08:10,294 --> 01:08:11,420
Do you still not…

808
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:16,258
know my heart?

809
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:20,471
I just…

810
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,519
want you.

811
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:32,274
Poor Gil-chae,

812
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,444
rich Gil-chae…

813
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:39,615
impertinent Gil-chae,

814
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:42,076
obedient Gil-chae…

815
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,541
Gil-chae, who does not love me.

816
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,755
Gil-chae, who loves me.

817
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,011
Any version of Gil-chae…

818
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:08,144
is fine with me.

819
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:18,988
All right.

820
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:21,574
Then…

821
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:36,463
What about a Gil-chae who was
violated by barbarians?

822
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:53,147
I should hold you
because you must have suffered.

823
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,428
You must have been in anguish.

824
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:33,270
It must have been hard.

825
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:42,154
It is all over now.

826
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,533
Do not worry about anything anymore.

827
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:56,794
I will be

828
01:10:58,128 --> 01:10:59,713
by your side now.

829
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:05,219
Even if you push me away, I will be here.

830
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,847
Even if you get tired of me…

831
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,686
I will be here.

832
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:26,615
The moment…

833
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:31,453
I first saw you, I knew.

834
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,335
I have never…

835
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,465
wanted anyone…

836
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:48,345
but you.

837
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:07,031
Can I…

838
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:16,332
hold you today?

839
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:52,052
I will make for him a pillowcase
embroidered by my own hands.

840
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:55,514
Please grant the captives
safe passage across the river.

841
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,558
Once Interpreter Lee comes back,

842
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:59,351
we will all live happily together.

843
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,310
Lee Jang-hyeon.

844
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:01,895
Let us not think of anything else.

845
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:04,273
Things are moving quickly, so hurry.

846
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:05,274
Lee Jang-hyeon.

847
01:14:05,357 --> 01:14:06,358
Where is he?

848
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,486
If he were alive, why would he
not have come back by now?

849
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:10,821
It has disappeared.

850
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:13,657
Do you think we would fear a woman
who lost her virtue to barbarians?

851
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,576
Then, you and Interpreter Lee…

852
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:18,537
If only you had slept with him sooner…

853
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:20,956
You know, he says he will stay with me.

854
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:37,598
