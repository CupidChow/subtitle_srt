00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:54,971
SPRING OF 1659
10TH YEAR OF HYOJONG'S REIGN

2
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,419
INSPECTOR SHIN I-RIP

3
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,023
You became an inspector this year?

4
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,192
Yes.

5
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,655
I heard you had a task for me.

6
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,343
This was discovered
after the former crown prince passed.

7
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,679
By former crown prince, you mean…

8
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,558
Crown Prince Sohyeon.

9
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,784
This is a historical record draft.

10
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,703
Frankly speaking,

11
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,831
it is a record
that should have been erased.

12
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,376
A record that should not exist.

13
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,590
It slanders the reputation
of the former crown prince.

14
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,970
However,

15
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,598
there is one thing that bothers me.

16
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:09,188
There is a man who
is mentioned frequently in this draft.

17
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,609
His actions are a cause of concern.

18
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,033
Find out if this draft is authentic.

19
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,452
Find out about that man.

20
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:27,332
But looking into a record
that should not exist…

21
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,666
That is why…

22
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,420
you have to do it quietly.

23
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:41,471
"One of the military officers
did not behave as an officer should."

24
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,306
"He failed his duty to report."

25
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,268
"He corrupted the crown prince."

26
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,190
"So, one of the men was punished
by the heavens and driven mad."

27
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,692
"Thus, His Majesty ordered

28
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,487
for him to never
see the light of day again."

29
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,038
"Lee Jang-hyeon."

30
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:14,045
HYEMINSEO: A GOVERNMENT OFFICE
THAT TREATED JOSEON COMMONERS FOR FREE

31
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,381
-I am in pain.
-Please help me.

32
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,386
Please help.

33
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,181
Gosh, it hurts.

34
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,433
Please take a look at me.

35
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:07,724
I heard that you wanted
to take a look around.

36
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,021
I heard you also treat
mental illnesses here.

37
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,814
That is right.

38
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,152
But we do not just take in anybody.

39
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,864
The nobles secretly bring relatives

40
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:27,493
who they can neither
care for at home nor abandon.

41
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,124
Is there a man who insists he is a
faithful servant of the late crown prince?

42
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,548
Do you know him?

43
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,097
I came here to ask him a question.

44
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,390
A question?

45
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:55,646
The mere thought
of conversing with him is absurd.

46
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,483
Why is that?

47
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,818
You will understand once you meet him.

48
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,112
But strangely enough,

49
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,200
someone from very high up
made a special request

50
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,994
for us to take good care of him.

51
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,832
Why care for a man
who has muttered the same thing for years?

52
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,959
What does he mutter?

53
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,795
Something about how

54
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,090
someone will come to get him
when it is time.

55
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,769
My dear husband. Is that you?

56
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,604
Why did you not come sooner?

57
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,980
My dear husband!

58
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,192
Mother!

59
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:44,195
I passed the civil service exam!

60
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,990
I got first place.

61
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:55,832
That wench! Please help my child.

62
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,418
That wench! That wench!

63
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,716
This is him.

64
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,355
I am Inspector Shin I-rip.

65
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,983
I have something to ask you.

66
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,153
If you would be willing to talk…

67
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,616
Is the person you are waiting for

68
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,369
Lee Jang-hyeon?

69
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,336
I read a strange story recently.

70
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,298
It featured a man

71
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,467
named Lee Jang-hyeon.

72
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,013
The records of his achievements
are likely untrue.

73
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,306
But I wonder

74
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,641
if you happen to know him.

75
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,319
I see you understand me.

76
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,322
You are not crazy,

77
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,782
are you?

78
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,080
Could you tell me

79
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,791
about Lee Jang-hyeon?

80
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,202
Can you hear it?

81
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,665
This sound.

82
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,463
The sound of flowers.

83
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,491
SPRING OF 1636
14TH YEAR OF INJO'S REIGN

84
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,955
-One, two.
-One, two.

85
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,083
-Let us keep going.
-Let us keep going.

86
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,210
There is a ton over here.

87
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,298
Snack time!

88
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,967
Let us eat.

89
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,220
You are here.

90
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,390
Hey.

91
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,934
Let us eat first.

92
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,936
-Gather around. Let us eat!
-Let us eat!

93
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,148
"My father gave me life,

94
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,192
and my mother nurtured it."

95
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:19,155
"My father gave me life,

96
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,032
and my mother nurtured it."

97
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,327
"My father gave me life,

98
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,413
and my mother nurtured it."

99
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,416
"My father gave me life,

100
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,335
and my mother nurtured it."

101
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,881
"At a place of rest, I will find my way.

102
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,509
When I find my way, peace will follow.

103
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,304
A peaceful mind leads to repose.

104
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,265
Repose leads to thinking.

105
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,268
When I think, I am enlightened."

106
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,652
Sweet, yellow bird.

107
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,780
Who is the fairest in the world?

108
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,034
If you think it is
Lady Gil-chae of Neunggun-ri,

109
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,577
chirp for me.

110
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,829
If you think it is another lady,

111
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,164
do a handstand.

112
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,463
Sweet, yellow bird.

113
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,216
Who is the fairest in the world?

114
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,760
Tell me,

115
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,845
or I will break your legs.

116
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,474
Lady Gil-chae.

117
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,271
I will get in trouble if you are late.

118
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,691
You must impress the senior clerk's wife
if you want a good husband.

119
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,069
All the matchmakers
who visit here go to her first.

120
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,904
But she hates me.

121
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,115
That is why you need to try harder.

122
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,783
You need to find a good husband

123
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,202
so I can live with my head held high.

124
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,162
Please do not just think of yourself.

125
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,123
Think of the people around you.

126
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,791
Is that not the duty of a noble lady?

127
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,295
Must I be nagged by my servant?

128
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,297
Your voice will haunt me in my dreams.

129
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,544
Eun-ae.
Are you going to the flower festival?

130
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,172
I am going to wear a hanbok
that is pink on top--

131
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,466
I did not ask you.

132
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,053
Hey, Eun-ae.
You know Young Master Jun-jeol?

133
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,305
He said he wanted to write poems
on my fan at the festival,

134
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,474
but he has not brought it up since.

135
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,393
If a man confuses you,
he does not like you.

136
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,145
If you want to know how he feels,

137
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,272
go up to him first.

138
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,650
Use the old trick
of smiling and tapping him playfully.

139
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,529
My goodness.

140
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,450
How could you tell me
to behave so frivolously?

141
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,453
Young Master Jun-jeol
would never fall for such a trick.

142
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,789
But you can be as frivolous as you like.

143
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,167
-Anyway, Eun-ae--
-Me first.

144
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,212
-Eun-ae, do you want to embroider with me?
-Sure.

145
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,757
Eun-ae promised to do it with me today.
Right, Eun-ae?

146
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,342
No, I was first.

147
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,635
No, she just said yes.

148
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,429
-No, I asked her first.
-This is pretty, right?

149
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,764
Do it with me this time.

150
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,266
I am not going to the flower festival.

151
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,852
Why bother making pancakes out of plants

152
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,730
or writing poems on fans or whatever?

153
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,316
How childish.

154
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,318
I heard Hanyang people do not do that.

155
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,861
It is so lame.

156
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,508
I cannot deal with you.

157
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,761
I should find another lady to serve.

158
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,348
I have been so worried
about my future lately

159
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,641
that I cannot sleep.

160
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,192
I really cannot deal with you.

161
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,737
Do I have to look for a new lady?

162
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,574
Do not worry about your future.

163
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,244
Soon, I will marry a handsome man.

164
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,874
I will meet the man destined for me.

165
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,848
Next time, no matter
how much you want to brag,

166
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,351
remind yourself that others might
have something you do not,

167
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,270
and keep it to yourself.

168
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,274
When I do meet the one,

169
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,986
I will give him a pillow
I embroidered myself

170
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,615
so that we can meet in our dreams as well.

171
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,451
How will you do that if you keep
getting kicked out of embroidery class?

172
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,205
How many times has it been already?

173
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,290
Is it so hard to sit quietly?

174
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,918
My goodness. I cannot believe her.

175
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,784
Who are you, Young Master?

176
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,374
I have been waiting for you

177
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,835
in this place

178
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,504
for a long time.

179
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,712
Lady Gil-chae.

180
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,174
Lady Gil-chae.

181
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,928
Lady Gil-chae. Your water is ready.

182
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,682
I knew your voice would haunt me.

183
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,184
Why did you wake me up?

184
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,562
Did you have that dream again?

185
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:21,024
Did you and that dream man once again--

186
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,150
Of course.

187
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,736
Once again, he and I

188
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,738
read together.

189
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,372
I read the first chapter,

190
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,583
and he read the second.

191
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:45,006
He was about to enlighten me
on cultivating the self and the home…

192
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,640
So, why did you have to wake me up?

193
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,144
You have never even seen his face.

194
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,062
I do not have to.

195
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,399
I am sure it is Young Master Yeon-jun.

196
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,693
Do not count your chickens
before they hatch.

197
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,571
People are saying

198
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,948
that Young Master Yeon-jun likes Eun-ae.

199
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:13,368
Did you think all the men
in the world liked you?

200
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:16,371
Those two
do not share that kind of connection.

201
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,747
As if.

202
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:21,334
Everyone in Neunggun-ri knows
Young Master Yeon-jun likes Eun-ae.

203
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,919
You are the only one who does not.

204
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,380
I told you not to speak of Eun-ae to me.

205
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,716
Eun-ae, Eun-ae, Eun-ae.

206
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,718
Eun-ae, Eun-ae, Eun-ae.
Eun-ae, Eun-ae, Eun-ae.

207
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,805
Did someone call me?

208
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,017
No one called you.

209
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:41,271
Are you that eager
to see Young Master Yeon-jun today?

210
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,190
Do not be ridiculous.

211
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,318
My gosh, how pretty.

212
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,694
Shall we go with this one?

213
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,988
Or will this look better?

214
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,573
Gosh.

215
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,574
It is not necessary.

216
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,244
But you have not seen him in a while.

217
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,622
There is no harm in looking your best.

218
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:02,125
This is why
that cunning Lady Gil-chae keeps--

219
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,543
Madam Bangdu.

220
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,045
Do not start that again.

221
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,761
I wonder if he has passed the entrance.

222
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:31,029
Young Master Yeon-jun likes Eun-ae
Not Gil-chae

223
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,239
Get out.

224
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,327
You leave too. I am going back to sleep.

225
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,121
I heard Young Master Yeon-jun

226
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:44,417
might come from Sungkyunkwan
to attend the festival today.

227
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,420
But I guess
if you really do not want to go…

228
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,928
Sometimes,
it is good to commune with nature.

229
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,269
Well then, I should wash up first.

230
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,565
Eun-ae!

231
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,859
Hi, Gil-chae.

232
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,696
What did I say?

233
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,532
I told you she would show up.

234
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,158
I am on my way to the festival.

235
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,910
-Do you want to go together?
-Gosh.

236
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,704
Is today the flower festival?

237
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,414
I cannot say no, can I?

238
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,873
Well, then. Shall we?

239
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:24,958
Let's go.

240
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,923
I knew your lady would come.

241
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,759
She knows Young Master Yeon-jun
is coming, doesn't she?

242
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:39,014
My lady can go wherever Lady Eun-ae goes.

243
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,891
I heard a man once tried to kill himself

244
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,977
after Lady Gil-chae rejected him.

245
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,813
It is not her fault men find her pretty.

246
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,107
It is not because she is pretty.

247
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,985
It is because of the way she acts.

248
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,738
Once, she laughed in the company of men

249
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,532
with her mouth wide open,
so you could see down her throat.

250
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,492
How indecent.

251
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,746
What else should a man look down at
when a woman laughs?

252
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,581
My goodness.

253
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,333
Being mean is bad for the baby.

254
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,878
Hey, how dare you!

255
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,894
Let us go

256
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,979
Let us go to the flower festival

257
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:32,442
Let us go before the flowers fall

258
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:37,238
Sang-dan will blanch the flowers

259
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:41,659
Sam-wol will mix the flour

260
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:46,081
The birds will call their friends

261
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:50,418
The tiger butterflies will dance

262
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,884
The weather is perfect.

263
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,179
Let us go

264
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,348
Let us go to the flower festival

265
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:08,186
Let us go before the flowers fall

266
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,148
Let us go to the flower festival

267
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,673
Do you know what can happen
if you act carelessly at the festival?

268
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,468
-When the Japanese invaded--
-When the Japanese soldiers invaded,

269
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,970
one soldier threw himself on Deok-bok.

270
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,431
She resisted and bit his finger,

271
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,850
so he got mad and cut off her hands.

272
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:50,270
When she still would not give in,
he beat her to death.

273
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,773
Even with her dying breath,
she condemned the enemy.

274
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,984
During the Jin invasion--

275
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,404
Ten years ago, during the Jin invasion,

276
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,532
Ms. Lee fled to the mountains
with her mother-in-law on her back.

277
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:05,326
When a barbarian
tried to glimpse her face,

278
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,745
she resisted fiercely.

279
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:10,081
So, the soldier
pierced her eyes with a knife.

280
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,834
It is not as if we are
on the verge of another war.

281
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,627
Why must she repeat these tales?

282
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,547
She acts like barbarians
will invade any minute.

283
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,886
Your Majesty,
Royal Messenger Min Jin-ik is here.

284
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:33,396
His Majesty is unwell,
so I have been by his side all day.

285
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,273
What is all this fuss about?

286
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,904
Have the envoys we sent
to the Jin Dynasty come back?

287
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,114
Yes, the envoys have returned,

288
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,866
but the Jin king said…

289
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,453
The king of Jin, Hong Taiji,

290
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,539
has appointed himself emperor
and offered a rite to the heavens?

291
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,125
Yes, Your Majesty.

292
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:59,547
But we did not bow down to him.

293
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:04,677
But you delivered his letter
instead of tearing it up before him.

294
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:08,556
Your Majesty. Cut off their heads
and throw them to the enemy.

295
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,933
You are overreacting.

296
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,145
The Great Ming Dynasty
has been at war with Jin

297
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,438
for several years now.

298
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,440
When Jin barbarians raid a village,

299
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,735
no houses are left standing.

300
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,154
No man can survive
or keep their wives safe.

301
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,371
They are that merciless.

302
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,623
Am I still overreacting?

303
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,669
Will you serve the leader
of such people as an emperor?

304
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,922
It used to be said
that no one could defeat

305
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,466
a Jurchen troop of 10,000 men.

306
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,761
The Ming's Dalinghe Fortress has fallen.

307
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,305
The Jin barbarians are a great threat.

308
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,306
But more importantly…

309
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,975
DALINGHE FORTRESS: A MING FORTRESS
AT THE DALING RIVER BASIN

310
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,812
They must know
that Joseon is loyal to the Ming

311
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,024
and that we would never serve
the Jin king as emperor.

312
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:05,405
Why would they dare
to force our envoys to bow?

313
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,617
What do you think is the reason?

314
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,209
Lee was carrying
her husband's body to his hometown

315
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,170
when the owner
of the inn grabbed her wrist.

316
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:25,091
He happened to grab it
when they got into a tussle,

317
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:27,135
but Lee wept
and cried out to the heavens.

318
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,221
"I am a widow. How could I…"

319
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,940
"How could I let another hold my wrist?"

320
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,693
What was it they called me?
Frivolous and cunning?

321
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,449
Those who envy me think
men like me because I am pretty.

322
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,783
But Jong-jong,

323
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:54,078
it is not just
because of my outstanding beauty.

324
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,998
I am a woman who puts in effort.

325
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,459
Yes, you are.

326
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,379
I will show them just how cunning I am.

327
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,435
Gil-chae, Gil-chae.

328
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,504
You look even more dignified
than usual today.

329
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:51,719
The mountain path was so steep
that I almost fell over on my way here.

330
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,222
Would you guide me

331
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,975
on the way back down?

332
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,103
Of course.

333
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,961
Young Master, how could you?

334
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,421
What?

335
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,423
Did I do something wrong?

336
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:32,427
I looked for you all day to ask you
to write a poem on my fan.

337
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,303
Where have you been?

338
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,305
You want me to do it?

339
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,307
Who else would I ask?

340
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,811
Aren't you the greatest calligrapher
in Neunggun-ri?

341
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,438
Well, I…

342
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:49,819
Then, I promise to write on your fan--

343
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,530
So, you will do it later
if you have time to spare?

344
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,240
I do not want that.

345
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,284
I will write it now…

346
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,871
I will write it for you now.

347
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,087
You are blocking the way.

348
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,299
My bad. I mean, sorry.

349
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,551
I mean, I apologize.

350
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,263
The ghost of a long-dead widow
must be holding my leg--

351
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,931
The ghost of a widow?

352
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,769
A ghost?

353
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,395
You are so funny.

354
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,443
Truly, you are the only man

355
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,070
who can make me laugh.

356
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,573
"The ghost of a long-dead widow."

357
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,787
Have you heard of such a ghost?

358
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,459
I am a very funny man.

359
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,420
I am the most dignified man
in Neunggun-ri.

360
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,089
I am the greatest calligrapher.

361
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,149
Let us have a taste.

362
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,615
Young Master.

363
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,246
That is hot. That is hot!

364
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:33,714
Ask him how he could promise
to write a poem for another woman.

365
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,216
In front of my very eyes, too!

366
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,135
He tripped like a clown
hurrying to get his brushes.

367
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,053
Was he that desperate?

368
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,888
Has he no dignity?

369
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,228
My lady says, "I am standing right here."

370
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,106
"How could you agree
to write on another woman's fan?"

371
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:58,906
Young Master.

372
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,285
How could you?

373
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,538
What?

374
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,457
I cannot hear you.

375
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,126
Do you like Gil-chae?

376
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,878
Nonsense.

377
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,131
She and I are practically strangers.

378
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,512
Someone like her

379
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,514
is out of my reach.

380
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,008
So, how is everyone doing?

381
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,468
How do you think?

382
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:04,597
Even the Imjin War wasn't this chaotic.

383
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,477
By the way,
where is Young Master Yeon-jun?

384
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,188
Welcome.

385
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,815
Come along.

386
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,244
Young Master Yeon-jun.

387
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,047
Why is he with Father?

388
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,466
Could he be

389
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,635
seeking permission to court me?

390
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,304
My gosh.

391
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,765
He should have dropped me a hint.

392
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,528
Since everyone is here,

393
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,946
I have an announcement.

394
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,825
As you are all aware,

395
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,869
the Ming and Jin are at war.

396
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:13,207
But in a letter to our king,
the king of Jin

397
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,835
declared himself
the emperor of the Great Qing

398
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,796
and referred to us as "you folks."

399
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,881
-"You folks"?
-How dare they?

400
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,216
-What?
-How insolent.

401
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,759
He dares to call himself an emperor?

402
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,844
But the royal court

403
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,513
has no intention of joining
the fight against Jin.

404
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,725
Instead, they will send an envoy
to appease the king of Jin.

405
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:31,809
An envoy?

406
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,978
-How ludicrous.
-That is ridiculous.

407
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,022
-Not this boring topic again…
-So, today…

408
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,110
with our master's permission,

409
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:44,613
I propose we unite
and raise an appeal to His Majesty.

410
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,825
-Good idea. I shall partake.
-Me too.

411
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:51,454
Of course. We must help the Ming
and teach the Jin a lesson.

412
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,247
-That is right.
-That is right.

413
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,042
Is there any guarantee
that the Ming will win?

414
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,261
Have you not considered the possibility

415
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,513
that the Jin barbarians might win?

416
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,223
What nonsense.

417
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,768
The Jin are no more
than children throwing stones.

418
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,436
The heavens are on Ming's side.

419
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,104
How could the barbarians win?

420
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,858
The heavens?

421
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,945
-Oh, dear.
-Goodness.

422
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,200
The heavens are on Ming's side,

423
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,495
so they will surely win, you say?

424
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,749
Well, you know what?

425
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,668
The Jin do not think that.

426
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,549
Before the great nation of Ming

427
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,136
was the Yuan Dynasty
set up by the Mongols.

428
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,222
And before that,

429
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,350
the land was ruled
by the Jurchen Jin Dynasty.

430
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,936
So, the Jin barbarians believe

431
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,606
-that the heavens are on their side.
-What nonsense.

432
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,858
-How absurd.
-How could you say that?

433
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,944
The heavens don't work that way.

434
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,824
Their will does not change
according to the time or circumstances.

435
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,785
The heavens are loyal and constant

436
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,245
like the earth.

437
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,248
And no matter how confident
the Jin barbarians may be,

438
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,125
the Ming is a powerful nation

439
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,710
while the Qing is a small newborn country.

440
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,587
Do you not know that Nurhaci,
the former king of Jin,

441
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,549
lost his life to the Ming general,
Yuan Chonghuan?

442
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,634
-Indeed.
-Of course.

443
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,388
And do you know how Yuan Chonghuan died?

444
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,560
He was punished by being flayed.

445
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,980
The Ming emperor

446
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,109
doubted his last remaining loyal subject

447
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,361
and cruelly tortured him to death.

448
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,532
Who would risk their life
and fight for such an emperor?

449
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,621
Joseon.

450
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:01,459
The dutiful bachelors
of Joseon will go out and fight.

451
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,797
But what will these brave scholars here

452
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,551
fight with once a war breaks out?

453
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,888
Will they build fortresses with brushes?

454
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,268
Will they grind ink and make swords?

455
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,730
-How dare he!
-What a thing to say.

456
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,441
Why, you…

457
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,234
-My goodness.
-He is hopeless.

458
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,571
-My goodness.
-How dare he speak like that?

459
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,573
How insolent.

460
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,618
My gosh.

461
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,119
-How rude.
-He is uneducated.

462
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,079
-How dare he?
-Unbelievable.

463
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,998
Why, he…

464
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,296
Who is he to talk like that
to Young Master Yeon-jun?

465
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,512
I heard rumors that he is very uncouth.

466
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:58,182
He visited our village
over a month ago to buy persimmons…

467
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,517
ONE MONTH AGO

468
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,685
The feng shui here is immaculate.

469
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,188
Do you even know what that means?

470
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,232
You are always getting
kicked out of academies.

471
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,652
Just tell me about the place you found.

472
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,320
Right.

473
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,448
It is said that Neunggun-ri

474
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,450
has good sikhye, tasty persimmons,

475
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,702
and great bamboo shoot liquor.

476
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,579
The village elders are kind

477
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,498
and loved by the people,

478
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,917
so the state does not interfere.

479
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,253
Also, the courtship laws are lax,

480
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,339
so men and women can interact easily.

481
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,175
I knew you would like that.

482
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,218
Perhaps for that reason,

483
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,345
it is home to a notorious creature.

484
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,809
-Creature?
-Yes.

485
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,937
It is a fox with nine tails… No.

486
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,481
A fox with 99 tails.

487
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,875
I came here by following
the bamboo scent of eminent scholarship.

488
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,211
Please be my mentors.

489
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:14,341
He suddenly asked
to be a disciple of our academy.

490
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,926
But our masters told him

491
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:20,723
that only village school graduates
could be accepted as disciples.

492
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,224
And then he said--

493
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:25,436
He would take the exam.

494
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,187
Then, does that mean

495
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,316
he took the academy exam
with all the school children?

496
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,484
Why did you suddenly decide
to take an exam?

497
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,445
It is not as if you will last long here.

498
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,159
You there. What is today's exam about?

499
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:43,287
Please be quiet.

500
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,504
Let us see.

501
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,759
What is today's exam topic?

502
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,802
LOYALTY

503
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,680
Write the meaning of loyalty.

504
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,559
A woman's fidelity to her husband,
a servant's loyalty to their master,

505
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,979
a son's duty to his parents,
and a people's duty to the king.

506
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,360
What are you doing, Young Master?

507
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,197
Jang-hyeon.

508
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:19,865
Jang-hyeon.

509
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,412
This topic is lame.
I will not sit this exam.

510
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,915
He only acts like a noble.

511
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,000
He could not write a single character.

512
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,961
He is definitely not a real nobleman.

513
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:35,089
The rumor is that he is a commoner

514
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,258
who bought a certificate
so he could pass himself off as noble.

515
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,427
Unbelievable.

516
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,262
Do you know what he said after?

517
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,265
"I will pay to enter this academy."

518
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,310
Someone like that should be kicked out.

519
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,812
But he somehow managed

520
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,772
to convince the village elders…

521
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,775
One of them was quick on his feet.

522
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,778
So I said, "Show me."

523
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,697
I stamped on his foot,

524
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:04,326
and he cried, "My goodness!"

525
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,582
I smacked him on the cheek,

526
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,543
and he exclaimed,

527
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,878
"Please have mercy!"

528
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:25,806
You tried to kick out someone
who wanted to learn at the academy?

529
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,350
Who knew our community was so heartless?

530
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,145
How could you kick out someone
who wanted to learn?

531
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,771
-How cruel.
-What is this?

532
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,399
-How arrogant.
-How could you?

533
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,984
So cruel.

534
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,361
Goodness.

535
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:44,825
He even convinced old man Song-chu.

536
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,703
You all know, right?

537
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:50,289
You know how bad
old man Song-chu's temper is.

538
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,374
-Hey.
-Young Master!

539
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,794
Are you blind?

540
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,839
Can you not see us working hard
to start a fire here?

541
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,675
Please do not get angry. I am sorry.

542
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,304
Darn it. I give up.

543
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,722
Goodness.

544
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,769
But that Lee Jang-hyeon has

545
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,481
moved into old man Song-chu's house

546
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,816
and is bossing him around like a servant.

547
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,444
Let us play

548
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:23,405
While we are young

549
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:27,451
Before we get too old

550
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:32,414
Hooray, let us play

551
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,254
But how did a man with no title

552
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,006
come to be so rich?

553
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,800
I heard he made a fortune by selling
persimmons and cigarettes

554
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,511
to the Jin barbarians.

555
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,930
He associates with the barbarians?

556
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,139
That is what I am saying.

557
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,142
I did not want to say this,

558
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,270
but I saw him when I went
to buy my mother's medicine once.

559
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,993
He embraced them like this.
Like this. Like this.

560
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,038
He rubbed cheeks with the barbarians?

561
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,165
How obscene.

562
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,209
Not only that, but rumors say

563
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,545
he travels the eight provinces
doing business,

564
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,839
and he has a woman in every province.

565
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,511
My gosh.

566
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,096
But what is more absurd

567
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,140
is that after he earns their favor
by giving them gifts…

568
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,655
Take it.

569
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,241
Open it.

570
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,125
Ribbons with embroidered ends
are the latest craze.

571
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,212
My goodness, how pretty.

572
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:07,259
You must pass
the civil service exam quickly

573
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:09,595
so we may get permission to marry.

574
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:11,930
Marriage?

575
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,560
Do not be too upset.

576
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,397
I would marry you even now,

577
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,275
but my parents refuse to allow--

578
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,821
My lady,

579
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,906
do you love me?

580
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,034
-What?
-I see you do not.

581
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,286
Do I love you?

582
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:35,829
Well,

583
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,415
I do not think I am there yet.

584
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,252
But we have already met three times,

585
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,463
and you have gifted me this.

586
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,966
I even rested my head on your shoulder.

587
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,510
That means we must get married?

588
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,182
I thought you were different.

589
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,602
Listen carefully, my lady.

590
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:02,564
Love is a fleeting emotion.

591
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,858
Humans are shallow.

592
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:08,654
We lack the ability to hold on
to such sacred emotions for long.

593
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:12,699
So, it is foolish to tie each other down

594
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,368
with a bond like marriage.

595
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,620
That is why I decided long ago

596
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,498
to live as a misogamist.

597
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,417
What is a misogamist?

598
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,461
"Miso" means hatred,

599
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,171
and "gamous" means marriage.

600
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,675
Basically, I have decided
to never get married.

601
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:34,012
Then, why have you been seeing me?

602
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,185
Can a man and woman only meet
for the sake of marriage?

603
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,984
Brother!

604
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,486
This man

605
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:52,155
has trifled with my affections!

606
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,283
Your words are too harsh.

607
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,868
-Hey!
-Why, you…

608
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,704
Who are those people?

609
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,206
I told you not to talk
about your misogamy.

610
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,041
-Goodness.
-Get him.

611
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,752
-You rascal!
-Come here!

612
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:09,131
He goes around talking about misogamy.

613
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,674
-Misogamy?
-What is that?

614
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:13,301
-Does he mean he cannot get married?
-Why would he not marry?

615
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,928
What reason could he have?

616
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,057
He must be lacking something.

617
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,393
Maybe he is lacking in the bedroom, or--

618
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,520
My lady.

619
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,244
Now is not the time
to talk about the barbarians.

620
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:42,873
We have to stop Lee Jang-hyeon
from tainting our academy.

621
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,500
But he said he would supply us rice.

622
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,421
You want us to accept him
in exchange for rice?

623
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,631
He dared to say that the Great Ming

624
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,550
could lose to the Jin barbarians.

625
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,927
Is someone talking about me?

626
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,726
Someone is probably bad-mouthing you.

627
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,061
You attract criticism wherever you go.

628
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,689
You will surely live until you are senile.

629
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,861
Did you really offer money
to enter the academy?

630
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:21,787
How embarrassing, how embarrassing.

631
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,250
This one. Yes.

632
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,382
I do not think

633
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,760
he would be lacking in the bedroom.

634
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,553
He has an impressive stature--

635
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,263
That is not all.

636
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,433
He was so fierce
when he confronted those men.

637
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:50,649
-As if they were deer and he was…
-A predator?

638
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,108
No, a beast.

639
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,364
-A beast?
-His gaze was so intense.

640
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,741
How boring.

641
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,702
Are you going to talk
about that misogamist all day?

642
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,079
I am off

643
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,081
to ride a swing.

644
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,290
Come along, Jong-jong.

645
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,006
That sly little…

646
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,355
You have heard the rumor too, right?

647
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:35,485
Down there in Namwon or whatnot,
a man named Lee Mong-ryong,

648
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,821
who passed the civil service exam,

649
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:41,408
fell for and married Chun-hyang,
a kisaeng's daughter.

650
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,118
Of course, I heard the rumors.

651
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,079
But such a thing could never
happen to a kisaeng's daughter.

652
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,289
Why not?

653
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,876
Anyway, do you know
why he fell in love with her?

654
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,628
Did not their eyes meet when she was

655
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,213
on a swing or something?

656
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,090
So, why do you think he fell in love

657
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,967
when he saw her on the swing?

658
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:17,068
My goodness. What are you doing?

659
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,321
If I ride this swing,
my skirt will ride up,

660
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,865
and my underskirt will show
ever so slightly.

661
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:22,866
If I am lucky,

662
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,285
my skin will peep out a little too.

663
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,454
The men will get so flustered.

664
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,540
That is why socks are so important.

665
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,509
Jong-jong. Let us do this.

666
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,701
I cannot bear to watch.

667
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:31,393
Gu-jam. Who is that woman over there?

668
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,607
That is the Neunggun-ri fox
with the 99 tails.

669
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,653
Is that so?

670
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,290
I am full, so I will take a walk.

671
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,459
Gosh, I am full.

672
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:04,426
We should tell our masters

673
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:08,221
that we absolutely cannot let
Lee Jang-hyeon into the academy.

674
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,140
We should tell…

675
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,226
We should tell…

676
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,409
Oh, no. I think…

677
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,453
I think an accident…

678
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,958
-An accident?
-What is going on?

679
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,715
Where is everyone going?

680
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,800
They went to help someone who is injured.

681
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,845
Lady Gil-chae was on the swing, and…

682
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,805
Then you should hurry over.

683
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:56,519
She shall have
plenty of help even without us.

684
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,573
-Over there.
-Lady Gil-chae.

685
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:11,201
-Lady Gil-chae.
-Lady Gil-chae.

686
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,207
The seat of the swing became loose…

687
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:22,504
What a rude swing.

688
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,339
Let us fix it.

689
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,965
Come on.

690
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,470
Lift it.

691
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,433
Is everyone here?

692
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,602
Of course, we ran here.

693
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,062
You almost got hurt.

694
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,980
No, I meant…

695
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:47,320
-Are you done?
-No, it still needs fixing.

696
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:48,530
Are you hurt--

697
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,281
Move. I must get back on.

698
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,117
-My goodness.
-Lady Gil-chae.

699
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,079
-My goodness.
-Be careful.

700
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,339
As you know,

701
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:09,092
I have seen countless women
during my travels.

702
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,177
Some had pretty faces,
others had delicate hands.

703
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,513
Some had thin waists,
others had slender wrists.

704
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,765
Some had clear voices,
others had good hearts.

705
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,435
Some chased after men,
and others were chased by men.

706
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,353
That is not all.

707
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,313
I have met Jeolla's Yang Guifei,

708
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,233
Pyongyang's Xi Shi,
and even Gyeongsang's Diaochan.

709
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,609
They were all

710
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,362
fancy on the outside
but empty on the inside.

711
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,197
Yes, I am sure.

712
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,494
What did you eat?

713
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,871
So, my point is

714
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:44,335
that even the Neunggun-ri woman
with 99 tails cannot impress me.

715
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:54,137
But since you went
to the trouble of warning me,

716
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,680
I must check her out myself.

717
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:56,723
However,

718
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:58,600
I do not expect much.

719
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:02,562
I am sure you know, but I am rather picky.

720
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,190
The type of woman I am looking for…

721
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:20,955
You asked me once

722
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:26,002
what I was thinking about
that day on the swing.

723
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,215
I told you I did not remember,

724
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,800
but I remember vividly.

725
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,094
That day,

726
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:39,807
I sensed that the man
from my dreams would show up.

727
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,770
So, everything before me

728
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,813
seemed to sparkle

729
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,983
ever so brightly.

730
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:56,199
One day, I asked you

731
00:58:57,575 --> 00:59:00,328
if you remembered
the first time you saw me.

732
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:04,123
You said, "Of course."

733
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:09,045
"I heard a curious sound that day."

734
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,883
I asked, "What did you hear?"

735
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,054
Do you hear it?

736
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:21,933
The sound…

737
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,272
The sound of flowers.

738
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,107
What?

739
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,985
What sound can flowers make?

740
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:03,266
Have you ever heard the sound
of flowers blooming?

741
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:05,977
Today,

742
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,147
I heard that rare and precious sound.

743
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:47,935
Were you waiting for me?

744
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:50,355
You smiled at me
earlier today, did you not?

745
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,273
All the men you have met

746
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:55,318
get flustered
when you throw them a glance.

747
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,736
But I am different.

748
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,281
I want to know
what they find attractive in a partner.

749
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:04,202
You know I am a misogamist.

750
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,913
Then what was the meaning
of those looks you gave me

751
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,915
and your sweet words?

752
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,626
I am leaving tomorrow.
I may be away for a few months.

753
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:14,379
Today, I will make
an offer he cannot refuse.

754
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,506
I will kiss him.

755
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:32,980
