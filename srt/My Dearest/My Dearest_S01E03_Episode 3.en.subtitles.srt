1
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,771
Your Majesty!

2
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,106
Your Majesty!

3
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,462
The barbarians…

4
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,049
The barbarians have invaded!

5
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,927
They have

6
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,430
imprisoned the king!

7
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,349
Barbarians?

8
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,268
That is preposterous. Are they back?

9
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,354
-My goodness.
-Oh, no.

10
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,939
Is it true, Soon-yak?

11
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,194
His Majesty…

12
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,956
Does this mean we are at war?

13
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,992
Goodness.

14
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,925
Since they are saying we are at war,

15
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,094
I am not sure we should be doing this.

16
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,597
The barbarians have His Majesty confined,

17
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,057
and it will be a while
before trouble reaches here.

18
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,643
Today is a special day for you,

19
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,855
so enjoy this sweet persimmon and rest.

20
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:10,857
Goodness.

21
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,152
You could consummate
as if this were your wedding night.

22
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:17,071
How could we when a war is waging?

23
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,162
Young Master Jang-hyun.

24
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,958
Why are you being so nice to me?

25
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,255
Because you deserve it.

26
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,653
Now that the barbarians
have invaded our land,

27
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,613
the nation will fall.

28
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:02,075
The foundation of the state will collapse.

29
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,701
Close your doors.

30
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,412
Ladies, cover your faces and hide.

31
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,165
Men, take up arms.

32
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:13,544
Ladies, cover your faces and hide.

33
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:17,632
Ladies, cover your faces and hide!

34
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,514
Father.

35
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,391
Father!

36
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,477
Father!

37
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,438
Father!

38
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,441
Father!

39
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,530
Father!

40
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,657
Father!

41
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,410
Please.

42
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,954
Father, please.

43
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,207
Father! Father!

44
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,378
Father!

45
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,381
Father!

46
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,759
Father!

47
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,219
What is wrong?

48
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,910
What did you see

49
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,872
that made you so startled?

50
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,844
So, a war finally broke out.

51
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,764
What will you do?

52
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,766
What can I do but run?

53
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,102
Lee Jang-hyun will choose to run?

54
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,813
I am not made out of steel.

55
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,193
But do you not think the barbarians

56
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,987
will retreat after just a few days

57
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,739
like the last time they invaded?

58
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,741
I do not know.

59
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,203
Unlike before, they are holding
His Majesty captive.

60
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:16,542
Their leader declared himself an emperor.

61
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,836
How can you smile when we are at war?

62
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,172
Goodness.

63
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:25,343
It is not like the war will end if I cry.

64
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,862
No one can carry a tune like you.

65
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,949
Ryang-eum, the world's greatest vocalist.

66
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,619
A once-in-a-century master talent.

67
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:18,813
Is it true that the barbarians
have surrounded Namhansanseong Fortress?

68
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,316
If the barbarians
have truly invaded our land,

69
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,652
His Majesty should have gone
to Ganghwa Island.

70
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,196
Why is he at Namhansanseong Fortress?

71
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,327
I have news from the government office.

72
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,872
The enemy passed Pyongyang
three days ago

73
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,915
and passed Songdo a day after that.

74
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,500
So, His Majesty was pressed for time

75
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,210
and could only make it
to Namhansanseong Fortress.

76
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,754
The barbarians may be fast,

77
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,216
but how could they have made it
to Hanyang in three days?

78
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,720
Is it not just a rumor spread
by those trying to incite public unrest?

79
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,804
It is not.

80
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,016
The Amnok River is likely frozen.

81
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,184
The time line makes sense

82
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,896
if the barbarians
headed straight to Hanyang

83
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,814
without striking other fortresses.

84
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,691
A direct invasion?

85
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,444
Why would they

86
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,197
penetrate the heart of Joseon

87
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,991
without first trying to eliminate
the Joseon soldiers?

88
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,660
Something must have
made it worth the risk.

89
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,455
The king of Joseon.

90
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,459
They have His Majesty surrounded
at Namhansanseong Fortress.

91
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,086
That must have been their main objective.

92
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,884
Receive His Majesty's order!

93
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,637
His Majesty has issued a new decree.

94
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,765
Receive His Majesty's order!

95
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,856
Receive His Majesty's order.

96
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,951
"The men of Jin have
crossed the border and invaded."

97
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,955
"Those who are loyal
will propose strategies,

98
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,916
and courageous scholars will
volunteer their services in battle

99
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,835
to repay the benevolence of our king."

100
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,641
If we are respectful,

101
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,644
I doubt they will treat you with cruelty.

102
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,020
However,

103
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,939
I am not a high-ranking official.

104
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,276
And Lord Neungbong
is not your younger brother.

105
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,695
I am worried they might find out and--

106
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,823
How could they know
who our royalty and high officials are?

107
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,077
Besides, we cannot send
a real prince as they demand.

108
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,792
You were held captive
by the barbarians in 1619.

109
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,920
The Jin people were
so impressed by your spirit

110
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,339
that they treated you with respect.

111
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,802
I trust you will do well once again.

112
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,473
Of course.

113
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,191
It has been a while.

114
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,489
Yes.

115
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,866
It has been a while.

116
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,081
Are you

117
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,417
the younger brother of the king of Joseon?

118
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,088
He is asking if you are
His Majesty's brother.

119
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,010
High official?

120
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,304
He is asking if you are a high official.

121
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,098
I am.

122
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,228
I will only ask once.

123
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,481
Do not deceive me.

124
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,067
Are they really
the king's brother and a high official?

125
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,780
Yes.

126
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:59,325
I assure you, they are
the king's brother and a high official--

127
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,416
You two will head back

128
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,502
and tell the king…

129
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,672
that this time around…

130
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,968
This time,

131
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:24,100
they have demanded
the crown prince as their hostage.

132
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,185
Such insolence!

133
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,397
How dare you speak of His Royal Highness?

134
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,441
Your Majesty, you cannot.

135
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,985
You cannot, Your Majesty!

136
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,323
You cannot, Your Majesty!

137
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,868
You cannot, Your Majesty!

138
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,831
You cannot, Your Majesty!

139
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,968
Who exactly are you, Young Master?

140
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,180
Since you seem to want it so,

141
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,058
would you like

142
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,979
to lock lips with me today?

143
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,667
Why on earth is everyone gathering?

144
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,407
His Majesty is being held captive.

145
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,035
The mighty leader of Joseon

146
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,663
is asking for the assistance
of righteous men.

147
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,666
People of Joseon,

148
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,420
it is time for you to prove your worth.

149
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,590
Let us rescue our king.

150
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:25,262
Let the world witness your loyalty!

151
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,933
His voice carries well.

152
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,352
He would have been a talented singer.

153
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,979
When have you seen nobles
learn how to sing?

154
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,481
It is only for the lowly.

155
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,609
Then, you should try your hand at it.

156
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,195
I will teach you as a fellow lowlife.

157
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,279
What did you say?

158
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,930
Lady Eun-ae, why will you not stop crying?

159
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,934
Seeing you cry makes me cry.

160
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,227
Do not mind me.

161
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,482
What is she up to this time?

162
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,656
Why are you crying?

163
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,618
What is it to you?

164
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,371
I am curious why you are crying.

165
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:38,669
Let the world witness your loyalty!

166
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,632
He must be shouting
at the top of his lungs to rally soldiers.

167
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,135
Of course.

168
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,847
Unlike someone I know,
he is not a wimp who will run and hide.

169
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:51,974
Goodness.

170
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,977
How did you know I was planning to flee?

171
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,398
It is written on that ugly face of yours

172
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,066
that you could not care less
about the nation

173
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,319
as long as you can live comfortably.

174
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,406
I am a great judge of character.

175
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,075
I knew you were shrewd enough
to deserve to be my woman--

176
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,286
Those with burning hearts, step forward.

177
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,582
Those who are fiercely loyal,
step forward.

178
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,334
I will go.

179
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,546
Anyone else?

180
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,714
I shall go too!

181
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:24,882
Same here.

182
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,050
-Me too.
-I shall also go.

183
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,801
-Same here.
-Me too.

184
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,554
No, do not dare.

185
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,680
Why not?

186
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,806
I shall go as well!

187
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,226
Hold your horses, little one.

188
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,900
What about you?

189
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,953
I will…

190
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,039
I…

191
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,126
I have no intention
of joining the righteous army.

192
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,797
He has no morals!

193
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,343
Listen here.

194
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,887
It is an army for the righteous.

195
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,015
One must volunteer out of righteousness

196
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,392
and cannot be forced.

197
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,313
Some may not be
healthy enough to fight a war.

198
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,440
My body and spirit are perfectly healthy.

199
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,237
However, I am curious.

200
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,157
The king fled and left his people behind.

201
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,242
So, why

202
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,412
should the people save him?

203
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,170
It is to protect
the foundation of our nation.

204
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,466
Did the king do that by fleeing first

205
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,302
-at the sight of danger?
-You…

206
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,138
-What would you know?
-How dare you?

207
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,682
That pathetic fool
does not know any better.

208
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,933
He is truly pathetic.

209
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,769
One must fulfill his duty.

210
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,522
I simply cannot understand it.

211
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,984
But go ahead
and try your best to save His Majesty.

212
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,320
Why, that little…

213
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,498
Even that little boy
raised his hand and volunteered…

214
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,459
I commend your audacity.

215
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,056
I am worried about what they will wear
for battle in the winter.

216
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,685
What if we donate 600 grams
of cotton to make padded clothes?

217
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,395
That sounds like a great idea.

218
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,607
I will make thick padded clothes
for Young Master Jun-jeol

219
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,401
and embroider my name on the collar.

220
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,071
I will sew a talisman wrapped in a towel

221
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,198
onto the inside
of Young Master Dae-oh's shirt.

222
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,532
-One that will prevent death?
-No.

223
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,785
-One that prevents infidelity.
-Goodness.

224
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,661
-Is there such a talisman?
-Of course.

225
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,207
I should also embroider my name
on Young Master Yeon-jun's…

226
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,888
Are you really going to flee
while all the others fight?

227
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,223
That is what I said.

228
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,600
They are my favorite clothes,
so wrap them with care.

229
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,436
Unbelievable.

230
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,818
As a man, one should ride a horse
into battle and wield a sword.

231
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,780
You fool.
Do you think fighting in a battle is fun?

232
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,282
You will be teaching
evil bastards a lesson.

233
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,743
Do you think the barbarians invaded us
because they are evil?

234
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,120
Are they not?

235
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,497
They invade foreign lands
and harm the people.

236
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,165
Can you call that honorable?

237
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,628
I guess not.

238
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,964
However,

239
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,634
who will be left in the villages

240
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,053
if all the men join the war?

241
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,097
Well,

242
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:04,059
the elderly, the young, and the women.

243
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,945
This will not do.

244
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,321
Wait for me here.

245
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,657
Where the heck are you going?

246
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,201
-Young-chae, I am off.
-Sure.

247
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,703
-Write to me.
-I will.

248
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,873
Gosh, it is freezing.

249
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,627
See you.

250
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,004
Take care.

251
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,767
My lady.

252
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,604
We meet again.

253
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,191
I thought you would have fled by now.

254
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,692
I will set out soon.

255
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,779
Do not be like that…

256
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,534
and flee with me.

257
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,660
What?

258
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,335
If we hide down south
further away from the fortress--

259
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,128
I do not intend to flee,

260
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,963
so flee all you want by yourself.

261
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,258
One could die.

262
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,263
I mean the righteous army men.

263
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,561
You are the one who should be careful.

264
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,396
You could break your nose while fleeing.

265
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,150
My righteous Young Master Yeon-jun
will defeat the barbarians and--

266
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,361
Have you ever seen a barbarian before?

267
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,030
-Well…
-You have not.

268
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,076
The barbarians have never
come this far south before.

269
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,328
So, what could you know

270
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,413
about barbarians?

271
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,919
Did you hear they were uncivilized people

272
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,172
who ate the flesh
and drank the blood of live animals

273
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,216
without any rules regarding men and women?

274
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,717
Is that not true?

275
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,346
They do eat the flesh
and drink the blood of live animals.

276
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,306
However,

277
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,102
did you also know
they are such well-trained warriors

278
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,813
that they can eat and sleep on horseback?

279
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,986
They are poor at farming
and cannot even tell pen from paper.

280
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,990
But even though
they cannot read or write…

281
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,828
they know how to kill people.

282
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,794
That smart Young Master Yeon-jun of yours…

283
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,965
The same young master
who spends all his time

284
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:44,386
reading at his desk
and worrying about the nation.

285
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,973
His loyalty is admirable, but do you think

286
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,768
he could harm even a hair
on a barbarian's head?

287
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,941
No, wait.

288
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,946
Do you really think
he could survive a fight…

289
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,743
against an army of trained assassins?

290
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,833
Though they cannot read or write,

291
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,044
they know how to kill people.

292
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,215
Do you really think
he could survive a fight

293
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,593
against an army of trained assassins?

294
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,353
Lady Gil-chae.

295
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,897
What brings you here?

296
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,733
Are the preparations going well?

297
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,026
They are.

298
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,113
Our weapons are rusty,
and we are not well-trained,

299
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,657
so we decided to set out
after a few days of training.

300
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,369
But most importantly,
we need armor and horses.

301
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,496
Please do not join the volunteer army.

302
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,083
Pardon?

303
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:44,256
The warriors of Qing
are said to be trained killers.

304
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,633
With just one brandish of a spear,

305
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,844
they leave five to six bodies
in their wake.

306
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,557
You have spent more time
reading than shooting arrows.

307
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,143
You are a tender soul
who cannot even kill a bird.

308
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,355
If you go to battle against those
brutal barbarians, you might…

309
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,235
I might die.

310
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:10,448
However, His Majesty is being held captive
at Namhansanseong Fortress.

311
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,869
The people of Joseon
only have two choices.

312
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,163
We can either live as cowards

313
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,958
or die doing the right thing.

314
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,509
But…

315
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,137
We must stop him.

316
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,640
The Qing warriors are so nimble
and ruthless that our scholars--

317
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,517
They will not be a match for them.

318
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,852
Wait.

319
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,563
Are you saying you knew
Young Master Yeon-jun could die

320
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,648
but still did not stop him?

321
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,775
Power is not the only way to win a battle.

322
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,404
He is fiercely loyal and resourceful, so--

323
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:53,074
The barbarians are also resourceful
and loyal to their leader.

324
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,577
Young Master Yeon-jun
studied his whole life

325
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,704
to fulfill his duties as a man of honor.

326
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,749
He would never
turn his back on this nation.

327
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,543
Sure, it is great to be a man of honor

328
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,171
who serves the people
and is loyal to his king.

329
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,840
But I could care less about His Majesty.

330
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:09,925
Gil-chae!

331
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,551
However,

332
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:15,472
when I think of the barbarians
shooting arrows into our men's hearts

333
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:18,058
and breaking their bones with spears…

334
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,105
Will you let Young Master Yeon-jun die?

335
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,170
You are right.

336
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,632
Everything you said is true.

337
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,802
Young Master Yeon-jun could die.

338
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,971
I might never get to see him again.

339
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,746
That is it. You are doing great.

340
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,832
Keep it up.

341
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,919
What are they talking about?

342
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:35,260
Good. She got through to him.

343
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,557
Eun-ae.

344
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,726
Gil-chae.

345
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,312
How did it go?

346
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,940
Then, he will not join the troops--

347
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,900
Before he departs for battle,

348
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,320
he will marry me.

349
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,698
What?

350
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,700
Marry you?

351
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,411
You were right.

352
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,913
Young Master Yeon-jun could die.

353
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,833
I could not let him leave me
without first tying the knot.

354
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,463
I owe it all to you.

355
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,769
What now?

356
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,897
Please stop crying.

357
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,232
Crying will only make your eyes ugly.

358
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,903
They will not go through
with the wedding, will they?

359
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,199
Young Master Yeon-jun
never goes back on his word.

360
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,743
No, wait.

361
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,204
It is Lady Eun-ae who does
what she sets her mind to.

362
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,582
What do I do?

363
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,210
It is your fault for urging her.

364
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,920
Be quiet!

365
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,922
I urged her to stop him
from going to battle,

366
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,590
not to secure a proposal.

367
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,593
Why does it have to be Eun-ae?

368
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,638
Why is it Eun-ae and not me?

369
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,181
That is because you are too--

370
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,432
Too what?

371
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,560
You know better than anyone

372
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,562
that men lose interest in a woman
once they win her over

373
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,023
and get easily tired of women
who chase after them.

374
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,698
Yes, you are right.

375
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,453
Right? It is about time
you forgot about him--

376
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,039
Young Master Yeon-jun
has not considered

377
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,166
that I could marry someone else.

378
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:39,050
If he hears that I plan
to marry someone else,

379
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,261
he will realize how much he loves me.

380
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,847
He will end up kneeling before me

381
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,683
and confessing that I am
the only one he loves.

382
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,062
I will pretend to give in reluctantly,
help him to his feet,

383
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,983
and tell him that I feel the same way…

384
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,152
My lady!

385
00:28:58,862 --> 00:28:59,904
What?

386
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,251
Lady Gil-chae.

387
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,795
Why did you ask to see me?

388
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,679
Are the preparations
for battle going well?

389
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,264
Yes.

390
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,933
I will snap off the head
of a barbarian with this hand

391
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,143
and bring it to you.

392
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,311
Please stop.

393
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,979
I do not wish to talk
of such scary things.

394
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,607
Gosh, I apologize.

395
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,193
But I feel reassured to know

396
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,153
that you will be fighting the barbarians.

397
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,321
Thank you.

398
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,574
I am the one who is grateful.

399
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:48,661
But I must say I am upset.

400
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:51,581
Pardon? Why is that?

401
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:55,585
Did not the elders of our families

402
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:59,547
once speak of a marriage between us?

403
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,133
The elders got ahead of themselves.

404
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,845
You could not possibly love
a talentless scholar like me.

405
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,097
Young Master Yeon-jun
will show his devotion to Eun-ae

406
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:10,183
by marrying her before leaving for battle.

407
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,603
How can you be this cruel?

408
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,315
My lady.

409
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,284
-Goodness.
-Hold on.

410
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,870
-Gosh, thank you.
-Thank you.

411
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,172
Dig in.

412
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,715
Eat up.

413
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,471
Oh, heavens!

414
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,517
In a few days, this humble man

415
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,561
will depart for battle
to save His Majesty.

416
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,273
Before I go,

417
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,942
I only ask for one thing.

418
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,027
Stop it.

419
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,947
Do not worry about me and your mom.

420
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:07,824
Yes, sit down.

421
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,617
What is this?

422
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,994
Lady Gil-chae,

423
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,454
marry me.

424
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:15,999
-Goodness.
-What?

425
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,959
Goodness me.

426
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:34,225
How could you ask that
in front of all these people?

427
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,897
That is because I am not ashamed
to confess what is in my heart.

428
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,108
If someone asks me what I am proudest of,

429
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,028
it is being brave enough to do this.

430
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,404
Soon-yak, you fool!

431
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,365
Why are you making a fool of yourself
in front of everyone?

432
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,200
-Father!
-What…

433
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,411
This is the only thing I want.

434
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,790
Will you deny
the final request of your son,

435
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:02,086
who could die out on the battlefield?

436
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,630
-My gosh.
-Honey!

437
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,302
-Wait.
-Oh, dear.

438
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,131
Marry me.

439
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,766
A marriage?

440
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,771
You will marry out of spite?

441
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,359
What is it to you?

442
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,152
That clueless Soon-yak

443
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,364
would not have proposed
so dramatically for no reason.

444
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,201
Do you think this will change
Young Master Yeon-jun's mind?

445
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,792
Young Master Yeon-jun

446
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,586
is a calculating man.

447
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:31,050
He may have acted interested in you,
but he has no intention of marrying you.

448
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,343
Do you know why?

449
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:38,891
Because he does not have the guts
to handle a woman of bad repute like you.

450
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,394
He is too weak-hearted

451
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:46,190
to handle a woman like you.

452
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,191
What?

453
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,070
Young Master Yeon-jun
is calculating and weak-hearted?

454
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,782
That is rich coming from a man
who is fleeing to save his skin.

455
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,325
How dare you speak ill of a man

456
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,495
who is risking his life
to save His Majesty and the people.

457
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,873
If you ever

458
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,501
speak of him again
with that detestable mouth of yours,

459
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:09,130
I will grind that ugly face of yours
into powder.

460
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:19,015
Is that not a little harsh?

461
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:25,021
What? Young Master Yeon-jun
is calculating and weak-hearted?

462
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,647
I have a bad reputation?

463
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,400
You do not have the best reputation.

464
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,986
Whatever.

465
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,115
You are behaving oddly if you ask me.

466
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,034
Whenever Young Master Jang-hyun
says something,

467
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,495
you always respond more than necessary.

468
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,748
You do not let the other young masters
even get near you.

469
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,751
When did I ever do that?
I have never behaved like that.

470
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,045
Unbelievable.

471
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:01,307
Gil-chae.

472
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,728
Are you going to marry
Young Master Soon-yak?

473
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,898
I am not sure.

474
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,441
The truth is,

475
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,361
I thought you harbored feelings
for another man.

476
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,951
Me? Which man?

477
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,786
At the wedding anniversary banquet,

478
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,872
we were all shocked to hear
a war had broken out.

479
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,707
Yes, we were.

480
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,586
Do you know who you looked
at as soon as you heard?

481
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,674
I am not sure I recall.

482
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:39,470
I believed he was the one
you had feelings for.

483
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,559
I actually asked you here
on behalf of Young Master Soon-yak.

484
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,852
He will be here soon.

485
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,359
Normally,

486
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,862
one must be picky
about choosing a wedding date.

487
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,865
But our options are limited
due to the war.

488
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,075
That being said, Gil-chae,

489
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:06,247
do you intend to marry Young Master
Soon-yak before he heads for battle?

490
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:24,015
Young Master Soon-yak is the man
my parents wanted me to marry, so…

491
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,812
My lady!

492
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,238
Then,
why do we not have a joint wedding?

493
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,450
What do you think, Young Master?

494
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,416
It is a fine idea.

495
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,644
My lady.

496
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,065
He is heartless.

497
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,651
He is truly heartless.

498
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,052
Wipe those tears.

499
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,597
Cold wind on a damp face
will ruin your skin.

500
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,862
Are you that upset
Young Master Yeon-jun is marrying?

501
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,202
Our country falls and the king is captive,
but this is what saddens you?

502
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,623
That is right. This saddens me more
than our nation being ruined.

503
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:16,335
I am not even afraid of dying in the war.

504
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:26,721
You do not fear death?
I see it is hopeless.

505
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,938
Then stop him from getting married.

506
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,900
I am in this mess
because I cannot do that.

507
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,030
Do you want my help?

508
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:49,577
My lady, if I help you,
what will you do for me in return?

509
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,246
How could you possibly stop the wedding?

510
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,832
Stop teasing me, and be on your way.

511
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,208
Get lost.

512
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,562
I heard you were having trouble
gathering armor and weapons.

513
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:19,732
The weapons we procured
during the first Jin invasion

514
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,984
ten years ago are rusty and old.

515
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,904
We have been repairing them, but…

516
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,572
I could help.

517
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,910
I bought some armor and weapons
a few months ago.

518
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,953
You purchased weapons?

519
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,373
I had a hunch as a merchant.

520
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,626
Since I do business with the barbarians,

521
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:43,089
I had a hunch that something big
would soon go down.

522
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,258
I knew that if a war broke out,

523
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:50,137
the people would have to obtain
weapons and armor on their own,

524
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,348
which meant I could make a big profit.

525
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,892
You are supposedly a nobleman,

526
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,602
but you have devoted your life
to making money.

527
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,230
You knew the nation was at risk,

528
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,856
and all you thought about
was making a profit?

529
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,650
There is nothing noble about you.

530
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,904
We have shamelessly

531
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,325
failed to repay you for the rice
you donated to our academy.

532
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,119
Is there a condition this time, too?

533
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:19,250
In exchange for the rice,
the academy took you in.

534
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,919
I am sure you will not
give us the weapons for free.

535
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,004
Finally,

536
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,631
we understand each other.

537
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,009
I hear that many

538
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,179
are rushing to get married
before the righteous army departs.

539
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,516
What do you say to delaying the weddings?

540
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,770
If the men die on the battlefield…

541
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,481
How dare you?

542
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,109
You are going to fight a war.

543
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,947
Should you not be prepared to die?

544
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,455
If a man's wife dies,

545
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,915
he can take on a new wife

546
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,793
without his children suffering
any consequences.

547
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,380
However, if a widow remarries,

548
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,009
her children are prohibited
from taking the state exam,

549
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,136
so they can never hold office.

550
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,305
In other words,

551
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,350
a husband's life continues
after his wife dies,

552
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:24,356
but the life of a woman
ends with the death of her husband.

553
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:31,113
Please consider the future
of the young ladies of this village.

554
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,784
They are beloved daughters
who were raised preciously.

555
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:40,623
Are you really willing
to put their futures at risk?

556
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,239
Lady Gil-chae.

557
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,908
I will soon be leaving.

558
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,786
Before I leave,

559
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,413
there is something I have decided

560
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,499
because of how much you mean to me.

561
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,253
What would that decision be?

562
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,881
We will not marry.

563
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,259
Pardon?

564
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,846
A husband's life continues
after his wife dies,

565
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,724
but the life of a woman

566
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,435
ends with the death of her husband.

567
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,564
That is why no man in this village

568
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:50,526
will marry anyone
before leaving to fight the war.

569
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,656
"No man"? That means…

570
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,875
So, Lady Gil-chae…

571
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,377
My lady?

572
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,421
Lady Gil-chae!

573
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,592
But Young Master, I…

574
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,474
I was wrong about Lee Jang-hyun.

575
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:25,894
He is more thoughtful than he seems.

576
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,229
But…

577
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,274
Instead,

578
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,528
I will keep you in my heart.

579
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,937
It is all right.

580
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,441
At least they are not getting married.

581
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,861
That is more than enough.

582
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,308
Tell Young Master Soon-yak
I wish to see him.

583
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,519
Again? For what reason?

584
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,791
My lady.

585
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,420
Jong-jong is watching.

586
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:22,970
You are the best archer in Neunggun-ri
and a skilled swordsman, are you not?

587
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,681
No one here is as valiant as you.

588
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,933
I guess…

589
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,312
Eun-ae

590
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,941
is deeply concerned
about Young Master Yeon-jun's safety.

591
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:40,112
That is why I ask
that you stay by his side,

592
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,614
for Eun-ae's sake.

593
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,289
If you were to protect him
with these broad shoulders…

594
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,207
Lady Gil-chae.

595
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,626
My friend, Eun-ae,
would deeply appreciate it,

596
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,628
and so would I.

597
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:58,881
Then…

598
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,133
Then?

599
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:06,305
Once you are back, the two of us alone…

600
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,848
The two of us alone?

601
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,269
-Without Jong-jong.
-Without Jong-jong?

602
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,820
It shall happen. I will make sure of it.

603
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,620
My lady.

604
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,090
Farewells should be kept short.

605
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:43,592
Jong-jong.

606
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,636
He will not wed, right?

607
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,724
Do you only follow me around?

608
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:57,105
Do you not have something for me?
Maybe a token of your gratitude.

609
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,816
What nonsense are you talking about?

610
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,195
Do you still see me
as a vulgar, narrow-minded,

611
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,239
and ugly piece of rock?

612
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,868
A rock cannot turn into gold,
no matter how many times you ask me.

613
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:16,333
Will I seem less ugly to you
if I help save the people?

614
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,507
You promised Soon-yak something

615
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:27,302
in return for protecting Yeon-jun
out on the battlefield.

616
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,597
Something about meeting in private
without Jong-jong.

617
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,891
Were you eavesdropping?

618
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,351
How about this, then?

619
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:39,856
If I am lucky enough to return alive
after helping the people,

620
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,026
kiss me once…

621
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,866
with those precious lips.

622
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,510
Good.

623
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,597
That is how you should react.

624
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,103
If you meet a barbarian

625
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,648
after we depart…

626
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,613
refuse them as harshly
as you did just now.

627
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,168
I shall get going.

628
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,691
Today,

629
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:08,820
I stand here to make a vow
with the people.

630
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,906
I will

631
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,826
defeat the barbarians
who have invaded our land.

632
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:19,498
Hurrah for Joseon!

633
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,377
Hurrah for the land of Joseon!

634
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,446
Did I eat too much
red ginseng candy this morning?

635
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,407
My heart is pounding.

636
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,616
You too?

637
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:56,910
Me too.

638
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,916
Men are all the same.

639
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:07,796
Yesterday, he asked if I would love him
if he helped to save the people.

640
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,508
He must be joining the battle
to win me over.

641
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,885
As if I would bat an eye.

642
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,429
Unbelievable.

643
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,849
Will you be joining the fight?

644
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,642
No.

645
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,269
I am fleeing to safety.

646
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,359
Are you wondering about my armor?

647
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,821
I wore it in case I came across barbarians

648
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,698
while I am on the run.

649
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:42,831
I shall return.

650
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,833
Look after yourself out there.

651
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,501
We will wait for you.

652
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,420
Please leave before I change my mind.

653
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:52,215
Gosh, no one is bidding us farewell
even though we are also leaving.

654
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,218
Who would cry for us
when we are fleeing to safety?

655
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:20,035
They say an item from a woman
will protect you from death.

656
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,746
But we are just fleeing to safety.

657
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,873
Even that can be dangerous.

658
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,211
Goodness.

659
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,463
I am afraid I ran out.

660
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,675
Let me see. Who could give you one?

661
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,305
Soon-yak! Soon-yak!

662
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,849
Please give me a moment.

663
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,816
Do not forget our promise.

664
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,027
Don't worry.
I'll protect Young Master Yeon-jun--

665
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:57,656
You, I mean.
Stay safe. Do you hear me?

666
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,033
Me?

667
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:04,079
Don't worry. I won't even lose
a strand of my hair.

668
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,331
Soon-yak.

669
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:08,917
Father, please.

670
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,223
Gil-chae.

671
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:31,565
Don't you have something
for Young Master Jang-hyun?

672
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,922
I shall be off now.

673
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,551
I have nothing to give
to a rock that is fleeing.

674
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,055
I have something for you.

675
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:06,474
Take it.

676
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,865
As if I would fall
for something like this.

677
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:25,076
Do you give daggers to ladies
in every village you visit?

678
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,411
Forget it.

679
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:27,746
Keep it on you.

680
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,498
Anyway, I have a favor to ask.

681
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:32,334
Look over there.

682
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,880
If you see smoke on that hill,

683
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,133
promise to flee the village
and head to safety.

684
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,011
Why would we flee
when the men will protect us?

685
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,806
Besides, it will not be an easy task
for this many people to flee.

686
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,226
-Bang-doo's baby is due soon, and--
-Then flee by yourself.

687
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,188
I do not care about the others anyway.

688
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,651
You must keep this promise.

689
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,866
What did you receive from her?

690
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,036
She did not have anything for me.

691
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,332
But I appreciate how kind you are being,

692
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,085
even though I am
just someone passing through.

693
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,505
You saved our village.

694
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:22,968
Besides, we might have
a closer relationship in the future.

695
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,846
What do you mean by that?

696
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,474
You are fond of Gil-chae.

697
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:37,357
Fond of her? Gosh, no.

698
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,861
Gil-chae and I grew up together.

699
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,780
I know her well.

700
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,951
I might even know her
better than she knows herself.

701
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:53,248
I also know who she harbors feelings for.

702
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,502
Do you know how I know?

703
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,090
Women…

704
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:05,969
Actually, it is the same for all people.

705
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:10,807
Like children seeking their moms,
when we are terrified or scared,

706
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,684
we turn to those we rely on.

707
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:19,482
When I heard about the war on the day
of the wedding anniversary banquet,

708
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,027
I immediately looked
to Young Master Yeon-jun.

709
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:26,406
I also happened to see
who Gil-chae was looking at.

710
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,327
Stay safe.

711
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,747
And return safely.

712
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:38,835
Gil-chae and I will both
be waiting for you.

713
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:45,759
-Goodbye.
-Good luck.

714
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,512
Stay safe!

715
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,181
Take care.

716
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:22,754
How can Young Master Yeon-jun
look that good in armor?

717
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,926
-Young Master Jang-hyun provided it.
-What?

718
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,345
But in return, he asked
for something peculiar.

719
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,347
What was it?

720
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,934
He requested the men
not to marry before leaving for battle.

721
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,561
Are you saying

722
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:42,273
he is the reason
they all decided not to marry?

723
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,733
That is what I said.

724
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,026
I bet

725
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,530
it was to make sure
others stayed single like himself.

726
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,326
Stop him from getting married.

727
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,162
Do you want my help?

728
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:04,629
Do you know who you looked
at as soon as you heard?

729
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:09,926
I looked

730
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,303
at that rock?

731
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,700
What is on your mind?

732
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,830
At Song-chu's wedding anniversary banquet,

733
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:44,252
did you see who Lady Gil-chae looked
at when we heard about the war?

734
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,172
They have

735
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:50,258
imprisoned the king!

736
00:57:58,516 --> 00:57:59,893
She looked at Young Master Yeon-jun.

737
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,566
I knew it.

738
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,380
Look over there.

739
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:39,933
I hear you are from Neunggun-ri.

740
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:42,393
Yes, we received His Majesty's order.

741
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:46,272
I apologize for the delay.
We had trouble procuring armor.

742
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,273
Do not apologize.

743
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:50,193
I have been waiting
for circumstances to change.

744
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,196
Look.

745
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,032
That is where His Majesty is.

746
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,870
We are close,
but His Majesty does not know we are here.

747
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,708
It is time we told him.

748
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:07,418
Of course.

749
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,287
Your Majesty. It is the Royal Guard.

750
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:45,999
Enter.

751
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:54,132
Your Majesty, a flaming arrow
was shot from Heomcheon.

752
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:56,175
The loyalist forces must be here.

753
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,182
Currently, at Namhansanseong Fortress,

754
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,268
His Majesty is desperately
waiting to be rescued.

755
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,854
Those who die for His Majesty

756
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,231
will be remembered
for generations to come.

757
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:14,068
So, do not be afraid. Do not fear.

758
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,447
We will risk our lives
to rescue His Majesty,

759
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,575
protect Joseon, and preserve the state.

760
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,078
As soon as the day breaks tomorrow,

761
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:26,748
we will strike
the Qing soldiers from behind

762
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,792
and escort His Majesty to Ganghwa Island.

763
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,045
With your hands

764
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:33,880
and with your swords,

765
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,882
will you rescue His Majesty?

766
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,063
It is an ambush.

767
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,814
An ambush!

768
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,834
Yeon-jun, stay behind me.

769
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,521
Yeon-jun!

770
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,368
When you took out the blade,

771
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,996
I thought you had finally
decided to kill some barbarians.

772
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:14,665
But here we are, peeling persimmons.

773
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:21,422
You are back. How did it go?

774
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,883
Why ask? It is as expected.

775
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,677
Goodness.

776
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:31,599
The loyalist forces of General Jung Se-gyu

777
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:33,893
encountered barbarians
on their way to Namhansanseong Fortress

778
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,061
and suffered a crushing defeat.

779
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:39,899
Didn't the men of Neunggun-ri
go to that general?

780
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:48,699
Either way, the battle
should be settled up there.

781
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,077
I hope it does not reach the south.

782
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,371
This time around,
the Jin soldiers are being helped

783
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,791
by Mongolian soldiers.

784
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,506
Mongolian soldiers are different.

785
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:05,967
Different? How?

786
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:11,222
The Manchus and the Han will be
following their leaders' strict orders.

787
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:15,935
But the Mongolians must be here
with an ulterior motive in mind.

788
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:18,563
What motive is that?

789
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,650
To plunder riches and prey on women.

790
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,979
I hear horses galloping. They are coming.

791
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:02,690
I will go get him. Go up the hill
and raise the smoke signal.

792
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:03,858
We cannot take the boat.

793
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,028
We must go another way.

794
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:10,114
The Mongolians must have already left
to loot Joseon villages.

795
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,490
We just have to cross that mountain.

796
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,367
Take the baby and run!

797
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,369
Where are you right now?

798
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:17,538
I am scared and exhausted.

799
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:22,335
Nothing happened to us at all today.

800
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:26,088
I will have to hunt them down.

801
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:36,140
