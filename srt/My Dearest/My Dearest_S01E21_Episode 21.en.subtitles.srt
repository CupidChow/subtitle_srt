1
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,564
I see you understand me.

2
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,776
You

3
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,445
are not crazy,

4
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,363
are you?

5
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,080
Could you tell me

6
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,457
about Lee Jang-hyeon?

7
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,222
I have never been crazy.

8
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,477
You people merely…

9
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,191
wanted to believe
that I was saying crazy things.

10
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,205
I will tell you about Lee Jang-hyeon.

11
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,084
If I do…

12
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,342
will you tell me…

13
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,140
what happened to him?

14
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,441
My life…

15
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,320
has been a series of bad choices.

16
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,992
Why would you think that?

17
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,294
I do not know if the things I did
for the crown prince

18
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,215
actually benefited him in any way.

19
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,551
If…

20
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,013
the crown prince

21
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,309
had been harmed by the barbarians,

22
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:08,897
the king of Joseon would not have grown
to hate him.

23
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,733
Then--

24
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,192
My lord.

25
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,572
You protected His Royal Highness.

26
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,704
So now…

27
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,083
let us think only
about enjoying life together.

28
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,085
All right?

29
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,005
Shall we do that?

30
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,175
Okay, then.

31
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,719
What kind of life do you want, Gil-chae?

32
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,394
As for me…

33
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,528
What?

34
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,822
The crown prince was poisoned?

35
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,952
Who dares to spread such a rumor?

36
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,791
You should have cared
for His Majesty better.

37
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,585
How could you let such rumors spread?

38
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,965
Your Majesty, the rumors must have been

39
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,093
started by those who mourn traitor Kang.

40
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,763
Why have you not arrested them?

41
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,806
How can we

42
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,059
arrest people without definitive proof?

43
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,607
We cannot let rumors spread like wildfire.

44
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,860
Your Majesty,

45
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:42,407
accusing the late crown princess
based on Jin-saeng's testimony alone

46
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,534
has sparked discontent among the scholars.

47
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,451
We need

48
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,830
someone who can command
their respect and obedience,

49
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:53,084
such as Kim Jib,
Kim Sang-heon, or Jang Cheol.

50
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,840
Jang Cheol. Bring him here.

51
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:06,431
But Jang Cheol greatly pities
the captives from Shenyang.

52
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,933
He will comply.

53
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,811
I will make sure of it.

54
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,400
Arrest those disrupting the peace.

55
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:22,739
They colluded with traitor Kang
and are plotting treason.

56
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:27,869
I want you to catch them
as a temporary inspector general.

57
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,620
Your Majesty,

58
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:35,626
why would you refer to the pitiful
prisoners as disrupters of peace?

59
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,920
I am sure of it.

60
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,842
The wealth accumulated
by traitor Kang has been dispersed,

61
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,095
and all that is left are
useless rolls of silk.

62
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,681
Where is the rest of it?

63
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,475
It must have

64
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,977
gone to the prisoners.

65
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,563
Do you have proof?

66
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,693
Proof?

67
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,739
How about this, then?

68
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,033
Every year,

69
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,786
I receive an appeal for a family to have

70
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,246
the social status
they lost in 1649 reinstated.

71
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:18,920
All the men in the family died,
and only the married daughter survived.

72
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,715
That daughter has submitted
the appeal every year.

73
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,302
I have ignored it until now,

74
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,764
but maybe I should
finally give it a good read

75
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:36,104
and look into the truth
behind your father's testimony,

76
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,940
which accused that family of treason.

77
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,240
Father.

78
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,827
I was never able to ask you.

79
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,456
But maybe it is time you answered me.

80
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,669
Did you

81
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,630
personally hear the traitors

82
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,050
conspiring to commit treason?

83
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,555
You were telling the truth
when you reported treason, right?

84
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,826
I could ruin the reputation
of your late father

85
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,621
by revealing the falseness
of his testimony

86
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,207
and have you return

87
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,628
to the status of a lowly servant.

88
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,300
Do you wish to show your pupils

89
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:52,013
your fall from grace?

90
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,779
Master, I do not understand.

91
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,033
Just a few days ago,
you refused His Majesty's request,

92
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,786
but now you have agreed to expose
the traitors among the Shenyang captives?

93
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:21,542
I hear you and Lee Jang-hyeon are
old acquaintances.

94
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,088
He was also there when you made it
to Namhansanseong Fortress.

95
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,758
Is this true?

96
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,676
Yes.

97
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,389
It is true we have crossed paths before,
but I do not know a lot about him.

98
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,935
I heard he became a noble
by purchasing his title

99
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:43,022
and made a fortune by trading persimmons
and white paper across the country.

100
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:47,068
He purchased his title as a noble?

101
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,197
Are you saying he is of lowly origin?

102
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,283
I do not know much about his past.

103
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,243
However,

104
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:59,413
although he may be greedy
when it comes to money,

105
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,666
he is not one to plot treason.

106
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,506
Investigate Lee Jang-hyeon first.

107
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,842
Interpreters are known to engage

108
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,928
in personal business
with the people of Qing.

109
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,305
So, we have no choice but to doubt him.

110
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,058
By any chance,

111
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,353
if he has been threatening our nation
by conspiring with the Qing,

112
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,648
I will have him executed.

113
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,401
If he is a mere merchant,

114
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,321
then I will make sure he is not punished

115
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,782
as a traitor.

116
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,577
Of course. Yes, Master.

117
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,263
"An Eunsan government office slave…"

118
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,931
"Hyeon."

119
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,856
YUHWON JANG SEO-IN
ANCESTRAL TABLET

120
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:31,297
Lee Jang-hyeon used to be
a slave at the Eunsan government office.

121
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,550
And his parents?

122
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,013
He was a drifter-turned-slave,

123
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,225
so there are no records of his parents.

124
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,394
All right.

125
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,981
Master.

126
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,859
Forgive my impudence,

127
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:57,531
but may I ask how your son died?

128
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,672
He was attacked by bandits.

129
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,260
By the time he was found…

130
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:25,226
his body had been burned
beyond recognition.

131
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,190
That is how I lost my son.

132
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,778
But I think of my pupils as my sons.

133
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,322
Especially you.

134
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,201
You call me out at times.

135
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,834
But you also worry about me.

136
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,339
It reminds me of my boy.

137
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,265
Do you wish to show your pupils

138
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,978
your fall from grace?

139
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,277
I cannot lose you as well.

140
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,866
I will not lose you too.

141
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,569
IN THE SHADE

142
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,453
Hyeon.

143
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,627
My son.

144
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,466
JOY OF A SPRING DAY

145
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,227
YI-DAN, HYEON, RYANG-EUM

146
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,854
RYANG-EUM

147
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,860
YI-DAN, HYEON

148
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,451
What brings you here?

149
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,418
I heard you were leaving.

150
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,176
I do not have a father.

151
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,806
That is why I have looked up
to my masters as father figures.

152
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,769
I do so now, and I did so in Neunggun-ri.

153
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,610
They do say

154
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,696
a monarch, master,
and father are one and the same.

155
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,951
Just like you risked your life to reach
His Majesty at Namhansanseong Fortress,

156
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,330
serve that master of yours

157
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,250
as if he is your father.

158
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,554
I have something to ask.

159
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,894
Rumor has it
that you bought your status as a nobleman.

160
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,023
It is true. I used to be a servant.

161
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,399
Why?

162
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,363
Does it bother you that you have been
cordial to a former servant?

163
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,491
What was your name back then?

164
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,119
As a slave,
you could not have had a surname.

165
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,205
When you bought your nobility,

166
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,707
why did you choose Lee as your surname?

167
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,465
Why "Lee"?

168
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,222
"Lee" is the surname
of Joseon's royal family.

169
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,976
I wanted to live

170
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,187
as a rogue with the same surname.

171
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,327
I guess

172
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,621
I did not hate you that much.

173
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,628
You may be boring…

174
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,924
but you have a good heart.

175
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:56,181
This jaded rogue will
soon move somewhere far away.

176
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,148
So, do not worry.

177
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,245
Your Majesty.

178
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,914
We have received a report regarding those

179
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,667
who held an ancestral rite
for traitor Kang in Ŭiju.

180
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:27,129
I have been supplying
Usimjeong with liquor.

181
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,174
One day, when I went to drop off a batch,

182
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,219
I heard them whispering in a room.

183
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,764
They referred

184
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,350
to the traitor, Kang,
as Her Royal Highness

185
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,478
and vow to get revenge on a certain date.

186
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,812
Cut the nonsense.

187
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,064
Do you have a death wish?

188
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,816
You ordered clear liquor to serve

189
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,319
at her ancestral rite.

190
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:54,364
We only held the rite to appease
the crown prince's pitiful soul.

191
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,991
Then,

192
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,036
did you host an ancestral rite
for traitor Kang as well?

193
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,748
Did you?

194
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,042
All we did

195
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,670
was offer her soul a glass of liquor.

196
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,718
The Inspector-General will speak.

197
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,680
How should they be dealt with?

198
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,725
Traitor Kang

199
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,063
dared to make an attempt
on Your Majesty's life.

200
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:30,067
Those who mourn her are
also considered traitors.

201
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,988
Sentence them to quartering
to send a message.

202
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:41,370
I also urge you, before doing so,
to interrogate these traitors

203
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:46,125
and arrest every person
who colluded with them.

204
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,421
Punish the traitors

205
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,258
and brighten the world.

206
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,386
-Brighten the world.
-Brighten the world.

207
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,860
-Jang-hyeon.
-Hey.

208
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,742
His Majesty suspects
the captives of treason

209
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,371
and has appointed a man named Jang Cheol
as Inspector-General to annihilate them.

210
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,710
Jang Cheol?

211
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,378
Yes.

212
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,547
He is respected by the scholars,

213
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,467
which is why His Majesty insisted
that he take on the role.

214
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,096
Anyway, he has been looking for proof.

215
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,807
If I could,
I would knock down the palace gates

216
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,100
and give them a piece of my mind--

217
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,143
No.

218
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,773
Then, you will
actually be guilty of treason.

219
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,237
I should meet with him.

220
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,781
Meet with who?

221
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,578
The person I hoped to never see again

222
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,248
before I died.

223
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,213
Master.

224
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,676
The leader of the traitors sent a letter.

225
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,470
He has asked to meet you in secret.

226
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,197
Are you the one

227
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,368
leading the traitors?

228
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,079
All they did

229
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,207
was repay the kindness of the deceased…

230
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,170
by offering their souls some liquor.

231
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,506
Traitor Kang

232
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,719
bore a grudge against her parents
and tried to kill them.

233
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,104
Was there any truth to that testimony?

234
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,446
Any reports made regarding acts of treason

235
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,198
are valuable.

236
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,201
That is how we protect this nation.

237
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,288
Like the case

238
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,208
involving your father in 1649?

239
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,459
What?

240
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,590
Who on earth are you?

241
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,929
I heard you bought your noble status.

242
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:47,723
That means

243
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,309
even your name

244
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,061
is a lie.

245
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,402
Do you wish to know my real name?

246
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,282
My birth name is Hyeon,

247
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,327
and I am of the Jang family.

248
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,416
Father.

249
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,671
I am Hyeon.

250
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:28,055
That is preposterous.

251
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,225
A long time ago, my son--

252
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,394
Did you think I died
in a fire caused by bandits?

253
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,584
Look closely.

254
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,653
I see you.

255
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,199
I see the face of my young boy.

256
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,369
My son.

257
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,082
How could this be?

258
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,505
How have you been living?

259
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,760
But why…

260
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,430
Why are you involved with the traitors?

261
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,812
Father.

262
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,316
They are not traitors.

263
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,402
Hyeon, please.

264
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,821
Spare the lives of the prisoners.

265
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,241
We will live as if we do not exist.

266
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,871
They honored the traitor Kang
by holding an ancestral rite.

267
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:21,543
Who would believe they would
no longer cause any more trouble?

268
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,967
Is that why you killed Sam-do?

269
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,058
Sam-do also said…

270
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,272
he would live as if he did not exist.

271
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,321
My sister loved him.

272
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,741
You were also aware of that.

273
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,384
However…

274
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:20,101
you accused him of raping his lady
and had him beaten to death.

275
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,729
Then…

276
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,609
you made my sister…

277
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,364
cross the frozen river
to run an errand for you.

278
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,621
She understood what you were implying.

279
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,997
No…

280
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,961
Your sister did what she did
for your sake.

281
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,215
She did it
so as not to hinder your future.

282
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,841
That is not true!

283
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,552
My sister…

284
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,768
could not disobey her father.

285
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:07,941
My sister…

286
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,862
did not have it in her…

287
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,700
to defy you.

288
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,750
I could not bear it.

289
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,797
I resented you for it.

290
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,049
That is why I was determined

291
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,344
to take away from you…

292
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,599
what you valued.

293
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,282
That is right.

294
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,827
Father.

295
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,624
I never went missing.

296
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,628
I stole myself…

297
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,635
away from you.

298
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,352
My son…

299
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,021
Dismantle the rebellious party.

300
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,942
Not a single strand
of hair shall be left remaining.

301
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,197
Not a single record
of their existence shall remain.

302
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,866
Soon,

303
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,037
slaves of the Palace Treasury Office will
take action against you.

304
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,665
So, hand the traitors over to them.

305
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,127
That is your only way to survive.

306
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,506
I cannot

307
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:59,135
lose you a second time.

308
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,013
Father.

309
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,184
Please let them go.

310
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,440
We will not cause any trouble.

311
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,154
We will live as quietly as dust.

312
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,616
Are you saying…

313
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,371
you will defy your own father?

314
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:07,912
I…

315
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,253
I was deeply fond of you.

316
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,179
When you found out that my sister
genuinely loved Sam-do…

317
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,015
you chose…

318
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,060
to elevate his status
from that of a slave to a commoner

319
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,231
so that they could be together.

320
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,028
I found that…

321
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,910
to be admirable.

322
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,292
That is why I could not comprehend

323
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,796
why you suddenly had him killed.

324
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,142
Father.

325
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,649
I know…

326
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,778
who Sam-do was.

327
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,371
Sam-do…

328
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,293
was the last male heir
of the family that was ruined

329
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:41,005
by Grandfather's false report.

330
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,386
Sam-do…

331
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,140
gave up on revenge
because he loved my sister…

332
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,229
but you did not believe him when he said

333
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,232
he would live a quiet life.

334
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,401
That is why you had him killed.

335
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,620
Please…

336
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,332
let the prisoners live.

337
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:20,962
If you…

338
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,051
strike my people…

339
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,972
this time around,

340
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,018
I will completely destroy

341
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,688
what you deem precious.

342
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,615
I know it now.

343
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,080
I know what you value the most.

344
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,505
And it is not me.

345
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,307
Master.

346
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,727
The prisoners escaped
the execution ground.

347
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,528
Take the women with you.

348
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,738
Come with us.

349
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,991
Can I trust you to feed Ttaeng-ttaeng?

350
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,744
You must live for his sake.

351
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,497
Go!

352
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,499
Let us leave.

353
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,250
Hurry!

354
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:45,630
Come on.

355
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:49,926
Over here!

356
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,178
Gu Yang-cheon is right here.

357
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,805
Gu Yang-cheon is here.

358
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,890
-Get him!
-Gu Yang-cheon is here.

359
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,861
Fire.

360
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,151
Lord Lee.

361
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,697
Lord Lee.

362
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,704
Where is Big Brother?

363
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,508
Jang-hyeon.

364
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,680
Jang-hyeon, soldiers are coming.

365
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,743
Do you trust me?

366
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,995
Go to Neunggun-ri.

367
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,247
I will be right behind you.

368
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,630
My husband, you risked your life
to save these people.

369
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,633
I will take good care of them.

370
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,968
So, please…

371
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:01,057
You must keep your word.

372
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,143
Of course.

373
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,395
I will keep it and then some.

374
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,065
You are my owner.

375
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,651
How can a servant die
without his owner's permission?

376
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,567
If you…

377
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,656
strike my people…

378
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,285
this time around,

379
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,164
I will completely destroy

380
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,959
what you deem precious.

381
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:31,731
Who are the people
that are threatening this nation?

382
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,443
They are traitors who have sold
out the nation

383
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,362
by being friendly with the barbarians.

384
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,489
They are women who know no shame

385
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,659
despite having
their chastity violated by barbarians.

386
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:47,580
They are filthy and lewd men
who indulge in homosexual love.

387
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:53,085
Together, they are on a mission
to tarnish this nation.

388
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,339
As loyal scholars of this nation,

389
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,800
what should we do
to remedy this situation?

390
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,442
Master.

391
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,861
I have something to tell you.

392
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,865
As you ordered, I looked
into Lee Jang-hyeon's past.

393
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,077
His name is Hyeon and--

394
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,370
A long time ago…

395
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,708
I lost both my daughter

396
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,461
and my son.

397
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,299
My daughter Yi-dan

398
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,178
took her own life following a rumor

399
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,682
that she had lain with her servant.

400
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,271
I knew…

401
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,652
of her decision to end her own life

402
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,571
but did not stop her.

403
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,327
The pain was like having
my bone marrow scraped out.

404
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,373
Together, my daughter and I

405
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,710
protected our family's reputation.

406
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,088
We were glowingly loyal.

407
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:25,553
On this Joseon land
that was violated by barbarians,

408
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:31,976
what are the ultimate sacrifices
and acts of devotion

409
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,854
we scholars can perform?

410
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,232
Is it getting rid of those

411
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,570
who hate us as well as the ones we hate?

412
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,490
That is neither a sacrifice nor courage.

413
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,786
A true sacrifice…

414
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,333
is cutting out even those
whom you cherish…

415
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,212
as much as your own life

416
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,343
in order to honor greater loyalty.

417
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,346
That is a sacrifice.

418
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,603
Husband!

419
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:18,773
Please help them.

420
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,358
Help Gil-chae

421
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,194
and Interpreter Lee.

422
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,321
We received reports of the prisoners.

423
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,990
Their guilt will be determined
after they are arrested.

424
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,451
They will die if captured.

425
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,953
It is for the sake of national order.

426
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,333
It cannot be true.

427
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,710
You must be mistaken.

428
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,046
Interpreter Lee would not commit treason.

429
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,675
Do you

430
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,179
trust him more than you trust me?

431
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:51,866
What are you doing?

432
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,665
Why are you here?

433
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,834
Go.

434
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:02,960
Leave already.

435
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,591
-You--
-It will be over once they arrest you.

436
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,801
Do you not know what that implies?

437
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,345
They will do anything to kill you.

438
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,224
I cannot see that happen. In fact…

439
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,269
I refuse to see it.

440
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,646
So, leave already.

441
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,983
Are you saying you will die in my place?

442
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:28,903
Please just go.

443
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,240
Please save me this one time.

444
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,578
I…

445
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,500
cannot watch you die.

446
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,878
So, please leave.

447
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,737
You have it all wrong.

448
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,368
I could gladly die for you,
but you cannot die for me.

449
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,664
Wait here.

450
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,875
I will come back for you.

451
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,101
Hey!

452
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,105
Why are you here?

453
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,523
Surrender.

454
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,732
If you surrender quietly,

455
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:52,861
the Office of Justice will
fairly determine your guilt.

456
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,282
You are still so naive.

457
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,869
Do you not understand why your monarch

458
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,748
sent slaves of the Palace Treasury Office
rather than palace guards?

459
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,876
Or are you choosing to feign ignorance?

460
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,789
ACADEMY OF STUDYING AND HOPE

461
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,212
This is it.

462
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,465
This is Neunggun-ri.

463
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,636
Gil-chae!

464
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,813
You did well.

465
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,982
I am proud of you.

466
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,276
I heard everything.

467
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,211
You did well.

468
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:38,884
What about your husband-to-be?

469
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,347
He will come soon.

470
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,933
He promised he would come.

471
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,436
Can you hear it?

472
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,732
This sound…

473
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,404
The sound of flowers.

474
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,193
I do not want to hurt you.

475
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,698
All of you must…

476
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,119
also have people waiting for you.

477
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,163
I have…

478
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,626
someone waiting for me too.

479
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,505
So…

480
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,675
let me go.

481
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,097
Let me…

482
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,602
go home.

483
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:29,656
Then,

484
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,409
how should I proceed with Lee Jang-hyeon

485
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,369
who leads the traitors?

486
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,499
Master.

487
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,085
His name is Hyeon,
and his family name is Jang.

488
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,254
His birth name is Jang Hyeon.

489
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,089
Lee Jang-hyeon is your--

490
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,507
Kill him.

491
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,970
Did you know that fear

492
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,930
can turn a person cruel?

493
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:59,061
How dare you call
that bitch a child of the king?

494
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:49,546
Those leading the traitors,
including Lee Jang-hyeon, were eliminated.

495
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,507
Their bodies were thrown into the sea,

496
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,260
destroying any trace of them.

497
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:58,555
He must have been

498
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:01,767
in possession of the letter
from the crown prince.

499
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,771
Give it here.

500
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:22,662
Master!

501
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,378
Hyeon.

502
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,049
Together, you and I…

503
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,217
Master!

504
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,135
We protected the family's reputation

505
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:41,348
and remained beautifully loyal.

506
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,504
The letter…

507
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,215
I am certain.

508
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,300
The letter…

509
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,594
The letter.

510
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,180
The letter…

511
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,099
There is a letter.

512
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,142
There is a letter…

513
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,658
Your Majesty.

514
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,875
I gave birth to my husband's baby,

515
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,044
but she died.

516
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,424
This child

517
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,093
is not the child I had with my husband,

518
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,305
but I wish to raise him well.

519
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,725
The child's name

520
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,768
is Byeong-yi.

521
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,232
I cannot go home

522
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:16,902
to our parents

523
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,195
or go to my in-laws.

524
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,454
But if you let me stay, Brother,

525
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:31,791
I will do right by this child.

526
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:40,842
HUSBAND JANG-HYEON
WIFE GIL-CHAE

527
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,516
That winter,

528
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,479
many who smiled
and cried fell asleep forever.

529
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:58,151
I had insisted on creating a world
that valued courtesy and loyalty.

530
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,322
But what did I
actually manage to preserve?

531
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,493
What kind of Joseon did I protect?

532
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,164
A long time has passed,

533
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,084
and all that remains with me…

534
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,797
is their laughter,

535
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,549
which I will never get to hear again.

536
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:30,725
Do you expect me to believe that?

537
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,311
All that stuff about the captives…

538
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:39,401
and Lee Jang-hyeon helping
the former crown prince and traitor Kang?

539
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,325
It is all true.

540
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,663
So, please tell me.

541
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:03,758
What happened…

542
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,973
to Lee Jang-hyeon?

543
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,106
Did you not know?

544
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,109
Lee Jang-hyeon…

545
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,487
died

546
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,032
a long time ago.

547
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,790
I met with the madman.

548
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,501
He spoke much nonsense, did he not?

549
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,836
He did.

550
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,089
There was no substance to his words.

551
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:25,840
However,

552
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,426
if what he said is true,

553
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,848
why has he not been executed
for being disloyal to the former king

554
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,683
by talking of the captives?

555
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,771
According to the Hyeminseo physician,

556
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,565
someone in a high position ordered
that he be kept alive.

557
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,693
May I ask who that is?

558
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:47,946
Let him live.

559
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:49,405
But, Your Majesty,

560
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:54,077
he has said many unacceptable things.

561
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,411
Let him live.

562
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:00,291
He is the only one
of my brother's people who survived.

563
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:01,918
However,

564
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,130
do not let him see the light of day again.

565
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,926
Do not be curious
about whom the order came from.

566
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,304
Then,

567
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,224
who wrote this draft?

568
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,108
Who wrote such disloyal words?

569
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:29,154
Moreover, why are you
suddenly investigating Lee Jang-hyeon

570
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,906
following the death of the crown prince?

571
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,493
During Prince Yeonsan's reign,

572
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,704
do you remember how
Kim Il-son published the criticism

573
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,998
of King Sejo killing King Danjong
to steal the throne

574
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:42,125
and thus caused mayhem?

575
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,837
Yes, it caused
the First Literati Purge of 1498.

576
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:49,382
Then,

577
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,260
are you saying

578
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,012
that Lee Jang-hyeon's death

579
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:57,015
was used as an analogy
to describe the crown prince's death?

580
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,643
According to this writing,
Lee Jang-hyeon's death

581
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,437
was ordered by his father, Jang Cheol.

582
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,359
The writing

583
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,820
lacks substance.

584
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,116
That is why it was never added

585
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,036
to the official record.

586
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,296
Why did you appoint me to this task?

587
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:33,259
Whether or not you believe this tale,

588
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,304
someone should know of it.

589
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:40,975
I wanted that

590
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,978
to be you.

591
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:46,940
Do you know

592
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,567
about your birth mother,

593
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:54,280
who was written off the family tree
after being dragged off by barbarians?

594
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,295
Lady Yoo, I send my regards.

595
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:15,718
I write to you to relay these words
that I recently heard from my brother.

596
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:21,224
It is about the younger brother
of the missing Lee Jang-hyeon.

597
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,618
Who was…

598
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:26,039
Lee Jang-hyeon to you?

599
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,382
I envy you.

600
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:43,473
The time you devoted to him…

601
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,352
I envy it.

602
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:59,280
You know…

603
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,826
I would like to…

604
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,207
to live with you…

605
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,922
and hear stories about him
that I have never heard before.

606
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,183
So, Ryang-eum…

607
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,065
Live with me.

608
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,361
Live with me.

609
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:43,324
We can live together…

610
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,662
missing him together.

611
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,000
Let us live like that.

612
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,974
He was my brother…

613
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,730
my parent…

614
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,156
and my secret love.

615
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,144
The crown prince died.

616
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,355
Due to his extended stay in Shenyang,

617
01:02:57,231 --> 01:03:00,693
he followed the way of the Qing people.

618
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:05,364
One of the military officers
did not behave as an officer should.

619
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:46,215
Why is the house a mess?

620
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:50,011
He has been a complete mess
ever since Lady Gyeong left.

621
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,145
Husband.

622
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:09,196
Husband!

623
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:10,865
Husband!

624
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:18,414
Husband.

625
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:31,010
Have you come to?

626
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:06,879
I was not able…

627
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,593
to witness his death in person.

628
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,435
Hold it!

629
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,284
If he gets too far away…

630
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:41,205
Wait. Will you disobey an order?

631
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,736
However, I doubt he survived.

632
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,489
He had already lost a lot of blood.

633
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:23,497
I heard all the bodies were thrown
into the sea.

634
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:29,503
They were.

635
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,592
But Interpreter Lee's body was
never found.

636
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:41,057
I have been searching for years,
hoping to at least recover his body.

637
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:45,936
Recently, I heard that an old man

638
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:50,691
from a nearby village was the last person

639
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,194
to see Lee Jang-hyeon.

640
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,739
If you ask him…

641
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,368
you might learn where his body was buried.

642
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,708
If you ever find his grave,

643
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,961
please let me know.

644
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,719
I would like to offer his soul
a glass of liquor.

645
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:44,286
I will look for him.

646
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:47,790
I will search the mountains and rivers

647
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:51,001
to at least bring his remains home.

648
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:18,737
I also plan

649
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,408
on heading to Neunggun-ri.

650
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:33,752
Can I go with you…

651
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:37,673
to Neunggun-ri?

652
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:42,303
Am I…

653
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:46,557
still your husband?

654
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:30,142
I…

655
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:33,562
I heard

656
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:36,899
you were the last person
to see Interpreter Lee alive.

657
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:39,318
Do you at least know

658
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,239
where his body is buried?

659
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:04,218
I owe him my life.

660
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,848
I vowed to take this to my grave.

661
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:17,314
If anyone finds out that he is alive,
they could try to kill him again.

662
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:20,651
That is why I kept it a secret.

663
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:31,120
What do you mean by that?

664
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:34,081
He…

665
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,543
did not die.

666
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:41,547
However…

667
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:42,316
He could not remember a thing.

668
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:10,928
Goodness.

669
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:14,264
Why do you weep?

670
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,773
I do not know why.

671
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,610
But the sight of that moon…

672
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:32,533
is making my heart ache.

673
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:42,459
He would laugh and cry

674
01:13:43,627 --> 01:13:46,130
whenever he looked at the moon.

675
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:51,135
Goodness.

676
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,304
Where are you going
in this state of yours?

677
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:56,640
You cannot leave.

678
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,105
I keep hearing a sound.

679
01:14:05,524 --> 01:14:06,984
Thank you for all you have done.

680
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:18,245
He said he was following
the sound of flowers

681
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:21,331
and just left.

682
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:33,635
Where to?

683
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,762
Where did he go?

684
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:38,891
He said there was
a question he never answered

685
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,684
and he was in a hurry to answer it.

686
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:48,400
That is because there has been
something about you…

687
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:54,823
since the moment I met you.

688
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:00,204
Something about me?
What do you mean by that?

689
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:02,998
To me, you are a bit…

690
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:09,963
-Well, you know.
-What do you mean?

691
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:11,423
I am a bit what?

692
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,550
Others will be waiting, so let us go.

693
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:17,930
Hold on. You cannot leave it at that.

694
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,348
What about me?

695
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:21,350
We first met each other by the swing.

696
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:22,518
What about it?

697
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:24,520
What is it that you mean?

698
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:25,521
Hey!

699
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,525
She desperately wanted to know
what he meant by that,

700
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:30,984
but he never told her.

701
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:33,403
What he meant was…

702
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:36,907
In that moment,

703
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:40,661
she had stolen my heart.

704
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,082
I should have told her…

705
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:51,421
that there was
no going back for me since then.

706
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,400
Do you know him?

707
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:15,529
He came by every day for days.

708
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:22,786
Excuse me.

709
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,417
You are back.

710
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,712
I told you the person
you seek is not here.

711
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:41,597
That is absurd.

712
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:46,226
She told me not to worry.

713
01:16:47,811 --> 01:16:50,814
She said she could wait a month
with a smile on her face.

714
01:17:15,922 --> 01:17:17,758
That is when I realized

715
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,636
that you, my husband,

716
01:17:21,845 --> 01:17:24,556
have been finding your way to me

717
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:28,268
since the first moment we met.

718
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:46,995
Then…

719
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,208
Where could you be right now?

720
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:54,044
Where can I find you?

721
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:04,304
Okay, then.

722
01:18:06,306 --> 01:18:07,641
What kind of life

723
01:18:08,475 --> 01:18:09,851
do you want, Gil-chae?

724
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:18,026
As for me…

725
01:18:27,577 --> 01:18:33,083
I used to want to live in a place
that was full of life and many people.

726
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:36,336
But now I want

727
01:18:37,504 --> 01:18:39,172
us to live alone together

728
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:42,676
somewhere quiet and remote.

729
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:49,599
In the woods near Neunggun-ri,

730
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:52,936
there is a place with a creek…

731
01:18:54,938 --> 01:18:58,024
and a trail of flowering trees.

732
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:03,280
We can build a small house with two rooms…

733
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:08,577
make a fence out of forsythia branches…

734
01:19:10,996 --> 01:19:13,123
and raise three hens

735
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:16,293
so that we can have eggs every morning.

736
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:23,258
We will view flowers in the spring…

737
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:28,096
dip our feet in streams in the summer…

738
01:19:30,682 --> 01:19:32,976
make wine out of wild grapes in the fall

739
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,646
and drink it in the winter.

740
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:06,802
We will view flowers in the spring…

741
01:20:24,277 --> 01:20:26,613
dip our feet in streams in the summer…

742
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:52,722
make wine out of wild grapes in the fall

743
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:56,017
and drink it in the winter.

744
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:26,149
Are you lost?

745
01:22:29,235 --> 01:22:31,446
I was looking for someone.

746
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:35,116
Someone?

747
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:37,077
Who?

748
01:22:39,412 --> 01:22:40,789
My husband.

749
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,418
What does your husband look like?

750
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:49,130
He is handsome.

751
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:56,846
I cannot help with that description alone.

752
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:02,894
Why are you fixing the fence?

753
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:09,693
I was asked…

754
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:15,073
to make the fence
only as tall as a small child.

755
01:23:59,784 --> 01:24:00,869
Are you not leaving?

756
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:07,667
I told you. I have not seen
a handsome man in this vicinity.

757
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,440
Would you like something to eat?

758
01:24:53,713 --> 01:24:55,006
I see you eat a lot.

759
01:24:58,176 --> 01:24:59,469
It is delicious.

760
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:02,680
How are you able to cook this well?

761
01:25:09,979 --> 01:25:12,398
Why are you smiling like that?

762
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:15,110
It is an odd smile.

763
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:17,278
It is a bit… You know.

764
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:31,459
I will let you sleep here
since it is late,

765
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:35,046
but once the day breaks,
head out to search for your husband.

766
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:52,243
What are you doing out here?

767
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:10,803
Why do you live alone

768
01:29:11,929 --> 01:29:13,598
in a place like this?

769
01:29:17,977 --> 01:29:19,437
I am waiting.

770
01:29:22,815 --> 01:29:23,858
For what?

771
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:32,408
She wanted to live in a place like this.

772
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:34,494
However…

773
01:29:49,842 --> 01:29:51,469
Are you not leaving to find your husband?

774
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:57,058
I should.

775
01:29:58,434 --> 01:30:00,478
But I need your help.

776
01:30:01,145 --> 01:30:02,522
How could I help you?

777
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:06,067
I will describe him to you.

778
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:11,948
Think about whether he reminds you
of anyone you know.

779
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:15,243
First of all, my husband…

780
01:30:18,996 --> 01:30:20,957
is a handsome man.

781
01:30:24,335 --> 01:30:25,419
Not that again.

782
01:30:27,046 --> 01:30:28,381
My husband

783
01:30:29,841 --> 01:30:32,468
always kept his promises.

784
01:30:34,887 --> 01:30:37,974
He asked me how I wanted to live.

785
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:44,397
I said I wanted to live
by a flowing creek…

786
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:50,403
in a thatched house at the end
of a trail of flowering trees…

787
01:30:52,905 --> 01:30:55,116
make wine out of wild grapes in the fall,

788
01:30:56,409 --> 01:30:58,578
and drink it in the winter.

789
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:04,959
That is the life I wanted with him.

790
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:15,428
There is something I wish to say to him.

791
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:19,056
When we meet again,

792
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:21,767
there is something

793
01:31:22,768 --> 01:31:24,395
I must tell him.

794
01:31:27,273 --> 01:31:29,775
I also need to hear his answer.

795
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:43,247
That day.

796
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,127
The first day I met you, I mean.

797
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:52,798
What did you think about

798
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:54,967
while on the swing?

799
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:03,351
I do not remember.

800
01:32:08,898 --> 01:32:09,899
Is that so?

801
01:32:10,566 --> 01:32:11,901
What about you, my lord?

802
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:14,612
What did you think of that day?

803
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:18,407
That day…

804
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:23,162
I heard a curious sound.

805
01:32:24,747 --> 01:32:26,332
What kind of sound?

806
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:04,328
For some odd reason,

807
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:09,917
I knew the man from my dreams would come
to find me that day.

808
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:15,131
That is why everything before me…

809
01:33:17,466 --> 01:33:18,634
seemed to sparkle

810
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:22,179
ever so brightly.

811
01:33:58,966 --> 01:34:00,176
Husband.

812
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:06,932
Gil-chae is here.

813
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:28,621
Now, please answer me.

814
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:33,501
What was

815
01:34:34,418 --> 01:34:36,379
the sound you heard that day?

816
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:43,886
The sound of flowers.

817
01:34:45,888 --> 01:34:47,181
The sound of four o'clock flowers.

818
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:27,555
Gil-chae.

819
01:35:39,483 --> 01:35:40,526
Gil-chae.

820
01:36:05,801 --> 01:36:07,219
I have waited…

821
01:36:13,976 --> 01:36:14,852
for you…

822
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:19,899
right here

823
01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:22,818
for a very long time.

824
01:37:05,819 --> 01:37:08,948
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
MY DEAREST

825
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:08,609
