1
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,064
I know it is common practice
to kidnap women

2
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,441
and pass them off as escaped prisoners,

3
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,401
but I am a lady of noble birth.

4
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,989
I hear you married into
a family of military officials.

5
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,658
I do not know if you heard,

6
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,912
but if escaped prisoners are not returned,

7
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:22,123
Joseon's king will be dragged to Qing.

8
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,126
That is why the royal court

9
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,587
is capturing the prisoners
that have escaped

10
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,380
regardless of their status.

11
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,468
Word is we are allowed
to kill anyone who resists.

12
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,137
So, being an officer's wife
will not do you any good.

13
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,764
What sick game are you playing?

14
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,557
Let my lady go this instant--

15
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:47,857
My lady?

16
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,463
Little one.

17
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,591
Are you lost?

18
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,010
They dragged the lady away.

19
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,064
Is there still no word?

20
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,859
Gil-chae…

21
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,318
My lady!

22
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,622
Is there anything else you heard?

23
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,332
What do you mean?

24
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,751
This is not the first time
she disappeared.

25
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,545
Could Lee Jang-hyeon--

26
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,754
My goodness.

27
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,298
What are you saying?

28
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,843
Last time,

29
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,679
my wife bid him farewell in person.

30
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,100
We should talk in private.

31
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,696
You will choke at that rate.

32
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,995
Men dragged away the lady of your house?

33
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,582
Was it your first time seeing them?

34
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,588
And the lady of your house
did not know them either?

35
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:45,850
What did you find out?

36
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,436
Report first.

37
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,656
Why should I bother?

38
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,910
You have no idea what she means to me.

39
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,458
Deceive you?

40
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,835
We stayed up all night
looking for your wife.

41
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,587
Did our efforts seem like a lie?

42
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,173
It is not you that I doubt.

43
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,675
I only asked

44
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,844
because your wife might have lied

45
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,056
and helped my wife take off again,

46
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,558
like she did last time.

47
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,435
Is that…

48
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,275
Is that how you have felt all this time?

49
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,321
You know

50
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,283
how Gil-chae is.

51
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,537
She does not change her mind
after making a decision.

52
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,125
You are the one she chose.

53
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,836
So, why would you doubt her?

54
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,260
You.

55
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,851
She was dragged away by unknown men?

56
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,477
Yes.

57
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,482
They took

58
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,278
the lady and Jong-jong.

59
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,321
Where?

60
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,364
Where were they taken?

61
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,701
They spoke the barbarians' language.

62
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,914
I hear many women
have been kidnapped lately.

63
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,584
-This must be--
-You are

64
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,046
one of Lee Jang-hyeon's people.

65
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,973
It has become clear to me now.

66
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,022
Officer Gu!

67
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,694
Officer Gu.

68
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,279
What is wrong?

69
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,659
I am certain that man,
Lee Jang-hyeon, took my wife.

70
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,204
And he got that man, Ryang-eum,
to cover his tracks.

71
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,122
-Officer Gu--
-Why else would he be

72
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,166
the one delivering news about my wife?

73
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,293
Ryang-eum just told us why.

74
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,295
He ran into Da-jim while passing by.

75
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,379
While passing by?

76
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,096
And you believe him?

77
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,730
Ryang-eum.

78
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,941
I believe you.

79
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,442
I also

80
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,570
believe the boy.

81
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,241
Gil-chae…

82
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,328
We must bring her home.

83
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,962
Flog him until he tells you
where Lady Gil-chae is.

84
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:02,171
-Yes, my lord.
-Officer Gu!

85
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,465
There is no time for this.

86
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,425
Since the men of Qing took her,

87
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,927
do not waste time

88
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,513
and send someone to find her.

89
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,598
Or even

90
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,476
allow me to go.

91
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,520
I will find out where she is--

92
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,147
As if I would believe you.

93
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,606
I will go.

94
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,157
I will go with Ryang-eum.

95
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,953
I trust you will not doubt me as well.

96
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,187
Get up!

97
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,206
Get up quickly!

98
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,469
Jong-jong.

99
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,054
Jong-jong, stay awake.

100
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,764
My lady.

101
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,641
I am thirsty.

102
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,852
So thirsty…

103
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,446
I packed dried meat and powdered grains,

104
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,989
so do not skip your meals.

105
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,951
I also packed more than enough socks.

106
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,746
The terrain will be rough
where you are headed.

107
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,666
Please take care of your health. Also…

108
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,389
Thank you.

109
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,933
Why would you thank me for doing my duty?

110
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,395
There is nothing I would not do

111
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,814
considering what Lady Yoo did for me

112
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,400
while I was incarcerated.

113
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,577
Officer Gu, we are heading out.

114
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,293
Jong-jong.

115
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,170
Jong-jong, stay awake.

116
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,047
Stay alert.

117
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,717
I cannot

118
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,844
walk any further.

119
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,805
The journey is said to take a month.

120
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,142
I cannot do this, my lady.

121
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,020
If you pass out,
they will leave you behind.

122
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,439
Would you rather be eaten by crows?

123
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,648
But

124
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,610
I cannot…

125
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,237
Jong-jong.

126
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,202
Look here.

127
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,455
Hey.

128
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,045
I have a pendant inside my clothes.

129
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,671
-If you untie me--
-Come on.

130
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,214
I could not do that.

131
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,300
Then, take it from me yourself.

132
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,010
Come on.

133
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,722
As if I could lay a hand
on a lady of noble birth.

134
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,766
I am fine with it, so take it already.

135
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,657
Take that as payment,
and let us ride on the cart.

136
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,994
This will only pay for one person.

137
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,371
I am fine walking,

138
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,414
so please let her on it.

139
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,750
A lady putting her servant on a cart?

140
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,169
That is a first.

141
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,050
Go on.

142
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,889
-My lady.
-Hang in there.

143
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,391
You must stay strong.

144
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,475
Go.

145
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,789
It suits you.

146
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:51,293
Well, I wore it to honor your generosity.

147
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,421
But I got this dress

148
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,882
as a gift for Lady Eun-ae.

149
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,510
I will go and change this instant.

150
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,394
It was for me, right?

151
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,524
It suits you well.

152
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,818
You look beautiful.

153
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,239
Well, I am a fair lady in a pretty dress.

154
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,074
Of course, I look beautiful.

155
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,829
My lady,

156
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,416
you are not terrible to look at,

157
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,211
but I have seen my fair share of ladies

158
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,797
who are prettier.

159
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,092
Do not say what you do not mean.

160
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,928
Why did you give this gift to me

161
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,389
if I am not the fairest lady you know?

162
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,309
Never have I seen or heard
of a man behave so strangely.

163
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,521
Why did I give you a silk dress as a gift?

164
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,110
That is because there has been

165
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,945
something about you…

166
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,535
since the moment I met you.

167
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,916
Something about me?
What do you mean by that?

168
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,752
To me, you are a bit…

169
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,675
-Well, you know.
-What do you mean?

170
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,135
I am a bit what?

171
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,262
Others will be waiting, so let us go.

172
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,725
Hold on. You cannot leave it at that.

173
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,101
What about me?

174
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,103
We first met each other by the swing.

175
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,230
What about it?

176
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,357
What is it that you mean?

177
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,483
Hey!

178
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,455
I am sorry to disturb you.

179
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,088
But do you live here?

180
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,107
Is the moonlight not an odd color today?

181
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,235
And here you are,

182
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,780
enjoying the moon alone at night
with a bottle of liquor.

183
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,368
Are you a hedonist?

184
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,206
Or are you

185
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,251
the rebellious son of a wealthy household?

186
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,131
What is it to you?

187
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,581
The moonlight is an odd color today.

188
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,466
You must also be under this moonlight too.

189
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,514
I wish you a wonderful night.

190
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,037
I know the path the Qing people
take to get to Shenyang.

191
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,832
We might be able
to track her if we are lucky.

192
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,460
By the way,

193
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,213
why did you not leave with Lee Jang-hyeon?

194
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,840
Moreover,

195
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,592
why are you aiding
in the search for Lady Yoo

196
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,719
when Officer Gu suspects you of foul play?

197
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,100
I once asked a similar question
to Young Master Jang-hyeon.

198
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:21,021
"Why are you risking your life
to help that person?"

199
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,731
Help who?

200
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,358
Who was that person?

201
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,239
Young Master Jang-hyeon said

202
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,033
that if that person
were to die or get hurt,

203
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,869
someone would cry their heart out.

204
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,747
He could not bear to see that.

205
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,334
I feel the same way.

206
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,343
You want us to farm out of the blue?

207
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,139
We are suffering from a drought

208
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,100
and are lacking in provisions
to send to Songshan and Jinzhou Fortress.

209
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,895
So, His Imperial Majesty
has ordered Joseon Hall

210
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,439
to supply its own food by farming.

211
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,482
This is preposterous.

212
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,862
There has not been an instance
where hostages of the state were not fed.

213
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,656
The soil here
is different from that of Joseon.

214
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,159
How are the people
supposed to farm properly?

215
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,745
His Imperial Majesty has spoken,

216
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,456
and his decision is final.

217
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,338
It seems

218
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,884
they do not intend
to send us back to Joseon.

219
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,432
They are now ordering us to farm.

220
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,268
They must plan to keep me here forever.

221
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,356
Who will take charge of the farming?

222
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,524
I am afraid

223
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:51,737
I have no knowledge
when it comes to farming.

224
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,282
Maybe you can ask our homeland
to send their farmers.

225
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,410
Joseon is already stretched thin
from losing its provisions and soldiers,

226
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,079
so how can I also ask for farmers?

227
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,372
I have

228
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,208
a little knowledge.

229
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,253
As a child, when my father
worked for the state,

230
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,965
I saw how my mother managed the farmers.

231
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,803
Now that we have no choice,
we must obtain a fertile field.

232
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,181
We were promised land
that would take a month to plow.

233
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,308
Find someone who knows about soil

234
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,227
and obtain the most fertile land possible.

235
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,854
We must hurry if we are to plow soon.

236
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,357
Also,

237
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,069
we will need farmers who are resourceful.

238
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,238
We can get them.

239
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,284
Get them? From where?

240
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,578
There are some very close by.

241
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,374
Joseon prisoners at the slave market

242
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,419
used to farm back in Joseon.

243
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,675
Would you like

244
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,178
to see for yourself?

245
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,734
It is not too late to turn back.

246
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,902
No.

247
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,155
Let us go.

248
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,876
Please help me!

249
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,212
Please save me!

250
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,381
-Sir!
-Please save me!

251
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,258
Please do not kill me.

252
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,968
Please help me.

253
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,095
Please do not hurt me!

254
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,181
-Please…
-Over here!

255
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,725
-Help me.
-Save us!

256
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,477
Please, my lords!

257
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,154
Look here.

258
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,240
I brought 30 yang since that was
the ransom for a prisoner,

259
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,784
but then you bumped it up to 70,

260
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:06,830
so I went back to Joseon
and acquired the money.

261
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:10,292
It has taken me half a year to come back.

262
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,879
But now you are saying
that I must pay 100 yang for her?

263
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,673
He is saying 100 yang is too much.

264
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,093
It costs money
to keep her here and feed her.

265
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,222
Keep this up,
and I will charge you 150 yang.

266
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,058
He will charge you 150 yang
if you do not comply.

267
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,644
I sold all the land I had,

268
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,146
and there is no way
to come up with more money.

269
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,607
Please…

270
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,484
Then, I will not sell!

271
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,280
Please return my daughter to me.

272
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,325
Please give me back my daughter!

273
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,495
Please give me my daughter back.

274
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,205
Please.

275
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,293
No…

276
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,837
Father, take that money back home.

277
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,924
The family will starve without it.

278
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,137
My daughter, no!

279
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,765
No! My child!

280
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,725
No…

281
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,405
Those who are lucky
have been able to return to Joseon,

282
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,824
but those who cannot pay for their release

283
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,243
or are not sought out by their family

284
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,996
still remain here awaiting their family.

285
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,957
If we purchase those slaves,

286
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,627
we will have good use for them as farmers.

287
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,424
How can you think of using them
as farmers after seeing that?

288
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,304
They have been here for years now.

289
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,432
Why bother being sad about it now
after all this time?

290
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,475
We have new goods.

291
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,145
We have new goods for purchase.

292
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,733
These are high-quality goods.

293
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,820
Four Joseon men

294
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,905
and three Joseon women.

295
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,330
They all have their teeth intact.

296
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,540
-Show us.
-Show us more.

297
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,750
Show us another body part.

298
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,343
Strip them!

299
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,597
These are top-quality goods.

300
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,059
-Show us.
-Let us see.

301
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,269
-Come on.
-Show us more.

302
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:48,909
Your Royal Highness!

303
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,253
How can those women

304
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,091
choose to live and endure such shame?

305
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,468
How can they disgrace Joseon, and still…

306
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,723
Then, how come His Majesty

307
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,728
still lives even after shamefully
bowing nine times to a barbarian?

308
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,271
You have lost your mind!

309
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,527
Why is one person's humiliation
worthy of our sorrow…

310
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,365
while another's humiliation

311
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,536
is a sin that should be punished by death?

312
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,626
-Today, I will truly kill you.
-Your Royal Highness!

313
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,673
Your Royal Highness.

314
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,300
Do you truly believe…

315
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,306
they should have died
to avoid this humiliation?

316
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,019
If you truly believe that…

317
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,568
kill me right here, right now.

318
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,602
Hyeon!

319
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,251
Hyeon!

320
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,420
Sister!

321
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,369
Interpreter Lee.

322
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,084
Come with me.

323
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,289
I will kill you.

324
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,542
But before I do,

325
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,462
I must know
why you followed me to Shenyang

326
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,881
when you clearly
are not loyal to His Majesty.

327
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,346
What game are you playing?

328
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,268
A long time ago,

329
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,896
someone I knew…

330
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,402
was so afraid of drowning
in humiliation and disgrace…

331
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,449
that she took her own life.

332
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,954
I could not understand
the choice she made.

333
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,832
I was enraged.

334
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,212
You asked why I came to Shenyang.

335
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:13,882
I was…

336
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,888
curious about your fate.

337
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,642
I did not think you would
withstand the hardship.

338
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,770
Such insolence!

339
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,981
However, I can proudly say
you stayed strong.

340
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,359
You have done quite well.

341
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,902
That is preposterous.

342
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,322
I was…

343
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,785
not able to protect Joseon's king--

344
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:44,204
It is not up to a child
to protect their parent.

345
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,749
Being a protector

346
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,169
is a parent's duty.

347
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,507
Your Royal Highness.

348
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,885
Do not forget.

349
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:04,682
Even if everyone points their finger
at you for groveling to a barbarian…

350
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,728
and even if the king of Joseon

351
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,273
doubts your loyalty…

352
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,910
You must endure to the end.

353
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,374
I want to see that.

354
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,131
It might heal this heart of mine,
which has resented…

355
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,388
the one who gave up on her life.

356
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,500
You were to purchase farmers,
not old people on the brink of death.

357
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:17,213
How can we buy young and healthy farmers
when we do not have enough silver?

358
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,716
But still, these old men--

359
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,426
My lord,

360
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,345
will we be beaten
for not working well enough?

361
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:29,058
Farming is all that we have done
our whole lives,

362
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,644
so that is all we know how to do.

363
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:32,771
Is that so?

364
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,107
That works out perfectly.

365
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,359
Let us go.

366
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,991
How can you farm

367
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,077
with men way beyond their prime?

368
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,749
They have been farming
since before I was even born.

369
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,710
No matter the state of the soil,

370
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,254
they will know what to do.

371
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,214
Good.

372
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,509
Divide them into six groups

373
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,386
and appoint
the most experienced as leaders.

374
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,846
One more thing.

375
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,350
How much fabric do we have left?

376
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:13,102
We have 2,407 yards
of red and white cotton.

377
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,564
It is embarrassing to see them
in unlined clothes,

378
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,566
so sew tops and bottoms for the farmers.

379
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,568
Also,

380
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,279
give them rice for breakfast and dinner.

381
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,365
Lunch will be served at this hall.

382
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,117
Your Royal Highness,
please allow me to speak.

383
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,118
Such insolence!

384
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,957
Will you send us home

385
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,502
if we are able to provide you with crops?

386
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,547
When I finally take my last breath,

387
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,802
I wish for it to be in my homeland.

388
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,483
I do not even know if I will
ever be able to return to Joseon.

389
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,777
However,

390
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,655
I promise you this.

391
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,576
If I am able to return to Joseon,

392
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,286
I promise…

393
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,080
I promise to take you with me.

394
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:25,174
Make haste!

395
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,639
My lady,

396
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,100
I was thinking.

397
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,978
We are headed to Shenyang.

398
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,564
Young Master Jang-hyeon may be there.

399
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,357
Do not speak of him.

400
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,235
We must not meet him

401
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,988
nor ask for his help.

402
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,825
We cannot.

403
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,167
Hey!

404
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,025
My lady!

405
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,267
SHENYANG, GIL-CHAE
OFFICER GU WON-MU

406
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,951
Little one!

407
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,347
Your Majesty.

408
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,726
A report was sent from Shenyang,

409
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,103
and Yonggoldae reprimanded us

410
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,731
on 12 separate accounts.

411
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,858
Read them to me.

412
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,494
"Yonggoldae came to me
and reported the following 12 incidents.

413
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,997
When drafting soldiers to send,

414
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,207
you caused an inconvenience
by not meeting the deadline.

415
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,628
This year, soldiers returned
later than scheduled,

416
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,715
using the excuse of ships sinking at sea.

417
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:15,595
You failed to immediately
return those that had escaped

418
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,682
and did not ban people from harvesting
ginseng across the border…"

419
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,936
My lord, please spare us some food.

420
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,397
We have not eaten for five days.

421
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:28,524
My lord.

422
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,694
-Please…
-Please give us some food.

423
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,494
Please give us food.

424
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,605
The people

425
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,192
are eating rice cakes
and porridge made out of dirt.

426
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,778
They taste like buckwheat.

427
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,782
You have eaten like that before too?

428
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,122
I thought the war had ended,

429
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:26,958
but I was wrong.

430
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,253
We are sucking the nation dry

431
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,046
by sending provisions
and soldiers to Qing.

432
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,799
Pyeongan Province will soon be destroyed.

433
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:39,137
I feel the nation will eventually crumble.

434
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,600
If I could

435
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,230
erase all traces of the barbarians
left behind in Joseon,

436
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,817
I would gladly give up my soul to do it.

437
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,904
How pretty.

438
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,450
Hey.

439
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,078
What are you up to?

440
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,835
What is written on this?

441
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,600
You must have heard,

442
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,060
but prisoners from Joseon
will be arriving.

443
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,897
But there is a minister who says

444
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,608
he cannot bear to watch
the captives being punished.

445
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,819
Yes, I will take his place.

446
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,738
Would you?

447
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,198
What is so difficult about it?

448
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,408
It is not like the captives

449
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,286
will not be punished if I do not watch.

450
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,204
Well…

451
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,089
My lady.

452
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,759
Please kneel.

453
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,762
Not even the crown princess of Joseon

454
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,639
rode her palanquin from here.

455
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,312
I heard everything.

456
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,356
Send me to Joseon too.

457
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:01,112
You should all be punished by execution,

458
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,447
but His Imperial Majesty

459
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,324
has shown mercy.

460
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,493
Only three will be punished instead.

461
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,621
Take out the back row.

462
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,832
Let us go.

463
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,597
-Get up!
-Do not hit him.

464
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,432
Get your hands off me.

465
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,225
Take him away.

466
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:14,852
I would like

467
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,189
to buy this prisoner.

468
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,275
He will not be of much use

469
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,277
with a severed ankle.

470
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,531
That is not a problem
since he is crafty with his hands.

471
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,158
Besides,

472
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,202
now he cannot run away again.

473
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,288
Take him away!

474
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,765
His Highness will be fond of them.

475
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,103
Bring them.

476
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,922
Will they recognize
that we are not captives?

477
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,357
Leave those two

478
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,067
to serve His Highness.

479
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,321
The rest will be sent to Joseon Hall

480
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,489
for 100 yang a piece.

481
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:32,990
Of course.

482
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,076
The three of you will stand.

483
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,455
Stand up this second!

484
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:40,998
Wait.

485
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,792
Did they recognize
that we are not captives?

486
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,006
What happens to you now
is none of my concern.

487
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,424
Follow me.

488
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,053
Wait. Look here!

489
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,057
I am also a Joseon woman.
Just do as you are told.

490
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,990
Change into these.

491
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,705
We are not prisoners.

492
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,374
We were wrongfully dragged here.

493
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,878
As a fellow person of Joseon,
please speak for us.

494
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,881
Whether you are a prisoner or not

495
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,008
is decided by His Highness.

496
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:36,053
And in any case,
do as you are told while you are here

497
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,182
or his temperamental mistress
will send you to the slave market.

498
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,812
I doubt you know
what the prisoners there must endure.

499
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,253
My lady.

500
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,631
We should look into whether Lord Lee

501
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:13,882
is at the crown prince's hall.

502
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:17,177
I would rather die
than turn to him for help.

503
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,804
Do you hear me?

504
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,438
I need your help.

505
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,370
Gosh.

506
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:29,083
Come on. Push!

507
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,710
Push, darn it!

508
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:36,131
Did you crap out
all your strength after breakfast?

509
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,800
Push harder.

510
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,385
I have been pushing!

511
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,552
You are so annoying.

512
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:42,971
-Darn it.
-Move!

513
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:44,932
I am exhausted as is.

514
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:49,687
Darn.

515
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:51,730
Darn it.

516
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,482
There is a rock embedded here.

517
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,775
A rock?

518
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,363
Oh, dear.

519
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:06,328
I am afraid we are in need of a cow.

520
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,790
Farming should be done by cows anyway.

521
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,292
Where would we obtain cows at this point?

522
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,421
We can buy a Mongolian cow with cigarettes
and red ginseng instead of silver.

523
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,179
Allow me to make the trade.

524
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:25,973
But Interpreter Lee,

525
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,600
you have much work to do at the hall.

526
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,395
Obtaining a cow is just as important.

527
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,920
Allow me to serve His Highness.

528
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,297
It is my wish.

529
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:01,175
Allow me to serve His Highness.

530
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,260
Allow me to serve His Highness.

531
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,863
Did I say it exactly how you taught me?

532
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,618
Wait.

533
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,251
My lady!

534
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,337
How dare

535
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,505
you seduce His Highness?

536
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,506
Bring her!

537
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,841
No, what are you doing?

538
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,052
-No!
-My lady!

539
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,721
What is the meaning of this? Let go!

540
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,181
-My lady!
-Jong-jong!

541
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,099
My lady!

542
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,188
No!

543
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:58,106
No?

544
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,651
Then, I have no other choice.

545
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,903
I will cut off

546
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,655
your fingers instead.

547
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:06,907
No.

548
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,370
My lady!

549
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:12,913
No…

550
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,960
His Highness has his eye on her.
She must be kept intact.

551
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,754
Punishing captives who try to flee
falls under my purview.

552
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,300
Was she really trying to escape?

553
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,557
Five Joseon prisoners escaped,

554
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,059
which enraged His Highness.

555
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,396
If they run off again due to your torture,

556
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,649
he said

557
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,818
he would hold you responsible.

558
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,291
My lady.

559
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,209
My lady.

560
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,379
My lady…

561
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,053
My lady.

562
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:11,888
My lady.

563
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,392
My lady.

564
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,064
You fool.

565
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,192
Did you expect that Deul-bun
would actually help you?

566
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,780
What you said was,

567
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,241
"Please let me serve the prince."

568
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:32,993
That is what you said.

569
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,333
Give up.

570
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:43,253
If you do not comply,
they will say you tried to escape

571
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,631
and cut off your fingers

572
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:47,841
or your toes.

573
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,193
Some time ago,

574
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,237
a few Joseon prisoners escaped.

575
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,368
But I was too scared to go with them.

576
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,966
-Excuse me. May we ask something?
-Sure.

577
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,469
Have you seen her before?

578
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,107
You bitch.

579
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,608
You played my lady on purpose.

580
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,360
I will end you
if it is the last thing I do!

581
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:50,070
It is hopeless.

582
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,447
Your lady has already been chosen
by His Highness.

583
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,117
What do you mean by that?

584
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,493
Do not act ignorant.

585
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,219
Maybe we took a wrong turn.

586
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:18,432
But the Qing people followed this path.

587
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,522
This…

588
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:39,411
SHENYANG, GIL-CHAE
OFFICER GU WON-MU

589
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,561
My wife.

590
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,357
My wife!

591
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,493
What do I do?

592
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,830
What can I do?

593
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,793
Then…

594
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,503
By now,

595
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,006
she will be in Shenyang.

596
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,552
They must have falsely arrested her
as an escaped captive.

597
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,720
Officer Gu.

598
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,724
We must come up with the money
for her release

599
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,935
and head to Shenyang.

600
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:47,938
Of course.

601
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,565
Absolutely.

602
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,777
My wife…

603
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,909
You are off to buy a cow in Mongolia?

604
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:05,747
Find yourself a Mongolian girl
with chubby cheeks, and have some fun.

605
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,419
What do you mean by fun?

606
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:15,382
To get over a woman,
you must find yourself another.

607
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,675
And do what with another--

608
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,593
Come on. Let us get going.

609
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,346
What is his problem?

610
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:33,441
Good night, my baby

611
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:38,321
Sleep tight, my baby

612
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:42,659
Will I trade you for gold?

613
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:47,706
Or will I trade you for jade?

614
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,011
Come on. Let us get you fed.

615
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,894
We can use this opportunity

616
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,396
to sell the cigarettes we have collected.

617
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:15,066
Is that why you opted
to travel to Mongolia?

618
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,738
What we earn on this trip

619
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,531
can fund our branch in Namwon.

620
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,556
These are top-quality cigarettes.

621
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,361
Hey.

622
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,041
He brought out a girl.

623
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,967
Mongolian cows taste good.

624
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,179
Stay as long as you want
and enjoy your time.

625
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,640
Yes, it tastes really good.

626
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,724
Truth be told,

627
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,851
I…

628
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,277
I had a girl.

629
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,410
I hoped

630
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,539
that she felt the same way I did.

631
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,002
But she said she never loved me.

632
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,341
Nor did she ever trust me.

633
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,561
I am over her now.

634
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,233
Come to think of it,
she is not even pretty.

635
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,567
Especially her eyes.

636
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,569
Her eyes were really…

637
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,664
Her eyes…

638
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,088
They sparkled too much.

639
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,762
Why did she have to look at me
with those eyes?

640
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,034
Fine.

641
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,665
I will return the favor.

642
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,336
If we ever meet again…

643
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,130
Well, I doubt that will ever happen.

644
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:51,301
But if we do meet again…

645
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,638
I will not look at her.

646
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,185
I will not even glance at her.

647
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,274
I am a man of my word!

648
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,089
All right, then.

649
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:31,883
Jong-jong.

650
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,344
Have a damn good life.

651
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:38,306
I did not ask you to come with me
because of your beauty.

652
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:42,101
I only said you could come if you wanted

653
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,938
since you were so clingy.

654
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,774
Hey, there.

655
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:51,027
Set me up
with a pretty Mongolian girl as well.

656
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,739
You want to know what my type is?

657
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,159
I want a woman who is petite,

658
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,828
has narrow eyes,

659
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:03,998
is sharp-tongued, and has plump lips.

660
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,625
Set me up with someone like that.

661
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,255
Damn, I just described Jong-jong.

662
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:26,980
What happened?

663
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,333
If you refuse, I will seek
Young Master Jang-hyeon myself.

664
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:50,628
Jong-jong.

665
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,800
Do you know what
the prince's concubine said about you?

666
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:58,553
His Highness has his eyes set on you.

667
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:01,681
Do you not understand what that implies?

668
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:27,790
Strip her.

669
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,044
What are you doing? Let go.

670
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,388
You do not have a single blemish.

671
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,701
Once you gain his favor,

672
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:05,912
do not forget how kind I was to you.

673
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:12,001
Get her ready.

674
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:20,093
Just tell me what she said.

675
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,261
I will not ask you for anything again.

676
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,891
Since you have clear skin
without any scars,

677
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,893
His Highness will favor you.

678
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,062
So, stop fighting it.

679
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,481
If you gain His Highness's favor,

680
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:36,067
you can enjoy a better life
than you did in Joseon.

681
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:00,383
The persimmons and white paper

682
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,677
-must be given to us first.
-Of course.

683
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,394
My lord!

684
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:16,023
We are not allowed to speak
with maids from Joseon.

685
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,067
Do you know Lord Lee Jang-hyeon?

686
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,695
-What about Gu-jam?
-What?

687
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,573
Tell him my lady from Joseon…

688
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:25,032
I mean, Lady Yoo…

689
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:26,659
No, wait.

690
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,580
Tell him Young Lady Gil-chae is here.

691
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,249
Wait. Who?

692
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,315
I tripped and fell.

693
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,234
How dare you scar your own face?

694
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:14,081
She scarred her own face
to avoid attending to His Highness.

695
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:19,253
I would love nothing more
than to whip her to death,

696
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,589
but I must

697
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,133
at least make some money off her.

698
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:26,552
Send her

699
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:28,679
to Buhuchi.

700
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:51,327
After all that I told you…

701
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,333
We should never have helped Da-jim.

702
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,753
Then, we would not have been kidnapped.

703
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,339
In fact,

704
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:05,299
if we had never taken in that old man--

705
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,884
What did you just say?

706
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,471
Drag them out of here!

707
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:11,722
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

708
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,601
Jong-jong!

709
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,109
Where are we headed?

710
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:25,820
You will pay for this
when I return to Joseon!

711
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,365
Shut that trap.

712
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,410
Your noble status means nothing here.

713
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:36,122
Here, no one will find me at fault

714
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,082
if I say I killed you

715
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,960
for trying to escape.

716
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:44,755
If you want to keep your life,
follow me quietly.

717
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:47,466
This is just my luck.

718
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,682
Father!

719
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:56,726
Father, no!

720
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,854
Father!

721
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,900
Father!

722
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,528
Please do not kill me.

723
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,042
Please…

724
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:25,796
Buhuchi.

725
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:34,764
Please spare me.

726
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,599
No…

727
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,727
Please.

728
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,646
She is a pretty one.

729
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:45,816
-Lock her up.
-Yes, sir.

730
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,154
Get in there!

731
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:52,281
My lady.

732
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,079
Get in there!

733
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,877
Please take care of Father and Je-nam.

734
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:09,966
Do not worry. I will look after them.

735
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:13,844
Will you be all right on your own?

736
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:17,181
Your aid so far has been more than enough.

737
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:19,976
It is now up to me to bring my wife home.

738
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:22,937
I shall set off.

739
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,005
You are next.

740
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,887
Let me send a letter to Joseon.

741
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,515
My husband will come
and pay for my release.

742
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:00,766
What?

743
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,727
Your husband will come for you?

744
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,607
Children come for their parents,

745
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:11,318
parents come for their children,

746
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:15,406
and wives come for their husbands,

747
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:18,868
but no husband ever comes for his wife.

748
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:41,057
We have new goods today!

749
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:45,895
We have new goods!

750
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:02,369
This one right here is an only son.

751
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:08,417
His family might pay
a hefty amount for him.

752
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:13,422
It is a worthwhile purchase.

753
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:16,926
You can make him slave away

754
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:18,803
and then sell him.

755
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:20,471
We start at 30 yang.

756
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:21,764
Smallpox.

757
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:23,182
Smallpox!

758
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:25,518
The plague.

759
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,646
Smallpox!

760
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:31,273
Smallpox!

761
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,275
-Smallpox.
-It is smallpox!

762
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,944
-Smallpox.
-Smallpox.

763
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:36,362
It is smallpox!

764
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,167
Run!

765
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:53,671
Catch them!

766
01:08:57,758 --> 01:09:00,386
My lady, come out!

767
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:08,519
Did you send
the cow we bought to the farmers?

768
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:10,437
Yes, do not fret.

769
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:12,106
But more importantly,

770
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,151
why did you fail to perform
when the cow owner

771
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:16,861
gave his daughter to you?

772
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,823
Who are you accusing
of "failing to perform"?

773
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,410
You used to string along maidens
while claiming to be a misogamist,

774
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:27,496
but now you cannot seem
to communicate with them.

775
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:30,624
Communicate, my foot.

776
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:32,626
Is Lady Gil-chae the reason?

777
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,588
Are you so upset about losing her

778
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,631
that your male parts are shriveling up?

779
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:40,968
My what has shriveled?

780
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:44,096
You have definitely changed for the worse.

781
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,806
Yeong-rang must be right.

782
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,141
You must be a eunuch.

783
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:48,976
You must have a death wish…

784
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,732
Run!

785
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,540
This will get us warmed up.

786
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,631
The lady in blue is busy yet again.

787
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:51,497
Have you been well?

788
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:01,048
It has been a while.

789
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:53,660
They are people who have chosen to live.

790
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:55,287
Seeing how desperate you are

791
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,956
makes me less willing
to send her back home.

792
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,917
Is there something you need?

793
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,211
Give me your time.

794
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:03,629
I came to tell you something.

795
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:06,298
Lady Gil-chae… I mean, Lady Yoo.

796
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:08,509
I keep seeing things.

797
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:11,011
Your husband has come for you.

798
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,262
My lady.

799
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:13,263
My lord.

800
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:15,307
There is no reason to worry.

801
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:16,683
Let us go.

802
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:34,243
