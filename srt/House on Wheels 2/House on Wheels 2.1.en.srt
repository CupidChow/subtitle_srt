1
00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:33,632
(Today, they're going to check out their new House on Wheels.)

2
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:38,202
(Familiar figures are approaching.)

3
00:00:38,202 --> 00:00:40,932
- So you've been doing well. - Yes, I have.

4
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:43,042
- Did you have breakfast? - Yes.

5
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:45,103
- I'm hungry. - You are?

6
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:46,173
(They are somehow both wearing black.)

7
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:53,682
(Let us introduce the head of House on Wheels, Sung Dong Il.)

8
00:00:54,713 --> 00:00:59,393
(He's the reliable eldest of House on Wheels Season 2.)

9
00:00:59,923 --> 00:01:05,122
(He's also the main chef of the show.)

10
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:11,703
(Let us introduce the handsome man of House on Wheels, Kim Hee Won.)

11
00:01:14,432 --> 00:01:15,743
(It's salty!)

12
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:17,173
(It's too sweet!)

13
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:19,973
(He learns about the world through the show.)

14
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:25,012
(He's the most innocent person.)

15
00:01:25,113 --> 00:01:27,482
It's the new car we'll be using.

16
00:01:27,583 --> 00:01:28,723
It's also our house.

17
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:30,922
It's a lot different from the old one, isn't it?

18
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:34,122
(Impressed)

19
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:40,732
(How did their house change?)

20
00:01:42,663 --> 00:01:47,103
(Introducing the new house)

21
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:49,303
Doesn't it seem completely different?

22
00:01:49,672 --> 00:01:52,473
It really is different from the old one.

23
00:01:52,473 --> 00:01:55,482
(House on Wheels)

24
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:59,353
(House on Wheels Season 2)

25
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,753
(He's like a new tenant checking out a house.)

26
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:04,782
- Wow. - Compared to the old one,

27
00:02:04,782 --> 00:02:06,553
doesn't it feel more open?

28
00:02:06,553 --> 00:02:08,223
It does. My gosh.

29
00:02:08,223 --> 00:02:09,762
It would have been really cool...

30
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:13,232
if the old house was as open as this one.

31
00:02:15,432 --> 00:02:17,863
They should've given this to us in summer. Now it's too late.

32
00:02:17,863 --> 00:02:19,473
(He's complaining again.)

33
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,432
Jin Goo is really busy these days.

34
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,172
I know. It'd have been nice to have him with us.

35
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:27,813
He was sad and disappointed that he couldn't join.

36
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:29,242
Jin Goo was good at everything.

37
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:31,012
I know, he was really good.

38
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:32,582
(They feel somewhat empty without Jin Goo.)

39
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:37,082
(To fill their void, )

40
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:41,922
(a new member is joining House on Wheels Season 2.)

41
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:45,462
- Hey, Si Wan. - Hello, Dong Il.

42
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:49,732
(The new member is Im Si Wan.)

43
00:02:50,063 --> 00:02:51,133
- It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you too.

44
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:53,503
- It's my first time meeting you. - Right.

45
00:02:53,503 --> 00:02:54,603
Are you close with Hee Won?

46
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:58,202
Yes, we've already worked on three shows together.

47
00:02:58,272 --> 00:03:00,343
- We're doing another one together. - Again?

48
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:01,982
Yes, we got to do another one.

49
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:08,482
(They met as good friends on "Misaeng".)

50
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:15,962
(And their friendship developed through different works.)

51
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:20,063
(They even went to Cannes Film Festival together.)

52
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:22,362
- Really? - Yes.

53
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:23,503
You helped him to join the show?

54
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,403
No, he was the one who recruited me.

55
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:28,302
- You're funny. - Why?

56
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:30,772
You're a sidekick, so how can you recruit a new member?

57
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:33,873
No, I made the right choice. This show is perfect for him.

58
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:35,982
Do you enjoy camping though?

59
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,383
I really love camping. I love traveling too.

60
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:39,383
You've got some experience too?

61
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:41,952
I live to enjoy traveling.

62
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,952
- Oh, really? - Yes.

63
00:03:42,952 --> 00:03:44,283
- That's great then. - I've traveled a lot.

64
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:46,193
And... Can you brew coffee?

65
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:49,063
No, I can't. I'm not a coffee guy. I've never brewed coffee.

66
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,422
Then what are the things you are good at?

67
00:03:50,823 --> 00:03:52,492
Can you carry heavy water bottles?

68
00:03:52,663 --> 00:03:56,063
We're not here to hire a worker. Why are you asking that?

69
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:00,732
Anyway, I have great expectations of you.

70
00:04:01,073 --> 00:04:02,242
(Expectations from Hee Won and Dong Il)

71
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:06,943
(Let us introduce the youngest member of the show, Im Si Wan.)

72
00:04:07,443 --> 00:04:08,813
(Would you like some tea?)

73
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:10,283
(I'd love to.)

74
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,012
(Happy)

75
00:04:12,913 --> 00:04:16,353
(He's very sensible also.)

76
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:22,163
(He's good at taking care of his members.)

77
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:24,362
(Chef!)

78
00:04:24,623 --> 00:04:26,133
(Chef!)

79
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,593
(Here's the pollack head.)

80
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:31,102
(Hee Won, you should just rest at home in the next season.)

81
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:34,173
(Out of nowhere?)

82
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:37,003
(Flying a drone)

83
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:41,113
(It seemed like he'd be good at everything.)

84
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:44,212
(What?)

85
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:45,582
- What is it? - That's...

86
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:48,082
(Aren't they wolves?)

87
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:49,452
(Oh, they're not.)

88
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:50,452
(I have poor eyesight, so...)

89
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:53,193
(If they're really wolves, we should get moving.)

90
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,363
(He's very generous too.)

91
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:02,863
(It became a disaster.)

92
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:07,032
(He's generous with food and also very clumsy.)

93
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,573
(The fish Dong Il caught)

94
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:12,813
(I think you should just pull it up.)

95
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,813
(Hey! Hey!)

96
00:05:14,443 --> 00:05:16,183
(Splash)

97
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,512
(Laughing)

98
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:21,212
What's wrong? Gosh, that startled me.

99
00:05:22,582 --> 00:05:25,082
(He's the youngest who is actually very sloppy.)

100
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,222
- Don't you want to see the inside? - I do.

101
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:29,563
- You can open the door now. - Okay.

102
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:32,363
I'll open the door.

103
00:05:33,462 --> 00:05:35,633
(The door is finally open.)

104
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:36,702
Let's go inside.

105
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:40,472
(Ta-da)

106
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,613
It's really nice and warm, right?

107
00:05:45,613 --> 00:05:48,472
Yes, it's warm for now. Watch your head.

108
00:05:48,543 --> 00:05:50,142
I bumped my head as soon as I came in.

109
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:55,082
(Welcome to our new house.)

110
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,823
It's gotten bigger.

111
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,392
It's a lot bigger.

112
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:03,022
I think it's twice as big. Right, Dong Il?

113
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:07,233
(Can you tell the difference?)

114
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,462
- It's prettier too. - It's way prettier.

115
00:06:09,462 --> 00:06:10,462
Right.

116
00:06:10,962 --> 00:06:13,733
(Old house)

117
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:17,342
(New house)

118
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:18,402
It's so nice.

119
00:06:18,743 --> 00:06:23,113
You can tell it's better because you know how the old house was.

120
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:26,082
- Of course. It's amazing. - The new house is amazing.

121
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:27,352
- Compared to the old one... - The same goes for this part.

122
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:29,383
This is... Wow...

123
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:31,183
- You have to climb the ladder. - It looks spacious.

124
00:06:31,352 --> 00:06:33,652
There are definitely more spaces...

125
00:06:33,652 --> 00:06:35,392
for us to sleep comfortably.

126
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:37,722
You can sleep here or here. Si Wan can sleep here.

127
00:06:37,722 --> 00:06:40,063
There's a hidden space in this house.

128
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,762
- This is actually a bed. - I see.

129
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:44,832
- They made use of the whole space. - It looks tight now, right?

130
00:06:44,832 --> 00:06:46,702
- Yes. - If you open this...

131
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:47,933
If you open it...

132
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,743
- Open it, and... - I took it out.

133
00:06:50,303 --> 00:06:52,772
(What?)

134
00:06:53,743 --> 00:06:56,883
So if you set this up, there's extra space.

135
00:06:57,443 --> 00:06:59,952
The inside of the car transforms just like "Transformers".

136
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:03,852
- This is what we use to go up? - Oh, we use this?

137
00:07:03,852 --> 00:07:05,282
- Wow... - They designed it so well.

138
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,053
(The stairs were magically hidden.)

139
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,892
- It's so nice. - They built it well.

140
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:12,962
It's very sturdy too.

141
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,592
Wow, this is nice.

142
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:15,633
It's strong enough for you to sleep on.

143
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:23,543
(The 2nd floor's beds in the old house were quite small.)

144
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:28,142
(They were so small that even the guests were shocked.)

145
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,883
- Try going up. - So I go up this way...

146
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:31,883
If you go up there...

147
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:34,212
(But in the new house...)

148
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,722
(Spacious)

149
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,383
- You're right! - Yes, you lie down like that.

150
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:42,962
(The new bed is surprisingly comfortable and big.)

151
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:46,962
(There are 2 comfortable beds on the 2nd floor now.)

152
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:51,503
(Thanks to them, they can have deep sleep.)

153
00:07:55,972 --> 00:08:01,743
(It's so spacious that Si Wan can do a forward roll to go down.)

154
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:04,142
You tend to get cold easily, right?

155
00:08:04,512 --> 00:08:07,512
There's electric floor heating.

156
00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:08,512
There's even electric floor heating?

157
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:09,623
Put your foot in here. It's really warm.

158
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:10,782
No wonder it's so warm.

159
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:13,592
Nice! It's so nice! It'd be nice to sleep on the floor.

160
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:14,793
- I know! - Right.

161
00:08:14,993 --> 00:08:17,363
And there's a heater here.

162
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,733
- Here, on the floor. - There's even a heater? Amazing.

163
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,262
- It's really warm. - This is amazing.

164
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,573
The house won't be cold when you travel during winter.

165
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,842
(The electric floor heating guarantees warmth.)

166
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:33,142
(And if you just press the button, )

167
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:34,712
(hot air will pour out from below.)

168
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:36,243
- This is nice. - There are...

169
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:38,743
heating systems on the floor.

170
00:08:38,743 --> 00:08:39,852
(It won't be a problem to travel during winter, right?)

171
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,852
It's so nice.

172
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:42,582
(There's also CO detector and fire alarm.)

173
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:44,483
- They built it really well. - I agree.

174
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:47,193
(He's happy with the new house.)

175
00:08:47,752 --> 00:08:50,323
(Proud)

176
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:52,193
I feel like I've moved into a really nice house.

177
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:53,263
Totally.

178
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:55,033
It's nice from the start.

179
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,033
It's like I've moved into a nice house.

180
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,002
It feels like I've saved up like a miser...

181
00:08:58,002 --> 00:08:59,433
to buy this house.

182
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:00,903
- I know. - To move into a nice house.

183
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:01,903
That's right.

184
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:04,303
Dong Il, is it okay if I cry?

185
00:09:04,303 --> 00:09:05,372
Cry? Why?

186
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:07,173
Because our house is so nice.

187
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:08,173
You're crying again?

188
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,643
My father saved up for such a nice house.

189
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,513
- He's overwhelmed. - It's really touching.

190
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,553
It really is.

191
00:09:16,553 --> 00:09:18,523
I don't think we'll need to pitch a tent now.

192
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:20,653
No, you and I will need to sleep in a tent.

193
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:22,423
(Right...)

194
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:24,063
When there's so much space for us to sleep inside?

195
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:27,563
Why would we sleep in a tent when there's so much space?

196
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:32,263
Our first destination is Pyeongchang.

197
00:09:32,903 --> 00:09:34,073
- Pyeongchang? - Yes.

198
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:40,342
These days, we just want to go on a trip.

199
00:09:40,943 --> 00:09:42,813
Up hill and down dale,

200
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:45,712
we find a secluded mountain for our trip.

201
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,413
(Welcome!)

202
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:49,722
Hello. Hello, Dong Il.

203
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:52,452
(Full of delight)

204
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:56,023
(Bae Doo Na)

205
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:58,323
(Kim Dong Wook)

206
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:01,263
To the most beautiful front yard we've found,

207
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:05,033
(Kong Hyo Jin, Oh Jung Se)

208
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:08,673
we'll invite the people we adore.

209
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:10,472
(Jeon Hye Jin)

210
00:10:10,773 --> 00:10:13,143
(Kim You Jung)

211
00:10:14,443 --> 00:10:16,283
(The power is off again!)

212
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,313
(My goodness.)

213
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:19,783
(We're out of water!)

214
00:10:20,082 --> 00:10:22,382
(The rice isn't cooked, right?)

215
00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:25,452
(Si Wan!)

216
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:26,793
I was in charge of rice today?

217
00:10:26,923 --> 00:10:28,592
(He always blames others.)

218
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:32,193
But if our trip goes smoothly, it'd be unusual of us.

219
00:10:32,193 --> 00:10:34,563
(What's worse is that...)

220
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,903
(We need a new house.)

221
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:44,972
Sometimes, it gets cheerful that we dance.

222
00:10:46,872 --> 00:10:49,043
And sometimes, we give warmth to each other...

223
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:51,082
by becoming more intimate with each other.

224
00:10:51,982 --> 00:10:53,752
"I'm warning you, Joker."

225
00:10:53,882 --> 00:10:55,683
We will be building more memories...

226
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:57,882
on top of our memories.

227
00:10:57,882 --> 00:10:59,122
He keeps shaking like this.

228
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,193
Hello! Please look forward to House on Wheels Season 2!

229
00:11:03,193 --> 00:11:05,693
You'll join us on our trip, right?

230
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:08,462
A house warming party around the whole country,

231
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:09,502
House on Wheels.

232
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:13,403
The second season starts now.

233
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:31,653
(One day at the end of winter...)

234
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:34,193
(where it's still cold)

235
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,962
(Somewhere in Pyeongchang...)

236
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:43,763
(where winter still hasn't gone)

237
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:48,433
I thought winter was almost over,

238
00:11:48,903 --> 00:11:50,673
but it seems like it's just starting here.

239
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:51,702
(It seems like winter is just starting in Pyeongchang.)

240
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:53,813
- There's still snow, Dong Il. - Right.

241
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:56,982
(To see the last bit of snow before spring comes, )

242
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,242
You're right. This place...

243
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:01,013
My gosh, there's so much snow.

244
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:04,053
(the three of them have arrived at Pyeongchang.)

245
00:12:04,452 --> 00:12:07,452
Will there be some snow left when we arrive?

246
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,793
Won't it start snowing once we arrive?

247
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:12,122
You all look forward to snow, don't you?

248
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:14,362
- Snow? - How about you, Si Wan?

249
00:12:14,362 --> 00:12:17,033
- As for me, when it snows... - Yes.

250
00:12:17,033 --> 00:12:18,763
- I like to see it. - Right.

251
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:22,573
But then I get worried about my shoes left outside.

252
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:25,273
- What if they got drenched? - Goodness. He's worse than Hee Won.

253
00:12:25,273 --> 00:12:26,543
(He's three times worse than Hee Won.)

254
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:28,543
(Cackling)

255
00:12:28,913 --> 00:12:29,943
I also worried about that.

256
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:32,553
- What about the shoes outside? - My goodness.

257
00:12:32,553 --> 00:12:33,683
(They both put priority on safety.)

258
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:35,683
- Gosh, it's getting worse. - I mean...

259
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:41,923
Were winters colder in the past?

260
00:12:42,523 --> 00:12:43,992
I think it was colder.

261
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:45,523
Back then,

262
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:48,332
- we had the achievement test. - Yes.

263
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:50,962
- It was so cold on the test day. - Right.

264
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:53,602
I ruined the exam because the weather was so cold.

265
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:54,673
Gosh.

266
00:12:55,903 --> 00:12:56,972
The test...

267
00:12:56,972 --> 00:12:59,573
- He was supposed to make it to SNU. - I was trembling with cold.

268
00:13:01,742 --> 00:13:03,783
- Even if I had known the answer... - Goodness.

269
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,783
- My hands were shaking. - He was trembling...

270
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,553
- and marked one next to the answer. - Yes, next to the answer.

271
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,313
That's such a shame.

272
00:13:08,313 --> 00:13:10,053
I got a much lower score than I had expected.

273
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:13,592
When I look back, it was so cold that day too.

274
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:15,492
I ruined my scholastic aptitude test.

275
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:16,563
Did you?

276
00:13:16,693 --> 00:13:19,563
I couldn't make full use of my ability.

277
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:20,663
- That's how it is. - Yes.

278
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:23,933
I'm sorry I talked about the weather for nothing.

279
00:13:24,063 --> 00:13:26,433
I made you guys look silly.

280
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:31,742
The house is certainly stable.

281
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:32,972
- It is, right? - Yes.

282
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:34,112
It is stable.

283
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:37,882
When seen from the front, you won't notice the car behind.

284
00:13:37,882 --> 00:13:39,212
(Steady and stable, the House on Wheels)

285
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:41,683
- Right. On our way there... - Yes?

286
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:46,092
I stayed here for quite a while when I shot "Take Off".

287
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:49,092
I also shot other dramas or films here, and there's a place I go to.

288
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:52,023
If you boil a soup full of dried pollack head,

289
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,862
- you can make a fish stock. - I see.

290
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:58,303
- Like dried pollack hangover soup? - Yes, dried pollack hangover soup.

291
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:00,702
This is the place.

292
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:01,803
(They're going to buy groceries at Dong Il's favorite place.)

293
00:14:01,803 --> 00:14:05,602
- Put on your masks. - First, it's a dried pollack store.

294
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:06,643
Yes.

295
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,513
- Hello. - Hello.

296
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:09,842
- Hello. - Welcome.

297
00:14:10,712 --> 00:14:12,143
(Pyeongchang's stylish owner greets them gladly.)

298
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,053
You still have your hair dyed.

299
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:16,653
It's good to see you. Welcome.

300
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:19,722
- I want to make... - Yes.

301
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:21,893
- I see. - thick dried pollack soup for them.

302
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:23,823
Here it is. This is what I was looking for.

303
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,793
Should I put these in a pot and boil them over and over?

304
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:30,232
Yes, with these. Just like when you make beef broth,

305
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:32,362
boil them to make broth.

306
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:34,573
(It's an essential ingredient for dried pollack hangover soup.)

307
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:37,073
Do you have the Korean thistle?

308
00:14:37,073 --> 00:14:38,472
- Korean thistle? - Is this it?

309
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:41,212
- Yes. - I'll make Korean thistle rice.

310
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:42,273
Oh, great!

311
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:46,352
(Korean thistle rice full of savory aroma)

312
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,852
And this is dried pollack sikhae.

313
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:49,452
- This one? - Yes. It's fermented dried pollack.

314
00:14:49,452 --> 00:14:50,722
(Dried pollack sikhae)

315
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,452
- This one is... Yes. - So it's sikhae.

316
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:54,752
You can eat it with napa cabbage or tofu.

317
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:56,293
(Season dried pollack with chili powder and ferment it.)

318
00:14:57,523 --> 00:15:00,763
You introduce us to the local delicacy.

319
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:02,533
(Dried pollack sikhae is a delicacy of Gangwon Province.)

320
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:05,163
- I'll give it a try. - Yes.

321
00:15:05,563 --> 00:15:07,472
But if it's too hard, we'll come here to eat.

322
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:09,702
- Sure, come to eat. - That sounds like a good idea.

323
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:11,573
- Goodbye. - Thank you.

324
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:13,972
- Take care until we meet again. - Yes, I will.

325
00:15:14,273 --> 00:15:16,112
(Ringing)

326
00:15:16,212 --> 00:15:18,082
- Hello. - Hello.

327
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:21,013
- How do you do? - What?

328
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:22,823
Did you leave? Wait. Have you been sleeping?

329
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:25,222
No, I wasn't sleeping. I woke up early.

330
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:27,092
- Did you? Okay. - Yes.

331
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,923
Hello, Doo Na. I'm Sung Dong Il.

332
00:15:30,023 --> 00:15:31,693
Hello, Dong Il.

333
00:15:32,423 --> 00:15:35,462
(Today's housewarming guest is Bae Doo Na.)

334
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:39,732
(She has stolen our hearts with her top-class acting.)

335
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:42,673
(She has now become a world star.)

336
00:15:43,073 --> 00:15:45,202
(Actor Bae Doo Na)

337
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:49,612
(She recently filmed a movie with Hee Won.)

338
00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:51,443
- Hello. - Goodness.

339
00:15:51,443 --> 00:15:54,153
Thank you. You're going to be here because you count on Hee Won?

340
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,612
(Bursting into laughter)

341
00:15:56,283 --> 00:15:57,622
It'll be tougher than you think.

342
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,553
(Unceasing laughter)

343
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:02,293
I was so happy to know that you're coming.

344
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:04,693
- Really? - I've always wanted to see you.

345
00:16:04,823 --> 00:16:06,862
- Me too. - I wanted to see your big eyes.

346
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:10,033
- Is that so? - Yes. So different from Hee Won's.

347
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:12,362
I'll keep my eyes opened wide.

348
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,173
What are the things you like?

349
00:16:14,602 --> 00:16:16,773
- I've never... - Yes.

350
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:19,342
- camped before. - I see.

351
00:16:19,342 --> 00:16:21,573
- Hee Won will teach you a lot. - Yes.

352
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:22,573
(Will I?)

353
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:27,382
So whenever I saw camping photos, I've always wanted to try...

354
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:29,112
- I see. - a barbecue.

355
00:16:29,582 --> 00:16:30,852
A barbecue.

356
00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:32,053
- Okay. - Yes.

357
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:33,622
- Can we do that? - A barbecue.

358
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:35,452
- Doo Na. - Yes?

359
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,893
Do you know Si Wan?

360
00:16:37,722 --> 00:16:38,893
- Hello. - Si Wan.

361
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:39,893
- Im Si Wan. - Hello.

362
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:41,992
Hello. This is Si Wan.

363
00:16:42,193 --> 00:16:44,132
- Hi. How have you been? - Good.

364
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:45,403
- It's really... - She knows you well.

365
00:16:45,502 --> 00:16:48,073
- It's been so long. - It's been a really long time.

366
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,073
I was a complete rookie then.

367
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,673
I'm in your hands.

368
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:54,313
(Si Wan)

369
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:58,982
(Their relationship dates back to 10 years ago.)

370
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:03,622
(Young Doo Na and even younger Si Wan in "Gloria")

371
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:07,893
Gosh, you remember me. Thank you.

372
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,263
Of course I remember you. What are you talking about?

373
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:13,332
We'll make delicious food for you.

374
00:17:13,663 --> 00:17:15,933
- Thank you so much. How thoughtful! - Okay.

375
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:18,263
- Hold on. I have one thing to ask. - Yes.

376
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:19,632
Is it so cold right now?

377
00:17:19,632 --> 00:17:22,172
(Is it so cold right now?)

378
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,372
- Well... - You can move without difficulty.

379
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:29,983
- It is cold. - I see.

380
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,813
- Doo Na! - No, it's not. We can still move.

381
00:17:31,813 --> 00:17:32,912
You don't have to come.

382
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,582
- It's windy though. - Stay there. It's freezing here.

383
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:37,253
I can hear the sound of the wind from here.

384
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:38,523
It's freezing cold. You don't have to come.

385
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:40,723
- I got it. - It's quite cold.

386
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:43,723
No, it's because there are fans in the mountain.

387
00:17:44,892 --> 00:17:46,162
(It's cold, but you'll be fine.)

388
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:48,993
- I'll get prepared for the cold. - Right.

389
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:50,832
- You're right. Dress warmly. - To stay warm.

390
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,263
- I will. - Really.

391
00:17:52,263 --> 00:17:53,832
- Be safe. - Yes.

392
00:17:53,832 --> 00:17:55,273
- Yes. Bye. - Okay.

393
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:57,273
- See you soon. - I'll see you soon.

394
00:17:57,573 --> 00:18:00,172
She sounds very lively.

395
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:03,182
Let's go. Open the door.

396
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,713
(They came to a butcher's shop to realize Doo Na's wish: barbecue.)

397
00:18:04,713 --> 00:18:06,553
- Hello. - Hello.

398
00:18:08,112 --> 00:18:09,922
There are so many goodies.

399
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,553
(Excited)

400
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:13,223
Beef ribs.

401
00:18:13,323 --> 00:18:15,993
- Yes. - Could we have beef ribs?

402
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:21,832
(Giant)

403
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:24,162
(It's astonishing.)

404
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,632
(Slicing it into big pieces)

405
00:18:28,303 --> 00:18:29,642
(What dish will they make out of it?)

406
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,043
Great. It looks perfect.

407
00:18:33,672 --> 00:18:35,073
Gosh. This must be delicious.

408
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:36,713
- Thank you, Hee Won. - Goodness, gracious.

409
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:39,013
You treat your customer properly, Hee Won.

410
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:41,112
That's awesome.

411
00:18:41,182 --> 00:18:42,582
(They are heading to the front yard again.)

412
00:18:42,582 --> 00:18:45,053
Now... We're almost there, right?

413
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:46,823
- We're almost there, right? - Yes, we are almost there.

414
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:51,162
(The lane gets narrower...)

415
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,963
(as if to inform them of their arrival.)

416
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:58,203
- My goodness. - Oh, boy! Look at the trees.

417
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,573
It's surrounded by trees.

418
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,372
(They pass by a dense forest.)

419
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:03,902
Here we are, finally.

420
00:19:03,902 --> 00:19:05,043
(They drive even deeper into the woods.)

421
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:07,142
(Exclaiming)

422
00:19:09,243 --> 00:19:10,313
(Exclaiming)

423
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:16,253
Are we going to sleep here tonight? Awesome!

424
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:17,323
(Today's front yard...)

425
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,652
(that makes you exclaim in admiration.)

426
00:19:19,652 --> 00:19:25,263
(Fir forest in Mount Gyebang)

427
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:28,692
(In winterland Pyeongchang, )

428
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:31,533
(this place is deeply hidden like treasure.)

429
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:35,033
(Through the fir trees outside the window, )

430
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:38,142
(it's sky blue during the daytime, )

431
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:40,773
(and full of starlight at night.)

432
00:19:42,273 --> 00:19:46,213
(In the backyard, the fir forest surrounds the house.)

433
00:19:48,382 --> 00:19:53,293
(In the front yard, clear mountain stream trickles.)

434
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:57,192
(The last winter snowflakes...)

435
00:19:57,192 --> 00:20:02,293
(linger here to the very end.)

436
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:08,033
(It is full of fresh foods...)

437
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:13,973
(that are grown in nature.)

438
00:20:14,273 --> 00:20:17,882
(There are various choices of snacks.)

439
00:20:18,713 --> 00:20:23,523
(To top it off, you can taste fresh Korean beef.)

440
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:26,392
(It's our front yard today.)

441
00:20:27,553 --> 00:20:31,493
(Today, we live in a fir forest in Mount Gyebang.)

442
00:20:33,263 --> 00:20:35,332
- We are here anyhow. - Good job driving.

443
00:20:35,332 --> 00:20:37,662
- Good job, Hee Won. - You did a good job.

444
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:40,073
Let's get off. Goodness. Let me breathe the air.

445
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,102
(Anticipating)

446
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:44,773
(Safely filmed with the permission of a landowner.)

447
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:52,543
(They admire the view even before they get off the car.)

448
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:55,253
(Exclaiming)

449
00:20:58,783 --> 00:21:00,192
How do you like our first destination, Si Wan?

450
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,953
- For me, it can't be better. - Come over here.

451
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:03,493
- It's great. At here... - Isn't it good?

452
00:21:04,293 --> 00:21:06,993
- We are all alone here, right? - Right.

453
00:21:06,993 --> 00:21:08,063
We're all alone here.

454
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:09,362
It's good.

455
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:11,063
It's serene.

456
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:14,632
The wind is weaker than before.

457
00:21:14,632 --> 00:21:16,003
- Yes. - It's blocked by the forest.

458
00:21:17,303 --> 00:21:19,402
(The towering fir trees...)

459
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:22,672
(are our house's windbreak.)

460
00:21:30,553 --> 00:21:32,753
- Is it a mountain stream in front? - It's a mountain stream.

461
00:21:32,953 --> 00:21:34,523
- It's amazing. - Yes.

462
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,662
- I'd like to... - The mountain stream? Shall we go?

463
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,223
- The mountain stream. - Let's go to the mountain stream.

464
00:21:38,223 --> 00:21:39,963
It's even better with the mountain stream.

465
00:21:40,493 --> 00:21:42,592
- You can hear the trickling water. - Oh, boy!

466
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:45,803
- My goodness. The water is... - Yes, yes. Goodness.

467
00:21:46,632 --> 00:21:47,773
The water is so clear.

468
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,842
(Walking along the trickling water, you will find the mountain stream.)

469
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,073
Gosh. This is fantastic.

470
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:57,743
Ricefish could live here.

471
00:21:57,743 --> 00:21:58,743
(The water is clear enough for ricefish.)

472
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:02,352
- The water is so clear. - Right.

473
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,152
(The clear sound of the stream is the sound of melting snow.)

474
00:22:06,152 --> 00:22:08,053
Dong Il, there's still some snow left here.

475
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:10,892
There are snow and ice left on the floor.

476
00:22:11,223 --> 00:22:14,733
(There's still a trace of snow here and there.)

477
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,463
- I feel good just looking at it. - Yes.

478
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,033
Just looking at it is enough.

479
00:22:20,932 --> 00:22:22,273
Goodness.

480
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:26,303
Dong Il, it's great.

481
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,243
- Yes, it is great. - Truly.

482
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:31,543
I've felt heavy in my mind, actually.

483
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:35,513
(Listening to the babbling stream, he tries to ease his heavy heart.)

484
00:22:35,783 --> 00:22:37,953
- Let's go and pull over the car. - Yes.

485
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:39,323
Let's set it up.

486
00:22:39,323 --> 00:22:40,493
(After a walk, they start to get ready for the guest.)

487
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:42,223
First of all, we need to set it up.

488
00:22:42,223 --> 00:22:43,922
- It'll be fun. - I'll give it a try.

489
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:45,263
Go ahead. That's right.

490
00:22:49,132 --> 00:22:51,733
(It's perfect.)

491
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,432
- We should keep the food inside. - Right.

492
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:02,473
(Keep the food inside the house so that it won't freeze.)

493
00:23:02,473 --> 00:23:05,612
I'll leave them here for now.

494
00:23:07,882 --> 00:23:08,983
(On the outside, they are swiftly getting ready to set up a shelter.)

495
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:09,983
(Tarp)

496
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:12,852
(Hammer)

497
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:18,293
(To stay warm during winter, the household goods have increased.)

498
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:21,793
(But it's too cold.)

499
00:23:21,793 --> 00:23:22,993
It's freezing.

500
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:27,332
(2:30pm, current temperature: minus 9°C)

501
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:29,233
- My gosh. - Gosh, it's...

502
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,672
It's too windy.

503
00:23:31,872 --> 00:23:35,773
(Hee Won is taking something out from the car.)

504
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:41,053
Dong Il!

505
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,253
Dong Il, here are earmuffs.

506
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,223
Oh, really? Thank you.

507
00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:47,592
- Si Wan. - Yes.

508
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,852
The color is...

509
00:23:48,852 --> 00:23:51,862
I made a clean sweep of earmuffs.

510
00:23:52,192 --> 00:23:53,463
I tried to match the colors, but there were only two colors.

511
00:23:53,463 --> 00:23:54,632
- The color... - They only had two colors.

512
00:23:54,632 --> 00:23:56,493
- Take that color. - This matches my clothes.

513
00:23:56,493 --> 00:23:58,003
- Have that color. Should I have it? - Take this.

514
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,203
Thank you so much.

515
00:23:59,203 --> 00:24:00,703
- It's like a luxury shop. - Oh, man!

516
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:03,703
- It's a luxury. - You've spent so much money on it.

517
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:05,372
- Seriously. - We look luxurious.

518
00:24:05,372 --> 00:24:06,573
My ears are hot.

519
00:24:07,073 --> 00:24:08,473
Look. It's all right.

520
00:24:08,473 --> 00:24:09,842
And then...

521
00:24:10,612 --> 00:24:13,382
This one shuts out the wind.

522
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:14,983
That's right. It's...

523
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:17,152
We've never tried it before.

524
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,553
- A shelter? - I think we should set it up.

525
00:24:20,553 --> 00:24:21,823
(What's this equipment that they are unfamiliar with?)

526
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:26,763
(It's a must-have item to stay warm outdoors and in cold winter.)

527
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:32,362
(The brand new winter item of the House on Wheels: a shelter.)

528
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,973
These... We should connect each of these.

529
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,942
I think it should be like this.

530
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,872
- Here is a combined one. - Yes, it should have two in it.

531
00:24:40,013 --> 00:24:41,513
Divide it. Look.

532
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:43,013
We have these.

533
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:47,652
(Hee Won assembles it skilfully without hesitation.)

534
00:24:47,912 --> 00:24:49,082
(Spinning the pole)

535
00:24:49,082 --> 00:24:50,622
(Clang)

536
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,223
- This is... Hold on a moment. - That one?

537
00:24:54,053 --> 00:24:56,293
Look. Here it is.

538
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:58,662
- Dong Il, take this. - That one.

539
00:24:58,662 --> 00:25:00,092
1, 2, 3.

540
00:25:00,092 --> 00:25:02,233
We should pull it out. Pull it out.

541
00:25:02,493 --> 00:25:05,132
- It's a plugged one. - Is it plugged?

542
00:25:05,132 --> 00:25:06,162
- Yes. - This...

543
00:25:06,263 --> 00:25:09,803
My goodness! Hee Won has improved a lot.

544
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,602
Well, I just stuck the poles.

545
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:16,912
It's done, right?

546
00:25:17,842 --> 00:25:19,213
The longest one?

547
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:20,753
- The solid one? - Yes.

548
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:21,882
The thick one?

549
00:25:21,882 --> 00:25:23,723
(Next, they have to decide a position for the tentpoles.)

550
00:25:26,283 --> 00:25:27,953
- Hold on a second. - Okay.

551
00:25:29,592 --> 00:25:32,422
(Doubtful)

552
00:25:35,763 --> 00:25:36,803
Dong Il.

553
00:25:37,463 --> 00:25:38,803
- Dong Il. - What?

554
00:25:38,932 --> 00:25:41,203
(What are you doing?)

555
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,342
This must be the position. Hand me over the long one.

556
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:44,672
- The long one. - The long one.

557
00:25:44,672 --> 00:25:45,672
Is this it?

558
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:49,642
(Are we doing it right?)

559
00:25:49,743 --> 00:25:51,582
(Standing still)

560
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:53,243
Isn't it too high?

561
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:58,053
It is... Wait a second.

562
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,023
Hey, Hee Won. Come in here. Hold this.

563
00:26:00,823 --> 00:26:03,023
- Hold this. - How? Like this?

564
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:04,223
Is it too high?

565
00:26:04,922 --> 00:26:06,422
Should we take one away?

566
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,463
I don't have a clue.

567
00:26:09,493 --> 00:26:11,632
Let's take away the middle one.

568
00:26:11,632 --> 00:26:13,003
(Blinking)

569
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:15,033
Take it out. Take it away.

570
00:26:15,372 --> 00:26:16,533
I took it away.

571
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,842
(Both of them disappeared all of a sudden.)

572
00:26:18,442 --> 00:26:19,773
But it's too low now.

573
00:26:20,043 --> 00:26:22,672
It is, isn't it? I think we should place them all.

574
00:26:22,743 --> 00:26:24,082
Hang on.

575
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:27,983
- Let it go. - We should assemble it. One more.

576
00:26:27,983 --> 00:26:31,082
- Is it? - Yes, a while ago. One more cell.

577
00:26:31,082 --> 00:26:32,223
(What's happening?)

578
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:35,293
- It should look like this. - That's it.

579
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,023
- That's the right position. - It is, but...

580
00:26:37,023 --> 00:26:39,023
- Put it down. Is this right? - That's it.

581
00:26:39,023 --> 00:26:40,733
- This is it. - Yes.

582
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,932
(A sagging shelter)

583
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:44,033
Is it right?

584
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:47,503
It's right, isn't it? But it's too high.

585
00:26:48,132 --> 00:26:49,372
Let it go.

586
00:26:49,372 --> 00:26:51,273
(The shelter began to sag because its roof isn't tight.)

587
00:26:53,003 --> 00:26:55,813
- Then, Hee Won! - Yes?

588
00:26:55,813 --> 00:26:57,442
Hold it from the front.

589
00:26:57,442 --> 00:26:58,942
- Where? - Come here.

590
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:02,112
- Si Wan, this way. - Where's the front?

591
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,483
- Where's the front? You can't see? - No, I can't.

592
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,422
- Come here. - Where are you?

593
00:27:06,422 --> 00:27:07,823
- Hee Won, come here. - Are you there?

594
00:27:07,823 --> 00:27:09,122
You should be there.

595
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:10,422
- That's right. - Which position?

596
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:13,223
That's okay. It's all right. Don't talk too much.

597
00:27:13,362 --> 00:27:15,632
Come here. Come closer to me.

598
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:16,862
- This way? - Si Wan, you stay there.

599
00:27:16,862 --> 00:27:18,563
- I'm not going to move. - Yes, that's it.

600
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,102
- Are we there? - You can stay there, Hee Won.

601
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:22,632
This is it. This will be the standard point.

602
00:27:23,402 --> 00:27:25,973
- It's well-shaped now. - Is it?

603
00:27:27,573 --> 00:27:29,213
Dong Il, you said it will be easy.

604
00:27:29,213 --> 00:27:30,213
Did I?

605
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,813
- You said it will be easy. - Did I say it'll be easy?

606
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,823
Are we doing it right? Si Wan?

607
00:27:37,953 --> 00:27:41,352
(Chance to search the internet)

608
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:46,162
(How to set up a shelter.)

609
00:27:46,263 --> 00:27:50,033
"Setting up a shelter is quite easier than you think."

610
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,303
It's nonsense.

611
00:27:53,063 --> 00:27:54,503
The wind is blowing. Gosh.

612
00:27:54,503 --> 00:27:56,073
(It's a tough situation because of the wind.)

613
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:58,473
- Hee Won! Are you comfortable? - Yes.

614
00:27:58,473 --> 00:28:01,773
Yes. It's better in here.

615
00:28:01,773 --> 00:28:04,882
- Inside of it? - Yes, there's no wind here.

616
00:28:06,612 --> 00:28:08,152
I see.

617
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:09,253
(Did he finally grasp how to do it?)

618
00:28:09,253 --> 00:28:10,753
I know how to do it.

619
00:28:10,753 --> 00:28:12,682
Now I figured out how to install it.

620
00:28:12,682 --> 00:28:13,852
- You did? - Yes.

621
00:28:13,852 --> 00:28:16,023
- Put it down. Let it go. - Should we put it down for now?

622
00:28:16,023 --> 00:28:17,563
- Come out. Come out. - Should I go out?

623
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:18,922
- Yes. - Should I put it down?

624
00:28:18,922 --> 00:28:20,063
Yes.

625
00:28:21,963 --> 00:28:23,662
(Abandoning)

626
00:28:23,733 --> 00:28:26,003
We should hammer the four first. Right?

627
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:28,233
- At the end. Spread it out. - Right.

628
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:32,003
- 4 ends. Vertexes. - Yes, 4 ends.

629
00:28:32,003 --> 00:28:33,073
Hammer the nails at four vertexes first.

630
00:28:33,273 --> 00:28:35,842
(His definite gesture toward the vertexes)

631
00:28:36,043 --> 00:28:38,082
This is the vertex, so we don't have to remove it.

632
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:40,652
- It should come up like this. - You're right about it.

633
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,283
We should perhaps remove this.

634
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:44,852
Like this. There are four vertexes.

635
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:48,253
That's right. It's going smoothly because of you.

636
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:50,263
Hammer it first. Hammer the vertexes first.

637
00:28:50,263 --> 00:28:52,592
Yes, I'll give it a shot.

638
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:57,132
(Highly motivated)

639
00:28:57,233 --> 00:29:00,332
(It doesn't seem to progress.)

640
00:29:04,773 --> 00:29:07,073
(Si Wan...)

641
00:29:07,073 --> 00:29:09,273
(What are you doing?)

642
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:12,813
(He has a highly motivated attitude.)

643
00:29:13,082 --> 00:29:16,412
(But his skill negates his attitude.)

644
00:29:16,783 --> 00:29:18,622
What's with him? Hey.

645
00:29:18,783 --> 00:29:21,592
Hee Won will show you. Hee Won, show him how to hammer.

646
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:22,953
- My gosh. - I'm even worse than him.

647
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:24,122
Go ahead. Hurry.

648
00:29:24,323 --> 00:29:26,323
- He's going to take a whole day. - I'm not good at it.

649
00:29:28,063 --> 00:29:30,632
(Hammering on the ground?)

650
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,003
(They know how to install it, but the real problem is hammering.)

651
00:29:33,003 --> 00:29:34,632
- It's done. - It got in.

652
00:29:34,632 --> 00:29:37,243
That's it. Good. You were hitting the ground.

653
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,703
Well.

654
00:29:39,743 --> 00:29:40,743
(Groaning)

655
00:29:42,543 --> 00:29:44,043
Why? It doesn't work well?

656
00:29:44,642 --> 00:29:46,682
(Out of the blue, a woman approaches them.)

657
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:48,852
- My goodness! - My gosh!

658
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:50,852
(Today's housewarming guest, Bae Doo Na)

659
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:52,783
- You're here? - Yes.

660
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:54,553
- It's not going well? Hello. - Hello.

661
00:29:54,553 --> 00:29:56,392
- It's good to see you. - Well.

662
00:29:56,392 --> 00:29:58,862
- Welcome. Where are your gloves? - Yes.

663
00:29:58,862 --> 00:30:00,632
- I have them. - You can't just put it here.

664
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:01,963
It's slippery.

665
00:30:01,963 --> 00:30:04,063
(She's carrying heavy bags with both of her hands.)

666
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:08,033
(The first winter housewarming guest has arrived with a bright smile.)

667
00:30:08,803 --> 00:30:11,803
There's something here. Dong Il, what's this shape?

668
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:13,342
(Chuckling)

669
00:30:13,342 --> 00:30:15,342
(She already bursts into laughter.)

670
00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:17,382
(Keeps laughing)

671
00:30:19,043 --> 00:30:20,713
(Why? What's the matter?)

672
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:24,953
(You're here?)

673
00:30:25,152 --> 00:30:27,223
(Hello!)

674
00:30:27,723 --> 00:30:31,823
(A valued guest who has come all the way in the cold weather.)

675
00:30:33,223 --> 00:30:36,392
Hey, Hee Won. You should introduce her to us.

676
00:30:36,392 --> 00:30:39,862
(He has to hammer and greet the guest.)

677
00:30:40,503 --> 00:30:41,872
Goodness. Doo Na.

678
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:44,102
(At last, the guest has arrived before the shelter is ready.)

679
00:30:44,273 --> 00:30:46,273
- How have you been, Hee Won? - I'm good.

680
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:47,973
It looks like you have some trouble.

681
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:49,942
It's a big problem. It's going nowhere.

682
00:30:49,942 --> 00:30:52,513
Actually, it's for the best. You said you've wanted to camp.

683
00:30:52,513 --> 00:30:54,082
- I've really wanted to camp. - Good.

684
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:55,483
Do it together. You can teach her.

685
00:30:55,483 --> 00:30:57,783
- He's done it all so far. - I don't have a clue.

686
00:30:57,783 --> 00:30:59,323
What have you done?

687
00:30:59,323 --> 00:31:02,092
- What are you doing? - Well, there are four spots.

688
00:31:02,092 --> 00:31:03,553
We'll put the poles in them.

689
00:31:03,793 --> 00:31:05,092
- Aren't you cold? - No, I'm not. I'm okay.

690
00:31:05,092 --> 00:31:07,033
- No, no. - No, go inside. You must be cold.

691
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:10,432
- Your face turned red. - But I'm fine.

692
00:31:10,432 --> 00:31:13,033
And gloves... You don't have gloves like these?

693
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:14,832
- I have gloves. - You have gloves?

694
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:16,332
Hurry. Go bring your gloves.

695
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,642
(She steps inside the house to get her gloves.)

696
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,203
It'll be warm if you go inside.

697
00:31:20,203 --> 00:31:22,513
- Yes, stay inside. Stay. - Stay inside. Stay there for now.

698
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:25,442
Hold on. I'll just get my gloves.

699
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:27,612
- Should I take off my shoes? - Yes.

700
00:31:27,882 --> 00:31:30,823
- It's the house, you know. - Yes, it's the house.

701
00:31:30,823 --> 00:31:33,523
(Please take off your shoes in the house.)

702
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:35,652
(Skipping)

703
00:31:36,152 --> 00:31:39,023
We have some stuff at the entrance.

704
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:42,033
- These are... - Oh, boy! It's pretty.

705
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,963
It's a brand new house.

706
00:31:43,963 --> 00:31:46,703
I can see it is. Windows weren't this big before.

707
00:31:46,703 --> 00:31:48,233
- In season one. - That's right.

708
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:49,773
- How pretty! - We can use these.

709
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:51,942
(Looking around)

710
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:55,043
(Here and there)

711
00:31:55,973 --> 00:31:57,612
My goodness! It's awesome.

712
00:31:58,043 --> 00:31:59,483
Goodness, gracious!

713
00:31:59,713 --> 00:32:03,953
(In the eyes of a camping beginner, everything looks amazing.)

714
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,652
(Dishes look suddenly unusual.)

715
00:32:06,983 --> 00:32:10,023
(The locking device of the closet is highly amazing.)

716
00:32:10,192 --> 00:32:13,563
(So many interesting things...)

717
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,332
(Even for the normal sink water...)

718
00:32:16,632 --> 00:32:18,533
(Amazed)

719
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:21,073
(What did you do? How did you do it?)

720
00:32:21,632 --> 00:32:25,872
(She has a lot of questions.)

721
00:32:26,773 --> 00:32:31,342
(This guest has so many things she wants to do.)

722
00:32:32,412 --> 00:32:38,852
(Let's see what's to come for her, a beginner in everything.)

723
00:32:39,483 --> 00:32:41,192
Although we have a guest,

724
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,092
we can't even greet her properly because of this tent.

725
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,592
The greeting comes first, but because of this tent...

726
00:32:47,862 --> 00:32:48,862
It's snowing.

727
00:32:48,862 --> 00:32:51,503
(It's even snowing.)

728
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:54,203
This is so cold.

729
00:32:54,203 --> 00:32:55,203
(It's getting colder.)

730
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:58,073
(The guest is heading out before the tent is completed.)

731
00:32:58,073 --> 00:32:59,273
This is done.

732
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:01,213
No, it's supposed to come up here.

733
00:33:02,612 --> 00:33:05,182
(Oh, my gosh.)

734
00:33:07,483 --> 00:33:11,553
Why did you restart camping in this deadly cold winter?

735
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,152
I said that I didn't want to come.

736
00:33:13,753 --> 00:33:15,892
I asked him to do this in September, but...

737
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:17,563
(He's pretending he didn't hear it.)

738
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:19,422
- Does it fit in? - Yes.

739
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,632
- Oh, my... - Your hands must be cold.

740
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:24,362
- The gloves... - Do you have gloves?

741
00:33:24,362 --> 00:33:25,832
I didn't bring any gloves.

742
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:27,003
I will get you gloves.

743
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:28,473
- Si Wan has them. - Just a moment.

744
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,803
I'm okay.

745
00:33:29,803 --> 00:33:31,543
Your hands are even red.

746
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,372
- Are they? - What about the jacket?

747
00:33:33,743 --> 00:33:35,342
It is warm enough.

748
00:33:35,342 --> 00:33:37,073
- What are you saying? - It does not seem warm.

749
00:33:37,073 --> 00:33:40,112
- You guys are... - Do we have a padding jacket?

750
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:42,513
- A padding jacket? - You have a long one.

751
00:33:42,513 --> 00:33:43,513
Seriously, I am not cold.

752
00:33:43,513 --> 00:33:44,953
You are not warm enough.

753
00:33:44,953 --> 00:33:46,523
We can't let you stay that way.

754
00:33:46,882 --> 00:33:48,922
- Doo Na, wear these gloves. - The gloves...

755
00:33:49,053 --> 00:33:50,563
- See if they're the thick ones. - Thank you.

756
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:51,723
Si Wan brought them too.

757
00:33:52,293 --> 00:33:54,092
- Take the thicker ones. - Yes, the thicker ones.

758
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:55,632
I am sorry to trouble you from the beginning.

759
00:33:55,632 --> 00:33:57,602
- Not a problem. - Take the earmuffs too.

760
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,463
- Thank you very much. - Put them on now.

761
00:33:59,463 --> 00:34:01,533
(Hee Won is well-taking care of his guest.)

762
00:34:02,003 --> 00:34:04,902
(Thank you.)

763
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:08,043
I am starving to death.

764
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:09,043
(It's 3:30pm)

765
00:34:09,142 --> 00:34:11,813
We are almost done. Only this part is left.

766
00:34:12,213 --> 00:34:14,313
Let's do this. Are you tired?

767
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,983
- No, I'm not. I am good. - You shouldn't be tired for this.

768
00:34:17,382 --> 00:34:20,553
(There's no more time to delay.)

769
00:34:20,922 --> 00:34:24,062
(The members are rushing.)

770
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:27,993
(Where are Hee Won and Doo Na?)

771
00:34:28,493 --> 00:34:31,962
We can do this. Si Wan, you did a great job.

772
00:34:32,462 --> 00:34:35,402
I am so hungry. Did you eat any?

773
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:36,803
I ate lunch.

774
00:34:36,803 --> 00:34:38,103
Where did you eat?

775
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:39,272
I ate in the car.

776
00:34:39,272 --> 00:34:40,303
- In the car? - Yes, I did.

777
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:46,083
(Almost in a battle here)

778
00:34:46,842 --> 00:34:48,612
- What's this? - I know what it is.

779
00:34:48,752 --> 00:34:50,882
We need to tie and pull, both here and there.

780
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:53,152
We could be out of this tent.

781
00:34:53,152 --> 00:34:54,353
There's no reason we should stay in.

782
00:34:54,353 --> 00:34:55,823
But it is warm in here.

783
00:34:55,823 --> 00:34:56,922
You want to stay in?

784
00:34:57,323 --> 00:35:00,223
(Laughing)

785
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:03,163
Doesn't this part seem weird?

786
00:35:03,163 --> 00:35:05,103
- That's what I'm saying. - Yes, it is.

787
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,973
The middle is supposed to be higher. But, both ends are high.

788
00:35:10,203 --> 00:35:12,143
Let's take it out. Pull out the peg.

789
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,243
- Here? Pull this one out? - I want to get out.

790
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:14,342
Pull the one here.

791
00:35:14,672 --> 00:35:15,672
This is not the one.

792
00:35:15,672 --> 00:35:16,942
- Doo Na, come out this way. - Okay.

793
00:35:16,942 --> 00:35:18,882
- I can't be in there. - I am pulling it out.

794
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:20,882
- Wait a minute. - What's wrong with this part?

795
00:35:20,882 --> 00:35:22,013
What have you done?

796
00:35:22,283 --> 00:35:25,752
This is the problem. I didn't peg here.

797
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:28,353
- What is this? - This should be...

798
00:35:28,353 --> 00:35:30,152
What are we supposed to do with this?

799
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,862
When this is all done,

800
00:35:32,862 --> 00:35:34,562
- it will be very useful. - Is that so?

801
00:35:34,862 --> 00:35:35,862
Yes, it will be.

802
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,632
(This endless tenting...)

803
00:35:39,062 --> 00:35:40,163
Let's tie this up here.

804
00:35:40,163 --> 00:35:42,203
(Pulling the string to lift it up)

805
00:35:42,203 --> 00:35:43,902
Should we tie this up here?

806
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:46,973
- I don't know how to tie this. - Let's cut it in a proper length.

807
00:35:47,442 --> 00:35:49,873
Boy scouts do this, don't they?

808
00:35:49,873 --> 00:35:51,243
They do.

809
00:35:51,243 --> 00:35:52,842
Are there boy scouts these days?

810
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,083
Boy scouts? Yes, there are.

811
00:35:55,312 --> 00:35:57,083
It's just not among us.

812
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,922
(Laughing)

813
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:00,993
I was a boy scout.

814
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:03,053
- For real? - Really? That's cool.

815
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:05,763
I wonder why they didn't teach this. Maybe I forgot?

816
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,433
Maybe this tent is with a new technique.

817
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:08,433
(It must be the latest tent.)

818
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:12,603
(The shelter starts to take its shape.)

819
00:36:12,732 --> 00:36:16,103
My knees have a limited capability. I can't use them more than 20 times.

820
00:36:16,303 --> 00:36:17,542
Let me do it.

821
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,842
I will do it. I want to give it a try.

822
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:22,373
You do? That's good.

823
00:36:22,473 --> 00:36:23,513
It will relieve my stress.

824
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:24,712
- Doo Na, nail it down here. - Give it a try.

825
00:36:25,842 --> 00:36:27,312
- Like this? - Hold the thing for her.

826
00:36:27,382 --> 00:36:29,583
Like this. Okay.

827
00:36:29,683 --> 00:36:30,853
(Light hammering at first)

828
00:36:30,853 --> 00:36:31,882
At first like this...

829
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,152
She's doing great.

830
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:35,152
(Now the real hammering comes.)

831
00:36:35,853 --> 00:36:38,163
(Powerful)

832
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:41,292
- Hey, Si Wan. - Me?

833
00:36:41,592 --> 00:36:43,333
Look at her.

834
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,002
Oh, my gosh.

835
00:36:46,002 --> 00:36:47,132
(Laughing)

836
00:36:48,002 --> 00:36:49,632
Have you been stressed out?

837
00:36:50,703 --> 00:36:52,643
- Oh, my gosh. - This is good.

838
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,743
We can't even see the head of the peg.

839
00:36:55,842 --> 00:36:57,243
(Laughing)

840
00:36:57,243 --> 00:36:58,312
This is fun.

841
00:36:59,513 --> 00:37:01,413
Should I do this one as well?

842
00:37:02,212 --> 00:37:05,123
Yes, that one. You can do them all.

843
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,252
- Like this? - Yes.

844
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:08,522
- Oh, my... - A little more.

845
00:37:09,422 --> 00:37:10,623
(Warming up)

846
00:37:10,623 --> 00:37:11,893
This is good.

847
00:37:12,623 --> 00:37:15,263
(Fixing in first)

848
00:37:15,732 --> 00:37:17,192
- Take off your hands. - Is it fixed?

849
00:37:17,192 --> 00:37:19,263
- Okay. - Wait for it.

850
00:37:19,263 --> 00:37:21,973
- Finally, it's my time. - Let's get this done.

851
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,502
(Hammering right on the head)

852
00:37:24,603 --> 00:37:25,973
You are so good.

853
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,212
(Hammering down with a big smile)

854
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,942
I'm having so much fun.

855
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:32,312
(She's becoming scary.)

856
00:37:32,413 --> 00:37:33,783
You are so good.

857
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:35,513
(Speeding up)

858
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:39,083
(The peg is getting pushed in.)

859
00:37:40,053 --> 00:37:42,152
It looks like you came for this.

860
00:37:42,152 --> 00:37:43,223
I like it.

861
00:37:44,823 --> 00:37:47,062
(Not moving)

862
00:37:50,663 --> 00:37:51,732
Look at him.

863
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,203
Do you see that? It's not going to work.

864
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:55,632
Hee Won, stop it.

865
00:37:55,632 --> 00:37:57,573
- Let her do it. - What?

866
00:37:57,573 --> 00:37:59,603
Let her do that. You come here.

867
00:37:59,703 --> 00:38:01,672
- Should I do it? - Watch how she does it.

868
00:38:01,672 --> 00:38:03,812
Hee Won, Doo Na should do the hammering.

869
00:38:03,812 --> 00:38:04,913
I will do it.

870
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:06,212
This is tough for her.

871
00:38:06,212 --> 00:38:09,152
Just watch her and see who's better.

872
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,982
It is tough but also fun.

873
00:38:10,982 --> 00:38:11,982
Try it.

874
00:38:14,323 --> 00:38:16,353
Look how fast the peg gets in.

875
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,393
(I see.)

876
00:38:23,192 --> 00:38:24,303
(Having so much fun hammering)

877
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:27,033
It's funny. It makes me laugh to see the peg getting in.

878
00:38:28,402 --> 00:38:29,632
I wonder why I couldn't do it.

879
00:38:30,533 --> 00:38:32,603
- Do this one here. - No problem.

880
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:33,873
- Hey, Doo Na. - Yes.

881
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,612
This one needs some work.

882
00:38:36,573 --> 00:38:38,513
(The guest is in charge as usual.)

883
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,583
(All the way in)

884
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:41,612
It's almost done.

885
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:43,283
(Focused on the hammering with the lips tight)

886
00:38:43,913 --> 00:38:46,723
(Getting it perfect even with one hand)

887
00:38:46,922 --> 00:38:48,752
- With just one hand. - That's great.

888
00:38:48,752 --> 00:38:50,763
- So good. - It's satisfying.

889
00:38:51,192 --> 00:38:52,192
She is good.

890
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:55,232
It's all done.

891
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:57,663
- Okay. - Thank you all.

892
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,402
- Should we go in? - Let's open it.

893
00:39:00,703 --> 00:39:02,833
- Open it. - Open up.

894
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,402
(Excited)

895
00:39:06,672 --> 00:39:07,712
No energy.

896
00:39:08,073 --> 00:39:11,312
(Welcome to the shelter.)

897
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:14,482
(Hearts beating)

898
00:39:14,953 --> 00:39:17,922
I'm tired. Help him out.

899
00:39:18,283 --> 00:39:19,823
You go in first.

900
00:39:19,823 --> 00:39:21,252
(Flapping)

901
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:25,522
(Automatic door?)

902
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:28,163
(I still like this.)

903
00:39:28,393 --> 00:39:30,462
(Walking into the open shelter)

904
00:39:30,462 --> 00:39:32,462
- I like it. - What is this?

905
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:34,902
It's warm in here.

906
00:39:35,732 --> 00:39:38,542
It is too wide open. Isn't it?

907
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,842
- Too much... - It's too wide open.

908
00:39:39,842 --> 00:39:41,913
- Dong Il, is it the right way? - Yes, it is.

909
00:39:42,873 --> 00:39:44,342
We worked that hard for this?

910
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,812
It is too cold to be out there,

911
00:39:46,812 --> 00:39:49,152
- so we can have the bonfire here. - I see.

912
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:52,723
- A bonfire? It would be nice here. - We will do it.

913
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,882
(We'll do everything for you.)

914
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:56,522
I really wanted to do this.

915
00:39:57,092 --> 00:39:58,163
It's cold.

916
00:39:58,163 --> 00:39:59,163
(It seems warmer in the house.)

917
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:03,362
(Doo Na is also running into the warm house.)

918
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:04,962
It's really warm in here.

919
00:40:05,232 --> 00:40:07,002
- Seriously. - You guys stay in.

920
00:40:07,002 --> 00:40:08,002
Okay.

921
00:40:09,132 --> 00:40:12,172
(Home is always better than a shelter.)

922
00:40:12,172 --> 00:40:13,342
- What do we do? - It's really...

923
00:40:13,342 --> 00:40:16,612
(Si Wan is making a space for Doo Na.)

924
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:18,982
Dong Il.

925
00:40:19,783 --> 00:40:22,712
Should I make some ramyeon?

926
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:23,752
- I'm very hungry. - Yes.

927
00:40:23,752 --> 00:40:24,783
(A happy face)

928
00:40:24,783 --> 00:40:25,853
Ramyeon?

929
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,092
Let's just eat whatever.

930
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,092
- Right? - Yes.

931
00:40:29,953 --> 00:40:31,022
Just do it.

932
00:40:31,422 --> 00:40:33,562
- I will boil some water. - Yes.

933
00:40:34,022 --> 00:40:35,933
Are you making ramyeon? It must be delicious.

934
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,462
Yes. I am making jjajang ramyeon.

935
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:41,473
I will try Chef Lee's recipe.

936
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,073
I will take some rest here.

937
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:46,542
Warm your body up.

938
00:40:48,073 --> 00:40:51,013
My lips are frozen. It's even hard to speak.

939
00:40:52,342 --> 00:40:53,482
Look at my nose.

940
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:55,953
It's very red.

941
00:40:56,953 --> 00:40:58,252
(Worried)

942
00:40:58,252 --> 00:40:59,252
Because of the cold?

943
00:40:59,382 --> 00:41:01,123
I am actually not that cold.

944
00:41:01,123 --> 00:41:03,723
Are you not? But your nose is telling me...

945
00:41:04,092 --> 00:41:05,993
how cold you are.

946
00:41:07,362 --> 00:41:08,533
Hey, nose. Get yourself together.

947
00:41:09,393 --> 00:41:10,632
I'll put some meat and onion.

948
00:41:10,632 --> 00:41:12,862
You put meat in ramyeon?

949
00:41:12,962 --> 00:41:14,103
- Yes. - That's awesome.

950
00:41:14,103 --> 00:41:15,703
- Isn't it? - It sounds good.

951
00:41:15,703 --> 00:41:16,703
It is.

952
00:41:16,703 --> 00:41:19,143
I will warm up my nose.

953
00:41:20,303 --> 00:41:24,342
(Si Wan looks lost.)

954
00:41:26,513 --> 00:41:28,812
I can't find spoons. Spoons?

955
00:41:29,783 --> 00:41:31,083
Where are spoons?

956
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:32,382
(It's a big deal to find spoons.)

957
00:41:32,382 --> 00:41:33,382
Spoons.

958
00:41:34,152 --> 00:41:36,792
Where is the potholder?

959
00:41:37,522 --> 00:41:39,993
(He is new to the kitchen, so he's not used to it yet.)

960
00:41:39,993 --> 00:41:41,732
How does this work?

961
00:41:42,263 --> 00:41:43,732
You are also new to the kitchen.

962
00:41:43,732 --> 00:41:44,803
Yes, I am.

963
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:48,033
I would like to show you around the house.

964
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:50,402
But I need to...

965
00:41:50,533 --> 00:41:52,473
figure out this first.

966
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:57,342
(Quietly approaching)

967
00:41:58,712 --> 00:42:00,442
The pot must be here.

968
00:42:00,442 --> 00:42:01,712
(Who is the guest here?)

969
00:42:02,013 --> 00:42:04,453
(A self-touring guest)

970
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:07,453
What are these here?

971
00:42:07,453 --> 00:42:08,652
(Checking out the spice jars fixed on the wall.)

972
00:42:09,453 --> 00:42:11,062
There's a lot of stuff here.

973
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:12,823
(They look at the goods inside the refrigerator of the new house.)

974
00:42:13,192 --> 00:42:14,933
There's a bed up here as well.

975
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:15,933
(She identified the two-room bedroom.)

976
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,562
- It's so cool, right? - 1, 2. Right.

977
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:23,073
(When the guests are looking around the house...)

978
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:29,712
- You go in first. - Okay.

979
00:42:30,272 --> 00:42:32,482
- This way? - Yeah.

980
00:42:33,013 --> 00:42:36,683
(They are moving it while making all kinds of sounds.)

981
00:42:36,783 --> 00:42:38,123
Okay, set it up on the side.

982
00:42:38,382 --> 00:42:40,183
Set it up, find the right position, and then lay it down.

983
00:42:40,453 --> 00:42:41,553
Use your feet.

984
00:42:41,922 --> 00:42:42,993
Be careful of your hands.

985
00:42:44,223 --> 00:42:45,292
It's done, right?

986
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:46,792
(They finished the deck with their low stamina.)

987
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:50,433
Shouldn't it be more comfortable than the previous trips?

988
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:51,803
- It seems more difficult. - Right?

989
00:42:52,033 --> 00:42:53,333
It's so much more tiring!

990
00:42:54,632 --> 00:43:01,172
(Endless chores)

991
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:04,042
I'm exhausted.

992
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:05,743
(Completely out of energy)

993
00:43:05,882 --> 00:43:08,513
(Dead tired)

994
00:43:08,513 --> 00:43:09,652
- Dong Il. - Yes?

995
00:43:09,812 --> 00:43:12,252
I guess we can't do anything about the wind from this direction, right?

996
00:43:12,283 --> 00:43:13,882
- Where? - Here.

997
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,292
The wind doesn't blow here, does it?

998
00:43:15,853 --> 00:43:17,252
(Yes, it does.)

999
00:43:17,252 --> 00:43:18,362
Oh, about this much.

1000
00:43:19,092 --> 00:43:20,263
It gets blocked.

1001
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:21,292
(Shaking)

1002
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:23,933
(Never mind...)

1003
00:43:24,263 --> 00:43:26,902
- The chair is lighter than before. - Yes.

1004
00:43:26,902 --> 00:43:29,473
- The floor is lighter as well. - Yes.

1005
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:31,143
(Absentmindedly)

1006
00:43:31,502 --> 00:43:32,573
It is nice though.

1007
00:43:33,373 --> 00:43:34,573
Right?

1008
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:37,073
(Evades answering)

1009
00:43:37,172 --> 00:43:39,243
It was tiring, but now that we've set it up, it's nice.

1010
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:40,743
Right?

1011
00:43:40,982 --> 00:43:42,982
- Right? - Yes.

1012
00:43:44,382 --> 00:43:45,823
To be honest, I don't know.

1013
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,382
(To be honest, I don't know what's better.)

1014
00:43:47,853 --> 00:43:50,323
(She's still calming her nose.)

1015
00:43:50,893 --> 00:43:53,022
Will my nose have calmed down?

1016
00:43:53,022 --> 00:43:54,592
- Oh, it has. - Let me see.

1017
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:56,592
- It calmed down. - Yeah, it calmed down.

1018
00:43:56,692 --> 00:43:59,303
Wow, that actually does calm it down.

1019
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,303
(Doo Na's nose-thermometer has returned to normal.)

1020
00:44:00,303 --> 00:44:01,833
It actually does calm it down. That's so cool.

1021
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:04,772
Don't get angry. Why are you like that?

1022
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:08,672
(Doo Na finds the rice cakes they bought.)

1023
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:10,743
Oh, these look so good.

1024
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:13,643
Can I try this small piece?

1025
00:44:13,643 --> 00:44:14,953
- Of course. - Thank you.

1026
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:15,953
(The guest got hungry after hammering.)

1027
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:16,953
You can eat all of it.

1028
00:44:17,882 --> 00:44:19,922
You can eat everything there.

1029
00:44:21,053 --> 00:44:22,692
It's so good.

1030
00:44:23,192 --> 00:44:24,323
It's really good.

1031
00:44:24,922 --> 00:44:26,422
It's so soft.

1032
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,033
I'm so hungry...

1033
00:44:31,732 --> 00:44:33,833
- I'm getting almost dizzy. - Really?

1034
00:44:34,902 --> 00:44:38,272
(What is Si Wan's special jjajang ramyeon recipe?)

1035
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:40,073
Dishwashing and handwashing.

1036
00:44:40,073 --> 00:44:43,172
(Washing the hands thoroughly first)

1037
00:44:43,643 --> 00:44:46,112
Onions. Onions. Onions.

1038
00:44:46,413 --> 00:44:48,252
I need to peel these.

1039
00:44:48,683 --> 00:44:50,312
(Why did Si Wan pick up a pair of scissors?)

1040
00:44:50,413 --> 00:44:52,022
A pair of scissors and a pair of tongs.

1041
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,323
(Why did Si Wan pick up a pair of scissors?)

1042
00:44:54,823 --> 00:44:57,823
(Peeling onions with a pair of scissors?)

1043
00:44:57,962 --> 00:45:01,263
(After lightly cutting off the root, )

1044
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:04,132
(he quickly peels the onion with great skill.)

1045
00:45:04,132 --> 00:45:06,703
(That's not the end for Si Wan's love for scissors.)

1046
00:45:07,132 --> 00:45:10,703
(He chops the peeled onions with scissors.)

1047
00:45:11,203 --> 00:45:15,442
(Cutting away the onion with scissors)

1048
00:45:15,573 --> 00:45:18,683
(The shape might be crooked, but he's cutting them quickly.)

1049
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:22,283
(Passionately cutting with scissors)

1050
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:29,592
(Then he drops a large piece of meat.)

1051
00:45:30,053 --> 00:45:32,592
(This is good already...)

1052
00:45:35,393 --> 00:45:38,362
(After flipping the meat on time, )

1053
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:42,732
(he throws in the chopped onion...)

1054
00:45:42,732 --> 00:45:47,073
(for it to get cooked well.)

1055
00:45:47,473 --> 00:45:50,942
(Of course he cuts the meat with scissors as well.)

1056
00:45:51,143 --> 00:45:54,083
(Cutting the kimchi as well)

(Gulp)

1059
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,623
(He's so hungry, he can't help but salivate.)

1060
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:05,022
Did you not eat lunch?

1061
00:46:05,022 --> 00:46:06,163
- No. - Why not?

1062
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,592
The others haven't even eaten breakfast.

1063
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:10,333
Right? Why haven't they eaten?

1064
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:11,732
Time just passed by.

1065
00:46:12,433 --> 00:46:14,833
It wasn't that they planned not to.

1066
00:46:15,203 --> 00:46:16,803
The time just passed by.

1067
00:46:17,073 --> 00:46:18,643
They're working so hard.

1068
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:21,942
They're pitching a tent they haven't done before.

1069
00:46:21,942 --> 00:46:23,772
It's a tent they're pitching for the first time.

1070
00:46:23,772 --> 00:46:26,183
They didn't eat lunch because of the tent?

1071
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:27,183
Yes.

1072
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,413
- It's crazy, right? - Really?

1073
00:46:30,252 --> 00:46:32,223
(Glance)

1074
00:46:32,882 --> 00:46:35,953
I think I already know...

1075
00:46:36,723 --> 00:46:37,792
why people go camping.

1076
00:46:37,922 --> 00:46:38,993
Why?

1077
00:46:39,192 --> 00:46:40,922
The body gets tired,

1078
00:46:41,092 --> 00:46:42,333
and the stomach is always hungry.

1079
00:46:42,362 --> 00:46:45,732
- Isn't that why? - We're constantly hungry, right?

1080
00:46:45,902 --> 00:46:47,362
I keep getting hungry.

1081
00:46:47,603 --> 00:46:51,172
So whatever I eat, I think it'll be good.

1082
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:55,373
(Doo Na's cooking quickly to feed the others who are hungry.)

1083
00:46:55,973 --> 00:47:00,312
(She opened the ramyeon beforehand to cook it more easily.)

1084
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:01,652
Should I put these away?

1085
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,223
Stay inside the fridge.

1086
00:47:06,683 --> 00:47:09,292
(Struggling)

1087
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:13,862
You need to do this.

1088
00:47:13,862 --> 00:47:14,993
I see. Sorry.

1089
00:47:14,993 --> 00:47:16,792
(Is there anything else to do?)

1090
00:47:17,393 --> 00:47:19,603
Isn't this also a worktop?

1091
00:47:19,663 --> 00:47:22,073
Yes, it is. We need to expand it.

1092
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:23,272
(She finds the hidden worktop.)

1093
00:47:23,272 --> 00:47:24,272
Like this?

1094
00:47:25,103 --> 00:47:27,703
- Okay! I think I'm good at this. - Okay!

1095
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:28,812
Good, good.

1096
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,373
(She organizes the ingredients on the expanded worktop.)

1097
00:47:30,373 --> 00:47:31,882
- This is good. - Yeah.

1098
00:47:32,612 --> 00:47:34,042
- Thank you. - No problem.

1099
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:35,353
You all of a sudden...

1100
00:47:35,882 --> 00:47:38,422
I like doing something together much better.

1101
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:41,953
(When the meat and the onions are about to get fully cooked, )

1102
00:47:43,192 --> 00:47:47,163
(he puts in the jjajang ramyeon into the boiling water.)

1103
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:50,763
(He also shakes in the broken pieces.)

1104
00:47:51,632 --> 00:47:55,132
(Then he adds the jjajang ramyeon sauce...)

1105
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:59,772
(into the cooked meat and onions.)

1106
00:47:59,873 --> 00:48:02,513
(The most important step is...)

1107
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:07,283
(pouring in the pasta water to get the right sauce concentration.)

1108
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:11,422
(The jjajang sauce and the pasta water...)

1109
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:14,422
(meet to form a delicious sauce.)

1110
00:48:14,623 --> 00:48:17,323
(Once he evenly cooks everything, )

1111
00:48:17,792 --> 00:48:22,333
(Si Wan's jjajang sauce is complete.)

1112
00:48:23,092 --> 00:48:25,962
(Though the cooking is done, the chores have just begun.)

1113
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:29,172
(Doing the dishes right away)

1114
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,743
(He's gathering all the trash...)

1115
00:48:32,103 --> 00:48:35,643
(and organizing them into one place.)

1116
00:48:36,842 --> 00:48:40,442
(He's crumpling the plastic bottles to recycle them.)

1117
00:48:41,453 --> 00:48:43,612
(He cleans the kitchen thoroughly.)

1118
00:48:43,982 --> 00:48:45,953
(Clean)

1119
00:48:45,953 --> 00:48:47,683
(Continuously busy)

1120
00:48:47,683 --> 00:48:49,353
It's his first trip,

1121
00:48:49,353 --> 00:48:50,823
so he's going to be really enthusiastic.

1122
00:48:51,663 --> 00:48:52,763
That will slowly fade.

1123
00:48:53,663 --> 00:48:54,833
He'll become normal.

1124
00:48:55,362 --> 00:48:56,692
You're going to eat outside, right?

1125
00:48:56,692 --> 00:48:58,333
- No! - Are you crazy?

1126
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:00,303
We're going to eat inside.

1127
00:49:00,303 --> 00:49:01,533
- Inside? - We can't eat outside.

1128
00:49:01,902 --> 00:49:02,933
Okay.

1129
00:49:04,272 --> 00:49:05,772
Right, there was a table.

1130
00:49:06,002 --> 00:49:07,942
Next time, I'm going to cook.

1131
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:10,112
You're going to cook next week?

1132
00:49:10,272 --> 00:49:11,612
I can't do the work outside.

1133
00:49:11,612 --> 00:49:12,612
(Giving up on the work outside)

1134
00:49:12,612 --> 00:49:15,683
(The passionate Si Wan is setting the table without rest.)

1135
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,723
(This table has been...)

1136
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:22,022
It's so cold. We need to go inside quickly.

1137
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:26,592
(specially prepared to be wide, )

1138
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:30,393
(so everyone can eat comfortably inside the warm house.)

1139
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:33,132
(Once the table is set on the warm floor, )

1140
00:49:33,232 --> 00:49:36,132
(and the dishes are all placed...)

1141
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:39,373
Time to eat!

1142
00:49:39,873 --> 00:49:41,442
(They're finally eating for the first time at 4pm.)

1143
00:49:41,442 --> 00:49:43,212
It's time to eat!

1144
00:49:43,212 --> 00:49:44,272
Let's go!

1145
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,482
- Let's go in. - Let's go.

1146
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,482
(Rushing)

1147
00:49:46,482 --> 00:49:48,312
Hey! Let the main character go first.

1148
00:49:48,312 --> 00:49:51,053
I was going to open the door for her!

1149
00:49:51,312 --> 00:49:52,922
- No manners... - Doo Na, go in!

1150
00:49:53,152 --> 00:49:56,022
- I came quickly to do this! - Oh, okay. Okay.

1151
00:49:56,192 --> 00:49:57,922
Oh, that smells nice!

1152
00:49:59,462 --> 00:50:00,462
(Exclaiming)

1153
00:50:02,663 --> 00:50:05,462
(Si Wan's jjajang ramyeon has finally been completed.)

1154
00:50:08,502 --> 00:50:10,002
It's like actual jjajangmyeon.

1155
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:14,473
This is a way to make ganjjajang at home.

1156
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:16,573
It's like ganjjajang.

1157
00:50:16,573 --> 00:50:17,842
(If you pour the sauce made with the jjajang sauce...)

1158
00:50:17,842 --> 00:50:19,842
The ganjjajang made by Si Wan.

1159
00:50:20,143 --> 00:50:21,553
It's impossible for this to be not good.

1160
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:24,752
(Looking forward to it)

1161
00:50:25,882 --> 00:50:27,422
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1162
00:50:27,422 --> 00:50:29,792
- It's nothing special, but enjoy. - Thank you for the food.

1163
00:50:30,592 --> 00:50:33,522
- Since it's a different kitchen, - The meat is just... Wow.

1164
00:50:33,692 --> 00:50:37,232
- it was hectic. - Gosh, this meat is amazing.

1165
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:38,933
The meat is just amazing.

1166
00:50:40,703 --> 00:50:43,232
(Looking forward to it)

1167
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:46,703
(After wrapping a big piece of meat with the noodles, )

1168
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:49,212
(Doo Na puts it all into her mouth.)

1169
00:50:52,612 --> 00:50:53,683
It's so good.

1170
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,112
(Satisfied)

1171
00:50:55,683 --> 00:50:57,053
It's so good.

1172
00:50:58,252 --> 00:50:59,922
(Really?)

1173
00:51:00,022 --> 00:51:02,522
(So good)

1174
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:04,752
Wow, this is so good!

1175
00:51:04,752 --> 00:51:06,163
- Is it okay? - Yeah!

1176
00:51:07,562 --> 00:51:10,562
(Dong Il also takes a big bite.)

1177
00:51:10,893 --> 00:51:12,232
It tastes just like actual jjajangmyeon.

1178
00:51:12,232 --> 00:51:15,002
Did you really make this out of just the jjajang ramyeon sauce?

1179
00:51:15,002 --> 00:51:16,033
Yes, just the sauce.

1180
00:51:16,703 --> 00:51:18,542
Normal jjajangmyeon doesn't have...

1181
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:20,842
meat cut into such big pieces.

1182
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:23,712
But this has that texture, so it's so good.

1183
00:51:23,712 --> 00:51:24,772
Is it good?

1184
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:26,183
Wow, I'm so glad we got to eat this.

1185
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,583
- It's so good. - It's so delicious.

1186
00:51:28,982 --> 00:51:30,913
(Slurp)

1187
00:51:31,982 --> 00:51:34,252
(Slurp)

1188
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:40,562
(Before we know it, the house is full of slurping sounds.)

1189
00:51:41,323 --> 00:51:42,333
Wow.

1190
00:51:44,263 --> 00:51:47,103
(Proud)

1191
00:51:48,703 --> 00:51:50,973
Oh, I forgot! This tastes better if you add vinegar.

1192
00:51:51,172 --> 00:51:52,203
I was so busy, I forgot.

1193
00:51:52,203 --> 00:51:53,902
- Vinegar? - Yes. I forgot.

1194
00:51:55,143 --> 00:51:57,643
Do you want to try adding vinegar?

1195
00:51:58,143 --> 00:51:59,212
Vinegar?

1196
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,913
(Flustered)

1197
00:52:02,212 --> 00:52:03,853
I'm telling you. It's really good.

1198
00:52:04,013 --> 00:52:06,252
Where's the vinegar?

1199
00:52:06,422 --> 00:52:07,752
Oh, I put it over there.

1200
00:52:08,152 --> 00:52:09,252
- This? - Yes.

1201
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,123
(Precious)

1202
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:14,592
- With this? - Yes. Let's try.

1203
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,033
(He confidently pours his secret recipe, vinegar.)

1204
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:19,632
(Pouring)

1205
00:52:20,502 --> 00:52:23,573
- It's fine! - Is it okay to pour this much?

1206
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:24,942
It's fine, really.

1207
00:52:26,172 --> 00:52:27,373
(Full of doubt)

1208
00:52:27,373 --> 00:52:28,513
I'll try.

1209
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:32,513
(How does Si Wan's recommendation of adding vinegar taste like?)

1210
00:52:33,413 --> 00:52:35,783
It's better than you'd think, they go along pretty well.

1211
00:52:37,382 --> 00:52:38,482
It is, indeed.

1212
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,353
- Really? - Yes, it's pretty good.

1213
00:52:41,453 --> 00:52:43,652
(Would you like to try?)

1214
00:52:44,252 --> 00:52:46,592
It adds to the taste, really. It gets much softer too.

1215
00:52:46,592 --> 00:52:48,462
- Add vinegar here? - Yes.

1216
00:52:48,462 --> 00:52:50,663
Add slightly less than the amount you're thinking of.

1217
00:52:50,663 --> 00:52:52,703
I can't really control this well.

1218
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:54,663
- That's enough. - About this much.

1219
00:52:54,663 --> 00:52:56,033
(One by one, they start adding vinegar.)

1220
00:52:57,303 --> 00:52:58,603
(Approaching)

1221
00:52:58,603 --> 00:53:00,143
Would you like to add some vinegar?

1222
00:53:00,743 --> 00:53:03,513
(He grabs the bottle before Si Wan.)

1223
00:53:03,672 --> 00:53:06,042
(He's full of doubt.)

1224
00:53:06,413 --> 00:53:08,913
(Adding drops of vinegar)

1225
00:53:08,913 --> 00:53:11,212
I think you're only pretending to add some.

1226
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:13,823
No, I need to do it this way,

1227
00:53:14,522 --> 00:53:16,752
- or I'll end up adding too much. - Got it.

1228
00:53:17,252 --> 00:53:20,062
(In Season 1 last summer...)

1229
00:53:21,062 --> 00:53:22,833
(Should I add some pepper?)

1230
00:53:24,232 --> 00:53:25,663
(Pouring)

1231
00:53:26,502 --> 00:53:28,303
(Pepper bomb)

1232
00:53:29,232 --> 00:53:31,803
(Frozen)

1233
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,643
(I didn't think so much of it would pour out.)

1234
00:53:35,143 --> 00:53:36,373
(The pepper smell...)

1235
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:39,442
(The past memory of the pepper still pains him.)

1236
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,283
(He takes extra caution after that incident.)

1237
00:53:42,283 --> 00:53:43,453
This is enough.

1238
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:46,783
- It's really good. - Really?

1239
00:53:48,522 --> 00:53:50,223
(Oh my goodness!)

1240
00:53:51,192 --> 00:53:52,623
The smell hits my nose without warning.

1241
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:56,132
It's a bit like eating sour kimchi.

1242
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,933
I think it's the same reason why people eat sour kimchi.

1243
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:01,033
How is it for you?

1244
00:54:01,902 --> 00:54:04,732
- It's good. - It adds to the taste, right?

1245
00:54:05,103 --> 00:54:06,342
This is really good.

1246
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:09,672
- It adds to the taste, right? - Yes, it's refreshing.

1247
00:54:09,672 --> 00:54:10,913
It's good.

1248
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:13,942
Let's try this.

1249
00:54:13,942 --> 00:54:16,083
(It's time to taste the side menu.)

1250
00:54:16,312 --> 00:54:18,053
(Crepe they bought from the traditional market...)

1251
00:54:18,053 --> 00:54:19,183
(in front of the house)

1252
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,953
(Gangwon Province's savory buckwheat batter)

1253
00:54:22,252 --> 00:54:24,893
(It's full of spicy and salty kimchi!)

1254
00:54:25,493 --> 00:54:27,522
(Traditional market's buckwheat crepe...)

1255
00:54:27,522 --> 00:54:29,163
(full of grandmother's love)

1256
00:54:29,632 --> 00:54:32,232
(How does it taste?)

1257
00:54:32,632 --> 00:54:35,402
- Is it good? - It's good, it's very good!

1258
00:54:35,573 --> 00:54:37,073
- Is it? - Yes!

1259
00:54:37,172 --> 00:54:38,373
It's made by an elderly lady,

1260
00:54:38,373 --> 00:54:41,172
so it tastes like the ones back in the day.

1261
00:54:41,272 --> 00:54:42,272
I see.

1262
00:54:42,373 --> 00:54:44,342
I really think traditional market's food is my kind of food.

1263
00:54:45,312 --> 00:54:47,283
- I like it too. - It tastes so good.

1264
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,783
- Have you tried? - Yes.

1265
00:54:48,783 --> 00:54:50,212
- It's really tasty. - It's tasty.

1266
00:54:50,953 --> 00:54:52,823
It tastes fresh,

1267
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:56,553
and it doesn't taste like it's soaked in oil.

1268
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,192
(Satisfied)

1269
00:55:00,192 --> 00:55:01,362
It's good, right?

1270
00:55:02,692 --> 00:55:04,993
(Impressed)

1271
00:55:05,732 --> 00:55:08,573
(Even the side menu is perfect!)

1272
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:11,303
When we go on a trip, we always stop by traditional markets.

1273
00:55:11,402 --> 00:55:13,303
Traditional markets are the most fun places!

1274
00:55:14,203 --> 00:55:15,612
- You like traditional markets! - Yes.

1275
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:17,413
Then join us as the main cast.

1276
00:55:18,842 --> 00:55:20,913
(She just laughs.)

1277
00:55:22,783 --> 00:55:24,783
- I feel alive now. - Why?

1278
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:26,953
Because I finally ate something.

1279
00:55:27,982 --> 00:55:31,192
(They feel much more lively after eating.)

1280
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,522
After it becomes dark,

1281
00:55:34,522 --> 00:55:36,962
will we be able to endure it outside?

1282
00:55:38,632 --> 00:55:40,763
(Worried)

1283
00:55:40,933 --> 00:55:43,473
When we start grilling the meat, it'll have become night.

1284
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:45,703
No, we'll grill it right away.

1285
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:48,743
Are we going to grill the meat right after this?

1286
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:51,643
This is bad.

1287
00:55:52,212 --> 00:55:54,583
By "right away", it means around 9pm.

1288
00:55:54,982 --> 00:55:56,183
(Laughing)

1289
00:55:56,183 --> 00:55:59,252
The meaning of the phrase "right away"...

1290
00:55:59,252 --> 00:56:01,283
is slightly different here.

1291
00:56:05,993 --> 00:56:07,993
The sky's become so clear.

1292
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:09,993
Nice.

1293
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:13,763
(Really?)

1294
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:17,632
The east side surely is clearer.

1295
00:56:17,703 --> 00:56:18,973
You mean the sky?

1296
00:56:20,103 --> 00:56:24,172
(Once they're full, they're finally able to enjoy...)

1297
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,283
(the view of the front yard.)

1298
00:56:27,743 --> 00:56:30,882
(The clouds clear, and the hidden sun shows itself.)

1299
00:56:31,652 --> 00:56:36,652
(The warm sunlight is shone through the fir forest.)

1300
00:56:37,123 --> 00:56:40,123
(The snow-covered small stream in front of the house...)

1301
00:56:40,123 --> 00:56:44,092
(is full of life.)

1302
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:54,002
(The house's front yard is beautiful even in winter.)

1303
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,612
(Warm air)

1304
00:56:58,812 --> 00:57:00,482
- It's warm, right? - Yes.

1305
00:57:01,143 --> 00:57:02,413
It's warm.

1306
00:57:02,413 --> 00:57:04,752
(In the warm and cozy house, )

1307
00:57:04,752 --> 00:57:05,922
(they enjoy the winter scenery.)

1308
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:08,283
- At least it's warm inside. - It's very warm.

1309
00:57:08,283 --> 00:57:09,453
This...

1310
00:57:10,623 --> 00:57:13,362
(He plays the music to suit the atmosphere.)

1311
00:57:13,362 --> 00:57:14,393
It's on!

1312
00:57:15,763 --> 00:57:19,002
I really like this, so I prepared it.

1313
00:57:20,763 --> 00:57:21,973
This is so cool.

1314
00:57:21,973 --> 00:57:23,672
(The lively music is heard throughout the fir forest.)

1315
00:57:24,002 --> 00:57:26,143
Yes, it's this kind of feeling!

1316
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:27,973
We're unexpectedly elegant.

1317
00:57:28,973 --> 00:57:31,112
(Satisfied headbanging)

1318
00:57:31,312 --> 00:57:32,312
(Humming)

1319
00:57:33,712 --> 00:57:35,382
(They join him in dancing.)

1320
00:57:35,382 --> 00:57:38,053
I like the lyrics. Hee Won, you understand this, right?

1321
00:57:38,053 --> 00:57:40,123
Of course I do.

1322
00:57:40,783 --> 00:57:43,823
(Home)

1323
00:57:43,823 --> 00:57:45,292
This song is perfect for our house.

1324
00:57:45,393 --> 00:57:48,362
- It's a home. - It keeps saying home.

1325
00:57:48,362 --> 00:57:49,462
Right.

1326
00:57:51,493 --> 00:57:54,833
Why is it already 5pm when we didn't do much?

1327
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:56,132
We did a lot of things!

1328
00:57:58,272 --> 00:58:03,973
(They relax and indulge themselves in music for a while.)

1329
00:58:05,178 --> 00:58:07,647
(While they're resting, the fir forest became dark.)

1330
00:58:07,678 --> 00:58:08,808
It's so cold!

1331
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:14,488
- Aren't you cold? - No, I'm fine!

1332
00:58:14,848 --> 00:58:17,017
You do have thicker sweatpants.

1333
00:58:17,017 --> 00:58:20,627
Yes, but I was planning to wear this to sleep.

1334
00:58:21,187 --> 00:58:22,828
I'll wear this to sleep,

1335
00:58:23,397 --> 00:58:25,428
and continue wearing till tomorrow morning.

1336
00:58:25,428 --> 00:58:27,098
- Till tomorrow. - I'll just wear it.

1337
00:58:27,098 --> 00:58:29,267
Just stay comfortably.

1338
00:58:29,267 --> 00:58:31,837
Yes, why bother changing?

1339
00:58:32,908 --> 00:58:36,008
Today is tougher than usual because it's too cold.

1340
00:58:36,008 --> 00:58:38,078
- Is that so? - Yes.

1341
00:58:38,078 --> 00:58:39,778
(He feels sorry.)

1342
00:58:40,377 --> 00:58:43,517
(Meanwhile, Si Wan comes back after starting a fire.)

1343
00:58:45,888 --> 00:58:47,618
- This is really bad. - Why?

1344
00:58:47,618 --> 00:58:49,587
- It's super cold! - Right?

1345
00:58:49,587 --> 00:58:51,618
Even with the fire, it's still cold!

1346
00:58:51,957 --> 00:58:55,758
(Current temperature: minus 12°C)

1347
00:58:55,928 --> 00:58:57,897
(Sorrowful)

1348
00:58:57,897 --> 00:58:58,997
(He's preparing out in the cold...)

1349
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:00,968
(for Doo Na to space out while staring at the fire.)

1350
00:59:01,428 --> 00:59:04,797
We should just eat in here. Why eat outside?

1351
00:59:05,098 --> 00:59:08,107
If we can block out the wind, it will be much better.

1352
00:59:08,107 --> 00:59:10,508
We can't block out the wind there because of how it's structured.

1353
00:59:10,738 --> 00:59:13,207
(I see.)

1354
00:59:13,348 --> 00:59:16,047
Dong Il is there alone.

1355
00:59:16,517 --> 00:59:17,647
Come out first.

1356
00:59:18,278 --> 00:59:20,718
In this freezing weather,

1357
00:59:20,718 --> 00:59:22,288
you even put up a lantern.

1358
00:59:22,758 --> 00:59:24,718
(They have a fire extinguisher ready for safety measures.)

1359
00:59:24,988 --> 00:59:29,297
(He's securing a warm place for Doo Na.)

1360
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,328
Come sit here, it should be the warmest spot.

1361
00:59:32,727 --> 00:59:34,328
Let's see!

1362
00:59:34,328 --> 00:59:36,567
It should be the warmest spot.

1363
00:59:36,598 --> 00:59:38,167
It's nice!

1364
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:41,008
We'll let you space out by the fire as much as you want!

1365
00:59:41,008 --> 00:59:42,877
(He even set up the gas heater in case Doo Na feels cold.)

1366
00:59:42,877 --> 00:59:44,107
You can space out as much as you want.

1367
00:59:44,107 --> 00:59:46,647
- This is so romantic. - My goodness.

1368
00:59:46,848 --> 00:59:49,348
(Proud of himself)

1369
00:59:49,948 --> 00:59:51,678
(Burning)

1370
00:59:51,678 --> 00:59:52,817
Spacing out while staring at the fire...

1371
00:59:52,817 --> 00:59:53,817
that you wanted to do so much.

1372
00:59:54,788 --> 00:59:57,087
(I love this so much!)

1373
00:59:58,388 --> 01:00:01,957
(They stop talking for a moment...)

1374
01:00:01,957 --> 01:00:04,957
(and focus on the bonfire.)

1375
01:00:05,828 --> 01:00:08,797
(They empty their minds and enjoy...)

1376
01:00:08,797 --> 01:00:12,167
(the sweet break time.)

1377
01:00:12,607 --> 01:00:14,107
(Warm)

1378
01:00:14,107 --> 01:00:16,078
(Safely filmed with the permission of a landowner)

1379
01:00:16,538 --> 01:00:18,408
The fire's just right.

1380
01:00:18,408 --> 01:00:20,607
- This is just nice, right? - Yes.

1381
01:00:21,848 --> 01:00:23,448
Isn't the scent nice too?

1382
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,687
Doesn't it smell sweet?

1383
01:00:26,488 --> 01:00:28,988
The smell of firewood burning.

1384
01:00:31,258 --> 01:00:34,058
(Healing)

1385
01:00:34,988 --> 01:00:36,297
It smells nice.

1386
01:00:39,267 --> 01:00:42,567
(Fluttering)

1387
01:00:42,868 --> 01:00:46,238
(It would've been better if the wind wasn't as strong.)

1388
01:00:47,107 --> 01:00:50,138
(It's so cold.)

1389
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:53,178
(Wiping his nose)

1390
01:00:54,078 --> 01:00:55,817
(Laughing)

1391
01:00:55,817 --> 01:00:58,278
- Why? - Why are we doing this?

1392
01:00:58,747 --> 01:01:01,517
(Even the bonfire is useless in front of the fierce cold.)

1393
01:01:01,618 --> 01:01:03,618
Isn't this like my heart? It makes you warm thoroughly.

1394
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,087
- Yes. - What a comparison.

1395
01:01:05,087 --> 01:01:07,087
- You're creative with your words. - And it's not biased.

1396
01:01:10,528 --> 01:01:13,368
Doesn't the house seem pretty nice when you see it in real life?

1397
01:01:13,368 --> 01:01:15,198
Yes, it's nice. It's cute.

1398
01:01:15,997 --> 01:01:19,038
When I sit inside the house and look outside,

1399
01:01:19,038 --> 01:01:20,508
the whole place feels like it's my own yard.

1400
01:01:21,067 --> 01:01:22,678
That's so true.

1401
01:01:23,908 --> 01:01:25,747
- It's really nice. - Yes.

1402
01:01:27,147 --> 01:01:29,578
Right, Doo Na brought some gifts!

1403
01:01:29,747 --> 01:01:32,388
I'll give it to you before I leave tomorrow.

1404
01:01:32,888 --> 01:01:34,417
Why don't we do the gift-giving ceremony...

1405
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:35,817
- We should receive it. - right now when there's fire?

1406
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,457
- It'll be cool. - That's a good idea.

1407
01:01:37,457 --> 01:01:39,017
- Bring the gifts first. - Gifts!

1408
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:41,058
You should give us the gifts first...

1409
01:01:41,058 --> 01:01:42,658
- so that we'll treat you better. - Exactly.

1410
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:44,028
They're really nothing much.

1411
01:01:44,297 --> 01:01:45,767
We should add more firewood.

1412
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:46,767
(Excited)

1413
01:01:47,267 --> 01:01:50,098
(I hope they like these.)

1414
01:01:50,638 --> 01:01:53,508
This is kind of embarrassing. They're nothing much, really.

1415
01:01:54,567 --> 01:01:55,937
You even wrapped them in a cloth?

1416
01:01:56,138 --> 01:01:58,377
- Wrapping cloth. - Here.

1417
01:01:58,377 --> 01:02:01,678
Golden bars? The effort put into this.

1418
01:02:01,678 --> 01:02:03,448
If there's a thing like this attached,

1419
01:02:03,448 --> 01:02:04,747
it means it's pretty luxurious.

1420
01:02:04,778 --> 01:02:05,788
Handmade.

1421
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:07,888
Yes, something like this. "From Bae Doo Na".

1422
01:02:07,888 --> 01:02:09,218
(Her sincerity can be felt just from the wrapping itself.)

1423
01:02:09,218 --> 01:02:10,618
What is that?

1424
01:02:10,618 --> 01:02:12,187
(Looking forward to it)

1425
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:13,687
(My gosh.)

1426
01:02:14,058 --> 01:02:16,457
(He finally opens the box.)

1427
01:02:16,857 --> 01:02:17,857
(My goodness.)

1428
01:02:20,368 --> 01:02:21,428
How is it?

1429
01:02:23,267 --> 01:02:24,598
(My gosh.)

1430
01:02:24,598 --> 01:02:25,868
Only you're looking at them.

1431
01:02:26,308 --> 01:02:28,337
Right, I'm sorry.

1432
01:02:28,337 --> 01:02:30,408
You're not even thinking of showing them to us.

1433
01:02:30,408 --> 01:02:31,837
- When can we see them? - Can you not see them?

1434
01:02:31,837 --> 01:02:33,408
- That was... - We can't even see them.

1435
01:02:34,147 --> 01:02:36,578
- My gosh! - Look at them, they're so pretty.

1436
01:02:37,218 --> 01:02:38,578
(They can't help but get amazed at...)

1437
01:02:38,578 --> 01:02:40,147
(the colorful mugs.)

1438
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:42,087
I don't think I've ever seen mugs like this.

1439
01:02:42,087 --> 01:02:43,988
I personally find this beautiful.

1440
01:02:43,988 --> 01:02:46,528
- I like something simple like this. - This is their signature design.

1441
01:02:46,528 --> 01:02:47,528
Yes.

1442
01:02:47,687 --> 01:02:49,627
I find that very pretty as well.

1443
01:02:50,158 --> 01:02:52,098
- Just look at the one on your side. - This is their signature design.

1444
01:02:52,198 --> 01:02:54,267
(He whisks away the signature mug as fast as lightning.)

1445
01:02:54,267 --> 01:02:55,627
- I... - You take that one.

1446
01:02:55,627 --> 01:02:57,297
(Embarrassed)

1447
01:02:58,038 --> 01:02:59,207
I like this.

1448
01:02:59,207 --> 01:03:00,368
(I like the signature mug.)

1449
01:03:01,508 --> 01:03:02,508
They're pretty.

1450
01:03:02,508 --> 01:03:03,607
(They're all pretty.)

1451
01:03:04,837 --> 01:03:06,678
That's a different design!

1452
01:03:06,808 --> 01:03:09,517
- It has a different design. - Do they all look different?

1453
01:03:09,517 --> 01:03:10,618
All four mugs have different designs.

1454
01:03:10,618 --> 01:03:11,778
(It turns out that all four mugs have different designs.)

1455
01:03:12,377 --> 01:03:14,618
(The mugs have unique charms...)

1456
01:03:14,618 --> 01:03:17,218
I thought they will go well with this house.

1457
01:03:17,218 --> 01:03:18,618
(with different designs.)

1458
01:03:19,058 --> 01:03:22,288
And it says "Made in Mexico" here.

1459
01:03:22,457 --> 01:03:24,497
- It's made in Mexico? - Yes.

1460
01:03:24,497 --> 01:03:25,897
(It's made in Mexico?)

1461
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:27,698
Is this the Mexican language?

1462
01:03:28,727 --> 01:03:30,837
It's Spanish. Mexico uses Spanish.

1463
01:03:30,837 --> 01:03:31,837
(Spanish)

1464
01:03:31,997 --> 01:03:33,437
(What does this mean?)

1465
01:03:33,437 --> 01:03:34,607
It's written here.

1466
01:03:36,178 --> 01:03:37,778
(Tteratte?)

1467
01:03:37,778 --> 01:03:39,038
(Ttarenk?)

1468
01:03:39,138 --> 01:03:41,078
It says to beware of imitations.

1469
01:03:41,348 --> 01:03:42,917
- Really? - Yes.

1470
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:44,718
(Laughing)

1471
01:03:46,118 --> 01:03:48,647
(It turns out to be Mexican traditional pattern.)

1472
01:03:50,488 --> 01:03:51,817
It looks Mexican.

1473
01:03:51,817 --> 01:03:52,928
(When I look at it again)

1474
01:03:53,528 --> 01:03:55,997
It's yellow here! I only saw it now.

1475
01:03:55,997 --> 01:03:56,997
Where?

1476
01:03:56,997 --> 01:03:59,928
On top here. The top edge.

1477
01:04:00,397 --> 01:04:01,997
Look, this one's blue!

1478
01:04:03,638 --> 01:04:06,238
- Look at this. - These are such precious things.

1479
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,707
- Thank you so much. - It's nothing.

1480
01:04:08,707 --> 01:04:10,578
You can only buy this in Mexico, right?

1481
01:04:10,578 --> 01:04:11,578
(Thank you for the precious gifts, Doo Na!)

1482
01:04:12,178 --> 01:04:14,508
I brought the ingredients for Vin Chaud.

1483
01:04:14,508 --> 01:04:15,508
You brought what?

1484
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,377
What's Vin Chaud?

1485
01:04:18,118 --> 01:04:20,888
"Vin" means wine in French,

1486
01:04:21,187 --> 01:04:22,988
and "Chaud" means hot.

1487
01:04:22,988 --> 01:04:24,857
I see, it means hot wine.

1488
01:04:25,888 --> 01:04:27,187
Hot wine?

1489
01:04:27,687 --> 01:04:29,627
(Worried)

1490
01:04:29,727 --> 01:04:31,627
- The alcohol will get evaporated. - There's no alcohol.

1491
01:04:31,727 --> 01:04:33,297
- Really? - I won't say there's none at all...

1492
01:04:33,297 --> 01:04:34,727
So you can drink it.

1493
01:04:34,727 --> 01:04:37,297
A lot of people in Europe drink this at Christmas...

1494
01:04:37,297 --> 01:04:38,767
because it's good for a cold.

1495
01:04:39,968 --> 01:04:42,707
(Vin Chaud is known as European cold medicine.)

1496
01:04:43,308 --> 01:04:46,747
(Towards the end of the year and at Christmas, )

1497
01:04:46,747 --> 01:04:49,618
(Europe holds many festivals.)

1498
01:04:50,118 --> 01:04:54,848
(During the festive season, Europeans enjoy this drink.)

1499
01:04:55,417 --> 01:04:58,417
(Fruits, wine, and spices are added...)

1500
01:04:58,417 --> 01:05:00,658
(and boiled for a long time.)

1501
01:05:01,357 --> 01:05:05,857
(Hot mulled wine, "Vin Chaud")

1502
01:05:06,368 --> 01:05:08,797
That should be fine. It sounds delicious!

1503
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:11,767
- Then let's eat beef first, - Yes.

1504
01:05:12,038 --> 01:05:13,508
and finish with Vin Chaud.

1505
01:05:14,067 --> 01:05:15,437
We can do that!

1506
01:05:15,567 --> 01:05:17,308
- Yes. - That's the best.

1507
01:05:17,477 --> 01:05:19,547
Then who usually cooks?

1508
01:05:20,348 --> 01:05:22,247
Chef Sung, of course!

1509
01:05:22,247 --> 01:05:24,118
- Chef Sung. - Just try his food later.

1510
01:05:24,618 --> 01:05:28,317
Dong Il, we should make beef sushi again!

1511
01:05:28,317 --> 01:05:29,388
Beef sushi!

1512
01:05:29,587 --> 01:05:31,058
(Expectant)

1513
01:05:31,058 --> 01:05:32,888
I thought you said you're going to cook Korean thistle rice too.

1514
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:34,288
- Exactly! - Then...

1515
01:05:34,288 --> 01:05:36,957
Then we should go for the second round...

1516
01:05:36,957 --> 01:05:38,357
with dried pollack soup.

1517
01:05:38,528 --> 01:05:40,828
Well then, let's get moving quickly!

1518
01:05:41,227 --> 01:05:42,267
It sounds like a great idea.

1519
01:05:42,698 --> 01:05:43,738
It's so warm!

1520
01:05:44,198 --> 01:05:45,437
It's super warm, right?

1521
01:05:46,138 --> 01:05:48,968
I love how my hair smells like firewood.

1522
01:05:49,167 --> 01:05:50,278
(Glance)

1523
01:05:50,278 --> 01:05:51,337
Show me your nose.

1524
01:05:52,578 --> 01:05:53,908
- Why? - Your nose.

1525
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,578
Because it might be red? No?

1526
01:05:56,377 --> 01:05:57,417
It was cold!

1527
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,017
- I can say for sure. - Really?

1528
01:05:59,718 --> 01:06:01,687
Once I check your nose, I know...

1529
01:06:01,687 --> 01:06:03,187
- I don't know why. - whether it's cold or not.

1530
01:06:04,687 --> 01:06:05,917
(Dong Il and Hee Won get in the house as well.)

1531
01:06:05,917 --> 01:06:07,288
It's so warm in here!

1532
01:06:09,028 --> 01:06:11,098
- It's boiling in here! - It is.

1533
01:06:14,627 --> 01:06:16,098
Si Wan, pass me the disposable gloves.

1534
01:06:16,098 --> 01:06:18,098
Here you go, chef!

1535
01:06:18,337 --> 01:06:22,038
There's nothing much to do for this. It's pretty simple.

1536
01:06:22,837 --> 01:06:25,578
I finally get to see Chef Sung cook again...

1537
01:06:25,578 --> 01:06:26,948
- after a year. - 10 years in the tent bar...

1538
01:06:28,047 --> 01:06:29,107
It's such an honor.

1539
01:06:29,547 --> 01:06:31,778
Pass me dried pollack heads.

1540
01:06:31,778 --> 01:06:34,488
Chef, here you go.

1541
01:06:35,988 --> 01:06:37,087
Take out Korean thistle.

1542
01:06:37,388 --> 01:06:38,417
Korean thistle?

1543
01:06:38,618 --> 01:06:41,357
Chef, here's the Korean thistle.

1544
01:06:42,328 --> 01:06:45,328
Si Wan, you need to clean this. Can you wash this?

1545
01:06:45,328 --> 01:06:47,198
- Both scallions and radish? - Yes.

1546
01:06:47,198 --> 01:06:48,997
Okay, I'll do this.

1547
01:06:48,997 --> 01:06:51,368
Here, you're doing good.

1548
01:06:52,267 --> 01:06:53,808
Where did we put the scallions just now?

1549
01:06:54,008 --> 01:06:55,238
- Scallions? - Yes.

1550
01:06:55,538 --> 01:06:58,477
Scallions are here. Ask me if you don't know...

1551
01:06:58,477 --> 01:07:00,377
where any of the ingredients are.

1552
01:07:00,377 --> 01:07:01,448
Fantastic.

1553
01:07:02,207 --> 01:07:03,218
(Busy)

1554
01:07:03,218 --> 01:07:04,618
(Just staring)

1555
01:07:04,618 --> 01:07:06,547
- Do I just need to wash with water? - Yes.

1556
01:07:06,547 --> 01:07:07,747
(Getting busier)

1557
01:07:08,047 --> 01:07:09,488
I'll wash them all once you're done.

1558
01:07:09,488 --> 01:07:11,317
(Yawning)

1559
01:07:12,317 --> 01:07:14,558
For the next trip, Hee Won should just rest at home.

1560
01:07:14,587 --> 01:07:16,627
Pardon? Okay.

1561
01:07:16,627 --> 01:07:19,028
I just need Si Wan.

1562
01:07:19,028 --> 01:07:20,627
(Si Wan became the assistant chef.)

1563
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:23,337
(It seems that Hee Won will be in charge of outdoor works again.)

1564
01:07:24,638 --> 01:07:27,538
(Risky)

1565
01:07:28,908 --> 01:07:31,507
The water's about to stop running again. It won't, right?

1566
01:07:31,507 --> 01:07:32,778
It's a bit risky.

1567
01:07:37,918 --> 01:07:39,517
Did the pipe freeze?

1568
01:07:39,517 --> 01:07:40,588
It's possible.

1569
01:07:41,647 --> 01:07:43,357
(Current temperature: minus 15°C)

1570
01:07:43,357 --> 01:07:44,517
This is bad.

1571
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:48,357
I think water might freeze if we leave it outside today.

1572
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:51,757
(Hee Won goes to check the pipe instead of Dong Il who's cooking.)

1573
01:07:51,757 --> 01:07:52,998
Please join me.

1574
01:07:56,198 --> 01:07:59,338
- I can't see, is it frozen? - Let me see.

1575
01:07:59,807 --> 01:08:02,107
Gosh. Let me turn on the flashlight.

1576
01:08:05,208 --> 01:08:06,208
It looks fine.

1577
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:07,548
(It looks fine.)

1578
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:10,147
(Peek)

1579
01:08:10,647 --> 01:08:13,217
Can you help us check if the water's running?

1580
01:08:14,717 --> 01:08:16,817
- Great! - It's running just fine.

1581
01:08:17,557 --> 01:08:20,328
(Thankfully they just needed to add more water.)

1582
01:08:20,687 --> 01:08:21,687
(Now that the tap issue is resolved...)

1583
01:08:21,687 --> 01:08:23,897
It may seem like we're just simply cooking, but it's delicious.

1584
01:08:23,897 --> 01:08:24,897
Okay.

1585
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:27,998
(Chopping into big chunks)

1586
01:08:30,467 --> 01:08:32,567
(He cuts some scallions and radish, )

1587
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:34,368
(then puts them in the pot.)

1588
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:37,908
(Special ingredient that he bought himself this morning)

1589
01:08:39,038 --> 01:08:40,477
Do they sell those like this?

1590
01:08:40,578 --> 01:08:41,677
Yes, they do.

1591
01:08:42,677 --> 01:08:44,017
(Dong Il bought them from the restaurant...)

1592
01:08:44,017 --> 01:08:45,347
(that he regularly goes to for 12 years.)

1593
01:08:46,687 --> 01:08:50,458
(Dried pollack heads for making broth)

1594
01:08:52,588 --> 01:08:54,227
You're so quick with your hands.

1595
01:08:54,227 --> 01:08:55,628
(To make thick broth, )

1596
01:08:56,857 --> 01:08:59,567
(he adds plentiful of fresh dried pollack heads...)

1597
01:09:00,828 --> 01:09:03,097
(and boil it for a long time with effort.)

1598
01:09:04,498 --> 01:09:05,698
(It will turn into thick and white soup...)

1599
01:09:05,698 --> 01:09:06,908
(with the rich taste of dried pollack.)

1600
01:09:07,107 --> 01:09:08,408
- Hee Won! - Yes?

1601
01:09:08,668 --> 01:09:09,838
- Hee Won! - Yes!

1602
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:11,307
- Here you go. - Just a second.

1603
01:09:13,807 --> 01:09:14,948
Put it over there.

1604
01:09:16,217 --> 01:09:17,217
There you go.

1605
01:09:17,217 --> 01:09:18,748
(Hee Won is in charge of outdoor works.)

1606
01:09:18,918 --> 01:09:20,588
(But it's cold.)

1607
01:09:21,948 --> 01:09:23,257
My eyes are burning!

1608
01:09:26,088 --> 01:09:28,857
(Boil the broth with the wood fire.)

1609
01:09:30,028 --> 01:09:32,828
(Korean thistle that he bought together with dried pollack)

1610
01:09:33,168 --> 01:09:36,368
Si Wan, once it's soaked enough in water,

1611
01:09:36,597 --> 01:09:39,168
- wash the rice with it, - Yes.

1612
01:09:39,168 --> 01:09:41,007
add the right amount of water, and put it in the rice cooker.

1613
01:09:41,507 --> 01:09:42,507
Okay!

1614
01:09:42,507 --> 01:09:44,378
I'll chop it up so it's easier to eat.

1615
01:09:44,378 --> 01:09:47,977
(Place the soaked Korean thistle at the base of the pot...)

1616
01:09:48,177 --> 01:09:50,317
(and add some rice on top of it.)

1617
01:09:50,948 --> 01:09:53,217
(Put the pot in the rice cooker, and it's ready!)

1618
01:09:53,847 --> 01:09:57,658
Everything's done so effortlessly and quickly here.

1619
01:09:59,988 --> 01:10:01,857
(The chef and the assistant chef show off their skill...)

1620
01:10:01,857 --> 01:10:03,028
(right off the bat.)

1621
01:10:03,897 --> 01:10:05,897
(Expectant)

1622
01:10:06,897 --> 01:10:09,467
(And...)

1623
01:10:09,698 --> 01:10:10,698
Did you see this?

1624
01:10:15,538 --> 01:10:17,278
(The highlight of today, beef ribs)

1625
01:10:17,278 --> 01:10:19,908
- This is the best. - They look so pretty.

1626
01:10:19,908 --> 01:10:22,578
You can see this in those...

1627
01:10:22,578 --> 01:10:23,677
- high-end restaurants. - That's right.

1628
01:10:24,778 --> 01:10:26,017
(The captivating visual of beef ribs)

1629
01:10:26,017 --> 01:10:28,048
Can I have some beef ribs?

1630
01:10:28,588 --> 01:10:32,517
(This particular part is the most delicious part of ribs!)

1631
01:10:34,288 --> 01:10:37,298
(The meat and bone are cut as a whole.)

1632
01:10:39,028 --> 01:10:40,897
(If they roast the whole chunk with charcoal, )

1633
01:10:41,828 --> 01:10:45,538
(the meat has both the deep flavor and texture!)

1634
01:10:46,767 --> 01:10:49,807
(The thick meat is full of savory juice.)

1635
01:10:55,007 --> 01:10:57,778
(The best barbecue loved by campers)

1636
01:10:58,677 --> 01:11:02,448
(Beef ribs with the best taste and visual)

1637
01:11:02,918 --> 01:11:05,187
- We're all about the visual. - We're all about the visual.

1638
01:11:05,857 --> 01:11:07,227
- The taste doesn't matter. - We're all about the visual.

1639
01:11:07,227 --> 01:11:09,557
Even if it tastes bad, please say it's delicious.

1640
01:11:09,998 --> 01:11:11,658
(Laughing)

1641
01:11:11,658 --> 01:11:13,427
It's not easy to make them look like this.

1642
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:15,767
(He sprinkles pepper to make them look better.)

1643
01:11:16,467 --> 01:11:18,467
See? It's already looking good.

1644
01:11:18,597 --> 01:11:19,738
I know.

1645
01:11:20,467 --> 01:11:21,868
You might think we make food absentmindedly.

1646
01:11:22,507 --> 01:11:24,708
You know those sashimi places in Noryangjin Fish Market...

1647
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:25,908
where they serve really fast?

1648
01:11:26,477 --> 01:11:27,578
We're as fast as them.

1649
01:11:27,578 --> 01:11:29,607
(The main dish's visual is completed.)

1650
01:11:29,607 --> 01:11:31,847
That's all we need to prepare. We only need to grill them now.

1651
01:11:33,147 --> 01:11:36,517
(Dong Il and Hee Won come outside to prepare the barbecue.)

1652
01:11:37,757 --> 01:11:41,227
(Check out the beef ribs later.)

1653
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:43,958
(Si Wan and Doo Na are washing dishes inside.)

1654
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:46,298
Doo Na, when I cook,

1655
01:11:47,028 --> 01:11:49,498
I try to use as little utensils as possible.

1656
01:11:49,798 --> 01:11:50,897
How?

1657
01:11:51,567 --> 01:11:52,937
I use scissors for everything.

1658
01:11:53,307 --> 01:11:55,767
- Oh, scissors? - I use scissors for everything.

1659
01:11:58,977 --> 01:12:00,507
I don't cook at all.

1660
01:12:00,677 --> 01:12:02,708
- What? You don't cook? - So I don't have to wash dishes.

1661
01:12:03,517 --> 01:12:05,778
Then do you always...

1662
01:12:06,317 --> 01:12:07,387
eat delivery foods?

1663
01:12:07,387 --> 01:12:08,887
No, I don't have delivery foods.

1664
01:12:09,647 --> 01:12:11,217
Then do you not eat at all?

1665
01:12:11,918 --> 01:12:13,288
No, that's not it.

1666
01:12:13,288 --> 01:12:14,788
(How can I put it?)

1667
01:12:15,088 --> 01:12:17,757
I only eat rice, kimchi, and dried laver.

1668
01:12:19,227 --> 01:12:21,198
What? Come on, bro. That's...

1669
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:22,397
- I called you bro. - "Bro"?

1670
01:12:22,397 --> 01:12:24,137
(Flustered, shocked)

1671
01:12:24,137 --> 01:12:25,267
How did you find out?

1672
01:12:25,498 --> 01:12:26,637
(I'm sorry, Doo Na.)

1673
01:12:26,637 --> 01:12:27,668
No, I said it wrong.

1674
01:12:27,807 --> 01:12:29,607
I don't eat...

1675
01:12:29,607 --> 01:12:33,048
until I'm so hungry that I might pass out.

1676
01:12:33,477 --> 01:12:36,477
When you're that hungry,

1677
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:38,078
you don't think of cooking.

1678
01:12:38,548 --> 01:12:40,418
- You need to just grab something. - That's true.

1679
01:12:40,418 --> 01:12:43,357
So I often eat rice, kimchi, and dried laver.

1680
01:12:43,357 --> 01:12:44,817
(There's a reason why I eat like that.)

1681
01:12:46,387 --> 01:12:48,557
We have some scallions, so I'll make seasoned scallions.

1682
01:12:48,557 --> 01:12:49,828
(Showing interest)

1683
01:12:49,828 --> 01:12:51,998
I made myself busy again.

1684
01:12:54,567 --> 01:12:56,267
I want to learn how to make it.

1685
01:12:56,298 --> 01:12:57,437
You want to learn how?

1686
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:58,498
There's not much to do.

1687
01:12:58,498 --> 01:13:01,467
Add seasoning to the scallions that's already shredded.

1688
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:02,538
(It only needs shredded scallions and a sauce!)

1689
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:05,708
The cutting board was already lying out here,

1690
01:13:06,338 --> 01:13:07,878
so I'm making use of it.

1691
01:13:08,177 --> 01:13:10,878
(What?)

1692
01:13:12,748 --> 01:13:14,517
(But I thought you need to shred the scallions.)

1693
01:13:16,187 --> 01:13:18,988
(The scallions are chopped randomly.)

1694
01:13:19,788 --> 01:13:21,187
I work better with scissors.

1695
01:13:23,227 --> 01:13:24,498
(Turning away)

1696
01:13:24,557 --> 01:13:27,467
Now it's time to make a sauce.

1697
01:13:27,628 --> 01:13:29,498
- I need to watch you do that. - Sure.

1698
01:13:29,597 --> 01:13:30,767
The ratio...

1699
01:13:31,668 --> 01:13:32,868
is one spoonful of sugar,

1700
01:13:33,538 --> 01:13:34,708
three spoonfuls of red chili pepper powder...

1701
01:13:34,838 --> 01:13:36,267
- Three? - Yes.

1702
01:13:36,307 --> 01:13:37,937
You need a lot of red chili pepper powder.

1703
01:13:37,937 --> 01:13:39,007
(I see.)

1704
01:13:39,278 --> 01:13:41,977
And three spoonfuls of soy sauce for seasoning.

1705
01:13:43,677 --> 01:13:45,078
That's pretty precise.

1706
01:13:45,317 --> 01:13:46,687
It's almost like baking.

1707
01:13:47,847 --> 01:13:50,687
- 1 spoonful of vinegar? - 1 and a half.

1708
01:13:52,317 --> 01:13:53,387
That's all.

1709
01:13:53,557 --> 01:13:54,687
- Really? - Yes.

1710
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,927
- Garlic. - What?

1711
01:13:55,927 --> 01:13:58,028
- Aren't you adding garlic? - Oh, right. I forgot.

1712
01:13:59,828 --> 01:14:00,897
I was startled.

1713
01:14:02,267 --> 01:14:04,437
A half spoonfuls of crushed garlic.

1714
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:07,838
Add a bit of crushed garlic.

1715
01:14:08,567 --> 01:14:09,708
- That's all. - Okay.

1716
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:11,278
- That's all you need. - It's easy.

1717
01:14:11,677 --> 01:14:13,448
(Looking bright)

1718
01:14:13,448 --> 01:14:14,708
- Okay, I got it. - Good.

1719
01:14:16,548 --> 01:14:18,717
I'll send you the recipe.

1720
01:14:19,778 --> 01:14:22,817
(The seasoned scallions by sloppy Si Wan is done.)

1721
01:14:24,458 --> 01:14:25,557
It looks so good.

1722
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:27,588
- You want me to try it? - Yes.

1723
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:29,528
(Taking a bite)

1724
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:34,528
(Looking bright)

1725
01:14:34,528 --> 01:14:35,698
It's so good.

1726
01:14:35,897 --> 01:14:37,538
- It's good, right? It's sour. - It's really good.

1727
01:14:37,538 --> 01:14:38,567
- It tastes good, right? - Yes.

1728
01:14:38,698 --> 01:14:40,467
(He's glad it's tasty.)

1729
01:14:42,267 --> 01:14:46,677
(Meanwhile, out in the yard...)

1730
01:14:48,107 --> 01:14:53,048
(They're watching the broth to serve to their guest.)

1731
01:14:53,347 --> 01:14:54,387
(Exclaiming)

1732
01:14:56,448 --> 01:14:57,817
(It's really cold.)

1733
01:14:57,817 --> 01:15:00,557
Do people go camping when it's really cold like today?

1734
01:15:00,727 --> 01:15:02,227
- Of course. - They do?

1735
01:15:02,227 --> 01:15:04,328
- Some choose to go on cold days. - Really?

1736
01:15:05,528 --> 01:15:07,328
Who would sleep outside when it's this cold?

1737
01:15:07,328 --> 01:15:08,328
(Current temperature: minus 16°C.)

1738
01:15:08,328 --> 01:15:10,397
It's not like we're climbing the Himalayas.

1739
01:15:12,868 --> 01:15:15,107
- Should we sleep inside? - We should.

1740
01:15:18,578 --> 01:15:20,948
So you like Vin Chaud.

1741
01:15:20,948 --> 01:15:22,708
I love all types of wine.

1742
01:15:23,248 --> 01:15:26,347
I sometimes run into my house.

1743
01:15:26,717 --> 01:15:29,118
- Sorry? - When I'm done with work,

1744
01:15:29,118 --> 01:15:31,088
- I run into the house. - Because you want to drink wine?

1745
01:15:31,088 --> 01:15:33,528
Yes. Wait. This will make me look like...

1746
01:15:33,528 --> 01:15:35,458
I'm an alcoholic. I'm not addicted.

1747
01:15:35,588 --> 01:15:38,528
When I'm under a lot of stress,

1748
01:15:38,698 --> 01:15:40,798
it helps me relax.

1749
01:15:40,798 --> 01:15:41,828
That's right.

1750
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:44,998
That helps you wrap up your day too.

1751
01:15:45,137 --> 01:15:46,967
You know how I shot a movie in the States, right?

1752
01:15:48,107 --> 01:15:50,778
I learned to speak English only after I was done shooting the movie.

1753
01:15:50,778 --> 01:15:51,807
- Did you know that? - Really?

1754
01:15:51,807 --> 01:15:53,807
I used to be really bad at English.

1755
01:15:53,807 --> 01:15:55,177
No way. I can't believe it.

1756
01:15:55,177 --> 01:15:58,017
I'm serious. After I was done with the movie, I went to England...

1757
01:15:58,017 --> 01:16:01,918
and learned English for 2 to 3 years.

1758
01:16:02,887 --> 01:16:07,128
Back then, if I didn't drink wine,

1759
01:16:07,128 --> 01:16:08,687
I couldn't speak English at all.

1760
01:16:08,788 --> 01:16:11,097
- Right, it helps you. - So I drank in the morning...

1761
01:16:11,097 --> 01:16:13,498
and even in the afternoon. I just kept drinking.

1762
01:16:13,498 --> 01:16:16,028
That way, I could speak well.

1763
01:16:16,328 --> 01:16:19,097
So wine brings in nostalgia from that time.

1764
01:16:19,937 --> 01:16:21,567
When I drink wine, I'm reminded of those days.

1765
01:16:21,567 --> 01:16:23,477
So that's how you feel.

1766
01:16:25,137 --> 01:16:29,677
(Her housewarming gift Vin Chaud holds such memories.)

1767
01:16:34,788 --> 01:16:39,118
(She makes more memories on House on Wheels Season 2.)

1768
01:16:39,458 --> 01:16:40,488
It's done.

1769
01:16:43,187 --> 01:16:46,397
(Slice sweet apples...)

1770
01:16:46,397 --> 01:16:50,767
(and sour oranges.)

1771
01:16:52,798 --> 01:16:55,767
(Then put them in the pot neatly.)

1772
01:16:56,637 --> 01:16:59,937
(To make Vin Chaud, she brought a bag full of...)

1773
01:17:00,347 --> 01:17:01,677
(cinnamon sticks.)

1774
01:17:01,807 --> 01:17:03,048
(It smells so nice.)

1775
01:17:06,748 --> 01:17:09,217
(Add in cinnamon sticks, dried clove buds, and star anise...)

1776
01:17:09,217 --> 01:17:10,918
(for deeper scents.)

1777
01:17:13,158 --> 01:17:15,088
Can you bear with this scent?

1778
01:17:15,557 --> 01:17:16,588
Dried clove buds.

1779
01:17:20,727 --> 01:17:22,467
It smells like a dental clinic.

1780
01:17:22,467 --> 01:17:23,597
It's not bad.

1781
01:17:24,838 --> 01:17:29,267
(Taking out wine that will determine the taste of Vin Chaud)

1782
01:17:32,708 --> 01:17:36,078
(Pour wine to the pot, and you're all set!)

1783
01:17:37,347 --> 01:17:39,078
Isn't this the delicious one?

1784
01:17:39,717 --> 01:17:40,717
Yes.

1785
01:17:40,918 --> 01:17:43,288
Can I have a sip of it?

1786
01:17:43,757 --> 01:17:45,788
- Doesn't your face get red? - It doesn't.

1787
01:17:45,788 --> 01:17:47,557
I can't have it because my face gets red.

1788
01:17:47,557 --> 01:17:48,887
- Really? - I'll let you...

1789
01:17:49,088 --> 01:17:50,798
- I'll let you have a taste of it. - Okay.

1790
01:17:54,227 --> 01:17:57,368
(Wandering about)

1791
01:17:58,267 --> 01:18:00,507
(On eggshells)

1792
01:18:02,168 --> 01:18:03,937
- That's enough. Just have a sip. - Okay.

1793
01:18:03,937 --> 01:18:06,238
(Slurping)

1794
01:18:08,507 --> 01:18:09,607
(Doo Na's Vin Chaud...)

1795
01:18:09,607 --> 01:18:13,347
(is becoming more delicious.)

1796
01:18:14,387 --> 01:18:15,948
- Si Wan! - Let's go inside now.

1797
01:18:16,317 --> 01:18:18,288
Let's eat. Come outside.

1798
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:21,088
- Are we eating now? - We only need to grill the meat.

1799
01:18:21,088 --> 01:18:23,498
(It's dinnertime at the house where the visual matters the most.)

1800
01:18:25,128 --> 01:18:27,368
(Doo Na's ideal camping...)

1801
01:18:27,368 --> 01:18:29,298
(is having a barbecue in her front yard.)

1802
01:18:29,427 --> 01:18:31,437
I'm going to eat a lot. I'll eat all of that.

1803
01:18:32,698 --> 01:18:34,137
I'm so excited.

1804
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:35,307
You can look forward to it.

1805
01:18:36,437 --> 01:18:40,147
(Beautiful beef ribs)

1806
01:18:40,647 --> 01:18:42,948
Let me taste the seasoned scallions Si Wan made.

1807
01:18:44,147 --> 01:18:45,878
- Is that dried pollack sikhae? - Dried pollack sikhae.

1808
01:18:45,878 --> 01:18:46,918
(Taking the generous amount of pollack sikhae made by a granny)

1809
01:18:47,088 --> 01:18:49,948
Seeing how the cheese is melting,

1810
01:18:49,948 --> 01:18:51,658
the fire must be perfect.

1811
01:18:51,658 --> 01:18:53,187
(Here's a table full of delicacies from Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province.)

1812
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:56,158
- Let's start with beef ribs. - I want to taste it so much.

1813
01:18:56,158 --> 01:18:57,727
I'm really curious how it'd taste.

1814
01:18:58,057 --> 01:19:00,767
(Safely filmed with the permission of a landowner)

1815
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:02,328
(Sizzling)

1816
01:19:02,328 --> 01:19:03,368
It smells so nice already.

1817
01:19:04,338 --> 01:19:05,368
(Impressed)

1818
01:19:05,567 --> 01:19:07,267
Wow, look at that. It looks so nice.

1819
01:19:07,267 --> 01:19:08,437
- This? - Yes.

1820
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:14,147
(Gulping)

1821
01:19:15,177 --> 01:19:16,578
It looks awesome.

1822
01:19:17,477 --> 01:19:18,548
(Thick pieces of meat on huge ribs)

1823
01:19:18,548 --> 01:19:20,317
I've never seen that part of beef.

1824
01:19:20,317 --> 01:19:22,187
Wow, it's fascinating though.

1825
01:19:22,187 --> 01:19:24,158
(Looking juicy)

1826
01:19:24,387 --> 01:19:27,328
(How would beef ribs taste?)

1827
01:19:27,328 --> 01:19:28,387
You should try this.

1828
01:19:29,288 --> 01:19:30,298
(Smooth)

1829
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:32,128
This must taste really good.

1830
01:19:32,298 --> 01:19:33,328
It looks so tasty.

1831
01:19:33,698 --> 01:19:35,198
It's getting cut smoothly.

1832
01:19:36,128 --> 01:19:38,637
(I want to taste it now.)

1833
01:19:38,637 --> 01:19:40,307
Is it cooked enough?

1834
01:19:40,738 --> 01:19:42,338
But the inside is still so red.

1835
01:19:42,338 --> 01:19:43,677
No, people eat it like this.

1836
01:19:43,677 --> 01:19:45,908
I prefer rare beef.

1837
01:19:45,908 --> 01:19:46,948
Really?

1838
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:49,477
The meat is holding its juice so well.

1839
01:19:50,378 --> 01:19:52,378
Try it. Here.

1840
01:19:53,788 --> 01:19:55,918
(Taking a bite)

1841
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:01,727
It's so good.

1842
01:20:01,727 --> 01:20:02,727
Really?

1843
01:20:03,028 --> 01:20:04,028
Si Wan.

1844
01:20:04,028 --> 01:20:06,198
(Dong Il gives one to Si Wan who's worked really hard.)

1845
01:20:06,198 --> 01:20:07,668
- Eat it when it's still hot. - Thank you.

1846
01:20:07,668 --> 01:20:08,798
Eat up.

1847
01:20:08,998 --> 01:20:11,567
(Taking a bite)

1848
01:20:11,597 --> 01:20:13,967
(He's tasting the meat.)

1849
01:20:15,567 --> 01:20:17,177
(Dancing out of joy)

1850
01:20:17,378 --> 01:20:19,408
- Is it good? - It's hot.

1851
01:20:20,137 --> 01:20:22,208
(Chef Sung gives it a try.)

1852
01:20:22,347 --> 01:20:23,347
(Impressed)

1853
01:20:23,347 --> 01:20:24,677
- Isn't it so good? - Right.

1854
01:20:25,618 --> 01:20:27,147
- It's cooked. - Is it?

1855
01:20:27,147 --> 01:20:28,147
(It's more delicious to eat it off the grill.)

1856
01:20:28,817 --> 01:20:30,687
- Try it. - What?

1857
01:20:30,687 --> 01:20:31,817
(Surprised)

1858
01:20:32,757 --> 01:20:35,288
(It's well cooked.)

1859
01:20:35,687 --> 01:20:38,158
(He takes it since Dong Il is offering, )

1860
01:20:38,357 --> 01:20:40,767
(but he puts it back on the grill again.)

1861
01:20:41,427 --> 01:20:42,668
(Holding back his laugh)

1862
01:20:42,668 --> 01:20:44,698
He has a weak stomach.

1863
01:20:47,937 --> 01:20:50,578
(He takes a bite full of doubts.)

1864
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:52,137
(Chewing)

1865
01:20:52,977 --> 01:20:54,548
How is it, Hee Won?

1866
01:20:56,078 --> 01:20:57,517
The inside is raw.

1867
01:20:59,618 --> 01:21:00,988
(Gosh, Hee Won...)

1868
01:21:01,187 --> 01:21:02,647
It's not fully cooked!

1869
01:21:02,647 --> 01:21:03,658
(Joking)

1870
01:21:04,217 --> 01:21:06,988
Why did you not cook it thoroughly? Why would you eat it raw?

1871
01:21:09,088 --> 01:21:10,397
Gosh, seriously...

1872
01:21:10,397 --> 01:21:11,528
(Hang on.)

1873
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:13,397
It's raw on the inside.

1874
01:21:13,498 --> 01:21:15,028
It's really good though.

1875
01:21:15,028 --> 01:21:16,097
(He cooks the meat thoroughly for Hee Won.)

1876
01:21:16,868 --> 01:21:18,838
I highly recommend this.

1877
01:21:18,838 --> 01:21:20,868
It's well-cooked. I recommend this.

1878
01:21:20,868 --> 01:21:22,467
This is well-cooked.

1879
01:21:22,467 --> 01:21:23,677
(The scent of charcoal has permeated on the well-cooked meat.)

1880
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:26,007
All right. Here, Hee Won.

1881
01:21:26,677 --> 01:21:28,378
It's almost like a work of art.

1882
01:21:28,378 --> 01:21:29,778
- You think? - It's amazing.

1883
01:21:30,748 --> 01:21:34,248
(He trusts Doo Na's words and takes a bite.)

1884
01:21:34,248 --> 01:21:36,187
(Savoring it carefully)

1885
01:21:36,187 --> 01:21:38,088
How is it? Isn't it cooked perfectly for you?

1886
01:21:38,088 --> 01:21:39,217
It's really good.

1887
01:21:39,217 --> 01:21:40,357
(His taste bud is like that of a baby.)

1888
01:21:40,887 --> 01:21:44,698
(He takes another piece right after.)

1889
01:21:45,158 --> 01:21:47,597
(I like my meat well done.)

1890
01:21:47,897 --> 01:21:49,467
How is it so good?

1891
01:21:49,467 --> 01:21:51,267
(Beef ribs satisfy both who like their meat rare and well done.)

1892
01:21:52,097 --> 01:21:54,767
(Magical beef ribs)

1893
01:21:54,767 --> 01:21:58,278
It's an unforgettable taste. I don't know how to describe it.

1894
01:21:59,408 --> 01:22:01,378
- Here. - It's soft on the inside,

1895
01:22:01,607 --> 01:22:03,248
- and it's moist on the outside. - No, you can have it.

1896
01:22:04,948 --> 01:22:06,177
(Did you mean to say...)

1897
01:22:06,177 --> 01:22:07,347
(it's soft on the inside and crispy on the outside?)

1898
01:22:08,717 --> 01:22:10,458
It's fantastic.

1899
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:11,817
(It's simply fantastic.)

1900
01:22:11,817 --> 01:22:14,128
My gosh, the ribs are so good.

1901
01:22:15,458 --> 01:22:18,897
Let's try it with fondue.

1902
01:22:19,057 --> 01:22:20,727
This is what you call fondue?

1903
01:22:21,267 --> 01:22:23,967
- My gosh. - I'm most curious about this one.

1904
01:22:24,698 --> 01:22:26,338
It must be really soft.

1905
01:22:26,338 --> 01:22:29,137
Let's try it. Look at this.

1906
01:22:29,137 --> 01:22:30,908
- Wow. - It's called beef fondue.

1907
01:22:31,107 --> 01:22:33,007
- Wow. - Here, Hee Won.

1908
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:36,078
- Just open your mouth. - Wait, Dong Il.

1909
01:22:36,078 --> 01:22:37,918
- This is the best part. - I can't get the right posture.

1910
01:22:37,918 --> 01:22:39,147
The right posture?

1911
01:22:39,278 --> 01:22:41,048
My dear Hee Won.

1912
01:22:41,988 --> 01:22:43,017
Try it.

1913
01:22:43,988 --> 01:22:47,828
(Beef fondue filled with Dong Il's affection for him)

1914
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:50,328
- Does it taste okay? - It's good.

1915
01:22:51,357 --> 01:22:53,967
- Why is it hot? - Fondue tastes okay.

1916
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:55,868
Isn't it good? Right?

1917
01:22:58,137 --> 01:22:59,137
(Stretching)

1918
01:23:02,908 --> 01:23:04,078
That's too much.

1919
01:23:04,078 --> 01:23:05,637
(Fixed gaze)

1920
01:23:06,477 --> 01:23:08,778
I thought it'd go well with beef.

1921
01:23:08,778 --> 01:23:11,517
(Slurping)

1922
01:23:11,548 --> 01:23:14,488
(Chewing)

1923
01:23:14,687 --> 01:23:16,317
(The more he chews, )

1924
01:23:16,317 --> 01:23:17,788
It's so good.

1925
01:23:17,788 --> 01:23:19,257
(the savorier it gets.)

1926
01:23:20,057 --> 01:23:24,328
(It's a taste you'd definitely fall for.)

1927
01:23:26,227 --> 01:23:30,227
(Should I try it differently this time?)

1928
01:23:31,067 --> 01:23:32,567
(Floundering)

1929
01:23:33,168 --> 01:23:35,538
(Dong Il's amazing talent)

1930
01:23:36,007 --> 01:23:37,137
I should have some more.

1931
01:23:37,807 --> 01:23:40,548
- Isn't it nice? - The taste is quite unique.

1932
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:41,948
(Fondue adds a savorier taste to the beef as it smears into the meat.)

1933
01:23:41,948 --> 01:23:43,147
He likes it.

1934
01:23:43,147 --> 01:23:45,048
(Si Wan gets more fondue.)

1935
01:23:45,048 --> 01:23:46,548
I shouldn't be eating this much.

1936
01:23:48,488 --> 01:23:49,918
How is the fondue?

1937
01:23:52,887 --> 01:23:54,857
(She's shaking as it tastes so good.)

1938
01:23:54,857 --> 01:23:56,857
- They go well together. - Right?

1939
01:23:56,857 --> 01:23:57,897
Yes.

1940
01:23:59,357 --> 01:24:01,998
(Enjoying the meat with another side dish this time)

1941
01:24:02,227 --> 01:24:03,528
- Is that dried pollack sikhae? - Yes.

1942
01:24:04,137 --> 01:24:07,408
It looks so delicious.

1943
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:10,538
I wonder how pollack sikhae will taste with beef.

1944
01:24:12,408 --> 01:24:14,578
- Do you want to take some? - Sure.

1945
01:24:14,578 --> 01:24:16,307
I'll take some to my dish.

1946
01:24:17,217 --> 01:24:18,448
Hand it to me.

1947
01:24:18,748 --> 01:24:21,488
- Dong Il, you should take some too. - Okay.

1948
01:24:21,488 --> 01:24:23,017
I'll give it a try.

1949
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:25,988
(Dong Il tastes it first.)

1950
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:29,757
(Curious)

1951
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:32,927
(The new combination is excellent as well.)

1952
01:24:33,057 --> 01:24:35,128
It's really good with pollack sikhae too.

1953
01:24:35,128 --> 01:24:36,698
(Let me give it a try.)

1954
01:24:37,798 --> 01:24:39,437
(Impressed)

1955
01:24:39,967 --> 01:24:43,878
(Hee Won, the skeptical type, takes a bite too.)

1956
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:46,038
You're eating so well.

1957
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:47,807
(The saltiness of pollack sikhae...)

1958
01:24:47,807 --> 01:24:49,007
(adds savoriness to the meat.)

1959
01:24:49,007 --> 01:24:50,517
- It's good. - Right?

1960
01:24:51,217 --> 01:24:53,177
Pollack sikhae is a delicacy too.

1961
01:24:53,448 --> 01:24:54,717
- Right. - It's so good.

1962
01:24:55,588 --> 01:24:57,017
(Pollack sikhae is to his taste.)

1963
01:24:57,288 --> 01:25:00,488
Dong Il, I love the seasoned scallion Si Wan made.

1964
01:25:00,588 --> 01:25:02,488
Does it taste okay?

1965
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:04,998
I'm glad you're eating it well.

1966
01:25:05,798 --> 01:25:07,798
- Can I have more of it? - Seasoned scallion is nice.

1967
01:25:07,798 --> 01:25:08,868
Dong Il, try the seasoned scallion.

1968
01:25:10,698 --> 01:25:12,038
The seasoned scallion...

1969
01:25:12,267 --> 01:25:13,838
- It's good. - is pretty nice.

1970
01:25:13,838 --> 01:25:16,208
I wish there was some sesame.

1971
01:25:16,937 --> 01:25:18,708
Isn't it nice?

1972
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:20,647
It tastes like the one they sell at restaurants.

1973
01:25:21,107 --> 01:25:22,278
- Right? - Wow.

1974
01:25:22,477 --> 01:25:23,748
It's perfect.

1975
01:25:25,048 --> 01:25:27,517
After this, we'll be having beef sirloin steak.

1976
01:25:27,618 --> 01:25:29,647
- Let's have some more. - I'd love that.

1977
01:25:30,588 --> 01:25:32,817
(They're really happy.)

1978
01:25:32,988 --> 01:25:35,588
I'm so full right now, but I can't stop eating.

1979
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:38,528
I've never had such thick beef sirloin steaks.

1980
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:40,998
(Chuck flap tail that melts in your mouth)

1981
01:25:40,998 --> 01:25:43,267
It's chuck flap tail. Everyone loves chuck flap tail.

1982
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:47,580
After this, we'll be having beef sirloin steak.

1983
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:51,820
(They're really happy.)

1984
01:25:52,089 --> 01:25:54,519
I'm so full right now, but I can't stop eating.

1985
01:25:54,519 --> 01:25:57,419
I've never had such thick beef sirloin steaks.

1986
01:25:58,429 --> 01:25:59,929
(Chuck flap tail that melts in your mouth)

1987
01:25:59,929 --> 01:26:02,530
It's chuck flap tail. Everyone loves chuck flap tail.

1988
01:26:02,599 --> 01:26:04,429
Gosh, this is just...

1989
01:26:04,429 --> 01:26:05,799
(Taking a bite right away with the seasoned scallion)

1990
01:26:05,799 --> 01:26:07,200
It's a little thick.

1991
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,870
I'll take this one then.

1992
01:26:10,269 --> 01:26:13,009
My gosh. Doo Na knows how to eat well.

1993
01:26:13,009 --> 01:26:14,410
(The taste that makes them forget the cold weather)

1994
01:26:14,509 --> 01:26:15,709
(Savoring)

1995
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:20,150
(The warmth of freshly grilled meat)

1996
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:22,820
Gosh, it's so soft.

1997
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:26,089
(In a trance)

1998
01:26:26,490 --> 01:26:29,589
(It's more delicious with the side dishes the members prepared.)

1999
01:26:29,589 --> 01:26:30,790
It's not too greasy.

2000
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:33,459
(It tastes even better.)

2001
01:26:33,459 --> 01:26:35,099
Chuck flap tail is way softer when it's cut thin.

2002
01:26:35,099 --> 01:26:36,299
(Doo Na is melting.)

2003
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:37,969
Have it while it's hot.

2004
01:26:37,969 --> 01:26:39,330
(The highlight of camping is barbecue.)

2005
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:41,370
- Chuck flap tail. - It's so good.

2006
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:43,540
- Really? Is it really good? - Yes, it's very good.

2007
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:45,570
(Doo Na's ideal camping to have a barbecue outside...)

2008
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:47,540
(turned out to be a huge success.)

2009
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:48,910
This is nice.

2010
01:26:50,879 --> 01:26:53,650
(All I needed was some nice beef.)

2011
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:54,879
It's so good.

2012
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:58,120
(I'm glad she likes it.)

2013
01:26:58,990 --> 01:27:00,450
It's really good.

2014
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:03,190
- It was a good meal. - It really was.

2015
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:05,290
We ate a lot.

2016
01:27:05,290 --> 01:27:08,030
We should now have some fondue. Oh, I meant Vin something.

2017
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:11,299
- It's Vin... - Vin Chaud.

2018
01:27:11,299 --> 01:27:13,769
- Vin Chaud. - Vin Chaud.

2019
01:27:13,769 --> 01:27:16,400
We can have a glass of Vin Chaud to wrap up.

2020
01:27:18,139 --> 01:27:19,440
Gosh, it's so warm.

2021
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,509
(Doo Na added lots of ingredients to make Vin Chaud for the members.)

2022
01:27:23,309 --> 01:27:24,910
(After some time, )

2023
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:26,280
(the flavor got even richer.)

2024
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,080
It smells so nice.

2025
01:27:29,179 --> 01:27:30,679
Pass me the ladle.

2026
01:27:31,219 --> 01:27:33,990
I should add some fruits.

2027
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:38,559
- It's so funny. - If you sit there...

2028
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:42,400
They're coming! They're coming! Is it called Vin Chaud?

2029
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,669
Venom? Van Chaud?

2030
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:46,299
(They're so funny.)

2031
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:48,870
Vin Chaud!

2032
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:50,570
- Cheers, everyone! - It is made of wine.

2033
01:27:50,799 --> 01:27:53,339
- This is so nice. - Good work, everyone.

2034
01:27:53,969 --> 01:27:55,540
(Sniffing)

2035
01:27:55,639 --> 01:27:57,910
Its fragrance is really unique.

2036
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:59,080
(He likes its fragrance.)

2037
01:27:59,179 --> 01:28:01,480
- Right? - It smells so nice.

2038
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:04,320
Its fragrance is therapeutic.

2039
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:11,059
(How would Vin Chaud made with various spices taste?)

2040
01:28:11,059 --> 01:28:13,290
(Gulping down)

2041
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:15,700
How should I describe it? It's like ssanghwacha.

2042
01:28:15,700 --> 01:28:17,929
- Exactly! - Right? It tastes like that.

2043
01:28:17,929 --> 01:28:19,900
It's ssanghwacha added with other ingredients.

2044
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:21,240
Doesn't that mean it tastes like health drinks?

2045
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,370
- It helps to heat you up. - Yes, it tastes like that overall.

2046
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:25,669
- It helps you wake up too. - It does?

2047
01:28:25,669 --> 01:28:27,639
Yes, my eyesight got better.

2048
01:28:28,339 --> 01:28:30,709
(I know I made it, but it's marvelous.)

2049
01:28:30,839 --> 01:28:32,709
It's really therapeutic.

2050
01:28:32,709 --> 01:28:35,080
Oh, there's an apple too.

2051
01:28:36,379 --> 01:28:37,889
There are many pieces in mine.

2052
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:40,490
Right?

2053
01:28:41,089 --> 01:28:42,120
As you drink...

2054
01:28:42,419 --> 01:28:45,259
(While the rest are getting delighted by Vin Chaud, )

2055
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:49,599
(Hee Won drinks it quietly.)

2056
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,030
(He tastes it more seriously than ever.)

2057
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:57,669
(He takes another sip as though he's mesmerized.)

2058
01:28:58,870 --> 01:29:01,509
(He also makes a mysterious groaning sound.)

2059
01:29:02,179 --> 01:29:04,440
(She gets somewhat nervous.)

2060
01:29:06,509 --> 01:29:09,679
- Doo Na! It's super delicious! - Really?

2061
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:11,719
- It is! - It's good, right?

2062
01:29:11,719 --> 01:29:13,349
It tastes really odd.

2063
01:29:13,790 --> 01:29:16,219
(Hee Won can't take alcohol though.)

2064
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:19,589
Does it have alcohol?

2065
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:20,929
It got evaporated.

2066
01:29:20,929 --> 01:29:23,929
I left the pot open to boil it, so it got evaporated.

2067
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:26,230
(Then I will...)

2068
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,969
(He starts slurping it again.)

2069
01:29:29,139 --> 01:29:30,139
(Groaning)

2070
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:33,570
(He's amazed.)

2071
01:29:34,269 --> 01:29:35,480
Look at him.

2072
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:37,509
(He can't stop sipping it.)

2073
01:29:38,709 --> 01:29:40,750
He can take alcohol.

2074
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:43,580
(Heavy drinker Kim Hee Won)

2075
01:29:43,849 --> 01:29:45,919
He might start cussing at me...

2076
01:29:46,450 --> 01:29:47,790
because he's drunk.

2077
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:51,160
(Laughing bashfully)

2078
01:29:51,759 --> 01:29:54,160
(Everyone bursts into laughter thanks to drunk Hee Won.)

2079
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:58,169
- This is so funny. - Shall I get into drinks from now?

2080
01:29:58,169 --> 01:30:00,400
Why would you get into them now?

2081
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,900
You've never had drinks until now.

2082
01:30:04,099 --> 01:30:05,709
This is so nice.

2083
01:30:06,339 --> 01:30:08,240
- This is nice. - This is fun.

2084
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:11,240
(Thanks to Doo Na's Vin Chaud, )

2085
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,280
(the front yard has become nice and warm.)

2086
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,309
- Is this it? - This is it.

2087
01:30:13,309 --> 01:30:14,309
Is this the song?

2088
01:30:14,879 --> 01:30:19,089
When I listen to it, I can smell a bonfire.

2089
01:30:19,219 --> 01:30:22,160
(The song that smells like a bonfire, "Snow" by Zion. T)

2090
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,219
It's good.

2091
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:26,089
(Feeling relaxed)

2092
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:29,129
(The night deepens with the wood fire.)

2093
01:30:29,929 --> 01:30:33,769
(Taking the brushing sound of fir trees as a pillow, )

2094
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,169
(they enjoy the authentic peace...)

2095
01:30:36,169 --> 01:30:40,509
(at the end of the day.)

2096
01:30:41,879 --> 01:30:47,080
(Waiting for tomorrow that might be a snowy day.)

2097
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:52,790
Did you know? There are so many stars.

2098
01:30:52,919 --> 01:30:53,919
- Right now? - Yes.

2099
01:30:53,919 --> 01:30:55,820
- Yes, there are. - There are so many stars.

2100
01:30:56,089 --> 01:30:59,129
- So many stars in the sky. - They are pretty.

2101
01:30:59,429 --> 01:31:02,230
(Let me see.)

2102
01:31:02,459 --> 01:31:05,030
- It's amazing. - There are so many stars.

2103
01:31:06,230 --> 01:31:12,169
(Stars are pouring over like a warm comfort.)

2104
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:15,410
- The sky is really clear. - Right.

2105
01:31:17,879 --> 01:31:22,679
(Tomorrow, I hope it will snow.)

2106
01:31:25,116 --> 01:31:28,116
(The first morning of...)

2107
01:31:28,116 --> 01:31:30,515
(the House on Wheels in Pyeongchang)

2108
01:31:31,055 --> 01:31:33,385
(It's minus 12°C in Pyeongchang.)

2109
01:31:33,385 --> 01:31:36,255
(Water in the fridge is frozen.)

2110
01:31:37,326 --> 01:31:38,826
(Coffee is frozen too.)

2111
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:41,366
(Due to extreme cold, dried pollack soup has turned into dongchimi.)

2112
01:31:42,125 --> 01:31:44,896
(This house has an open structure.)

2113
01:31:44,896 --> 01:31:46,095
(It's like the polar regions.)

2114
01:31:46,196 --> 01:31:48,835
(He just laughs.)

2115
01:31:49,206 --> 01:31:51,305
(Doo Na's nose-thermometer has turned red again.)

2116
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:55,706
(A guest arrives to melt the frigid House on Wheels.)

2117
01:31:55,706 --> 01:31:58,375
(A human heater, Kim Dong Wook)

2118
01:31:58,816 --> 01:32:01,515
(He kindly offers strawberries to Dong Il.)

2119
01:32:02,015 --> 01:32:05,816
(He brings them gloves.)

2120
01:32:06,685 --> 01:32:09,385
(He's also good at housekeeping.)

2121
01:32:10,085 --> 01:32:11,456
(He makes the House on Wheels nice and warm.)

2122
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:13,656
(And there's a present for members of the House on Wheels.)

2123
01:32:14,295 --> 01:32:15,725
It's snowing a lot outside.

2124
01:32:18,465 --> 01:32:19,465
(It's so good.)

2125
01:32:19,996 --> 01:32:22,106
(This is why it had been so cold. To give us the present.)

2126
01:32:23,106 --> 01:32:25,505
I think it's worth coming to Pyeongchang.

2127
01:32:25,975 --> 01:32:29,746
(House on Wheels Season 2 in Pyeongchang)
