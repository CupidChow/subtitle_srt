1
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,987
(Today's front yard is surrounded by a green forest.)

2
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:32,727
(Mount Cheonma Pine Tree Forest)

3
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:35,686
(Dong Il's youngest bright daughter, Actress Kim You Jung)

4
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:38,827
(She learned to enjoy camping alone.)

5
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:43,437
(She's become an expert camper who is also good at fishing.)

6
00:00:43,797 --> 00:00:45,496
(Follow me.)

7
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:47,266
(Fish, fish.)

8
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:50,876
(She's still very bright.)

9
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:51,907
(There you go!)

10
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:52,946
Si Wan.

11
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:55,376
(Can you give me one more piece?)

12
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:59,346
(You Jung also eats well.)

13
00:00:59,446 --> 00:01:02,816
(House on Wheels in the woods with bubbly You Jung)

14
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:07,927
(What's going to happen to them today?)

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,391
(A day with the warm spring sunlight...)

16
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:16,730
(that's perfect for an outing)

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,501
(House on Wheels is heading toward somewhere.)

18
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:23,130
The place we're going to today must be really warm.

19
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:24,501
It must be.

20
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:29,210
My bright daughter is coming today,

21
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,971
so I hope the weather will be nice.

22
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,380
I should go and welcome her.

23
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:36,650
(Dong Il sounds excited.)

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,520
How old was she when I first met her?

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,781
I think she was about seven.

26
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:44,691
- She was 7?
- Or was she 8?

27
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:47,260
- She was 7?
- Yes, I think she was 7 or 8.

28
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,260
(Exclaiming)

29
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:50,960
She played a patient when I first met her,

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,460
and she ended up playing my daughter.

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,430
I've watched her grow.

32
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,370
(Impressed)

33
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,001
(The youngest guest is coming to visit today.)

34
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:01,301
You know her well too, right?

35
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:02,540
- You Jung?
- Yes.

36
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,141
Yes, I know her. She's really bright.

37
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:06,210
She takes after me.

38
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,481
(He's a fool for his daughter.)

39
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:12,350
Anyway, I wonder if Si Wan is escorting her well.

40
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:14,721
I'm sure he will do well.

41
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,320
I should've gone to get her instead.

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
(Meanwhile, Si Wan is going to the place separately.)

43
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:21,721
(Laughing)

44
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,930
(Laughing)

45
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,490
(Si Wan is bringing You Jung well...)

46
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,100
(while laughing continuously.)

47
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,071
(He's even bringing a gift.)

48
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:36,270
(Today's guest, Kim You Jung)

49
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,111
(You Jung first met Dong Il as his patient in a drama.)

50
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:41,280
(9-year-old You Jung)

51
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:44,051
(She grew up to become Dong Il's bright daughter 8 years later.)

52
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:45,310
(17-year-old You Jung)

53
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:49,250
(Hee Won, whom she thought was her real father...)

54
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:52,451
(You're not my daughter.)

55
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:54,960
(You're my niece.)

56
00:02:55,161 --> 00:02:57,661
(13-year-old You Jung)

57
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:58,891
(Si Wan and You Jung are like sweet brother and sister.)

58
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,101
(She spent her childhood with all three of them.)

59
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,770
(You Jung came to visit House on Wheels.)

60
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,740
(Where is today's front yard they're heading to with You Jung?)

61
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,381
You said you know this place, right?

62
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:16,250
Yes, it's the most forest-like place...

63
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,451
that's close to Seoul.

64
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:22,120
There's nothing except for trees.

65
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,291
(Today's front yard is recommended by You Jung.)

66
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,020
It's even hard to pitch a tent when you go up there.

67
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,190
What does it mean to "pitch"?

68
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,761
It's fixing a tent on the ground. It's hard to pitch it up there.

69
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:33,530
You must've gone camping a lot.

70
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,970
I went camping alone a lot.

71
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:37,270
- Alone?
- Yes.

72
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,201
Last time I was here...

73
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,440
I didn't need to wash since I was here alone.

74
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,370
(You don't need to wash if you're on a trip alone.)

75
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:46,940
Right. You wash out of etiquette.

76
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,210
So I went down to the stream...

77
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,051
and just washed my face. There's one at the foot of the mountain.

78
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:53,421
- Oh, really?
- That's what I did.

79
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,020
You're amazing though.

80
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,921
When I was sleeping here alone...

81
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,190
I'm not even lying.

82
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:06,060
I heard someone screaming. It turned out to be an elk.

83
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,661
- You know...
- Like this?

84
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:10,530
(Exaggerating You Jung's story)

85
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:12,641
(That's right! That's the sound.)

86
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,870
When I heard it cry, I was really scared.

87
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,210
I feel dizzy just at the thought of it.

88
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,280
(The more we hear about her story, the more we can't wait for today.)

89
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,340
I like camping...

90
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,081
because it feels like you're taking your temporary home with you.

91
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:26,120
Right.

92
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,180
You get your own space when you're camping.

93
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,020
Still, you have so many things to do.

94
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,460
And so many unexpected things happen while camping.

95
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,060
- Right. But that's the fun of it.
- Really?

96
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,000
- That's what makes it fun.
- Is that so?

97
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:46,500
(When You Jung wanted to relax from her busy life, )

98
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,711
(she secretly came to this place.)

99
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,041
(It's close to Seoul, )

100
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,041
(so you can visit the place anytime.)

101
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:59,281
(The sunlight that beams between trees soothes you.)

102
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:02,620
(The clean stream water washes your face.)

103
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,450
(Today, she's here...)

104
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,221
(with her family.)

105
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,200
(You Jung invites you to her secret forest.)

106
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:17,543
Let's go.

107
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:19,543
(House on Wheels is hurrying its way to You Jung's secret forest.)

108
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:22,244
(Driving past a calm, blue lake...)

109
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:25,153
Gyeonggi Province has a lot of large bodies of water.

110
00:05:25,153 --> 00:05:26,153
Right.

111
00:05:26,153 --> 00:05:28,353
(House on Wheels is heading deeper into the mountains.)

112
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:32,423
(A well-hidden place deep in nature)

113
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:35,093
(Splashing)

114
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:40,233
(What kind of front yard will they get to see today?)

115
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:42,434
(Impressed)

116
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:44,603
Wow, this place is amazing.

117
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:51,213
(A thick forest you can't believe you're seeing)

118
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:52,444
This place is superb.

119
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:54,944
- Is this the place?
- Oh, it's here.

120
00:05:56,554 --> 00:06:00,684
(Eyes going wide)

121
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:04,523
This is the best front yard by far.

122
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:08,593
(Today's front yard, Mount Cheonma Pine Tree Forest in Namyangju)

123
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:11,934
(Mount Cheonma, the gift of nature, )

124
00:06:11,934 --> 00:06:15,533
(is located in Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province.)

125
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:21,603
(The beautiful pine tree forest that fills Mount Cheonma...)

126
00:06:22,204 --> 00:06:24,843
(becomes your garden filled with phytoncide.)

127
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:28,014
(The scent of pine trees...)

128
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:31,153
(surround your house.)

129
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:36,523
(You can hear water flowing from the clear stream next to your house.)

130
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:42,634
(When the night comes, )

131
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,894
(the starlight falls to the forest.)

132
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:46,704
(And the hidden treasure of this forest...)

133
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:48,704
(is pine nuts.)

134
00:06:50,103 --> 00:06:54,944
(You can even taste the savory pine nut noodles.)

135
00:06:55,473 --> 00:06:57,843
(Slurping)

136
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:06,184
(A way to spend a relaxing day)

137
00:07:07,954 --> 00:07:10,954
(We're spending a day...)

138
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:16,163
(in the pine tree forest of Mount Cheonma.)

139
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:21,533
(Dong Il and Hee Won have arrived at the front yard first.)

140
00:07:23,473 --> 00:07:24,934
This place is beautiful.

141
00:07:25,473 --> 00:07:29,473
Look at this. The sunlight beaming between the trees is amazing.

142
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:31,213
Right.

143
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:33,944
You Jung recommended this place.

144
00:07:33,944 --> 00:07:35,343
(Sunlight pouring on top of House on Wheels)

145
00:07:37,554 --> 00:07:42,454
(And the pine tree forest spread out behind House on Wheels)

146
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,923
(A gentle breeze)

147
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:50,494
(The sunlight...)

148
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:52,934
(that comes between the thick forest)

149
00:07:53,663 --> 00:07:57,973
(What's going to happen to them today?)

150
00:07:58,074 --> 00:07:59,944
We're a little late because it's deep in the mountains.

151
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:04,373
It's still cold.

152
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:09,414
We should turn on the heating system. It's a little cold today.

153
00:08:10,054 --> 00:08:11,054
All right.

154
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:16,623
(They open the windows so that the scent of the forest can go inside.)

155
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:18,353
Fix the window, and let's open this.

156
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:19,924
(They hurry to get ready for the guest.)

157
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:22,963
You and I look like Dumb and Dumber with our sunglasses on.

158
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:26,664
How about going on a trip just the two of us?

159
00:08:26,664 --> 00:08:28,863
- You don't want it either, right?
- No.

160
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:34,174
- Fix this one.
- Okay. I need to fix this first.

161
00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:35,204
You don't want it either, right?

162
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:37,814
- I don't think you want to go.
- No, I'd love to.

163
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:39,343
My daughter is coming,

164
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:42,044
so we need to hurry and make something for her.

165
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:46,123
- Do we go up further?
- Yes.

166
00:08:46,123 --> 00:08:47,424
(Si Wan and You Jung are nearing the front yard.)

167
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:48,883
The whole place...

168
00:08:49,424 --> 00:08:52,863
The further you go up, the thicker the forest gets.

169
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:56,493
(You Jung excitedly explains about the place to Si Wan.)

170
00:08:57,434 --> 00:08:59,093
It must be really cool when you come in summer.

171
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:00,263
It's so pretty.

172
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:03,574
They're here.

173
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:05,674
- They're here?
- Yes.

174
00:09:05,674 --> 00:09:07,444
What's with that car?

175
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:11,643
What's that thing you brought? You should be driving a house.

176
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:13,944
I brought one too.

177
00:09:14,383 --> 00:09:16,713
I know. What's that? We have two houses today?

178
00:09:17,284 --> 00:09:18,314
You Jung.

179
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:20,623
(He's glad to see her.)

180
00:09:21,924 --> 00:09:25,554
(Dad.)

181
00:09:26,393 --> 00:09:30,294
(The reunion of the father and daughter makes us smile.)

182
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:33,233
(It's good to see you!)

183
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:35,103
(It's been a while since I saw You Jung.)

184
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:38,674
Hee Won! Would you welcome her? Gosh, you punk.

185
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:40,973
(Bursting into laughter)

186
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:43,513
How much more can I welcome her? Welcome, You Jung.

187
00:09:44,743 --> 00:09:47,414
- Let's go.
- It looks like a cabin.

188
00:09:47,414 --> 00:09:49,184
- Sorry? How is it?
- It looks like a cabin.

189
00:09:50,414 --> 00:09:51,784
This is our house.

190
00:09:51,784 --> 00:09:52,784
(Expectant)

191
00:09:52,784 --> 00:09:53,784
How is it?

192
00:09:53,784 --> 00:09:55,723
(Fascinated)

193
00:09:55,924 --> 00:09:57,723
So this is where you come often?

194
00:09:57,723 --> 00:09:58,753
Yes, that's right.

195
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:01,623
- It's quite dangerous.
- That's why I come to this place.

196
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:03,164
- What?
- I like that it's dangerous.

197
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:05,194
- You like that it's dangerous?
- Yes, I like that it's rough.

198
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:08,733
Dong Il, she says she usually stays here for three nights.

199
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:11,404
- Alone?
- Yes, alone.

200
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:12,843
Have you been well?

201
00:10:12,843 --> 00:10:14,304
- Yes, I have.
- That's good.

202
00:10:14,904 --> 00:10:16,643
Okay. Now that you came here, get some rest, You Jung.

203
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:17,873
- Let's work.
- What should I do?

204
00:10:17,873 --> 00:10:19,074
What's there for her to do?

205
00:10:20,483 --> 00:10:22,784
You two can go up there and have some conversation.

206
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:24,554
Okay!

207
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:26,983
Gosh, since my daughter is here,

208
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:28,483
she lifts my mood.

209
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:30,824
(Si Wan and You Jung take a look around the front yard.)

210
00:10:30,824 --> 00:10:33,963
- So you've been here often?
- Yes.

211
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:37,233
- Yes, the path goes on this way.
- Yes.

212
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:39,034
The path isn't even like this.

213
00:10:39,463 --> 00:10:40,633
It becomes really...

214
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:41,804
(Winding)

215
00:10:41,804 --> 00:10:43,473
- So it's like an off-road trail.
- Right.

216
00:10:43,473 --> 00:10:47,973
- I hear water trickling here.
- Yes, I think it's down there.

217
00:10:48,544 --> 00:10:50,843
- You must cook a lot then?
- Sure.

218
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:54,044
- I eat ramyeon and grill meat.
- Goodness.

219
00:10:54,243 --> 00:10:55,314
Here.

220
00:10:57,753 --> 00:10:59,383
- Isn't this place cute?
- Yes.

221
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:00,753
I washed my face there.

222
00:11:00,753 --> 00:11:02,154
You washed your face in a place like this?

223
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:04,524
Right. The stream goes all the way down there.

224
00:11:04,524 --> 00:11:06,294
My gosh, it's so beautiful.

225
00:11:07,694 --> 00:11:10,363
When I see clear water, I become extremely excited.

226
00:11:10,794 --> 00:11:12,794
- The water looks so clear.
- Right.

227
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:16,473
- I like the sound of water.
- Yes, I like the sound of it.

228
00:11:17,103 --> 00:11:21,174
(The sound of a trickling stream...)

229
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:25,074
(adds freshness to the front yard.)

230
00:11:25,444 --> 00:11:27,243
- We should bring chairs.
- Just that one.

231
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:28,314
- This one?
- Yes.

232
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:31,314
- Only one, at the moment.
- Looks like they own this mountain.

233
00:11:32,883 --> 00:11:35,324
We'll bring chairs. Where do you want to sit?

234
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:38,054
I think this is a flat area.

235
00:11:38,054 --> 00:11:40,363
Here? Okay, then tell them to bring chairs here.

236
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:41,763
Four of them, got it?

237
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:43,733
- Tell them the position.
- Here.

238
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:46,133
- It's flat here. How about here?
- Should I put it here?

239
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:47,204
Okay.

240
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:48,704
Be careful.

241
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,304
- It's okay.
- What do I do?

242
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:52,274
- Seriously...
- It's done.

243
00:11:52,274 --> 00:11:53,274
(Facing opposite direction)

244
00:11:53,674 --> 00:11:55,544
The opposite way...

245
00:11:57,113 --> 00:11:58,174
It's done.

246
00:11:58,174 --> 00:11:59,444
(Is it all done?)

247
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:02,243
- Ta-da!
- Pick whichever direction you want.

248
00:12:03,853 --> 00:12:05,253
- Sitting with my back against you?
- Right.

249
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:06,454
- As you please.
- Like this?

250
00:12:06,554 --> 00:12:07,883
We can sit like this.

251
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,824
- What's that?
- It looks natural and nice.

252
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:10,853
(Innovative placement of chairs)

253
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:13,194
We can sit wherever we feel at ease.

254
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:15,593
Honestly, we don't talk that much with each other.

255
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:17,893
Don't do that.

256
00:12:18,434 --> 00:12:22,133
We should show You Jung how warm our family is.

257
00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:24,674
(Chuckling)

258
00:12:25,473 --> 00:12:28,103
- I'm hungry.
- Okay, I'll fix some food quickly.

259
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:31,473
- What's the menu, Dong Il?
- The menu?

260
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:34,044
We're in the pine tree forest.

261
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:35,684
- I'll make noodles with pine nuts.
- I see.

262
00:12:35,684 --> 00:12:38,213
- So these are pine trees.
- Right, pine nut noodles.

263
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:44,493
(A wide pine tree forest that is surrounding our house)

264
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:47,493
(A precious ingredient from pine trees)

265
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:50,593
(Pine nuts)

266
00:12:51,164 --> 00:12:54,664
(If you pour freshly ground pine nuts over noodles, )

267
00:12:54,664 --> 00:13:00,373
(you can have creamy and savory pine nut noodles.)

268
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:06,044
(Dad will make it tasty.)

269
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:09,544
Dong Il, I'll show You Jung around our house.

270
00:13:09,544 --> 00:13:10,554
Good, go ahead.

271
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:11,613
- You Jung.
- Yes?

272
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:15,883
You know this house... I'll show you around the house.

273
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:17,223
- Sounds good.
- Right.

274
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:19,524
- Show me around.
- Okay.

275
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:21,024
- This place is our living room.
- It's the living room.

276
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:22,294
- This is the living room.
- The living room.

277
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:24,233
You can sit here.

278
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:26,534
We sit here to have a conversation.

279
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:29,164
- Like this.
- This chair is so narrow.

280
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:31,174
We sit here, but actually, we usually sit on the floor.

281
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:32,674
We end up sitting on the floor.

282
00:13:32,674 --> 00:13:33,843
(Glancing)

283
00:13:33,843 --> 00:13:34,843
And...

284
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:36,643
What is this? My goodness!

285
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:38,143
- It follows you.
- Goodness, it's amazing.

286
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:39,314
(What's so amazing?)

287
00:13:39,314 --> 00:13:40,414
It'll keep following you.

288
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:42,684
- You'll get used to it.
- It doesn't. It's receding.

289
00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:45,054
(He keeps checking on You Jung.)

290
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,753
We have this. It's our second bed.

291
00:13:47,924 --> 00:13:50,524
Can you unfold it? I see.

292
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:51,853
(It keeps bothering him.)

293
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:53,623
- It's spacious.
- Take a look at it from here.

294
00:13:54,763 --> 00:13:57,794
(Standing next to Si Wan)

295
00:13:57,794 --> 00:14:00,863
From here. Now you can see it's quite spacious.

296
00:14:00,863 --> 00:14:02,664
- It is indeed.
- Right, when you sleep here,

297
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:04,103
it's good because...

298
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:07,003
- There.
- Hey, Si Wan.

299
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:08,873
- Si Wan.
- Yes?

300
00:14:08,873 --> 00:14:11,243
Do not smile with your eyes at my daughter.

301
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:12,914
Don't be too kind.

302
00:14:12,973 --> 00:14:15,914
Should I be less kind to her to some extent?

303
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:16,983
Yes, make it less.

304
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:19,154
(Dad!)

305
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:21,154
Okay, You Jung. Just a moment.

306
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:25,393
Should I put a lot of pine nuts to make the noodles savory?

307
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:27,194
Or maybe slightly...

308
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:28,623
Should I put this much to make it savory?

309
00:14:28,623 --> 00:14:30,534
- Yes. Okay.
- I'm going to grind it.

310
00:14:32,963 --> 00:14:36,804
(Putting enough of them for his daughter)

311
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,334
You can't really trust me, can you?

312
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:40,774
Yes, I can.

313
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:44,143
- I must trust my dad.
- That's right.

314
00:14:46,414 --> 00:14:49,684
(Mash tofu with his hands.)

315
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:54,654
(Pour it into the blender with soy milk.)

316
00:14:57,054 --> 00:15:01,164
(Chef Sung is always a reliable dad.)

317
00:15:02,393 --> 00:15:03,493
My goodness.

318
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:05,194
It's overflowing.

319
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:07,334
(His love for his daughter is overflowing.)

320
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:08,434
It's overflowing.

321
00:15:08,434 --> 00:15:09,503
(That's fine.)

322
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:13,103
(While the pine nut broth is being ready...)

323
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,473
(Glancing)

324
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:19,473
(Why can't I do this?)

325
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:22,013
(Smiling)

326
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:23,584
(She notices Hee Won struggling with light bulbs.)

327
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,024
Shall I untangle it?

328
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:30,623
- Can you help with the middle part?
- Okay.

329
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:33,963
I'm going to hang it over here.

330
00:15:33,963 --> 00:15:35,024
(After handling it for a while...)

331
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:38,993
(Easily)

332
00:15:39,363 --> 00:15:41,934
- It's slanted. I can't reach it.
- Hee Won, I...

333
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:43,233
- I can do it from here.
- Okay.

334
00:15:43,503 --> 00:15:44,534
- Just a moment.
- Yes.

335
00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:45,873
Don't make my daughter do that!

336
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:47,503
Don't give her any chores.

337
00:15:48,044 --> 00:15:49,373
I didn't.

338
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:50,643
(Laughing)

339
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:51,643
Like this.

340
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:53,314
(Dad is the best, right?)

341
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:56,284
(Smiling)

342
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:59,713
(Savory pine nut broth is ready.)

343
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:06,294
(Coming up)

344
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:09,623
(Here you are!)

345
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:11,863
- From the beginning...
- Yes.

346
00:16:11,863 --> 00:16:15,164
Okay, my daughter. Should I add a little salt?

347
00:16:15,164 --> 00:16:18,404
If I add salt...

348
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:22,444
What would you like? Salt or a bit of sugar?

349
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:23,674
- Salt.
- Salt?

350
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:27,244
- That's good.
- It's a bit sweet.

351
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:29,744
- It's because of pine nuts.
- There's the sweet taste.

352
00:16:30,153 --> 00:16:33,754
(Today, You Jung's palate will be the standard.)

353
00:16:35,183 --> 00:16:36,494
(With whole heart)

354
00:16:36,494 --> 00:16:37,893
(Grinding)

355
00:16:37,893 --> 00:16:39,153
(Admiring)

356
00:16:39,794 --> 00:16:42,964
Since my daughter is here, I have to make it heartily.

357
00:16:44,034 --> 00:16:47,334
Pine nuts are good for your health. I also put tofu and soy milk.

358
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:50,504
(It looks delicious.)

359
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:52,274
You're saying we can put shoes on it?

360
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:53,304
Yes.

361
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:55,474
- Right?
- I'll put some stones on it.

362
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,643
- There are big stones over there.
- Yes.

363
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,514
Why are they being so noisy?

364
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:02,084
I think they're doing something.

365
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:03,353
- They are like Dumb and Dumber.
- They're picking up stones.

366
00:17:03,353 --> 00:17:04,714
I don't know what they're up to.

367
00:17:05,554 --> 00:17:07,024
That's enough. Enough.

368
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:09,084
That'll be enough.

369
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,153
- Hold it here.
- I'll be holding it.

370
00:17:11,153 --> 00:17:12,153
Wait a moment.

371
00:17:12,153 --> 00:17:14,163
(They're struggling with the deck.)

372
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,163
Hee Won, I think I fell in love with the deck too.

373
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:17,663
I know. This deck is...

374
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:18,964
(He came to know the appeal of a deck through House on Wheels.)

375
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:21,834
I'll be looking for a deck when I go on a camping trip.

376
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:23,304
We're done.

377
00:17:23,804 --> 00:17:25,304
I see. They're settling the deck.

378
00:17:25,304 --> 00:17:26,504
No, wait.

379
00:17:27,903 --> 00:17:29,274
Gosh, now...

380
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:32,214
Hee Won, I'm so into the charm of the deck.

381
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:33,514
Dong Il! No. Why did I call you Dong Il?

382
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:37,084
He thinks Si Wan is older than him.

383
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:38,683
(Embarrassed)

384
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,623
I may call You Jung my older sister.

385
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:43,153
(Laughing)

386
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:46,123
- Is it done?
- I think it's done.

387
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:47,393
Okay, good.

388
00:17:48,524 --> 00:17:52,193
(Staring)

389
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:55,834
(Furtively)

390
00:17:57,334 --> 00:17:59,903
(Taking a bite)

391
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:04,244
It's like soybean noodle soup.

392
00:18:05,443 --> 00:18:07,143
You Jung. Once you try it...

393
00:18:07,143 --> 00:18:08,143
(It's tasty.)

394
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:10,554
(I'll have one more, it's delicious!)

395
00:18:10,554 --> 00:18:11,814
It's definitely the best.

396
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:18,893
(She's eating dried laver as if she's hungry.)

397
00:18:19,393 --> 00:18:22,193
(My daughter must be hungry.)

398
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:25,064
(In a hurry)

399
00:18:25,064 --> 00:18:27,804
(Dong Il hurries so that You Jung won't get hungry.)

400
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:33,443
(Safely filmed in a campground where the use of burners is granted.)

401
00:18:35,474 --> 00:18:39,014
(Pouring)

402
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:40,643
(Approaching)

403
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:44,014
(Staring)

404
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:48,254
Can I eat a strand?

405
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:50,324
You're asking for it.

406
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,254
How can I say no?

407
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:55,193
(Following Dong Il around, she keeps eating.)

408
00:18:55,794 --> 00:18:58,593
- You Jung, stir it well.
- Okay.

409
00:18:58,593 --> 00:18:59,734
Your dad is busy.

410
00:19:02,603 --> 00:19:04,774
- Tell me when it's done.
- I will.

411
00:19:11,474 --> 00:19:12,514
(In a...)

412
00:19:12,514 --> 00:19:15,343
(hurry)

413
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:22,054
(Extremely busy)

414
00:19:22,784 --> 00:19:24,254
Is it all going well, You Jung?

415
00:19:24,254 --> 00:19:25,953
I think...

416
00:19:26,153 --> 00:19:28,163
I need a little water.

417
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:30,834
- Water?
- To add water if it overflows.

418
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:33,234
You don't have to. Keep stirring. Reduce heat.

419
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:35,564
- Heat...
- I'll do it.

420
00:19:35,564 --> 00:19:37,074
- How can I reduce it?
- It's dangerous.

421
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:39,903
No, don't pour water in. Don't let it cool down.

422
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,074
Reduce heat.

423
00:19:41,074 --> 00:19:42,373
- Reduce heat?
- Yes.

424
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:43,413
(I'll reduce it now.)

425
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:46,113
(Little by little)

426
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:51,984
I can't reduce the heat.

427
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:55,584
I turned the switch to the end.

428
00:19:55,724 --> 00:19:56,893
My gosh!

429
00:19:56,893 --> 00:19:57,953
- Is it turned off?
- It's turned off.

430
00:19:58,423 --> 00:19:59,953
You should turn it on again.

431
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:02,623
But wouldn't it have been enough?

432
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:04,663
I did it.

433
00:20:04,764 --> 00:20:05,964
I reduced the heat.

434
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:07,034
(He reduced the heat at the end.)

435
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:10,074
Keep stirring. The noodles.

436
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:13,843
(If Dong Il says so, I'll keep stirring it.)

437
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:15,974
We usually add cold water to it, right?

438
00:20:18,443 --> 00:20:19,974
- "No." But actually, we can.
- Dong Il...

439
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:22,314
- He has his own method.
- Right.

440
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:23,453
Hey.

441
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:25,613
Stay quiet.

442
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:28,984
If he says no, we can't.

443
00:20:28,984 --> 00:20:30,653
(You're talking loudly. Your dad may hear it.)

444
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:33,393
(You'll get into trouble when he hears it.)

445
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:35,093
He's bad-tempered.

446
00:20:36,264 --> 00:20:37,863
He has a nasty temper.

447
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,234
You Jung, you can't.

448
00:20:39,234 --> 00:20:40,834
(Hee Won's disclosure continues as the noodle strands.)

449
00:20:40,903 --> 00:20:43,264
If he says something, you should apologize no matter what.

450
00:20:43,264 --> 00:20:44,304
(His joke continues.)

451
00:20:44,304 --> 00:20:46,574
(Laughing)

452
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:50,514
(Is everything going all right out there?)

453
00:20:50,843 --> 00:20:52,744
- I think it's almost done.
- That's right.

454
00:20:52,744 --> 00:20:54,683
- Is it done?
- I'll try one.

455
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:56,544
Try it, You Jung.

456
00:20:56,584 --> 00:20:59,054
- Here. It's hot.
- It must be hot.

457
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:02,324
- You Jung.
- It's hot.

458
00:21:02,324 --> 00:21:03,593
Wait.

459
00:21:04,754 --> 00:21:08,824
(She quickly catches the falling strand and eats it.)

460
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,764
- Is it done? It's all done?
- Yes.

461
00:21:10,764 --> 00:21:12,163
Dong Il, it's all done.

462
00:21:12,163 --> 00:21:14,264
- Done? Give it to me.
- Quickly.

463
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,234
Okay.

464
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,544
(Here are boiled noodles.)

465
00:21:22,443 --> 00:21:23,913
(Pour it into the water with ice.)

466
00:21:23,913 --> 00:21:25,143
Hand me the tongs.

467
00:21:25,373 --> 00:21:26,814
- Tongs?
- I found it.

468
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:32,284
(Becoming chewy)

469
00:21:36,923 --> 00:21:40,863
(Divide evenly and put it in a bowl.)

470
00:21:41,163 --> 00:21:44,994
(It must be delicious.)

471
00:21:45,464 --> 00:21:47,433
To eat lunch with gusto...

472
00:21:48,534 --> 00:21:51,034
To eat it with gusto, go for a run.

473
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,744
- You should be hungry to enjoy it.
- But I'm hungry now.

474
00:21:53,744 --> 00:21:54,774
Right.

475
00:21:54,774 --> 00:21:55,804
(Dad and Uncle have good chemistry.)

476
00:21:56,943 --> 00:22:01,284
(Is this restaurant famous for its pine nut noodles?)

477
00:22:01,744 --> 00:22:03,214
It looks delicious.

478
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:10,153
(A combination of chewy noodles and savory soup)

479
00:22:11,853 --> 00:22:15,724
(And we can't leave this out!)

480
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:19,933
(Here come the sesame seeds.)

481
00:22:21,804 --> 00:22:24,173
(Pouring sesame seeds)

482
00:22:27,443 --> 00:22:29,173
(Cutting)

483
00:22:30,574 --> 00:22:34,143
(Kimchi goes well with pine nut noodles.)

484
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:38,453
(Pouring sesame seeds)

485
00:22:38,953 --> 00:22:41,224
- Gosh, it looks good.
- Let me take it.

486
00:22:41,224 --> 00:22:42,324
(He passes the noodles to Hee Won.)

487
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:43,524
Thank you.

488
00:22:44,923 --> 00:22:48,193
(Delivering it cautiously, not to spill the broth)

489
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:52,933
(Let's move to the dining spot.)

490
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:55,903
- Good. Keep holding it.
- I will.

491
00:22:55,903 --> 00:22:58,074
- Okay, hold on a second. Stones...
- Okay.

492
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:01,403
Okay, hold on a second. Stones...

493
00:23:01,403 --> 00:23:02,673
(Here's a stone.)

494
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,774
Here, you can wedge it in here.

495
00:23:05,173 --> 00:23:06,274
Wedge it.

496
00:23:06,274 --> 00:23:08,413
Hee Won, You Jung wedged the stone.

497
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:10,353
(She's nimble as she is the master of camping)

498
00:23:10,913 --> 00:23:13,284
- You can put a stone in it.
- Yes, You Jung wedged it.

499
00:23:13,284 --> 00:23:15,183
- Did she?
- You Jung is fast.

500
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:16,284
Looks good.

501
00:23:16,284 --> 00:23:18,393
(Throwing away)

502
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:19,853
Dong Il, we're all set.

503
00:23:19,853 --> 00:23:21,623
(Laughing)

504
00:23:22,593 --> 00:23:26,464
(A meal with pine nut noodles is finally ready.)

505
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,804
You'll be truly surprised because it's delicious.

506
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:31,774
- Gosh, this looks nice.
- Seriously.

507
00:23:31,774 --> 00:23:32,933
(Looking delicious)

508
00:23:33,074 --> 00:23:34,274
- Let's eat up.
- It looks so delicious.

509
00:23:34,274 --> 00:23:35,574
- Thank you for the food.
- Add salt...

510
00:23:35,574 --> 00:23:37,443
- as much as you'd like.
- Okay.

511
00:23:37,443 --> 00:23:40,214
But I think it'll be just fine with kimchi.

512
00:23:40,883 --> 00:23:42,784
(Slurping)

513
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:49,024
(They all taste the pine nut broth.)

514
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:51,824
- My, it's so savory.
- Yes.

515
00:23:51,824 --> 00:23:53,923
The taste of pine nuts is so strong.

516
00:23:53,923 --> 00:23:56,264
- And...
- It's so savory.

517
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:57,693
(I prepared a lot of it.)

518
00:23:57,693 --> 00:23:59,133
It's so savory.

519
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:01,504
It's delicious as it is.

520
00:24:01,903 --> 00:24:03,564
Dong Il, these pine nuts are...

521
00:24:03,564 --> 00:24:04,933
We have this much,

522
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:07,074
so add more if it's too thick.

523
00:24:07,203 --> 00:24:09,974
- Have some, You Jung.
- Thank you for the food!

524
00:24:09,974 --> 00:24:11,544
The broth is a little thick.

525
00:24:11,613 --> 00:24:14,584
- Hee Won.
- Yes? I'll try the noodles first.

526
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:16,314
The noodles are just perfect.

527
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,453
- Today...
- Me?

528
00:24:18,453 --> 00:24:21,524
You did a good job taking my daughter around.

529
00:24:21,524 --> 00:24:25,794
No problem. I'm just grateful that You Jung is here.

530
00:24:25,794 --> 00:24:29,724
(Noodles make an entrance.)

531
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:32,093
(Savoring)

532
00:24:32,093 --> 00:24:34,703
This pine nut noodle is no joke.

533
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:37,774
- My goodness.
- Isn't it good? Have enough broth.

534
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:42,974
This broth is better than soybean noodle soup.

535
00:24:43,603 --> 00:24:46,314
It's a delicacy. I love it.

536
00:24:46,314 --> 00:24:49,183
(Taking a mouthful)

537
00:24:51,584 --> 00:24:54,584
It'll be also good if we eat it warm when it's cold.

538
00:24:54,584 --> 00:24:55,824
(Chewing)

539
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,393
This is a healthy dish.

540
00:24:58,393 --> 00:25:00,623
- Like soybean noodle soup.
- I know.

541
00:25:00,623 --> 00:25:02,724
Right, it really is a healthy dish.

542
00:25:02,724 --> 00:25:06,794
- Gosh, the broth is so savory.
- It's so light and tasty.

543
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:08,734
- It's good.
- Right. It's savory.

544
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:11,534
I like it better because it's thick.

545
00:25:11,933 --> 00:25:14,203
- The pine nuts are really sweet.
- Right.

546
00:25:14,203 --> 00:25:15,873
- It's sweet, right?
- Yes.

547
00:25:15,873 --> 00:25:17,514
(He already finished a bowl.)

548
00:25:17,514 --> 00:25:19,574
I put pine nuts a lot on purpose.

549
00:25:19,774 --> 00:25:22,413
Gosh, these pine nuts...

550
00:25:22,514 --> 00:25:24,183
- Do you want more broth?
- Yes.

551
00:25:24,183 --> 00:25:25,514
The broth is so savory.

552
00:25:25,514 --> 00:25:27,623
You should have taken it when I offered you earlier.

553
00:25:27,623 --> 00:25:30,183
- You make me work twice.
- It was full of noodles earlier.

554
00:25:30,324 --> 00:25:32,254
He keeps making me do this and that...

555
00:25:32,254 --> 00:25:33,653
when we're eating just a bowl of noodles.

556
00:25:34,524 --> 00:25:35,663
Did you see it?

557
00:25:36,324 --> 00:25:37,633
He's always like this.

558
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:38,994
(He's always like this.)

559
00:25:39,234 --> 00:25:42,403
(Laughing)

560
00:25:43,363 --> 00:25:44,433
(I'll tell You Jung on you.)

561
00:25:44,433 --> 00:25:46,074
He can't say that I'm wrong.

562
00:25:46,074 --> 00:25:47,574
(Sulky)

563
00:25:48,603 --> 00:25:49,804
Try it with kimchi.

564
00:25:49,804 --> 00:25:51,443
Pick a piece with lots of sesame seeds.

565
00:25:52,173 --> 00:25:53,544
This is freshly made kimchi.

566
00:25:53,544 --> 00:25:55,383
- It's delicious.
- Yes.

567
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,324
(Struggling)

568
00:26:02,453 --> 00:26:05,724
Dong Il, you should've cut it into smaller pieces for You Jung.

569
00:26:05,893 --> 00:26:07,794
(Annoyed)

570
00:26:07,923 --> 00:26:09,724
- No, I'm okay.
- She likes to tear it...

571
00:26:09,724 --> 00:26:10,994
since she was a little girl.

572
00:26:11,193 --> 00:26:13,363
- What?
- Since her first birthday.

573
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:17,373
She grabbed aged kimchi at her first birthday party.

574
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,373
- At her first birthday party?
- Right, she grabbed aged kimchi.

575
00:26:21,074 --> 00:26:23,103
Dong Il, but still, it's too big.

576
00:26:23,774 --> 00:26:25,744
It even has a stalk end.

577
00:26:26,913 --> 00:26:28,544
- I like a stalk end.
- I prepared it for you.

578
00:26:28,814 --> 00:26:30,683
- You see?
- I like this part of kimchi.

579
00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:33,084
She grabbed the stalk end of kimchi at her first birthday party.

580
00:26:33,784 --> 00:26:36,423
(Laughing)

581
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:37,994
(I'll cut it for you.)

582
00:26:37,994 --> 00:26:39,794
See? I still remember it.

583
00:26:39,794 --> 00:26:40,964
Do you want to take the stalk end?

584
00:26:41,863 --> 00:26:43,623
- Hee Won, try this.
- Please eat.

585
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:45,893
Think about why she likes it.

586
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:47,834
- The stalk end.
- Give it a try.

587
00:26:50,133 --> 00:26:53,074
I now know why she grabbed it at her first birthday party.

588
00:26:53,074 --> 00:26:54,304
(It's as good as kkakdugi.)

589
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:56,703
- It's no joke.
- My goodness.

590
00:26:57,873 --> 00:26:59,913
You can eat it with kimchi.

591
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:02,113
- Like thin noodles.
- I see.

592
00:27:02,843 --> 00:27:05,484
- The broth is so savory.
- It's a work of art.

593
00:27:05,484 --> 00:27:06,554
(He likes broth.)

594
00:27:06,953 --> 00:27:09,584
This is... I want to make it for my kids.

595
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:10,923
- Seriously. I mean it.
- Yes.

596
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:12,494
- Do you want some salt?
- No, without salt.

597
00:27:12,494 --> 00:27:13,893
- No salt?
- No.

598
00:27:13,893 --> 00:27:15,123
- You don't need to add salt.
- Right.

599
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:17,764
Because pine nuts are savory.

600
00:27:18,193 --> 00:27:19,734
It's truly a work of art.

601
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:21,304
(Licking)

602
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:24,103
Gosh, we're having pine nut noodles under these pine trees.

603
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:25,574
Isn't this incredible?

604
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:28,343
- Right.
- Seriously, this is no joke.

605
00:27:29,574 --> 00:27:35,284
(In a pine tree forest where pine cones are scattered around, )

606
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:39,214
(today's lunch satisfies both their eyes and palate.)

607
00:27:41,853 --> 00:27:43,423
We picked them up together.

608
00:27:43,423 --> 00:27:46,524
(Healthy energy of pine nuts spreads all over the body.)

609
00:27:48,264 --> 00:27:49,764
How many years has it been?

610
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,834
About five years?

611
00:27:52,764 --> 00:27:54,703
No, it's been longer than that.

612
00:27:54,703 --> 00:27:56,304
I think it's been seven years.

613
00:27:56,564 --> 00:27:58,203
Has it been that long?

614
00:28:02,343 --> 00:28:09,343
(7 years ago, they went through a sad breakup.)

615
00:28:12,254 --> 00:28:15,724
I'm 23 now, and I was in middle school at that time.

616
00:28:15,724 --> 00:28:17,524
You were in middle school then?

617
00:28:17,524 --> 00:28:20,324
I see. It's been so long.

618
00:28:21,593 --> 00:28:24,334
You Jung has such beautiful eyes.

619
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,834
I still think that when I see her.

620
00:28:26,093 --> 00:28:29,433
Those eyes are a gift for an actor.

621
00:28:30,304 --> 00:28:31,774
It amazes me...

622
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:34,173
Very few people have their childhood face...

623
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:36,274
when they grow up.

624
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,574
- She was so pretty as a child.
- I haven't changed.

625
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:40,613
She grew up with that exact look.

626
00:28:41,714 --> 00:28:44,814
- Does she look young now?
- She became even prettier.

627
00:28:44,814 --> 00:28:46,683
Or should I say she looked older than her age when she was a kid?

628
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,853
No, that's not.

629
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:51,353
(She almost belched it out.)

630
00:28:51,353 --> 00:28:54,794
When she was young, she was premature.

631
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,234
So you looked older than your age before, right?

632
00:28:58,294 --> 00:28:59,494
Am I right?

633
00:28:59,494 --> 00:29:00,663
(What are you talking about?)

634
00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:03,004
But she hasn't changed since she was a little girl.

635
00:29:03,004 --> 00:29:05,804
She looks the same.

636
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:08,304
- You hate it that much?
- No, I just think it's amazing.

637
00:29:08,304 --> 00:29:10,574
Gosh, then you should say it nicely, perhaps with a smile.

638
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:13,143
I'm saying she's pretty. She was such a pretty girl before.

639
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:14,984
(Urgent gesture)

640
00:29:14,984 --> 00:29:16,814
(Are you pointing fingers at her?)

641
00:29:16,814 --> 00:29:18,214
And she has grown up looking exactly the same.

642
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,814
Why are you pointing fingers at her?

643
00:29:20,113 --> 00:29:22,153
I'm not pointing my fingers. It's my palm.

644
00:29:22,153 --> 00:29:24,054
- Pointing his palm.
- I'm pointing my palm at her.

645
00:29:24,193 --> 00:29:26,554
- Pointing my palm.
- It is a palm.

646
00:29:26,554 --> 00:29:28,593
- Sorry, You Jung.
- You punk.

647
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:30,494
- Watch your behavior to your niece.
- Dong Il.

648
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:32,994
She was your daughter, but she was my niece.

649
00:29:32,994 --> 00:29:34,004
Right.

650
00:29:34,004 --> 00:29:36,103
Of course, she's your niece. She's my daughter.

651
00:29:36,103 --> 00:29:37,574
So that means you're my brother?

652
00:29:37,574 --> 00:29:38,673
(Are you my brother?)

653
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:42,074
(It's getting twisted.)

654
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:44,673
And you were my brother.

655
00:29:44,673 --> 00:29:46,173
Your brother, yes.

656
00:29:46,173 --> 00:29:48,183
- We're a family.
- He is my son.

657
00:29:48,343 --> 00:29:50,754
- Dad!
- He's my son.

658
00:29:51,314 --> 00:29:54,324
- Wait, he's your son.
- I'm her brother. Dad!

659
00:29:54,623 --> 00:29:56,784
- I'm your uncle.
- You're my uncle.

660
00:29:56,784 --> 00:29:58,893
- We were a family.
- A family.

661
00:29:58,893 --> 00:30:02,163
I have many daughters and sons wherever I go.

662
00:30:02,163 --> 00:30:04,893
We were all families. Now we know.

663
00:30:04,893 --> 00:30:05,933
(Today was a family gathering.)

664
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:09,163
(Little You Jung was like an angel.)

665
00:30:09,163 --> 00:30:11,774
(When You Jung was 9 years old)

666
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:13,703
(When You Jung was 13 years old)

667
00:30:13,703 --> 00:30:18,574
(She has been growing in the screens little by little.)

668
00:30:18,913 --> 00:30:21,413
(When You Jung was 17 years old)

669
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:25,254
(Now she's a grown-up.)

670
00:30:25,913 --> 00:30:27,284
Do you drink now?

671
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,853
When you were little, I used to say...

672
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:31,423
- I'd like to have drinks...
- That's right.

673
00:30:31,423 --> 00:30:32,494
- with you when you grow up.
- I remember that.

674
00:30:32,593 --> 00:30:34,393
Do you drink at times now?

675
00:30:34,393 --> 00:30:35,564
I do.

676
00:30:36,123 --> 00:30:37,464
Not much, though.

677
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:40,163
We don't, either. Still, it'd be more than he does.

678
00:30:40,494 --> 00:30:42,504
- I can't drink at all.
- You can't drink?

679
00:30:42,504 --> 00:30:44,304
- Not even a single drink.
- For real?

680
00:30:44,304 --> 00:30:47,203
I don't like the feeling of it.

681
00:30:47,203 --> 00:30:49,574
That's true. I agree.

682
00:30:49,574 --> 00:30:51,744
There's someone who drinks every day.

683
00:30:51,744 --> 00:30:53,474
I'm not going to say who that is.

684
00:30:53,474 --> 00:30:55,314
(Laughing)

685
00:30:55,643 --> 00:30:57,554
I'm not going to say who that is.

686
00:30:57,554 --> 00:30:59,453
(Someone feels guilty.)

687
00:30:59,453 --> 00:31:01,353
If you sum up for a year...

688
00:31:02,024 --> 00:31:04,054
He drinks 370 days a year.

689
00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:07,764
He said 370 days a year.

690
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:11,234
Should I bring some hot coffee?

691
00:31:11,234 --> 00:31:12,234
Coffee sounds good.

692
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:14,804
I brought gifts for you.

693
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:15,804
- Really?
- For real?

694
00:31:15,804 --> 00:31:19,103
If you brought that up earlier, we could've treated you nicer.

695
00:31:19,903 --> 00:31:21,044
I meant to,

696
00:31:21,044 --> 00:31:23,603
- but I was very into the food.
- Hee Won, have a seat.

697
00:31:23,603 --> 00:31:24,814
Let's sit after cleaning up the table.

698
00:31:24,814 --> 00:31:27,173
The table needs to be clean when opening up gifts.

699
00:31:27,784 --> 00:31:29,984
- What's wrong?
- Her bag is small.

700
00:31:31,653 --> 00:31:34,084
It's at least heavy.

701
00:31:34,084 --> 00:31:35,784
- Is it heavy?
- Yes, it's heavy.

702
00:31:35,784 --> 00:31:37,524
Gold bars are good for gifts.

703
00:31:37,524 --> 00:31:39,693
(Gold bars are good gifts.)

704
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:40,794
Gold bars.

705
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:45,193
(Dong Il is funny.)

706
00:31:45,593 --> 00:31:46,893
I'm excited.

707
00:31:47,264 --> 00:31:50,264
I've wrapped them up, so you need to unwrap them.

708
00:31:51,574 --> 00:31:53,873
The wrapping is unique.

709
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:55,373
What's that?

710
00:31:55,574 --> 00:31:58,044
- It's something pretty.
- My gosh.

711
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:00,214
It's something you can use...

712
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:01,843
- when you drink coffee.
- Is it?

713
00:32:01,843 --> 00:32:03,284
- I made...
- Okay.

714
00:32:03,284 --> 00:32:05,683
these trays and a coffee dripper.

715
00:32:05,784 --> 00:32:07,383
If you take a look,

716
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:10,153
(Something is on the tray.)

717
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,054
you can place your food on this.

718
00:32:14,054 --> 00:32:15,163
Did you apply coating on this?

719
00:32:15,163 --> 00:32:17,663
- It's called resin art.
- I meant with resin.

720
00:32:17,663 --> 00:32:19,034
I made it with resin.

721
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:21,764
I know what resin is. It's used for cafe floors as well.

722
00:32:21,863 --> 00:32:24,203
(Resin art?)

723
00:32:25,603 --> 00:32:28,603
(Pour the liquid resin in a mold, )

724
00:32:28,804 --> 00:32:34,014
(draw something in different colors, )

725
00:32:34,314 --> 00:32:38,784
(and decorate with various objects.)

726
00:32:40,683 --> 00:32:45,724
(It's finished once it gets hardened.)

727
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:47,494
(Lovely housewarming gifts from You Jung, )

728
00:32:47,494 --> 00:32:49,964
- Did you really make this?
- It's what we needed.

729
00:32:49,964 --> 00:32:53,534
I drew a tree on a clear resin.

730
00:32:53,663 --> 00:32:55,834
I'll use this for plating today.

731
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,234
Unless it's very hot,

732
00:32:58,234 --> 00:33:00,403
- you can place any food.
- Because it's resin.

733
00:33:01,074 --> 00:33:03,044
I didn't know you were interested in resin art.

734
00:33:03,443 --> 00:33:05,843
- I like making things.
- I see that.

735
00:33:05,843 --> 00:33:08,044
This is very cool.

736
00:33:08,244 --> 00:33:10,883
- I like how neat this is.
- It could have Hee Won's face here.

737
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:13,683
What's the clear thing coated?

738
00:33:13,683 --> 00:33:15,024
- It's resin.
- Resin?

739
00:33:15,024 --> 00:33:16,784
It's neat.

740
00:33:17,284 --> 00:33:19,024
- It's good to make a design.
- The design.

741
00:33:19,024 --> 00:33:22,464
- I see the design here. Right.
- It's a shape of a tree.

742
00:33:22,824 --> 00:33:25,294
Dong Il, it must be good for hygiene as well.

743
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,294
It's neat.

744
00:33:26,294 --> 00:33:29,433
When you place food on it,

745
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:31,234
the food gets absorbed in the wood.

746
00:33:31,234 --> 00:33:33,674
- But, this prevents it.
- That's why she did it.

747
00:33:33,674 --> 00:33:35,444
- We already talked about it.
- I know.

748
00:33:36,844 --> 00:33:38,643
(Okay.)

749
00:33:38,944 --> 00:33:39,944
What's the matter?

750
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:43,013
You said that's why.

751
00:33:43,013 --> 00:33:44,183
Yes, I did.

752
00:33:44,183 --> 00:33:45,654
(I was just repeating.)

753
00:33:45,853 --> 00:33:47,384
- Whose is this?
- That one?

754
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:49,754
People use resin a lot these days.

755
00:33:49,754 --> 00:33:50,953
My goodness. Look at this.

756
00:33:50,953 --> 00:33:53,553
(This resin is very pretty.)

757
00:33:54,024 --> 00:33:55,524
I bought that one.

758
00:33:55,723 --> 00:33:58,064
(This is not resin.)

759
00:33:58,433 --> 00:33:59,634
Do you place this here?

760
00:33:59,634 --> 00:34:01,933
I did this part there.

761
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:03,834
- Did you make this resin?
- Yes, I did.

762
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,873
They look like coffee beans.

763
00:34:05,873 --> 00:34:07,774
- You drew it.
- I did.

764
00:34:07,774 --> 00:34:11,114
- I put a piece of glass here.
- It's glass.

765
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:13,044
- I'll make coffee with this.
- Let's use it.

766
00:34:13,044 --> 00:34:15,314
- We can make coffee with that.
- I'll do that.

767
00:34:15,314 --> 00:34:16,783
You can just drip it here.

768
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,384
You must like to make things.

769
00:34:19,513 --> 00:34:22,953
I started out with painting as a hobby.

770
00:34:22,953 --> 00:34:23,984
I see.

771
00:34:24,694 --> 00:34:28,223
(Si Wan is in the house.)

772
00:34:29,223 --> 00:34:32,493
(I'll make coffee with the gift from You Jung.)

773
00:34:32,493 --> 00:34:34,964
- Can I help you?
- No. I'm okay.

774
00:34:34,964 --> 00:34:36,864
Don't we need to do the dishes?

775
00:34:36,864 --> 00:34:39,134
The dishes? We can just leave it there for now.

776
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:40,174
Are you sure?

777
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,203
I'm going to wash the mop.

778
00:34:42,203 --> 00:34:43,703
You've got a turntable here.

779
00:34:44,203 --> 00:34:46,214
- Can I play it?
- Of course you can.

780
00:34:46,214 --> 00:34:47,884
You have "A Star Is Born".

781
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:50,114
- Do you like it? It's my favorite.
- I do.

782
00:34:50,114 --> 00:34:51,413
I like it very much.

783
00:34:51,413 --> 00:34:53,513
I have this album at home.

784
00:34:53,654 --> 00:34:54,683
Do you have that LP?

785
00:34:54,683 --> 00:34:57,993
Yes. I collect LPs as a hobby.

786
00:34:57,993 --> 00:34:59,053
For real?

787
00:35:00,194 --> 00:35:02,763
- I have a lot at home, this much.
- Really?

788
00:35:03,323 --> 00:35:04,433
You've got a lot of hobbies.

789
00:35:05,234 --> 00:35:07,493
I make everything into my hobby.

790
00:35:07,493 --> 00:35:10,004
I can see that. You have so many hobbies too.

791
00:35:11,603 --> 00:35:13,933
(Shall we listen to the music?)

792
00:35:15,143 --> 00:35:18,243
(This is it.)

793
00:35:18,573 --> 00:35:23,314
(Sharing You Jung's hobby in the pine tree woods.)

794
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:24,453
It's here.

795
00:35:29,783 --> 00:35:31,723
(The soft wind, )

796
00:35:31,723 --> 00:35:34,564
(the smell from the woods in front of the house, )

797
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:41,634
(and the cool water sound from the valley)

798
00:35:41,634 --> 00:35:44,774
(Let's pay attention to those.)

799
00:35:45,973 --> 00:35:49,073
(Happy)

800
00:35:50,743 --> 00:35:53,674
He brought something. Is it a pine cone?

801
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:57,044
Have you picked out pine nuts while traveling here?

802
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:02,553
If you look at the bottom, there are pine nuts.

803
00:36:02,853 --> 00:36:04,823
- Like this, from the bottom.
- That's cool.

804
00:36:04,823 --> 00:36:07,663
It's hard to peel.

805
00:36:07,663 --> 00:36:10,064
(I'll peel and show you.)

806
00:36:10,893 --> 00:36:13,094
Once you peel, you can see the pine nuts.

807
00:36:13,094 --> 00:36:14,263
- Goodness.
- I see.

808
00:36:14,263 --> 00:36:17,033
- This is... It does look like it.
- It looks like a sunflower seed.

809
00:36:18,834 --> 00:36:22,473
Do pine cones also have something inside?

810
00:36:22,473 --> 00:36:25,674
Pine trees have that powder.

811
00:36:26,174 --> 00:36:29,044
- You mean pine resin powder?
- No, not pine resin.

812
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:32,984
It's used for medicines as well. And, it's good for a hangover.

813
00:36:33,783 --> 00:36:34,853
It's pine resin powder.

814
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:38,823
You Jung said pine resin powder.

815
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:39,893
Did she?

816
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:42,064
You said that it's not.

817
00:36:42,064 --> 00:36:43,763
Pine resin powder is very expensive.

818
00:36:43,763 --> 00:36:45,163
Say you're sorry no matter what.

819
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,533
- I'm sorry.
- How dare you.

820
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:52,033
Have you gone fishing before?

821
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:55,143
I've done a lot of sea fishing.

822
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:57,444
You've done sea fishing as well? Even a lot of times?

823
00:36:57,444 --> 00:37:00,044
I was into fishing.

824
00:37:00,044 --> 00:37:02,044
She even knows the captain.

825
00:37:02,314 --> 00:37:04,584
- She talks on the phone with him.
- Where do you go fishing?

826
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:06,183
- Do you fish in Namhae?
- I go to Yeosu.

827
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:07,754
- Yeosu in Jeolla Province.
- Yes.

828
00:37:09,283 --> 00:37:12,594
She is different from how she looks.

829
00:37:13,223 --> 00:37:16,993
Let's go fishing after having coffee.

830
00:37:16,993 --> 00:37:18,033
How about trout fishing?

831
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:20,033
I've never done trout fishing.

832
00:37:20,033 --> 00:37:21,734
- Trout is not for sea fishing.
- Right.

833
00:37:21,964 --> 00:37:22,964
Trout fishing.

834
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:27,134
Are you okay with fishing?

835
00:37:29,774 --> 00:37:33,674
I didn't catch any on purpose back then...

836
00:37:33,674 --> 00:37:35,513
to make you feel good.

837
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:37,683
There were bites.

838
00:37:37,683 --> 00:37:41,123
I tapped twice each to the right and left.

839
00:37:41,254 --> 00:37:42,953
Then, the fish get unhooked.

840
00:37:42,953 --> 00:37:44,893
I released them on purpose.

841
00:37:45,353 --> 00:37:47,393
You were just happy, not knowing it.

842
00:37:47,594 --> 00:37:51,234
I just felt bad for you that you didn't catch any.

843
00:37:51,794 --> 00:37:55,163
(Offshore of Geoje Island in last summer)

844
00:37:55,603 --> 00:37:57,464
(They are getting a fishing lesson.)

845
00:37:57,703 --> 00:38:00,504
(These beginners need the training.)

846
00:38:02,303 --> 00:38:06,674
(Everyone else is catching fish.)

847
00:38:07,073 --> 00:38:09,243
(Dong Il is envious.)

848
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:12,714
(Hee Won also continues to catch fish.)

849
00:38:12,714 --> 00:38:14,314
(Gosh, I caught it again.)

850
00:38:14,654 --> 00:38:17,553
(He even caught two fish at once.)

851
00:38:18,024 --> 00:38:19,154
(How does that happen?)

852
00:38:19,594 --> 00:38:20,594
(I'm so good.)

853
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:22,763
(Put some smiles on your face.)

854
00:38:23,223 --> 00:38:26,064
(I keep on catching. It's no longer to be happy about.)

855
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:29,433
(I'm not even catching a single one.)

856
00:38:29,634 --> 00:38:31,603
(Humming)

857
00:38:32,573 --> 00:38:35,404
(I'm the happiest person in the world today.)

858
00:38:36,473 --> 00:38:39,174
(Would Dong Il be able to make up for the last fishing?)

859
00:38:40,413 --> 00:38:43,913
(The coffee bean grinding sound is...)

860
00:38:43,913 --> 00:38:47,853
(echoing in the pine tree woods.)

861
00:38:48,623 --> 00:38:51,323
(The coffee dripper from You Jung)

862
00:38:52,794 --> 00:38:55,493
(Si Wan's effort and the mood from the pine tree woods are...)

863
00:38:55,493 --> 00:38:57,393
(added in the taste.)

864
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:03,834
What do you think of when you travel alone in places like this?

865
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:07,433
I think I travel...

866
00:39:08,044 --> 00:39:12,143
when I want to stop thinking of things.

867
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:13,913
- When you don't want to think.
- Yes.

868
00:39:14,783 --> 00:39:17,913
- I smell and listen to nature.
- I see.

869
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:21,884
If I travel with someone else,

870
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:23,984
- You can't be yourself.
- I kind of have to do the favor.

871
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:24,993
I know.

872
00:39:25,524 --> 00:39:28,623
I wanted to have fun by myself.

873
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:31,294
That's why I traveled alone a lot...

874
00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:33,493
and tried many different things.

875
00:39:33,864 --> 00:39:35,864
Right. That's important.

876
00:39:38,734 --> 00:39:40,103
(Good.)

877
00:39:40,103 --> 00:39:41,544
This horse bean tea is good.

878
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:45,714
This strengthens your immunity. I just looked it up online.

879
00:39:46,614 --> 00:39:48,743
When I have shootings in other states,

880
00:39:48,743 --> 00:39:50,884
I share the hotel room with him.

881
00:39:50,884 --> 00:39:52,853
He's sick all over his body,

882
00:39:53,384 --> 00:39:55,183
even all the joints.

883
00:39:56,453 --> 00:39:58,024
I pretend, so he doesn't make me run errands.

884
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:01,663
(It's absurd.)

885
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,024
As soon as we get there,

886
00:40:03,663 --> 00:40:06,964
I act like this.

887
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:08,303
That's my tactic.

888
00:40:12,103 --> 00:40:14,643
(Si Wan learns fast.)

889
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:17,303
Dong Il, I will make some coffee for you.

890
00:40:17,643 --> 00:40:19,614
Si Wan, don't overwork.

891
00:40:19,614 --> 00:40:21,044
(Coughing)

892
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,814
Last time, someone broke his back...

893
00:40:23,814 --> 00:40:25,314
while carrying a coffee pot.

894
00:40:26,453 --> 00:40:27,654
Sit.

895
00:40:28,084 --> 00:40:29,223
Stay in your seat.

896
00:40:29,924 --> 00:40:32,194
(Good job, Si Wan.)

897
00:40:32,194 --> 00:40:33,323
Stay in your seat.

898
00:40:33,524 --> 00:40:34,823
Forgive me that I'm too slow.

899
00:40:34,964 --> 00:40:36,094
Oh, my...

900
00:40:36,094 --> 00:40:38,234
(Si Wan's acting talent is on.)

901
00:40:38,364 --> 00:40:40,364
I tried to do it faster.

902
00:40:41,504 --> 00:40:44,263
- Forgive me.
- A patient made the coffee.

903
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:47,303
(I can't lift my arms, so feed me.)

904
00:40:47,504 --> 00:40:49,143
I can't lift my arms, so feed me.

905
00:40:49,143 --> 00:40:50,774
(Laughing)

906
00:40:50,774 --> 00:40:52,513
I can't lift them. Help me.

907
00:40:52,844 --> 00:40:54,044
You may just die...

908
00:40:56,183 --> 00:40:57,344
if you can't lift your arms.

909
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,614
(You Jung is laughing out loud.)

910
00:40:59,513 --> 00:41:02,524
(I can never win over them.)

911
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,654
- You said I should die?
- My apologies, Dong Il.

912
00:41:04,654 --> 00:41:06,024
Do you want me dead?

913
00:41:06,024 --> 00:41:07,123
I'm sorry.

914
00:41:09,364 --> 00:41:10,623
What time is it now?

915
00:41:11,663 --> 00:41:14,493
I don't think we can catch fish now.

916
00:41:14,493 --> 00:41:15,533
(An expert in fishing)

917
00:41:15,533 --> 00:41:18,674
- Where is it?
- They don't show up under the sun.

918
00:41:18,674 --> 00:41:19,703
Is that so?

919
00:41:19,703 --> 00:41:21,674
The fish also take naps.

920
00:41:22,603 --> 00:41:24,814
(I see.)

921
00:41:24,814 --> 00:41:26,174
You're an expert in fishing.

922
00:41:26,674 --> 00:41:27,844
How many can you catch?

923
00:41:27,844 --> 00:41:29,084
(If you're an expert.)

924
00:41:29,084 --> 00:41:30,913
I'd be thankful even for one.

925
00:41:31,553 --> 00:41:32,584
Just one?

926
00:41:32,913 --> 00:41:34,254
Look at his face.

927
00:41:34,254 --> 00:41:36,223
- Just one?
- Why are you angry?

928
00:41:36,223 --> 00:41:38,493
Stop it, you little kid.

929
00:41:38,654 --> 00:41:41,464
I catch two at once.

930
00:41:42,564 --> 00:41:43,594
Goodness.

931
00:41:43,594 --> 00:41:46,464
Should we go fishing for an hour?

932
00:41:46,464 --> 00:41:47,533
Okay.

933
00:41:47,634 --> 00:41:49,504
Are we able to catch in an hour?

934
00:41:49,763 --> 00:41:52,734
You said you get two at once.

935
00:41:52,734 --> 00:41:54,473
Can't you catch two?

936
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:55,674
Catch 2 every 5 minutes.

937
00:41:55,674 --> 00:41:57,073
I can.

938
00:41:57,203 --> 00:41:58,844
I just worried about you.

939
00:41:59,544 --> 00:42:01,444
(You Jung is excited about Hee Won's fishing.)

940
00:42:01,444 --> 00:42:03,513
- Let's go.
- Okay.

941
00:42:03,513 --> 00:42:04,614
Let's go.

942
00:42:05,384 --> 00:42:06,884
Isn't the weather nice today?

943
00:42:06,884 --> 00:42:08,183
(On the way to trout fishing near the house)

944
00:42:08,953 --> 00:42:10,783
You Jung seems to laugh a lot.

945
00:42:13,953 --> 00:42:16,493
(A smiling angel)

946
00:42:16,763 --> 00:42:18,763
There's a saying that you should laugh less as you get old.

947
00:42:18,964 --> 00:42:20,194
Why is that?

948
00:42:20,564 --> 00:42:22,004
Why laugh less?

949
00:42:22,504 --> 00:42:24,033
She can only laugh when she's with me.

950
00:42:24,033 --> 00:42:25,533
(Laugh only with me.)

951
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:27,634
That's why I'm laughing less.

952
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:28,703
(I'm laughing less.)

953
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,573
She's laughing less because of you.

954
00:42:31,573 --> 00:42:32,643
(Hee Won is teasing.)

955
00:42:34,274 --> 00:42:35,844
You Jung needs to look at others as well.

956
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,114
No. She can look only at me.

957
00:42:39,183 --> 00:42:41,183
She's no longer laughing because she's only looking at you.

958
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:44,154
(While laughing and having fun, )

959
00:42:44,154 --> 00:42:46,094
(they arrive at the reservoir fishery shortly.)

960
00:42:46,094 --> 00:42:47,654
- Isn't it here?
- It is.

961
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,024
Since I catch fast,

962
00:42:51,123 --> 00:42:53,663
I'll get bored soon.

963
00:42:54,134 --> 00:42:57,864
Then, I'll rush and finish in 30 minutes.

964
00:42:57,864 --> 00:42:59,433
- Will you?
- I think 30 minutes will be enough.

965
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:01,803
You guys are very confident.

966
00:43:02,473 --> 00:43:04,103
(Laughing)

967
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:06,973
Hee Won's laughing sounds to mean something.

968
00:43:07,743 --> 00:43:08,944
(Everyone is eager to win.)

969
00:43:08,944 --> 00:43:10,084
He just laughs off.

970
00:43:11,783 --> 00:43:14,553
I think You Jung will do very well.

971
00:43:14,984 --> 00:43:16,754
I'm okay with catching none.

972
00:43:18,094 --> 00:43:21,564
I know you have the desire to win.

973
00:43:21,564 --> 00:43:25,864
You can't hide that from me. I know you're eager to win.

974
00:43:26,163 --> 00:43:27,993
It would be good if I can catch one.

975
00:43:27,993 --> 00:43:30,734
You now want to win.

976
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:33,933
I hope we all catch some.

977
00:43:36,504 --> 00:43:40,674
(Who'd be today's Fishing King?)

978
00:43:41,143 --> 00:43:44,853
(It's perfect weather to compete.)

979
00:43:46,053 --> 00:43:48,323
Let's go. You Jung, I hope we catch one each.

980
00:43:48,353 --> 00:43:49,553
Can we make it?

981
00:43:49,683 --> 00:43:50,884
You Jung, my little daughter.

982
00:43:50,884 --> 00:43:52,553
Let's play a fishing contest with me today.

983
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:58,993
(The whole trout fishing area was rented to us for the filming.)

984
00:43:59,194 --> 00:44:00,334
Let's go.

985
00:44:00,334 --> 00:44:01,763
(Entering the fishery with high hopes)

986
00:44:02,103 --> 00:44:04,634
My desire to win is rising.

987
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:07,573
- There are a lot of fish.
- Look here!

988
00:44:07,803 --> 00:44:10,174
- We can just see them.
- There are so many.

989
00:44:10,274 --> 00:44:12,044
They're just right there.

990
00:44:12,044 --> 00:44:13,073
(This place is half water and half fish.)

991
00:44:13,073 --> 00:44:15,584
We'll catch them as soon as we start.

992
00:44:15,584 --> 00:44:16,584
I think so too.

993
00:44:16,584 --> 00:44:18,913
Seriously, there are too many here.

994
00:44:19,154 --> 00:44:22,623
I think we can catch them easily.

995
00:44:23,084 --> 00:44:25,154
Hee Won, isn't it just too many?

996
00:44:25,154 --> 00:44:26,154
(A freshwater fishery with full of trouts)

997
00:44:26,893 --> 00:44:27,893
Pass me the scoop net.

998
00:44:27,924 --> 00:44:29,723
Dong Il is asking for a scoop net.

999
00:44:29,723 --> 00:44:30,763
(Even a scoop net would work.)

1000
00:44:30,763 --> 00:44:32,634
You Jung, so many fish are here.

1001
00:44:33,294 --> 00:44:35,634
There's no way we fail to catch.

1002
00:44:35,734 --> 00:44:37,603
Don't you use baits for trouts?

1003
00:44:37,703 --> 00:44:39,134
Do you use fake ones?

1004
00:44:39,433 --> 00:44:41,603
Trout fishing is with fake ones, called lure.

1005
00:44:41,603 --> 00:44:43,243
- It's with fake ones.
- Yes.

1006
00:44:43,743 --> 00:44:46,344
(Lure fishing is a kind of fishing...)

1007
00:44:46,344 --> 00:44:49,084
(using fake baits, called lure.)

1008
00:44:49,084 --> 00:44:52,984
(Fishers move the lures to make them look alive...)

1009
00:44:52,984 --> 00:44:57,424
(and attract the fish to catch them.)

1010
00:44:57,723 --> 00:45:00,393
(The fish is curious.)

1011
00:45:00,393 --> 00:45:03,993
(It's also curious.)

1012
00:45:04,594 --> 00:45:05,933
All the tools are here.

1013
00:45:06,234 --> 00:45:07,334
- But, it's...
- Are there all?

1014
00:45:07,334 --> 00:45:09,933
- The gloves and everything.
- Okay.

1015
00:45:09,933 --> 00:45:11,803
- Are there lures?
- Yes, lures are here.

1016
00:45:12,674 --> 00:45:13,834
(Ouch)

1017
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:14,904
Be careful.

1018
00:45:14,904 --> 00:45:18,643
Cover it with this, so you don't get poked.

1019
00:45:18,814 --> 00:45:20,174
Put it right here.

1020
00:45:20,174 --> 00:45:21,174
(You Jung is good.)

1021
00:45:21,174 --> 00:45:22,743
You hang it here.

1022
00:45:23,044 --> 00:45:24,314
Don't you need this?

1023
00:45:24,314 --> 00:45:25,984
(Si Wan's fishing rod is here.)

1024
00:45:26,214 --> 00:45:27,283
Should I get your lure on?

1025
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,353
Do you know how to do it?

1026
00:45:30,183 --> 00:45:32,493
- You just hook this...
- Yes.

1027
00:45:32,493 --> 00:45:34,924
- on your needle.
- Just that?

1028
00:45:36,663 --> 00:45:38,734
When you wind up your line, it hangs there.

1029
00:45:38,734 --> 00:45:39,763
(While the three are getting ready, )

1030
00:45:39,864 --> 00:45:42,533
(Dong Il started his casting alone.)

1031
00:45:42,663 --> 00:45:46,274
(His desire to win is right on.)

1032
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:47,734
How do I throw this?

1033
00:45:47,734 --> 00:45:50,344
You pull it back like this first.

1034
00:45:51,774 --> 00:45:53,573
Do I throw this after pulling back like this?

1035
00:45:53,973 --> 00:45:55,143
Yes. After you roll down.

1036
00:45:55,243 --> 00:45:57,183
(Swish)

1037
00:45:57,643 --> 00:46:00,013
(You Jung is casting in a very stable posture.)

1038
00:46:00,384 --> 00:46:02,183
(Fly over!)

1039
00:46:04,254 --> 00:46:05,294
(Plop)

1040
00:46:05,294 --> 00:46:06,353
I did it.

1041
00:46:07,024 --> 00:46:09,594
(Si Wan tries his first casting.)

1042
00:46:10,524 --> 00:46:12,964
(Lightly rolling)

1043
00:46:13,533 --> 00:46:15,564
- I wish I could catch one.
- Right.

1044
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,763
(He's moving his lure.)

1045
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:18,303
(His eyes are on the lure.)

1046
00:46:18,303 --> 00:46:19,303
That's good.

1047
00:46:20,703 --> 00:46:22,103
Let's count an hour from now.

1048
00:46:22,103 --> 00:46:23,444
An hour sounds good. Let's go.

1049
00:46:23,674 --> 00:46:27,013
(A trout fishing battle has started.)

1050
00:46:27,774 --> 00:46:32,084
(A school of trouts is right in front of the eyes.)

1051
00:46:32,513 --> 00:46:36,654
(Bite mine.)

1052
00:46:37,183 --> 00:46:40,924
(You Jung is focused without words.)

1053
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:44,564
(Luring)

1054
00:46:44,663 --> 00:46:48,703
(How many fish would I catch today?)

1055
00:46:48,904 --> 00:46:52,834
(The desires are on.)

1056
00:46:53,803 --> 00:46:55,103
It's not biting.

1057
00:46:56,103 --> 00:46:58,714
The fish are passing right by without even looking at the lure.

1058
00:46:58,913 --> 00:47:00,444
- Mine too.
- Right?

1059
00:47:00,973 --> 00:47:02,484
They must know it's fake.

1060
00:47:03,214 --> 00:47:04,384
They are smart.

1061
00:47:05,513 --> 00:47:07,513
One came along then just left.

1062
00:47:07,513 --> 00:47:09,323
They just look then leave.

1063
00:47:09,453 --> 00:47:10,783
They just figure it's not it then leave.

1064
00:47:11,794 --> 00:47:13,323
- Saying, "It's fake." - Right.

1065
00:47:13,493 --> 00:47:15,594
They're good at distinguishing.

1066
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:17,123
(That's fake.)

1067
00:47:18,123 --> 00:47:19,594
A lot of fish means nothing.

1068
00:47:20,464 --> 00:47:21,703
They're not interested.

1069
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:25,703
I got a bite.

1070
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:28,473
(You got a bite?)

1071
00:47:29,904 --> 00:47:31,073
It came.

1072
00:47:33,743 --> 00:47:35,314
(Peekaboo)

1073
00:47:36,044 --> 00:47:37,114
(Jumping)

1074
00:47:37,114 --> 00:47:38,283
Look at that.

1075
00:47:38,853 --> 00:47:42,024
(Trouts are jumping out of the water.)

1076
00:47:43,053 --> 00:47:44,323
Come on.

1077
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:46,823
They're fooling us.

1078
00:47:47,294 --> 00:47:49,094
Aren't they getting paid...

1079
00:47:49,564 --> 00:47:51,163
from the Fish Union?

1080
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:52,893
They must get paid more.

1081
00:47:53,334 --> 00:47:54,334
Okay.

1082
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:57,603
It feels different as I'm looking at the fish.

1083
00:47:57,603 --> 00:47:59,103
It actually feels worse.

1084
00:47:59,303 --> 00:48:02,573
- Don't you feel more annoyed?
- Yes. My desire gets higher.

1085
00:48:02,573 --> 00:48:04,344
If we don't see any,

1086
00:48:04,643 --> 00:48:07,114
we can just think it's because there are not many fish.

1087
00:48:07,913 --> 00:48:09,484
(Rolling)

1088
00:48:10,013 --> 00:48:11,283
(You Jung is in a perfect posture.)

1089
00:48:11,283 --> 00:48:12,884
You Jung, you're good at throwing.

1090
00:48:13,114 --> 00:48:14,553
You're good.

1091
00:48:14,984 --> 00:48:16,053
Very gently.

1092
00:48:17,553 --> 00:48:19,723
(Throwing from the back)

1093
00:48:21,094 --> 00:48:23,263
(Throwing from the side)

1094
00:48:23,864 --> 00:48:26,933
(Carefully reeling)

1095
00:48:27,763 --> 00:48:30,933
(Such a fisher)

1096
00:48:31,163 --> 00:48:33,473
(So cool.)

1097
00:48:35,703 --> 00:48:37,243
Something is hooked.

1098
00:48:37,303 --> 00:48:38,473
For real?

1099
00:48:39,513 --> 00:48:41,274
(What's that?)

1100
00:48:47,413 --> 00:48:48,953
I caught at least something.

1101
00:48:49,924 --> 00:48:52,353
Look at this. I caught something.

1102
00:48:52,353 --> 00:48:53,393
(That's a big one.)

1103
00:48:53,393 --> 00:48:54,393
That's big.

1104
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:55,763
Isn't it quite big?

1105
00:48:55,763 --> 00:48:57,163
You Jung, what did you catch?

1106
00:48:57,163 --> 00:48:59,364
It's big and fresh.

1107
00:49:00,134 --> 00:49:01,964
(At least, you caught something.)

1108
00:49:01,964 --> 00:49:03,303
You got a big one.

1109
00:49:03,303 --> 00:49:04,564
You Jung, score one.

1110
00:49:04,564 --> 00:49:06,174
(One plant)

1111
00:49:06,373 --> 00:49:07,973
I saw a fish biting...

1112
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:12,444
the end of my lure and release it.

1113
00:49:12,944 --> 00:49:13,944
For real?

1114
00:49:13,944 --> 00:49:15,243
Yes. Isn't it shocking?

1115
00:49:16,384 --> 00:49:19,114
(A shocking reality)

1116
00:49:19,254 --> 00:49:22,084
The hook is in the middle of the lure,

1117
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,283
but the fish bit just the end then let it go.

1118
00:49:24,654 --> 00:49:26,654
Right. I shouldn't be using this.

1119
00:49:26,654 --> 00:49:28,024
I'll get something else.

1120
00:49:28,694 --> 00:49:31,594
- Do we have other baits?
- They're in the basket.

1121
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:32,763
It's right here.

1122
00:49:33,263 --> 00:49:34,964
- Dong Il.
- Yes?

1123
00:49:34,964 --> 00:49:38,634
How do I get the float on in the middle like yours?

1124
00:49:38,634 --> 00:49:42,004
(A float is needed to get the bait to the proper depth.)

1125
00:49:42,504 --> 00:49:45,674
- I don't know.
- How did you get that thing there?

1126
00:49:46,174 --> 00:49:48,274
We should be using that as well.

1127
00:49:48,274 --> 00:49:50,913
- This doesn't work.
- It was here from the beginning.

1128
00:49:50,913 --> 00:49:52,984
- Yours is different from ours.
- You cheated.

1129
00:49:52,984 --> 00:49:54,283
That's not true.

1130
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,283
(You still don't tell us.)

1131
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,584
It's here.

1132
00:49:56,584 --> 00:49:58,623
I think he got this one.

1133
00:49:59,323 --> 00:50:01,453
That looks like it.

1134
00:50:01,993 --> 00:50:05,933
He's cheating since he didn't catch any last time.

1135
00:50:06,094 --> 00:50:08,364
I can't fish because it's too noisy.

1136
00:50:09,064 --> 00:50:12,303
(I got a float this time.)

1137
00:50:12,703 --> 00:50:15,544
(Neither of them is backing out...)

1138
00:50:15,544 --> 00:50:18,344
(from this fierce fishing competition.)

1139
00:50:19,174 --> 00:50:22,714
(The first bite is mine.)

1140
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:25,283
(Keeping others in check)

1141
00:50:25,984 --> 00:50:28,384
(This won't do.)

1142
00:50:28,524 --> 00:50:30,024
- I'm not getting...
- Here?

1143
00:50:30,024 --> 00:50:32,694
any bite there. Can I try here?

1144
00:50:32,754 --> 00:50:34,094
This is the place!

1145
00:50:34,254 --> 00:50:36,263
I'll definitely catch one!

1146
00:50:36,694 --> 00:50:38,364
(Here you go!)

1147
00:50:39,734 --> 00:50:42,433
(Intense concentration)

1148
00:50:43,364 --> 00:50:48,073
(Who will get the first bite?)

1149
00:50:48,973 --> 00:50:53,214
(You Jung chants a spell to call the fish.)

1150
00:50:53,944 --> 00:50:55,243
Follow me!

1151
00:50:56,544 --> 00:50:58,013
(Follow me!)

1152
00:50:58,714 --> 00:51:01,384
("Follow Me", composed and lyrics written by Kim You Jung)

1153
00:51:01,384 --> 00:51:03,524
(Fish, fish)

1154
00:51:03,754 --> 00:51:05,823
(Follow me)

1155
00:51:06,094 --> 00:51:07,794
(Fish)

1156
00:51:07,794 --> 00:51:09,094
(Hey!)

1157
00:51:09,663 --> 00:51:11,493
(After listening to You Jung's fish spell, )

1158
00:51:11,493 --> 00:51:12,834
(his fishing rod reacts to it!)

1159
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:15,603
My gosh, Dong Il. This...

1160
00:51:16,763 --> 00:51:19,533
- He caught it! He caught it!
- Amazing!

1161
00:51:20,634 --> 00:51:21,734
Hee Won!

1162
00:51:21,734 --> 00:51:24,274
(Will I succeed once again?)

1163
00:51:24,703 --> 00:51:27,873
(Taut)

1164
00:51:28,413 --> 00:51:31,044
(The fishing rod is bent so much.)

1165
00:51:32,453 --> 00:51:36,584
(The honor of the first catch goes to Hee Won.)

1166
00:51:37,183 --> 00:51:40,723
(Fisher You Jung quickly runs to get the landing net.)

1167
00:51:42,524 --> 00:51:45,263
(Rushing)

1168
00:51:45,263 --> 00:51:48,564
He's blessed with fishing.

1169
00:51:48,904 --> 00:51:51,004
(Proud)

1170
00:51:51,464 --> 00:51:54,404
(She brings up the first fish in a cool pose.)

1171
00:51:54,973 --> 00:51:55,973
(Big catch)

1172
00:51:55,973 --> 00:51:57,243
- My goodness!
- This is so big!

1173
00:51:57,844 --> 00:51:59,913
- What should I do now?
- You need to unhook it.

1174
00:51:59,913 --> 00:52:00,944
Like this.

1175
00:52:00,944 --> 00:52:02,814
(He slowly approaches to show off.)

1176
00:52:03,143 --> 00:52:04,783
(Sighing)

1177
00:52:05,314 --> 00:52:06,683
Ouch, my waist!

1178
00:52:06,683 --> 00:52:07,783
(Making it super obvious)

1179
00:52:07,783 --> 00:52:10,053
Look at this, it's so fresh!

1180
00:52:10,984 --> 00:52:13,194
This is exactly what I was worried about.

1181
00:52:14,154 --> 00:52:16,964
This is what I was worried about with him.

1182
00:52:16,964 --> 00:52:18,064
(The scene Dong Il was worried about)

1183
00:52:18,364 --> 00:52:20,263
Has it not been one hour yet?

1184
00:52:21,634 --> 00:52:23,904
This is what I was worried about!

1185
00:52:24,203 --> 00:52:25,373
It had to come true.

1186
00:52:26,334 --> 00:52:29,603
(Elderly vibe)

1187
00:52:29,803 --> 00:52:31,404
What should I do now?

1188
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,844
You Jung, can you remove it?

1189
00:52:34,544 --> 00:52:35,984
I should just do it.

1190
00:52:37,143 --> 00:52:38,614
(You Jung is even good at removing the hook.)

1191
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,183
- I removed it!
- It's done!

1192
00:52:40,183 --> 00:52:42,183
- Should I show them?
- Yes, show them.

1193
00:52:42,823 --> 00:52:45,794
(You can see that he's relaxed from the way he walks.)

1194
00:52:46,094 --> 00:52:48,794
- This is what Hee Won caught.
- Let me see.

1195
00:52:50,223 --> 00:52:53,364
It's small! My gosh.

1196
00:52:53,464 --> 00:52:56,064
Roughly about 30cm.

1197
00:52:56,864 --> 00:53:00,774
Isn't Hee Won's bait different?

1198
00:53:01,073 --> 00:53:02,103
Me?

1199
00:53:02,473 --> 00:53:04,404
You're using different bait.

1200
00:53:04,404 --> 00:53:05,844
I'm not.

1201
00:53:05,844 --> 00:53:08,143
I saw you change your bait just now!

1202
00:53:08,844 --> 00:53:11,743
No, it's the same. Look.

1203
00:53:11,844 --> 00:53:13,714
- Mine wasn't this.
- Exactly!

1204
00:53:13,714 --> 00:53:14,953
You're right, mine's different.

1205
00:53:15,384 --> 00:53:18,924
It was somewhere here. Where is it? It was in a container.

1206
00:53:20,223 --> 00:53:22,763
(Searching)

1207
00:53:23,024 --> 00:53:25,433
You Jung, this is the one.

1208
00:53:26,033 --> 00:53:28,834
- I see.
- Remove the one you're using now.

1209
00:53:29,303 --> 00:53:31,404
(Taking a glance)

1210
00:53:31,904 --> 00:53:34,203
- Put it on like this?
- Yes.

1211
00:53:34,203 --> 00:53:36,303
(She changes her bait to the one that can catch the fish well.)

1212
00:53:36,303 --> 00:53:38,143
- This...
- Do I just put one?

1213
00:53:38,143 --> 00:53:39,513
- Pardon?
- What is this?

1214
00:53:39,513 --> 00:53:42,384
- If it's this big, remove this.
- Yes.

1215
00:53:42,743 --> 00:53:44,714
I just used one.

1216
00:53:44,714 --> 00:53:45,953
I think it'll come off.

1217
00:53:46,154 --> 00:53:47,814
Try fishing with that bait.

1218
00:53:48,984 --> 00:53:50,053
Thank you!

1219
00:53:52,794 --> 00:53:54,893
I think it's too big to trick them.

1220
00:53:55,223 --> 00:53:57,663
Dong Il! You should try with this too.

1221
00:53:57,663 --> 00:53:59,163
- Which one?
- This.

1222
00:54:00,064 --> 00:54:01,464
When I use this...

1223
00:54:01,634 --> 00:54:04,334
- This...
- Wrap it like that?

1224
00:54:05,064 --> 00:54:11,044
(But they should be catching one about now.)

1225
00:54:13,073 --> 00:54:14,373
I'm hungry.

1226
00:54:15,413 --> 00:54:17,143
You Jung, aren't you hungry?

1227
00:54:17,643 --> 00:54:20,553
(She's too focused on her fishing rod.)

1228
00:54:20,714 --> 00:54:24,223
You're getting competitive now, aren't you? My goodness.

1229
00:54:24,223 --> 00:54:26,794
- Because Hee Won caught one, - Yes.

1230
00:54:26,794 --> 00:54:28,893
I got my hopes up that I can catch one as well.

1231
00:54:28,893 --> 00:54:31,594
Are you saying that if I can catch one, you can catch one as well?

1232
00:54:31,594 --> 00:54:32,864
That's not what I mean.

1233
00:54:32,864 --> 00:54:35,933
It's the fact that someone actually caught the fish.

1234
00:54:37,763 --> 00:54:39,674
My gosh!

1235
00:54:39,674 --> 00:54:41,433
(But it's me again.)

1236
00:54:42,274 --> 00:54:43,703
Did you catch it again?

1237
00:54:44,473 --> 00:54:46,174
- Did you catch it again?
- What's this?

1238
00:54:46,473 --> 00:54:49,114
My gosh, it's so easy to catch them!

1239
00:54:49,114 --> 00:54:52,154
- Goodness.
- He caught another one? Amazing.

1240
00:54:52,154 --> 00:54:54,953
Help him scoop it up.

1241
00:54:55,823 --> 00:54:56,984
(Struggling)

1242
00:54:56,984 --> 00:54:58,553
Hee Won, you're amazing.

1243
00:54:58,553 --> 00:55:00,654
(Looks like a big fish)

1244
00:55:00,893 --> 00:55:03,694
(What's up with him?)

1245
00:55:04,263 --> 00:55:07,364
(This time, Si Wan brings the landing net.)

1246
00:55:07,964 --> 00:55:09,864
My gosh, why is this...

1247
00:55:10,263 --> 00:55:11,334
Here.

1248
00:55:11,334 --> 00:55:13,703
(The Fishing King's catch is shining.)

1249
00:55:13,973 --> 00:55:15,873
Dong Il, I caught one.

1250
00:55:15,904 --> 00:55:18,174
My gosh, this is amazing.

1251
00:55:18,174 --> 00:55:19,743
Good job!

1252
00:55:20,844 --> 00:55:22,743
You Jung, this is a bad spot.

1253
00:55:22,743 --> 00:55:25,044
- This is a bad spot.
- Right? I think that's a bad spot.

1254
00:55:25,044 --> 00:55:27,013
We should move up.

1255
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:30,084
Move up there. This is a bad spot.

1256
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:33,493
It's cheap and childish, but I should move to Hee Won's side.

1257
00:55:34,353 --> 00:55:36,094
(Glance)

1258
00:55:36,763 --> 00:55:40,094
Then I should go to Dong Il's place to fish.

1259
00:55:41,663 --> 00:55:44,734
Since he moved here saying it's a good spot.

1260
00:55:45,334 --> 00:55:47,573
(That's a bad spot, I'm telling you.)

1261
00:55:47,904 --> 00:55:50,973
(He puts down his fishing rod for a while...)

1262
00:55:51,674 --> 00:55:53,444
(and makes the bait again.)

1263
00:55:56,183 --> 00:55:58,444
(A bite is here.)

1264
00:55:58,444 --> 00:56:00,783
(Shaking intensely)

1265
00:56:01,513 --> 00:56:04,823
What is this? Why would you bite when there's no bait?

1266
00:56:05,084 --> 00:56:07,993
(This is the power of the person blessed with fishing.)

1267
00:56:08,623 --> 00:56:09,763
(Did you see that?)

1268
00:56:09,763 --> 00:56:11,723
My gosh, what's happening?

1269
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:16,734
(Bitter)

1270
00:56:17,433 --> 00:56:20,834
It came to bite when there wasn't even a bait then left.

1271
00:56:21,004 --> 00:56:22,134
(Amazing)

1272
00:56:22,134 --> 00:56:23,944
I'm not even trying to catch.

1273
00:56:24,044 --> 00:56:27,844
Hee Won's going to start nagging.

1274
00:56:28,814 --> 00:56:31,783
Dong Il should catch one.

1275
00:56:34,084 --> 00:56:36,024
- He got a bite!
- He did?

1276
00:56:36,024 --> 00:56:37,424
(It's me this time.)

1277
00:56:37,424 --> 00:56:39,493
- Si Wan got a bite!
- He did? Pull!

1278
00:56:39,493 --> 00:56:40,754
Pull it!

1279
00:56:40,754 --> 00:56:42,323
The fish keeps swimming away.

1280
00:56:42,323 --> 00:56:43,893
It keeps moving further.

1281
00:56:43,893 --> 00:56:45,864
Exactly. How far is it trying to go?

1282
00:56:46,964 --> 00:56:48,334
It's here!

1283
00:56:48,334 --> 00:56:50,303
Si Wan's looks big!

1284
00:56:51,064 --> 00:56:52,734
Hang in there till the end!

1285
00:56:53,303 --> 00:56:55,743
Hold on, hold on!

1286
00:56:55,743 --> 00:56:57,404
(Landing net fairy gets to work immediately.)

1287
00:56:59,174 --> 00:57:01,473
(She's ready.)

1288
00:57:01,944 --> 00:57:03,844
It's pulling so strongly.

1289
00:57:04,814 --> 00:57:06,283
(When he pulls back the line till it's near with much struggle, )

1290
00:57:06,283 --> 00:57:08,214
- Hang in there till the end!
- Okay.

1291
00:57:08,214 --> 00:57:10,553
(the energetic landing net fairy picks it up.)

1292
00:57:11,424 --> 00:57:13,094
- Here.
- I caught it!

1293
00:57:13,094 --> 00:57:14,924
- My gosh, it's so strong!
- Thank you.

1294
00:57:14,924 --> 00:57:17,464
Yes, it's really big. I caught one!

1295
00:57:17,464 --> 00:57:18,823
Goodness.

1296
00:57:18,823 --> 00:57:22,134
You guys are amazing. This is why I didn't want to come fishing.

1297
00:57:23,263 --> 00:57:26,134
Goodness, life...

1298
00:57:27,603 --> 00:57:31,643
(Life is unpredictable)

1299
00:57:34,344 --> 00:57:36,513
(Meanwhile, Hee Won tries from Dong Il's place.)

1300
00:57:36,683 --> 00:57:38,743
Did you say this is a bad spot?

1301
00:57:40,114 --> 00:57:42,924
(He quickly scans for his target.)

1302
00:57:43,283 --> 00:57:46,453
(Lure them with delicate reeling!)

1303
00:57:46,924 --> 00:57:48,723
(Dong Il, Si Wan, You Jung, )

1304
00:57:48,723 --> 00:57:51,623
(and the Fishing King)

1305
00:57:51,823 --> 00:57:55,234
(Overwhelming)

1306
00:57:57,334 --> 00:57:59,904
Dong Il, this is a bad spot.

1307
00:57:59,904 --> 00:58:02,743
This is such a bad spot, what to do?

1308
00:58:02,743 --> 00:58:04,774
You had it rough here.

1309
00:58:04,803 --> 00:58:07,114
(I caught one.)

1310
00:58:07,373 --> 00:58:09,344
(As expected from the Fishing King.)

1311
00:58:09,743 --> 00:58:11,513
(Ragging on him)

1312
00:58:12,214 --> 00:58:14,214
What's this? It fell!

1313
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:16,353
(As he was ragging on, the reel fell off.)

1314
00:58:16,353 --> 00:58:19,424
- Hey!
- The reel fell off, my gosh.

1315
00:58:19,424 --> 00:58:20,453
- Hey!
- What's that?

1316
00:58:20,754 --> 00:58:22,323
(Happy)

1317
00:58:22,893 --> 00:58:24,763
How in the world...

1318
00:58:24,964 --> 00:58:28,033
Fishing at a bad spot makes my reel fall off.

1319
00:58:28,033 --> 00:58:30,803
- What should I do now?
- How did the reel fall off?

1320
00:58:30,803 --> 00:58:33,473
What should I do...

1321
00:58:33,573 --> 00:58:34,933
when the reel falls off?

1322
00:58:34,933 --> 00:58:37,103
(Don't worry, I'm on my way.)

1323
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:40,444
Hold on. You caught one.

1324
00:58:40,513 --> 00:58:43,283
(He catches another one despite the bad situation.)

1325
00:58:43,344 --> 00:58:45,444
I'll stop now.

1326
00:58:45,853 --> 00:58:48,384
I caught one immediately from a bad spot.

1327
00:58:48,384 --> 00:58:49,524
Dong Il...

1328
00:58:50,453 --> 00:58:52,053
Dong Il, just now,

1329
00:58:52,993 --> 00:58:55,623
it took a bite even without bait.

1330
00:58:55,794 --> 00:58:58,223
And I caught one the moment I came here.

1331
00:58:59,263 --> 00:59:01,834
How did the reel drop?

1332
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:03,234
(Current score: Hee Won 3, Si Wan 1, You Jung 0, Dong Il 0)

1333
00:59:03,234 --> 00:59:05,004
Gosh, this is so funny.

1334
00:59:05,973 --> 00:59:08,303
Are You Jung and I the only ones who didn't catch one?

1335
00:59:08,834 --> 00:59:10,774
Only the father and the daughter?

1336
00:59:10,774 --> 00:59:12,203
(The father and the daughter didn't get any bite yet.)

1337
00:59:12,203 --> 00:59:14,143
My goodness.

1338
00:59:14,143 --> 00:59:17,114
How does Hee Won reel?

1339
00:59:17,643 --> 00:59:19,254
(The fisher king comes to help You Jung.)

1340
00:59:19,254 --> 00:59:20,654
Like this.

1341
00:59:20,913 --> 00:59:23,584
They only come to check mine out, but won't bite it.

1342
00:59:23,584 --> 00:59:25,123
Try pulling it up.

1343
00:59:25,123 --> 00:59:27,123
Bring it here. The height...

1344
00:59:27,924 --> 00:59:29,723
Put it up higher.

1345
00:59:29,723 --> 00:59:32,064
Making it shorter works pretty well.

1346
00:59:32,893 --> 00:59:34,763
Did you stay still after throwing in the bait?

1347
00:59:34,763 --> 00:59:37,364
Yes. After throwing it in,

1348
00:59:37,364 --> 00:59:39,473
- the line sags like this.
- Yes.

1349
00:59:39,473 --> 00:59:41,603
- The line floats up on the surface.
- Yes.

1350
00:59:41,603 --> 00:59:43,844
So leave some part in the water.

1351
00:59:43,844 --> 00:59:46,573
Then just reel in a bit. That's how I did it.

1352
00:59:46,573 --> 00:59:48,174
- Try it.
- Okay.

1353
00:59:49,214 --> 00:59:52,084
(She casts the fishing rod with all her might after getting his advice.)

1354
00:59:53,013 --> 00:59:56,024
(He changes his target.)

1355
00:59:56,584 --> 00:59:59,353
(Don't come here.)

1356
00:59:59,853 --> 01:00:02,053
(Starting his engine)

1357
01:00:02,254 --> 01:00:03,623
Sir!

1358
01:00:04,594 --> 01:00:06,594
Can you help me?

1359
01:00:07,334 --> 01:00:09,533
Which way is to the post office?

1360
01:00:09,533 --> 01:00:11,433
(Interesting)

1361
01:00:12,004 --> 01:00:13,404
This is my first time here as well.

1362
01:00:13,404 --> 01:00:16,004
I see. Did you catch a lot?

1363
01:00:16,274 --> 01:00:17,703
I just started.

1364
01:00:19,944 --> 01:00:21,774
Which way is to the post office?

1365
01:00:23,214 --> 01:00:25,584
Are you going to send the fish via courier service?

1366
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:28,783
Yes. I caught too many, so I'm thinking of using a courier service.

1367
01:00:28,783 --> 01:00:32,493
(This skit is so funny.)

1368
01:00:33,754 --> 01:00:36,564
Gosh, this is exactly why I didn't want to come.

1369
01:00:37,823 --> 01:00:40,694
I should go to the post office to courier my fish.

1370
01:00:42,603 --> 01:00:44,964
(Darn it)

1371
01:00:46,573 --> 01:00:49,674
(You Jung focuses without blinking in the middle of this ruckus.)

1372
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:52,573
You said we'll be here just for an hour.

1373
01:00:52,844 --> 01:00:54,714
- You can't do that with fishing.
- That's right.

1374
01:00:54,714 --> 01:00:56,444
- Fishing...
- Once you sit down,

1375
01:00:56,913 --> 01:00:58,783
- you can't leave.
- Exactly.

1376
01:00:58,783 --> 01:00:59,783
(Sun is about to set.)

1377
01:00:59,783 --> 01:01:02,053
It's fun for me even though I can't catch any.

1378
01:01:02,053 --> 01:01:03,953
It'll be good if you can catch one though.

1379
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:06,654
If I can't catch one, that's fun in its own way.

1380
01:01:07,294 --> 01:01:08,323
You're right.

1381
01:01:08,654 --> 01:01:10,964
(Daughter, it's not fun for me.)

1382
01:01:11,524 --> 01:01:14,964
But I removed a lot of hooks...

1383
01:01:14,964 --> 01:01:17,263
and scooped up with the landing net the most.

1384
01:01:17,263 --> 01:01:20,334
- You're right.
- I assisted a lot from the side.

1385
01:01:20,334 --> 01:01:23,743
Actually, we are men but are scared of it more than you.

1386
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:26,674
Yes, you should do it.

1387
01:01:27,044 --> 01:01:30,084
I'll catch the fish, but you should do it.

1388
01:01:30,084 --> 01:01:32,553
You guys are making so much noise while fishing!

1389
01:01:32,553 --> 01:01:34,013
(Laughing)

1390
01:01:34,314 --> 01:01:35,814
Are you alone here?

1391
01:01:36,084 --> 01:01:38,453
- Sorry.
- Just leave!

1392
01:01:38,453 --> 01:01:40,493
- Sure.
- "Just leave."

1393
01:01:40,493 --> 01:01:42,823
I've been trying to find a post office since just now.

1394
01:01:42,823 --> 01:01:44,323
(Unbelievable)

1395
01:01:44,794 --> 01:01:46,794
You look just like Kim Hee Won.

1396
01:01:47,493 --> 01:01:50,203
(In his best mood)

1397
01:01:51,033 --> 01:01:53,573
He'll talk about this for 2 weeks.

1398
01:01:53,933 --> 01:01:55,803
It's so annoying and cheap.

1399
01:01:56,404 --> 01:01:58,373
Gosh, why did we come here?

1400
01:01:58,544 --> 01:02:00,344
- Sir.
- Yes.

1401
01:02:00,344 --> 01:02:01,413
Would you like to go to the toilet with me?

1402
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:02,814
- Toilet?
- Yes.

1403
01:02:03,013 --> 01:02:05,844
You should keep an eye on the rod. I'll go myself.

1404
01:02:06,114 --> 01:02:08,013
(Giggling)

1405
01:02:08,254 --> 01:02:11,683
You Jung, even if a fish bites, just leave it.

1406
01:02:12,323 --> 01:02:15,893
(I'll not rest for a single moment!)

1407
01:02:16,393 --> 01:02:19,123
Just leave it.

1408
01:02:19,234 --> 01:02:21,234
- Leave it?
- Yes, just leave it.

1409
01:02:21,234 --> 01:02:23,864
It's showing interest. It bit!

1410
01:02:23,864 --> 01:02:25,933
It bit, okay. It got caught!

1411
01:02:25,933 --> 01:02:27,473
You caught it, right?

1412
01:02:27,473 --> 01:02:29,973
- I caught it.
- Okay! You Jung caught one!

1413
01:02:30,573 --> 01:02:32,243
You Jung caught one!

1414
01:02:32,844 --> 01:02:34,573
Dong Il, she caught one!

1415
01:02:34,573 --> 01:02:36,544
- Me?
- No, You Jung.

1416
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:37,544
I see, catch it.

1417
01:02:37,643 --> 01:02:38,984
(Laughing)

1418
01:02:39,553 --> 01:02:41,314
(I'll take it out for you this time.)

1419
01:02:41,314 --> 01:02:43,623
You Jung, staying still worked, right?

1420
01:02:43,623 --> 01:02:46,694
- You're right. I kept moving it.
- Yes.

1421
01:02:48,594 --> 01:02:50,524
- Be careful with your head.
- This is too short.

1422
01:02:50,524 --> 01:02:52,364
It's not going to fall off, right?

1423
01:02:53,564 --> 01:02:56,703
Okay! You Jung caught one!

1424
01:02:57,004 --> 01:02:59,533
(Proud)

1425
01:02:59,904 --> 01:03:02,973
- Gosh, my daughter. You caught one?
- Yes.

1426
01:03:03,973 --> 01:03:06,114
I want to let it go alive.

1427
01:03:07,513 --> 01:03:08,973
(Smiling)

1428
01:03:10,384 --> 01:03:12,143
- This...
- Dong Il said,

1429
01:03:12,143 --> 01:03:14,114
"I want to let it go alive."

1430
01:03:15,984 --> 01:03:17,223
"I want to let it go alive."

1431
01:03:18,524 --> 01:03:21,223
He looks so lonely.

1432
01:03:22,353 --> 01:03:24,564
We caught enough, so let's go back.

1433
01:03:24,564 --> 01:03:27,263
- Hey!
- My gosh!

1434
01:03:28,163 --> 01:03:30,433
(You can't go anywhere!)

1435
01:03:30,933 --> 01:03:32,533
(Dad, finally!)

1436
01:03:32,834 --> 01:03:35,033
- What's this? It shouldn't happen.
- Yes!

1437
01:03:35,703 --> 01:03:37,373
That means everyone caught one.

1438
01:03:37,373 --> 01:03:38,373
(Will everyone succeed in fishing today?)

1439
01:03:39,614 --> 01:03:41,973
I don't panic. I cross my legs.

1440
01:03:43,984 --> 01:03:46,654
Look, I don't panic at all. I even cross my legs.

1441
01:03:47,084 --> 01:03:49,683
Sitting on the sofa, it looks like I didn't catch one at all, right?

1442
01:03:52,154 --> 01:03:55,493
This is how laid back a true pro is.

1443
01:03:55,493 --> 01:03:57,663
Look, I don't panic at all.

1444
01:03:58,424 --> 01:04:00,033
(1 minute ago)

1445
01:04:00,033 --> 01:04:01,533
(Trembling)

1446
01:04:02,763 --> 01:04:05,364
(I definitely didn't panic.)

1447
01:04:06,073 --> 01:04:09,703
It's become a part of me that my body remembers.

1448
01:04:09,844 --> 01:04:11,944
Dong Il, you're so cool.

1449
01:04:12,044 --> 01:04:14,873
I should take a picture of this.

1450
01:04:14,873 --> 01:04:15,913
(You Jung takes out her phone too.)

1451
01:04:15,913 --> 01:04:16,913
Come here.

1452
01:04:17,013 --> 01:04:19,654
A true fisher doesn't use a landing net.

1453
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:21,783
- Gosh.
- I pull it up like this.

1454
01:04:21,953 --> 01:04:24,384
You need to show that you caught it exactly like this.

1455
01:04:24,384 --> 01:04:26,053
(Amazed)

1456
01:04:26,323 --> 01:04:28,123
Dong Il, you must've caught a fish!

1457
01:04:28,123 --> 01:04:29,694
("This Is How Relaxed A Fisher Is" by Si Wan)

1458
01:04:30,094 --> 01:04:33,134
(I should record a video.)

1459
01:04:33,864 --> 01:04:35,364
I don't panic at all.

1460
01:04:35,364 --> 01:04:37,134
I don't think it's getting pulled back anymore.

1461
01:04:37,564 --> 01:04:38,864
I think you should grab it here.

1462
01:04:39,033 --> 01:04:40,703
Yes, leave it. Hey!

1463
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:43,373
(You Jung's camera)

1464
01:04:43,603 --> 01:04:45,774
- I think you should grab it here.
- Yes, leave it.

1465
01:04:45,774 --> 01:04:46,774
(Drop)

1466
01:04:49,814 --> 01:04:51,984
(I'm doomed.)

1467
01:04:52,283 --> 01:04:54,513
(The amazing situation is recorded clearly.)

1468
01:04:54,513 --> 01:04:55,553
Why?

1469
01:04:55,553 --> 01:04:57,584
(Is this really happening?)

1470
01:04:57,953 --> 01:05:00,723
(I shouldn't laugh.)

1471
01:05:02,993 --> 01:05:04,123
I'm sorry, Dong Il.

1472
01:05:08,134 --> 01:05:11,203
(Our house is like a comedy show yet again today.)

1473
01:05:11,763 --> 01:05:13,473
(Awkward)

1474
01:05:13,473 --> 01:05:16,844
My gosh. He finally caught one after 30 years,

1475
01:05:16,844 --> 01:05:17,944
but what a pity.

1476
01:05:18,573 --> 01:05:22,073
(The more you think about it, the funnier the situation is.)

1477
01:05:22,314 --> 01:05:23,643
Si Wan, it's okay.

1478
01:05:24,084 --> 01:05:27,283
My gosh, Dong Il... Let's go back.

1479
01:05:28,154 --> 01:05:29,884
It's over.

1480
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:31,853
- I'm crying.
- Let's go.

1481
01:05:32,024 --> 01:05:33,323
It's so funny.

1482
01:05:33,723 --> 01:05:36,564
Things are going to be so awkward for the rest of the day.

1483
01:05:38,123 --> 01:05:39,163
My gosh.

1484
01:05:39,163 --> 01:05:42,033
This is amazing. It's so funny.

1485
01:05:42,033 --> 01:05:43,533
I'll be in the car first.

1486
01:05:45,303 --> 01:05:49,334
My gosh, it's going to be so awkward for the rest of the day.

1487
01:05:51,243 --> 01:05:54,214
Please wear your seat belts before we leave.

1488
01:05:54,214 --> 01:05:55,413
- Okay.
- You set up the GPS, right?

1489
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:56,714
Yes, I did.

1490
01:05:56,743 --> 01:05:58,584
Tell me if you find anything uncomfortable on the way, Dong Il.

1491
01:05:58,584 --> 01:05:59,614
Sure.

1492
01:05:59,853 --> 01:06:01,513
I'm feeling uncomfortable right now.

1493
01:06:02,984 --> 01:06:04,553
(Cold)

1494
01:06:04,553 --> 01:06:05,723
If that's the case...

1495
01:06:05,953 --> 01:06:07,823
- Let's go now.
- Yes.

1496
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:13,033
(They leave while carrying Dong Il's heavy heart.)

1497
01:06:13,533 --> 01:06:16,263
Gosh, I feel so alone.

1498
01:06:16,533 --> 01:06:18,933
- Why?
- I just feel that way.

1499
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,433
You caught one.

1500
01:06:20,433 --> 01:06:22,334
You caught one. So I was really...

1501
01:06:22,334 --> 01:06:26,413
Catching a lot doesn't mean much. Right?

1502
01:06:26,413 --> 01:06:28,674
My pride gets wounded when I look at how you behave.

1503
01:06:28,674 --> 01:06:29,683
Why?

1504
01:06:30,584 --> 01:06:32,584
It lasted for two weeks last time.

1505
01:06:32,584 --> 01:06:34,553
What do you mean 2 weeks? It lasted for 3.

1506
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:37,723
(The Fishing King's jokes are really on point today.)

1507
01:06:37,723 --> 01:06:38,783
Two weeks are too short.

1508
01:06:39,053 --> 01:06:42,424
- But that's quite strange.
- Right.

1509
01:06:42,424 --> 01:06:44,663
I fished back then and today,

1510
01:06:44,663 --> 01:06:46,464
and this is my second time ever.

1511
01:06:46,464 --> 01:06:47,533
But you placed first for both.

1512
01:06:47,533 --> 01:06:49,904
- Yes, but that...
- I don't know what to say.

1513
01:06:50,203 --> 01:06:52,433
(One moment, he's laughing brightly)

1514
01:06:52,734 --> 01:06:54,734
(Sighing)

1515
01:06:56,174 --> 01:06:59,103
You know, the psychological state of the fish?

1516
01:07:00,573 --> 01:07:02,214
"Psychological state".

1517
01:07:03,013 --> 01:07:05,413
When I look at those aspects...

1518
01:07:05,413 --> 01:07:08,384
What's the one we hung the first time?

1519
01:07:09,053 --> 01:07:10,053
Lure?

1520
01:07:10,053 --> 01:07:13,654
They will bite on the lure but won't eat the bait.

1521
01:07:13,993 --> 01:07:16,594
But it really looked like...

1522
01:07:16,823 --> 01:07:20,694
it was a part of a script and you were acting it out.

1523
01:07:20,694 --> 01:07:24,103
I thought they were filming a scene from a movie.

1524
01:07:24,103 --> 01:07:25,533
I thought they were filming it.

1525
01:07:25,533 --> 01:07:27,734
How can it suddenly...

1526
01:07:27,734 --> 01:07:30,774
I recorded a video of it.

1527
01:07:31,444 --> 01:07:32,973
- Really?
- You recorded it?

1528
01:07:32,973 --> 01:07:34,814
(Deep sigh)

1529
01:07:35,174 --> 01:07:37,413
I'll watch it whenever I feel blue.

1530
01:07:37,944 --> 01:07:40,084
When I'm tired from work.

1531
01:07:40,084 --> 01:07:41,514
- You'll watch it?
- Yes.

1532
01:07:41,514 --> 01:07:42,884
My gosh.

1533
01:07:43,323 --> 01:07:46,224
(A tunnel appears just in time.)

1534
01:07:48,993 --> 01:07:50,993
I feel like this tunnel now.

1535
01:07:52,224 --> 01:07:53,993
- Soon, - Soon, there will be light.

1536
01:07:53,993 --> 01:07:56,304
the exit... You'll see the light.

1537
01:08:00,674 --> 01:08:03,044
- Why is the tunnel so long?
- There's no end to the tunnel!

1538
01:08:03,174 --> 01:08:04,773
Why is the tunnel so long?

1539
01:08:04,773 --> 01:08:07,613
He'll be stuck in a tunnel till the end.

1540
01:08:08,174 --> 01:08:10,243
The exit...

1541
01:08:10,243 --> 01:08:11,243
- Soon...
- Why is it so long?

1542
01:08:11,243 --> 01:08:14,384
I was going to say you'll see the light soon.

1543
01:08:14,384 --> 01:08:16,184
I didn't think the tunnel is so long.

1544
01:08:17,983 --> 01:08:21,554
(Dong Il's bright future that will come one day)

1545
01:08:21,823 --> 01:08:23,363
It's so suffocating.

1546
01:08:24,094 --> 01:08:26,394
(Joking)

1547
01:08:26,663 --> 01:08:29,294
- That's such a fun memory.
- Yes.

1548
01:08:29,294 --> 01:08:31,233
Really unexpected memory.

1549
01:08:31,663 --> 01:08:33,304
I want to go home quickly.

1550
01:08:33,504 --> 01:08:35,903
I'm hungry. Right?

1551
01:08:36,203 --> 01:08:37,443
Aren't you hungry, You Jung?

1552
01:08:37,443 --> 01:08:39,044
- I'm hungry.
- Right?

1553
01:08:39,044 --> 01:08:42,544
For dinner, Si Wan will cook what you like,

1554
01:08:42,544 --> 01:08:46,084
a whole barbecue. Look forward to it.

1555
01:08:47,153 --> 01:08:50,584
I brought a smoker grill.

1556
01:08:50,823 --> 01:08:52,884
- A smoker grill?
- For the smoke?

1557
01:08:52,884 --> 01:08:54,354
- You Jung, you brought it?
- Sounds delicious.

1558
01:08:54,594 --> 01:08:56,123
Do you mean a grill where you put in the meat?

1559
01:08:56,123 --> 01:08:59,094
You need to add in the chips for the smoker grill...

1560
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:00,294
You need to put in the chips together.

1561
01:09:00,294 --> 01:09:02,934
and get the smoke fragrance onto the meat towards the end.

1562
01:09:02,934 --> 01:09:04,063
But Dong Il,

1563
01:09:04,063 --> 01:09:08,104
I'm only cooking pork belly.

1564
01:09:08,334 --> 01:09:12,104
It will be nice to have something we can eat...

1565
01:09:12,104 --> 01:09:13,573
together with pork belly.

1566
01:09:14,573 --> 01:09:15,573
Kimchi!

1567
01:09:15,573 --> 01:09:17,813
Do we just eat it with kimchi?

1568
01:09:17,813 --> 01:09:20,714
- Rice!
- Rice? Should I just cook those?

1569
01:09:20,714 --> 01:09:21,913
Should I do it?

1570
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:23,384
Sure.

1571
01:09:23,384 --> 01:09:25,554
Maybe jjigae?

1572
01:09:25,554 --> 01:09:27,724
- Sujebi?
- Should we eat them together?

1573
01:09:27,724 --> 01:09:28,924
Kimchi sujebi?

1574
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:31,264
Whatever you cook, it'll be great.

1575
01:09:31,294 --> 01:09:34,863
Sujebi and smoked pork belly sound great together!

1576
01:09:34,863 --> 01:09:36,934
Yes. If we go now...

1577
01:09:37,434 --> 01:09:40,533
It's 5pm now, so we should reach around 6pm.

1578
01:09:41,073 --> 01:09:43,873
I don't think I ever came back from fishing in just one hour...

1579
01:09:43,873 --> 01:09:45,474
even when I plan that initially.

1580
01:09:45,644 --> 01:09:47,544
Will the barbecue take three hours?

1581
01:09:47,813 --> 01:09:49,214
It takes three hours.

1582
01:09:49,714 --> 01:09:51,844
I'll try to reduce the time as much as possible.

1583
01:09:51,844 --> 01:09:53,884
(He will try to reduce cooking time as much as possible.)

1584
01:09:56,523 --> 01:10:00,394
(They drove past the downtown and rushed...)

1585
01:10:01,554 --> 01:10:05,663
(to reach the familiar pine tree forest.)

1586
01:10:05,863 --> 01:10:06,894
We're here.

1587
01:10:08,733 --> 01:10:10,563
I want to eat something.

1588
01:10:10,703 --> 01:10:11,703
Right?

1589
01:10:12,203 --> 01:10:15,073
I'll go and prepare dinner right away.

1590
01:10:15,073 --> 01:10:16,104
Sure thing.

1591
01:10:16,104 --> 01:10:19,044
It will begin as I put them in it.

1592
01:10:19,044 --> 01:10:21,243
- Yes, we should eat it right away.
- We don't need anything extra.

1593
01:10:21,243 --> 01:10:23,313
(Shall we go and have dinner now?)

1594
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,483
- Goodness. Good work.
- Good work.

1595
01:10:25,743 --> 01:10:26,953
Good work.

1596
01:10:27,754 --> 01:10:29,354
You Jung must be starving.

1597
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:31,953
Shall I take out the grill now?

1598
01:10:31,953 --> 01:10:33,254
- Yes.
- Shall I take it out?

1599
01:10:33,424 --> 01:10:34,453
Yes.

1600
01:10:34,894 --> 01:10:35,894
It's this one.

1601
01:10:36,054 --> 01:10:37,764
- Oh, this is it?
- Yes.

1602
01:10:37,964 --> 01:10:39,323
It's what I brought.

1603
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:41,094
So this is a grill?

1604
01:10:41,934 --> 01:10:44,504
You put the charcoal in here...

1605
01:10:44,504 --> 01:10:46,163
and grill the meat on top.

1606
01:10:46,233 --> 01:10:47,903
You can put the charcoal here.

1607
01:10:48,273 --> 01:10:50,544
- There?
- So that's how it works?

1608
01:10:50,544 --> 01:10:52,073
(Okay, I got it.)

1609
01:10:52,174 --> 01:10:54,544
It's hard to control fire using this.

1610
01:10:56,443 --> 01:10:59,684
(Dong Il and Hee Won are in charge of making a fire.)

1611
01:10:59,684 --> 01:11:01,184
Do we make a fire here?

1612
01:11:03,653 --> 01:11:07,193
(Meanwhile, Si Wan seasons the whole pork belly.)

1613
01:11:09,193 --> 01:11:11,294
The whole pork belly is really thick.

1614
01:11:11,294 --> 01:11:12,363
(Thick)

1615
01:11:14,033 --> 01:11:16,703
(Smoked whole pork belly barbecue...)

1616
01:11:16,703 --> 01:11:20,373
(prepared for You Jung)

1617
01:11:21,174 --> 01:11:24,703
(Start a fire on one side of the grill, )

1618
01:11:24,703 --> 01:11:28,573
(and add more smoky flavor using wood chips.)

1619
01:11:29,714 --> 01:11:33,384
(Grill it with smoke for about 2 to 3 hours...)

1620
01:11:33,384 --> 01:11:36,884
(to make smoked barbecue.)

1621
01:11:38,354 --> 01:11:42,523
(Crispy on the outside...)

1622
01:11:42,523 --> 01:11:45,424
(and moist on the inside.)

1623
01:11:45,764 --> 01:11:47,264
Shall I wash rice?

1624
01:11:47,464 --> 01:11:48,733
Rice?

1625
01:11:48,863 --> 01:11:51,104
No, it's okay. It's not so urgent.

1626
01:11:51,134 --> 01:11:52,604
I can make it in no time.

1627
01:11:53,703 --> 01:11:55,804
(Si Wan said it's okay to You Jung, but...)

1628
01:11:56,134 --> 01:11:57,804
(He seems busy.)

1629
01:11:57,804 --> 01:11:59,573
I need a wooden bowl.

1630
01:12:00,573 --> 01:12:03,313
(He can't hide how he's in a rush because You Jung is starving.)

1631
01:12:03,613 --> 01:12:06,014
(The key point of whole pork belly barbecue)

1632
01:12:07,313 --> 01:12:10,084
(Cinnamon powder)

1633
01:12:11,054 --> 01:12:14,323
(Cumin powder)

1634
01:12:14,823 --> 01:12:17,724
(Adding more flavor with various spices)

1635
01:12:17,724 --> 01:12:19,594
(Fully concentrated)

1636
01:12:20,134 --> 01:12:22,634
(He applies the seasoning thoroughly.)

1637
01:12:22,663 --> 01:12:24,934
(Seasoning with nimble fingers)

1638
01:12:25,663 --> 01:12:28,203
(I'll cook it fast for you!)

1639
01:12:29,033 --> 01:12:30,804
(In the meantime, )

1640
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:33,644
(You Jung is cooking rice on her own.)

1641
01:12:35,474 --> 01:12:37,184
(Washing)

1642
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:40,554
The rice water...

1643
01:12:41,113 --> 01:12:42,514
You can just pour it out there.

1644
01:12:42,913 --> 01:12:43,983
What a waste.

1645
01:12:44,724 --> 01:12:47,023
Do you use it to make something?

1646
01:12:47,354 --> 01:12:49,823
- You can make a stew with it.
- Using rice water?

1647
01:12:50,163 --> 01:12:51,823
Yes. And you can also wash your face with it.

1648
01:12:52,123 --> 01:12:53,163
(Laughing)

1649
01:12:53,163 --> 01:12:54,964
Don't you know you wash your face with rice water?

1650
01:12:55,363 --> 01:12:56,533
I do.

1651
01:12:56,804 --> 01:12:58,903
- I've heard of it.
- My mom made me wash my face...

1652
01:12:58,903 --> 01:13:01,233
with rice water a lot because it makes my face brighter.

1653
01:13:01,573 --> 01:13:04,873
I actually kept it in the fridge and washed my face with it.

1654
01:13:04,873 --> 01:13:07,714
(She's adorable.)

1655
01:13:08,773 --> 01:13:09,943
I'll put it in here.

1656
01:13:09,943 --> 01:13:12,283
(She quickly prepares rice to cook.)

1657
01:13:14,254 --> 01:13:15,514
I should make sujebi right away.

1658
01:13:16,783 --> 01:13:19,993
(She knows where the ingredients are.)

1659
01:13:21,554 --> 01:13:23,794
(Shall I start?)

1660
01:13:25,323 --> 01:13:26,794
- Are you making kimchi sujebi?
- Yes.

1661
01:13:27,794 --> 01:13:28,964
(Impressed)

1662
01:13:28,964 --> 01:13:30,264
It must be delicious.

1663
01:13:30,703 --> 01:13:32,403
I only took out the flour.

1664
01:13:32,703 --> 01:13:35,233
I can tell from the flour how delicious it'll be.

1665
01:13:36,434 --> 01:13:38,044
(Hee Won...)

1666
01:13:39,104 --> 01:13:42,073
- You Jung is using flour to...
- I hope it'll be delicious.

1667
01:13:43,073 --> 01:13:44,243
- Is this salt?
- Yes.

1668
01:13:46,443 --> 01:13:48,953
(She tastes it before adding it.)

1669
01:13:49,854 --> 01:13:51,783
(Adding a bit of salt)

1670
01:13:52,854 --> 01:13:55,823
(Adding a bit of cooking oil for the chewy texture)

1671
01:13:57,063 --> 01:13:59,964
(Mixing)

1672
01:14:00,693 --> 01:14:03,334
(When the dough is well-mixed, )

1673
01:14:05,604 --> 01:14:08,403
(put it in a plastic bag.)

1674
01:14:08,733 --> 01:14:11,873
(Closing it tightly)

1675
01:14:13,243 --> 01:14:15,174
(Push it to deflate it.)

1676
01:14:17,884 --> 01:14:21,684
(She even knows that it needs to sit for a while.)

1677
01:14:23,054 --> 01:14:24,384
(Glancing)

1678
01:14:25,453 --> 01:14:26,523
What is it?

1679
01:14:28,023 --> 01:14:30,863
(You Jung suddenly bursts into laughter.)

1680
01:14:30,863 --> 01:14:32,063
- What is it?
- Sorry?

1681
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:34,134
- Why are you laughing?
- You just seemed...

1682
01:14:34,533 --> 01:14:36,094
really busy, that's why.

1683
01:14:36,094 --> 01:14:39,063
Yes, I'm pressed for time.

1684
01:14:39,134 --> 01:14:40,334
Gosh, seriously.

1685
01:14:40,334 --> 01:14:42,033
- It's...
- You're working so hard.

1686
01:14:42,134 --> 01:14:43,674
It's really pressuring, you know.

1687
01:14:43,674 --> 01:14:45,674
I'm worried that they might not eat on time because of me.

1688
01:14:47,144 --> 01:14:48,373
(After seasoning the meat...)

1689
01:14:48,373 --> 01:14:50,184
I'm done seasoning the meat.

1690
01:14:50,613 --> 01:14:52,044
I've never seen this before.

1691
01:14:52,743 --> 01:14:54,014
This is...

1692
01:14:54,254 --> 01:14:57,623
The fire is in here, so if you close the lid,

1693
01:14:57,623 --> 01:14:59,554
the smoke is trapped in there.

1694
01:14:59,554 --> 01:15:03,094
So it cooks the meat indirectly.

1695
01:15:04,424 --> 01:15:05,924
I'll just put in the whole thing.

1696
01:15:05,924 --> 01:15:07,964
(He adds an abundant amount of meat to feed his family.)

1697
01:15:07,993 --> 01:15:09,464
(Packed with meat)

1698
01:15:09,464 --> 01:15:10,834
- Do I close it?
- Yes, please.

1699
01:15:11,863 --> 01:15:12,903
It can't be closed.

1700
01:15:13,063 --> 01:15:15,533
Push that one inside.

1701
01:15:16,504 --> 01:15:17,873
(Pushing the meat inside)

1702
01:15:17,873 --> 01:15:19,703
- There you go.
- All right.

1703
01:15:21,273 --> 01:15:23,514
(He closes it tightly so that it doesn't open.)

1704
01:15:24,443 --> 01:15:27,613
(I hope you'll be cooked well.)

1705
01:15:28,354 --> 01:15:30,653
(It looks like it'll take a while.)

1706
01:15:31,054 --> 01:15:32,684
You Jung must be starving.

1707
01:15:33,993 --> 01:15:36,054
(For the members who must be hungry, )

1708
01:15:37,294 --> 01:15:40,334
(Chef Sung enters the kitchen.)

1709
01:15:40,863 --> 01:15:42,993
So what are you making?

1710
01:15:43,134 --> 01:15:45,063
I'm making you delicious chives jeon.

1711
01:15:45,063 --> 01:15:46,563
(He's making chives jeon while the meat gets cooked.)

1712
01:15:46,804 --> 01:15:49,233
(He made chives jeon batter in the blink of an eye.)

1713
01:15:49,703 --> 01:15:52,474
(That's fascinating.)

1714
01:15:53,004 --> 01:15:55,044
- It's chives jeon.
- Chives jeon?

1715
01:15:55,443 --> 01:16:00,054
I'm using the chives bud that shot out the first thing in spring.

1716
01:16:00,054 --> 01:16:01,913
- I'm adding lots of chives.
- Okay.

1717
01:16:01,913 --> 01:16:03,084
I like it.

1718
01:16:03,084 --> 01:16:05,123
(I'll make it for you quickly.)

1719
01:16:08,054 --> 01:16:09,554
(Slapping down)

1720
01:16:09,724 --> 01:16:11,023
(Golden brown)

1721
01:16:11,764 --> 01:16:13,023
(Slapping down again)

1722
01:16:13,023 --> 01:16:15,834
This must be why grandmas slap down jeon. It's fun.

1723
01:16:15,834 --> 01:16:16,964
- Sorry?
- What?

1724
01:16:16,964 --> 01:16:18,703
It makes the slapping sound when I flip the jeon.

1725
01:16:18,703 --> 01:16:19,733
(The jeon makes a slapping sound when Dong Il flips it.)

1726
01:16:21,004 --> 01:16:22,674
(Slapping it down again)

1727
01:16:23,773 --> 01:16:26,073
It's more delicious if you tear it with your chopsticks.

1728
01:16:26,073 --> 01:16:27,073
(Dong Il finished making chives jeon for his family who must be hungry.)

1729
01:16:27,073 --> 01:16:28,113
It looks good.

1730
01:16:29,144 --> 01:16:31,044
Try it. The chives are good.

1731
01:16:31,044 --> 01:16:32,943
(Hee Won takes a bite first.)

1732
01:16:33,283 --> 01:16:34,483
(Exclaiming)

1733
01:16:35,953 --> 01:16:37,084
- It's like bread.
- Bread?

1734
01:16:37,084 --> 01:16:38,123
Yes.

1735
01:16:38,123 --> 01:16:40,193
(Embarrassed)

1736
01:16:40,894 --> 01:16:42,953
- It's like bread?
- Yes, try it.

1737
01:16:43,323 --> 01:16:45,863
(You Jung takes a bite of the chives bread.)

1738
01:16:47,063 --> 01:16:49,533
(Chewing)

1739
01:16:50,464 --> 01:16:53,334
The chives have a strong scent.

1740
01:16:53,604 --> 01:16:55,004
(Try it, Si Wan.)

1741
01:16:55,004 --> 01:16:56,033
It's chives bud jeon.

1742
01:16:58,004 --> 01:16:59,403
- It has a nice scent, right?
- Wow.

1743
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:02,344
Everything tastes good here.

1744
01:17:03,884 --> 01:17:06,113
(It suits You Jung's palate too.)

1745
01:17:06,443 --> 01:17:08,384
There's a famous chives bread place.

1746
01:17:08,453 --> 01:17:09,854
- Right.
- It's...

1747
01:17:09,854 --> 01:17:12,054
- It's called Dong Il Bakery.
- Yes, it's really famous.

1748
01:17:12,924 --> 01:17:15,054
(This bakery has nice chives bread.)

1749
01:17:15,993 --> 01:17:17,394
(Smacking her lips)

1750
01:17:17,823 --> 01:17:18,894
Si Wan.

1751
01:17:20,794 --> 01:17:21,794
Si Wan.

1752
01:17:21,894 --> 01:17:23,733
- Can you give me one more piece?
- Sure.

1753
01:17:23,733 --> 01:17:24,764
(Give me one more piece of chives bread.)

1754
01:17:25,733 --> 01:17:26,873
Thank you.

1755
01:17:26,873 --> 01:17:28,804
(Refilling chives bread)

1756
01:17:30,243 --> 01:17:32,073
(It's so good.)

1757
01:17:32,073 --> 01:17:33,743
Chives are delicious, seriously.

1758
01:17:33,743 --> 01:17:35,144
(They appease their hunger with chives jeon.)

1759
01:17:35,474 --> 01:17:38,413
(You Jung hurriedly makes kimchi sujebi.)

1760
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:43,983
(Adding all sorts of vegetables she prepared)

1761
01:17:45,724 --> 01:17:48,193
(Then she adds kimchi.)

1762
01:17:49,054 --> 01:17:52,663
(Cutting without hesitation)

1763
01:17:54,434 --> 01:17:55,634
It'll be done soon.

1764
01:17:55,634 --> 01:17:56,634
(Sujebi will be ready soon.)

1765
01:17:58,304 --> 01:17:59,563
I don't need to add more kimchi, do I?

1766
01:18:01,334 --> 01:18:03,644
I don't really measure things when I cook.

1767
01:18:03,773 --> 01:18:05,273
- I like it.
- I don't measure.

1768
01:18:05,273 --> 01:18:06,344
That's nice.

1769
01:18:07,773 --> 01:18:10,884
(Adding anchovy sauce as much as she wants)

1770
01:18:11,813 --> 01:18:14,754
(Adding lots of kimchi juice)

1771
01:18:15,884 --> 01:18:18,153
Do you want me to help... Did you put in sujebi already?

1772
01:18:18,153 --> 01:18:19,384
No, not yet.

1773
01:18:20,594 --> 01:18:21,623
Do you want me to help?

1774
01:18:22,193 --> 01:18:23,623
Let's do it together. I just need to put it in, right?

1775
01:18:23,623 --> 01:18:24,693
- That's right.
- Right.

1776
01:18:24,693 --> 01:18:27,134
You just need to put it in.

1777
01:18:27,134 --> 01:18:29,533
(Uncle Hee Won is on his way to make sujebi with her.)

1778
01:18:32,334 --> 01:18:33,873
Do I apply it to my hands?

1779
01:18:33,873 --> 01:18:35,533
Just like...

1780
01:18:35,533 --> 01:18:39,873
applying hand lotion, you should rub your hands with it.

1781
01:18:39,873 --> 01:18:42,813
(He's rubbing his hands just like You Jung said.)

1782
01:18:43,474 --> 01:18:45,144
- Mushrooms...
- You're putting it in later, right?

1783
01:18:45,144 --> 01:18:47,653
- Should I put it in later?
- I have no idea. You should know.

1784
01:18:48,983 --> 01:18:50,354
(He's distancing himself from the recipe.)

1785
01:18:50,354 --> 01:18:52,323
- I have no idea.
- It's okay to put it in first.

1786
01:18:52,323 --> 01:18:53,623
- Do you put it in first?
- Yes.

1787
01:18:54,123 --> 01:18:57,294
(Making cuts on the mushroom)

1788
01:18:57,623 --> 01:19:00,693
All right. I can just put sujebi in now, right?

1789
01:19:00,693 --> 01:19:02,294
- Yes, you can.
- Right?

1790
01:19:05,563 --> 01:19:06,663
(She looks skilled as she's made it often.)

1791
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:07,974
So that's how it's done.

1792
01:19:08,674 --> 01:19:10,403
(You Jung puts in a piece.)

1793
01:19:11,144 --> 01:19:13,174
(Hee Won puts in a piece as well.)

1794
01:19:14,474 --> 01:19:16,313
I pressed it hard,

1795
01:19:16,514 --> 01:19:17,783
so it should be cooked well.

1796
01:19:18,443 --> 01:19:20,514
You're quite good at it, Hee Won.

1797
01:19:20,514 --> 01:19:21,514
Really?

1798
01:19:23,684 --> 01:19:27,424
(It's gotten dark in the pine tree forest.)

1799
01:19:28,123 --> 01:19:30,894
(In the meantime, the meat is getting cooked.)

1800
01:19:31,594 --> 01:19:34,033
(Is it getting cooked well?)

1801
01:19:35,193 --> 01:19:37,903
(With an excited heart, )

1802
01:19:37,903 --> 01:19:40,033
(he opens the lid.)

1803
01:19:42,674 --> 01:19:45,544
(It looks like it'll never be cooked.)

1804
01:19:46,903 --> 01:19:48,113
What do I do with this?

1805
01:19:48,113 --> 01:19:49,474
(He's flustered.)

1806
01:19:49,474 --> 01:19:50,544
What should I do?

1807
01:19:51,113 --> 01:19:53,913
(Anxious)

1808
01:19:56,153 --> 01:19:59,084
(He adds more charcoal hurriedly.)

1809
01:19:59,123 --> 01:20:01,123
It takes really long to finish cooking.

1810
01:20:01,123 --> 01:20:02,823
(Will they be able to eat it within today?)

1811
01:20:03,594 --> 01:20:05,493
I'll grill some rice cakes here.

1812
01:20:05,663 --> 01:20:06,724
Sure.

1813
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:09,733
(Grilling rice cake)

1814
01:20:12,563 --> 01:20:15,373
- Let's give one to You Jung first.
- Sure.

1815
01:20:16,004 --> 01:20:18,344
You need to wrap it with grain syrup.

1816
01:20:18,344 --> 01:20:21,044
Gosh, it must be really good.

1817
01:20:22,214 --> 01:20:25,014
You Jung, try the grilled rice cake.

1818
01:20:25,014 --> 01:20:27,953
It's wrapped with grain syrup we got in Gyeongju.

1819
01:20:30,653 --> 01:20:32,483
- It's delicious.
- Is this good enough?

1820
01:20:32,653 --> 01:20:34,123
My goodness.

1821
01:20:34,294 --> 01:20:35,854
Here, try it.

1822
01:20:35,854 --> 01:20:37,924
(He gives Si Wan a piece with grain syrup wrapped around.)

1823
01:20:38,123 --> 01:20:39,724
- How is it?
- Wow.

1824
01:20:39,724 --> 01:20:41,493
- Is it good?
- My gosh.

1825
01:20:41,493 --> 01:20:42,764
- Is it that good?
- Yes.

1826
01:20:43,134 --> 01:20:45,363
You're only saying that because you feel bad about fishing right?

1827
01:20:45,363 --> 01:20:46,804
- No, it's really good.
- Is it?

1828
01:20:46,804 --> 01:20:49,934
Yes, it's the best rice cake I've ever had.

1829
01:20:50,273 --> 01:20:52,273
- I'm serious.
- That makes it more suspicious.

1830
01:20:52,273 --> 01:20:54,144
The rice cakes I've had so far don't deserve to be called one.

1831
01:20:54,144 --> 01:20:55,573
- Really?
- Yes, I'm serious.

1832
01:20:56,873 --> 01:20:59,243
Si Wan, I can tell you're telling the truth.

1833
01:20:59,384 --> 01:21:00,453
Here.

1834
01:21:00,453 --> 01:21:03,584
- You keep...
- The grain syrup from Gyeongju.

1835
01:21:03,584 --> 01:21:06,384
It's the one the villager made. I wrapped it around the rice cake.

1836
01:21:07,153 --> 01:21:09,354
You Jung. This is a different rice cake.

1837
01:21:09,724 --> 01:21:11,123
- It's mugwort rice cake.
- It's mugwort?

1838
01:21:11,123 --> 01:21:12,464
This is how much I love you.

1839
01:21:12,464 --> 01:21:14,233
It's hot, be careful. Try it.

1840
01:21:14,233 --> 01:21:16,693
I added more oil to fry it. It must be more crispy.

1841
01:21:16,964 --> 01:21:18,464
- It's really good, right?
- Yes.

1842
01:21:20,104 --> 01:21:22,004
Here. Try it. Let's eat it together.

1843
01:21:22,004 --> 01:21:23,004
(They try it together this time.)

1844
01:21:24,403 --> 01:21:26,773
(They feed rice cakes to each other to make up for fishing.)

1845
01:21:27,044 --> 01:21:28,514
It's crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.

1846
01:21:28,514 --> 01:21:31,313
That's right! Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside.

1847
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:34,554
(You're the best, Dong Il.)

1848
01:21:35,153 --> 01:21:37,684
The soup looks delicious.

1849
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:39,384
It's kimchi juice based soup.

1850
01:21:40,084 --> 01:21:42,394
It smells so nice.

1851
01:21:42,493 --> 01:21:43,823
(Smacking his lips)

1852
01:21:45,123 --> 01:21:46,693
I hope it's good.

1853
01:21:46,924 --> 01:21:48,733
It's impossible to be not tasty.

1854
01:21:48,733 --> 01:21:51,264
We only need to boil this for a while outside.

1855
01:21:53,834 --> 01:21:55,674
(Expectant)

1856
01:21:56,134 --> 01:21:57,873
(Impressed)

1857
01:21:57,873 --> 01:21:59,743
The masterwork of my daughter.

1858
01:22:01,743 --> 01:22:04,214
It's boiling hard.

1859
01:22:04,344 --> 01:22:05,943
Wow, it smells amazing.

1860
01:22:06,113 --> 01:22:08,384
I think the sujebi will be really good.

1861
01:22:08,384 --> 01:22:10,254
I know. It looks amazing.

1862
01:22:10,254 --> 01:22:11,283
(Boiling)

1863
01:22:11,283 --> 01:22:14,554
I think it'll be incredible.

1864
01:22:14,554 --> 01:22:16,523
Let's see.

1865
01:22:16,523 --> 01:22:18,424
- How long have we cooked it?
- It's been a while.

1866
01:22:18,424 --> 01:22:20,794
- Then I think it's cooked.
- It's been quite a while.

1867
01:22:20,794 --> 01:22:24,464
Are we finally having it?

1868
01:22:24,863 --> 01:22:26,634
You've waited for long.

1869
01:22:26,634 --> 01:22:28,974
(Highly expectant)

1870
01:22:29,474 --> 01:22:30,703
Is it well-cooked?

1871
01:22:33,004 --> 01:22:34,644
My gosh... This is...

1872
01:22:34,644 --> 01:22:36,443
Gosh, my goodness.

1873
01:22:36,443 --> 01:22:37,743
(It's still very raw.)

1874
01:22:37,943 --> 01:22:40,813
(Did we put in too much meat?)

1875
01:22:40,813 --> 01:22:42,153
Let's just...

1876
01:22:42,153 --> 01:22:44,023
grill one of them.

1877
01:22:44,623 --> 01:22:46,123
Yes, just one of them.

1878
01:22:46,123 --> 01:22:47,123
There.

1879
01:22:47,224 --> 01:22:50,054
I think it's only going to burn on the outside.

1880
01:22:50,224 --> 01:22:52,563
Even if it burns on the outside,

1881
01:22:52,563 --> 01:22:54,993
- we can cut it.
- You Jung knows this stuff well.

1882
01:22:54,993 --> 01:22:56,334
If it burns too much,

1883
01:22:56,334 --> 01:22:58,733
we can just cut the burned part.

1884
01:22:58,934 --> 01:23:01,233
- I'll close the lid now.
- It'll be cooked.

1885
01:23:01,233 --> 01:23:02,634
- It's perfect.
- Yes.

1886
01:23:03,004 --> 01:23:05,174
Let's see.

1887
01:23:05,174 --> 01:23:06,203
(In the meantime, the sujebi is boiled perfectly.)

1888
01:23:06,403 --> 01:23:08,044
It looks incredible.

1889
01:23:08,044 --> 01:23:09,474
My goodness.

1890
01:23:09,644 --> 01:23:11,313
(Forget about the meat.)

1891
01:23:11,313 --> 01:23:12,613
Here, try it.

1892
01:23:12,913 --> 01:23:14,453
I'll try it.

1893
01:23:15,128 --> 01:23:17,289
(Forget about the meat, )

1894
01:23:17,289 --> 01:23:20,058
(and try the sujebi first.)

1895
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:23,199
- It smells really nice.
- It really does.

1896
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:25,199
I can't wait to try it.

1897
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,539
The sujebi.

1898
01:23:27,138 --> 01:23:28,869
Please don't expect too much.

1899
01:23:29,539 --> 01:23:31,478
I made it in a hurry.

1900
01:23:31,478 --> 01:23:33,008
I made it really quickly.

1901
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:35,008
(He tries the soup first.)

1902
01:23:35,008 --> 01:23:36,048
(Amazed)

1903
01:23:37,548 --> 01:23:40,718
(Si Wan sips in the warm soup too.)

1904
01:23:41,688 --> 01:23:43,649
(It soothes the fatigue away.)

1905
01:23:43,649 --> 01:23:45,018
You Jung, this is good.

1906
01:23:45,218 --> 01:23:46,919
Is it okay? Is it good?

1907
01:23:46,919 --> 01:23:48,489
- It's really nice.
- Goodness.

1908
01:23:49,128 --> 01:23:51,399
(He takes a big bite with the vegetables.)

1909
01:23:51,959 --> 01:23:53,758
- This is so good.
- Wow.

1910
01:23:54,228 --> 01:23:55,569
- It's good.
- Yes.

1911
01:23:55,569 --> 01:23:56,628
- It really is good.
- Right.

1912
01:23:56,628 --> 01:23:57,638
(Everyone is satisfied.)

1913
01:23:58,369 --> 01:24:00,699
You Jung can cook really fast and well.

1914
01:24:00,798 --> 01:24:03,838
I thought she just randomly put in the ingredients.

1915
01:24:04,609 --> 01:24:05,638
(She made it without looking at a recipe.)

1916
01:24:05,638 --> 01:24:08,649
Right? It looked like I randomly added ingredients, right?

1917
01:24:09,409 --> 01:24:11,079
It's so good.

1918
01:24:11,619 --> 01:24:12,649
(Impressed)

1919
01:24:13,518 --> 01:24:14,718
(Exclaiming)

1920
01:24:14,718 --> 01:24:15,819
I'm so glad.

1921
01:24:15,819 --> 01:24:16,819
(She's glad that they're enjoying it.)

1922
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:19,758
(She also takes a big bite now that the rest are enjoying it.)

1923
01:24:19,859 --> 01:24:22,188
(Eyes going wide)

1924
01:24:22,688 --> 01:24:26,728
(She fell in love with it although she made it herself.)

1925
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:30,128
(I made it, but it's so good.)

1926
01:24:30,529 --> 01:24:31,539
(A bite)

1927
01:24:31,768 --> 01:24:32,768
(Another bite)

1928
01:24:32,869 --> 01:24:33,869
(Another bite)

1929
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:35,338
(Another bite)

1930
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:38,478
(You Jung can't help but continue to eat it.)

1931
01:24:38,739 --> 01:24:41,249
(In a trance)

1932
01:24:41,909 --> 01:24:44,449
(She's enjoying it.)

1933
01:24:45,319 --> 01:24:47,848
I'm not cold anymore.

1934
01:24:47,848 --> 01:24:49,249
I love the soup.

1935
01:24:50,249 --> 01:24:53,319
- The soup warmed up my body.
- Right.

1936
01:24:55,529 --> 01:24:58,928
(You can even see his breath.)

1937
01:24:59,329 --> 01:25:00,798
It's making me relaxed.

1938
01:25:00,798 --> 01:25:02,699
(The warm soup makes you forget about the cold.)

1939
01:25:03,628 --> 01:25:06,968
You Jung's dish is the best one so far.

1940
01:25:07,768 --> 01:25:10,138
Hee Won helped me make it.

1941
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:12,178
- It's nothing.
- No wonder it's thick.

1942
01:25:12,178 --> 01:25:13,779
He should've made it thin and nice.

1943
01:25:14,348 --> 01:25:16,909
Don't say that I helped you. It'll only make it worse.

1944
01:25:17,919 --> 01:25:19,779
(Joking)

1945
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:22,088
(Gosh, Dad.)

1946
01:25:22,489 --> 01:25:24,388
I already finished two bowls.

1947
01:25:24,388 --> 01:25:26,258
I had three bowls including the rice.

1948
01:25:26,258 --> 01:25:27,588
I told you...

1949
01:25:27,588 --> 01:25:30,428
that I gain 1 to 2kg when I go back home.

1950
01:25:30,428 --> 01:25:32,029
I'm really full.

1951
01:25:32,029 --> 01:25:34,228
It relieved all the stress I got from fishing.

1952
01:25:34,669 --> 01:25:37,169
My daughter helped me relieve my stress.

1953
01:25:37,169 --> 01:25:38,169
I know.

1954
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:40,438
You Jung is very thoughtful.

1955
01:25:40,938 --> 01:25:43,338
It was so good that I didn't know my stomach was burning.

1956
01:25:44,678 --> 01:25:47,539
(Now that they have finished the sujebi, )

1957
01:25:47,978 --> 01:25:51,018
(they wonder what's going on with the whole pork belly barbecue.)

1958
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:53,218
(Taking a glance after taking a bite)

1959
01:25:53,218 --> 01:25:54,218
(Exclaiming)

1960
01:25:55,249 --> 01:25:56,449
(Glancing)

1961
01:25:57,149 --> 01:25:59,459
(Exclaiming and glancing)

1962
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:01,789
Is it ever going to be cooked?

1963
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:04,499
(It's not even smoking now.)

1964
01:26:04,499 --> 01:26:06,659
- How hot is it?
- What?

1965
01:26:06,758 --> 01:26:08,928
- What's the temperature?
- I think it's about 110°C.

1966
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:11,268
I saw the inside earlier.

1967
01:26:12,369 --> 01:26:14,268
- It's about 120°C.
- The outside is...

1968
01:26:14,268 --> 01:26:16,138
It's about 120°C.

1969
01:26:16,138 --> 01:26:18,838
- That's actually fine.
- It's about 120°C.

1970
01:26:19,609 --> 01:26:22,848
I think it'll be cooked in 20 to 30 minutes.

1971
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:26,919
I think it'll be well-cooked after 30 to 40 minutes.

1972
01:26:27,218 --> 01:26:29,588
(But Si Wan is getting impatient.)

1973
01:26:29,619 --> 01:26:32,088
(You Jung needs to taste it.)

1974
01:26:32,588 --> 01:26:34,928
(He continues to worry.)

1975
01:26:35,428 --> 01:26:38,029
(He keeps opening it every 10 minutes because he can't wait.)

1976
01:26:38,199 --> 01:26:40,628
(He's cute.)

1977
01:26:40,959 --> 01:26:43,298
(Barbecue isn't working well today.)

1978
01:26:43,499 --> 01:26:44,968
(He keeps opening it...)

1979
01:26:44,968 --> 01:26:46,399
(again and again.)

1980
01:26:46,598 --> 01:26:49,138
(Please be cooked already!)

1981
01:26:49,268 --> 01:26:51,579
If you keep opening it, it won't be cooked.

1982
01:26:52,378 --> 01:26:54,649
You need to keep it closed for its temperature to increase.

1983
01:26:55,048 --> 01:26:56,609
Don't ever open it again.

1984
01:26:56,609 --> 01:26:58,718
No, I won't. I'll just check its temperature.

1985
01:26:59,779 --> 01:27:03,249
(They add more charcoal for the last time.)

1986
01:27:03,449 --> 01:27:06,319
Let's take as long as we can to finish cooking it.

1987
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:07,888
Just leave it.

1988
01:27:07,888 --> 01:27:11,329
Let's wait about three hours and see how it goes.

1989
01:27:11,329 --> 01:27:13,728
(Trying to ignore it)

1990
01:27:13,758 --> 01:27:15,999
It'll be really dark if you turn off all the lighting.

1991
01:27:16,768 --> 01:27:18,539
- It's really dark at night, right?
- It's pitch dark.

1992
01:27:18,539 --> 01:27:19,838
- It's pitch dark.
- Is it?

1993
01:27:19,838 --> 01:27:20,999
There are no lights, right?

1994
01:27:20,999 --> 01:27:24,039
If we turn off all the lights here,

1995
01:27:24,039 --> 01:27:26,838
- it'll be pitch dark.
- Right.

1996
01:27:26,838 --> 01:27:30,249
There's no light at all on all sides.

1997
01:27:30,249 --> 01:27:32,678
(It has an eerie mood like one from a scary movie.)

1998
01:27:32,819 --> 01:27:35,489
(Bang, bang)

1999
01:27:35,789 --> 01:27:37,548
Isn't that the gun sound?

2000
01:27:38,088 --> 01:27:39,258
Isn't it?

2001
01:27:39,258 --> 01:27:40,758
Are they shooting at night?

2002
01:27:40,758 --> 01:27:41,888
There's such a thing?

2003
01:27:42,459 --> 01:27:43,728
Can't you recall?

2004
01:27:43,829 --> 01:27:45,159
- Is it from the construction site?
- Is it from the construction site?

2005
01:27:45,899 --> 01:27:47,869
What's that banging sound?

2006
01:27:48,128 --> 01:27:51,569
What am I, the village head? How would I know?

2007
01:27:51,768 --> 01:27:54,638
My gosh. Do you think I'm the village head?

2008
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:58,508
Dong Il was stressed out a lot today.

2009
01:27:58,508 --> 01:28:00,079
He couldn't even fish.

2010
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:02,978
Why did I have to get so stressed over fish?

2011
01:28:02,978 --> 01:28:04,978
- Relax, Dong Il.
- Thank you, guys.

2012
01:28:05,348 --> 01:28:08,348
He usually doesn't get so mad.

2013
01:28:08,348 --> 01:28:10,419
(They help relieve him the stress he got from fishing.)

2014
01:28:10,588 --> 01:28:12,359
My gosh, Dong Il.

2015
01:28:12,359 --> 01:28:13,819
(They find peace again.)

2016
01:28:14,058 --> 01:28:17,359
(The night wears on as they laugh and chat.)

2017
01:28:18,428 --> 01:28:21,329
(The grill is working hard to cook the meat.)

2018
01:28:21,899 --> 01:28:24,098
(It's starting to smoke a little too.)

2019
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:27,039
(Is it getting cooked well?)

2020
01:28:27,295 --> 01:28:29,125
All right. Let me take a look.

2021
01:28:31,182 --> 01:28:35,321
I think the temperature dropped because we kept opening it.

2022
01:28:35,951 --> 01:28:38,722
Patience is a virtue when it comes to food.

2023
01:28:39,691 --> 01:28:42,722
Oh, no. Will this be okay?

2024
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:46,962
(Devastated)

2025
01:28:47,562 --> 01:28:50,831
(We need to feed You Jung some meat.)

2026
01:28:51,001 --> 01:28:53,501
(He's sorry, disappointed, and tired.)

2027
01:28:53,932 --> 01:28:55,941
(The inside isn't cooked.)

2028
01:28:59,712 --> 01:29:01,741
I think we can grill it here.

2029
01:29:02,441 --> 01:29:04,212
- My gosh.
- You're right.

2030
01:29:04,212 --> 01:29:05,812
- We can grill it there.
- I think we can just grill it here.

2031
01:29:05,812 --> 01:29:08,751
All right. Let's do that. Okay.

2032
01:29:09,621 --> 01:29:13,151
It'll be delicious. If we cook it here first, it'll be good.

2033
01:29:13,821 --> 01:29:16,361
Here we go. We're going to grill it first.

2034
01:29:17,831 --> 01:29:19,092
Please put this aside.

2035
01:29:19,092 --> 01:29:20,191
- Hang on.
- Put it on the gridiron.

2036
01:29:21,031 --> 01:29:23,762
Put it on the gridiron, and let's wait.

2037
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:26,401
Wow, it's gone up to 200°C.

2038
01:29:26,632 --> 01:29:28,642
- No, that's in Fahrenheit.
- Is that so?

2039
01:29:29,201 --> 01:29:30,842
(Calm down.)

2040
01:29:30,842 --> 01:29:34,812
I'm starting to only see the things I want to see.

2041
01:29:35,012 --> 01:29:37,081
You see? It's starting to smoke already.

2042
01:29:37,911 --> 01:29:40,052
This can't be done by humans.

2043
01:29:40,982 --> 01:29:43,522
We need some help from up there.

2044
01:29:44,321 --> 01:29:46,151
We did all we could do.

2045
01:29:46,621 --> 01:29:48,962
It keeps smoking unlike before.

2046
01:29:49,161 --> 01:29:51,962
Let's just leave it be, whether it gets cooked or not.

2047
01:29:54,092 --> 01:29:55,802
(Gathering all of their energy, )

2048
01:29:55,802 --> 01:29:58,401
(they open the grill.)

2049
01:29:58,401 --> 01:30:00,371
We're finally opening it.

2050
01:30:00,831 --> 01:30:01,871
It looks good.

2051
01:30:01,871 --> 01:30:03,071
(The well-grilled barbecue greets them.)

2052
01:30:03,102 --> 01:30:04,911
Cut it in the middle first.

2053
01:30:05,672 --> 01:30:06,941
(He cuts it to see if it's cooked to the inside.)

2054
01:30:06,941 --> 01:30:08,812
Look at its color.

2055
01:30:09,081 --> 01:30:10,342
It's cooked.

2056
01:30:10,342 --> 01:30:11,482
- It's well-cooked.
- Cut some more.

2057
01:30:11,482 --> 01:30:13,882
(The meat is thoroughly cooked!)

2058
01:30:13,882 --> 01:30:15,482
It looks nice.

2059
01:30:15,922 --> 01:30:17,321
I think it'll be good.

2060
01:30:18,291 --> 01:30:21,821
(He gives a piece to the guest who's waited for so long.)

2061
01:30:22,562 --> 01:30:23,722
It's really good.

2062
01:30:23,722 --> 01:30:25,962
(It's really good.)

2063
01:30:26,732 --> 01:30:29,331
(He gives a bite to Hee Won who's also worked hard.)

2064
01:30:30,802 --> 01:30:32,501
Wow, this is really good.

2065
01:30:32,501 --> 01:30:33,831
- It is.
- Is it okay?

2066
01:30:33,831 --> 01:30:35,941
Si Wan seasoned it well.

2067
01:30:35,941 --> 01:30:36,941
(He's relieved.)

2068
01:30:37,201 --> 01:30:41,142
It's a bit salty too. It tastes like smoked meat.

2069
01:30:41,241 --> 01:30:42,441
It looks good.

2070
01:30:43,411 --> 01:30:46,212
(It tastes even better because they all worked hard together.)

2071
01:30:46,212 --> 01:30:47,212
It's good.

2072
01:30:48,052 --> 01:30:49,522
- It's so good.
- It's good.

2073
01:30:49,522 --> 01:30:51,892
It tastes like the American-style barbecue.

2074
01:30:52,222 --> 01:30:54,151
(It's so good!)

2075
01:30:55,022 --> 01:30:58,831
(They're glad to see You Jung enjoying the meat.)

2076
01:30:58,831 --> 01:31:00,432
You Jung knows how to enjoy the food.

2077
01:31:00,991 --> 01:31:04,462
(Filling her whole mouth)

2078
01:31:05,371 --> 01:31:07,732
- Look at You Jung.
- Thank you so much for enjoying it.

2079
01:31:07,732 --> 01:31:09,602
- She eats so well.
- Indeed.

2080
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:12,241
(Uncle Hee Won is proud of her.)

2081
01:31:12,241 --> 01:31:13,272
Yes.

2082
01:31:13,772 --> 01:31:15,741
It tastes even better because it's thick.

2083
01:31:15,982 --> 01:31:17,182
- Because it's thick?
- Yes.

2084
01:31:17,581 --> 01:31:20,251
(Si Wan who's been worrying the whole time takes a bite too.)

2085
01:31:20,982 --> 01:31:22,352
(Satisfied)

2086
01:31:22,352 --> 01:31:24,151
You should always have it thick.

2087
01:31:24,791 --> 01:31:27,522
It's so nice to see you two eating so well.

2088
01:31:28,661 --> 01:31:30,962
The whole pork belly barbecue was a success.

2089
01:31:31,661 --> 01:31:33,491
Have the whole pork belly barbecue for dessert.

2091
01:31:36,932 --> 01:31:38,071
And fishing.

2092
01:31:38,831 --> 01:31:42,701
And... You're aggravating me again when you're leaving.

2093
01:31:42,701 --> 01:31:45,212
I was about to forget it, but you guys brought it up again.

2094
01:31:45,212 --> 01:31:46,512
(Feeling guilty)

2095
01:31:46,741 --> 01:31:49,111
- Let's take a photo together.
- Oh, right.

2096
01:31:50,382 --> 01:31:51,812
- Good work, everyone.
- Good work.

2097
01:31:51,812 --> 01:31:53,812
The pork belly was really troublesome.

2098
01:31:54,581 --> 01:31:59,291
(Spring has come to House on Wheels with cherry blossoms.)

2099
01:32:00,121 --> 01:32:01,661
(Today's front yard, )

2100

2103
01:32:09,762 --> 01:32:11,932
(She has a bite while feeling the spring breeze.)

2104
01:32:14,071 --> 01:32:15,941
(Exclaiming)

2105
01:32:16,041 --> 01:32:18,541
(Taking a bite)

2106
01:32:18,772 --> 01:32:20,441
(Yoon A eats everything well.)

2107
01:32:20,541 --> 01:32:23,111

(A man with unexpected charms, Kim Byoung Cheol)

2110
01:32:29,982 --> 01:32:33,751
(He grinds coffee beans with his silky hair blowing in the wind.)

2111
01:32:35,092 --> 01:32:36,462
(It smells like grass.)

2112
01:32:37,092 --> 01:32:40,031
(I like it. I like being alone.)

2113
01:32:40,132 --> 01:32:43,001
(A charming smile)

2114
01:32:43,201 --> 01:32:46,831
