1
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,350
(Below the green meadow, )

2
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,950
(there's blue East Sea.)

3
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,719
(Today's front yard is Ocean Hill of Chilpo in Pohang.)

4
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:38,760
(In today's front yard that's paradise-like, )

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,229
(two new guests have come.)

6
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:44,690
I'm not sure.

7
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,300
(Dong Baek and Gyu Tae are back in Pohang.)

8
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:51,170
(Their visit to House on Wheels...)

9
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,600
(is as pleasant as a camellia flower that bloomed in the winter.)

10
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,339
(It begins now.)

11
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,809
(House on Wheels is headed to the new front yard as usual.)

12
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,849
Here we go again.

13
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:11,290
(They're excited as the sky is high and clear.)

14
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,419
- You're not cold, are you? - Not at all. I'm actually hot.

15
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,559
Open the window on your side and get some fresh air.

16
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,000
(He's just having a great time.)

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,330
We're here because of Si Wan.

18
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,599
- Oh, really? - Yes.

19
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,599
I told him that I really want to visit Pohang.

20
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,140
Si Wan said he wants to see Pohang.

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,610
You know the movie I shot with Si Wan, "The Merciless"?

22
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,110
- Yes. - We shot the movie here too.

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,280
The ocean was really beautiful back then.

24
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:37,450
- Is that why you wanted to come? - Yes.

25
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,720
Do you know why I remember that?

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,780
Why?

27
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,750
Because I drove all night to Pohang from Seoul.

28
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:47,519
I didn't even get to get off my car.

29
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,860
I only took a peek from my car,

30
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,659
and they told me to they were done shooting my scene.

31
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:00,069
(Taking a peek)

32
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,509
- I remember that scene. - You only came to Pohang...

33
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,640
- I came all the way for that scene. - for that scene?

34
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,879
(Let's enjoy the ocean as much as we can this time.)

35
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:12,980
(With an excited heart to see the ocean, )

36
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:16,920
(they drive past a grove of pines.)

37
00:02:17,649 --> 00:02:20,420
Wow. Look at the ocean, Dong Il.

38
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:22,190
(Impressed)

39
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,629
(They finally get to see the ocean!)

40
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,429
- Look at the waves crashing! - I know.

41
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:29,769
(The white crashing waves...)

42
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:32,570
Look at those waves. My goodness.

43
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,739
(are intensely welcoming the members.)

44
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,769
It's beautiful. Korea is indeed beautiful.

45
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,209
(As they listen to the waves crashing, )

46
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,510
(they drive along the Haeparang Road of the eastern coast.)

47
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,149
(The beautiful view unfolds between the forest and ocean.)

48
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:50,950
The waves bring the water right to the road.

49
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,489
- I know. - Look at that.

50
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:55,959
(The road where you're closest to the waves)

51
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,390
Wow, it's magnificent.

52
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,330
- My gosh. - Look at those waves.

53
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,360
I know.

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,769
You need to see these waves up close.

55
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:06,399
- This is nice. - Goodness.

56
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:09,640
Actually, when it comes to Pohang,

57
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,709
the steel industry comes to my mind first...

58
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,279
rather than...

59
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,880
- the beautiful ocean. - The steel business.

60
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,080
Yes, that's what comes to my mind first when I think of Pohang.

61
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,480
It's known for the steel industry.

62
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,850
But the ocean is really beautiful.

63
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,760
When you're in mother nature,

64
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,230
you experience awe.

65
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,899
It feels like that. It's breathtaking.

66
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,769
Pohang is known for its crabs.

67
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:39,439
- That's right. - Its famous snow crab.

68
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,469
And there's... It tastes best when it's steamed, right?

69
00:03:41,469 --> 00:03:43,369
Right, it's best to steam them. They get savory.

70
00:03:43,369 --> 00:03:44,769
I'm really curious about them.

71
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:48,640
You know their feet are divided into parts like bamboo.

72
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,010
The Chinese character of "snow crab" is the same as that of "bamboo".

73
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:54,080
- It's my first time hearing it. - Their feet are...

74
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,950
I thought they used the Chinese character for "big" as they're big.

75
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,019
Me too.

76
00:03:58,019 --> 00:03:59,559
Snow crabs...

77
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,130
are crabs that vary in size from 12cm to 15cm.

78
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,760
We're having crabs that are about 12cm to 15cm big.

79
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:10,499
It's illegal to catch young snow crabs.

80
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:11,499
(He even knows the laws?)

81
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,200
If the snow crab shells...

82
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,570
are smaller than 9cm,

83
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,769
you can't catch those.

84
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,439
You need to flip the crab to have the top face bottom.

85
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:23,209
If you let it sit, its juice will fall out.

86
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:24,510
That's why you need to flip them.

87
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,019
There's crab juice in there.

88
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:28,950
You can find crab juice inside the shell.

89
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,989
(He ends up bursting into laughter.)

90
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:32,189
- Did you study up on them? - Of course.

91
00:04:33,619 --> 00:04:35,630
(It's a piece of cake.)

92
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,160
Let's make rice as soon as we get there.

93
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,100
- Let's make rice. - Right, we must do that first.

94
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,369
- Right. We'll make rice. - We need to make rice first.

95
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:44,499
(They drive past a peaceful fishing village by chance.)

96
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:46,239
My, what's that?

97
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,199
They're drying seaweed.

98
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,569
My gosh.

99
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,679
- My goodness, villages... - My gosh.

100
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:54,780
by the sea are really pretty.

101
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,980
It's very quiet and peaceful.

102
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,480
(They look around the peaceful village as they drive.)

103
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,590
Hee Won, do you want to build a house by the sea and live with me?

104
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,389
(Laughing)

105
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,860
Wow, it gets bigger as we get closer to the seashore.

106
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,329
(Is that our spot?)

107
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:17,129
- I think we're here. - We're here.

108
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,139
(Heart fluttering)

109
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:23,610
(Their eyes go wide as soon as they see the place.)

110
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:26,710
This is paradise.

111
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,610
(The ocean view is magnificent.)

112
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,050
(Today's front yard, Ocean Hill of Chilpo in Pohang)

113
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,759
(The vast East Sea comes in sight from the hill.)

114
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,429
(Mount Kunryun becomes a hill behind your house here.)

115
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:47,030
(This place has an abundant amount...)

116
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,600
(of freshly caught seafood.)

117
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:52,340
(It's where Pohang's ocean unfolds before you.)

118
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:56,170
(You can walk with the waves...)

119
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,009
(as you watch the sunrise.)

120
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,610
(Pohang's hidden...)

121
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,420
(paradise on earth)

122
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,389
(Today, we're staying at Ocean Hill of Chilpo.)

123
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:21,883
(They're only a minute away from reaching their front yard.)

124
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:25,722
We're here, but the road...

125
00:06:25,722 --> 00:06:28,383
- Drive gently. - The road is...

126
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:30,022
Be careful.

127
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,662
The ground here is too wet.

128
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,423
Put it in gear one and drive gently.

129
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:36,493
(The car might get stuck in the mud.)

130
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:38,133
The rear tires shouldn't fall into the mud.

131
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,762
- They shouldn't. - You got this!

132
00:06:39,762 --> 00:06:41,162
- It's moving. - They shouldn't fall.

133
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:43,702
- They shouldn't fall. - Please!

134
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:44,972
(Gosh, they fell into the mud.)

135
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:47,902
My goodness. We're in big trouble. Let's see.

136
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:49,873
- They're deep in the mud, right? - Yes, they are.

137
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:51,673
Let's see.

138
00:06:52,582 --> 00:06:54,212
- I see. - They're deep in the mud.

139
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:55,613
We should...

140
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:56,883
(Dong Il checks how deep the tires are in the mud.)

141
00:06:57,113 --> 00:06:58,883
Let's just push the car.

142
00:06:59,282 --> 00:07:01,352
(Push the car?)

143
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:03,753
1, 2, 3!

144
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:04,892
(A mission to save their house that's in deep mud)

145
00:07:05,193 --> 00:07:07,793
(All the staff members are used to save the house.)

146
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:11,693
(Grunting)

147
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,003
It's moving. It's moving.

148
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:17,733
It's moving!

149
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:20,642
Watch where you're driving the car to.

150
00:07:20,642 --> 00:07:22,142
(House on Wheels slowly move out of the mud.)

151
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,243
(He's putting all his efforts in the car as well.)

152
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:27,712
(Frowning)

153
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:32,212
Okay, okay!

154
00:07:32,683 --> 00:07:33,753
We got it!

155
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:40,892
(They're already exhausted.)

156
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:44,793
(Laughing)

157
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:47,303
(This trip is bound to be fun as well.)

158
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:48,363
My gosh.

159
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:50,003
You need to drive it faster.

160
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:52,873
- Step on it. Just step on it. - Okay.

161
00:07:53,402 --> 00:07:55,372
It can only move with that force. Step on it.

162
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:57,813
- I'll keep going then. - Keep stepping on it.

163
00:07:57,813 --> 00:07:59,082
That's enough. Stop.

164
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:00,783
Keep stepping on it.

165
00:08:00,783 --> 00:08:02,382
(They're in the safe zone now.)

166
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,783
- We're here. - My gosh.

167
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,382
Let's go.

168
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:09,553
(They arrive at their front yard after many twists and turns.)

169
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:11,952
(Exclaiming)

170
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:18,332
(They finally look around their front yard.)

171
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:20,933
It's so refreshing.

172
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,163
(The view makes you feel refreshed.)

173
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:23,273
Hee Won.

174
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:27,903
(Across the green meadow, )

175
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,972
(the ocean unfolds before your eyes.)

176
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,683
(Today's front yard)

177
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:36,752
Hee Won.

178
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:39,783
Gosh, it's too cold! Let's get back inside.

179
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,452
(They run into their house as it's too cold.)

180
00:08:42,452 --> 00:08:44,523
Why did you pick this place?

181
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:47,122
Gosh, it's too cold.

182
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:52,702
We haven't had this kind of weather for the past two weeks.

183
00:08:52,702 --> 00:08:54,362
(Slapping)

184
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:59,033
(Let me see.)

185
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,273
The wind is blowing from this direction, right?

186
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:02,472
(Checking the direction of the wind)

187
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:03,913
Yes, it's coming this way.

188
00:09:05,342 --> 00:09:07,082
- Hey. - I think it's blowing from there.

189
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:09,653
Can't we park the car here?

190
00:09:10,982 --> 00:09:13,823
Let's put the house in this direction.

191
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:16,193
- In this way? - Yes, to block the wind.

192
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:19,763
Wouldn't that be better? Don't you think?

193
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:21,063
Let's block the wind this way.

194
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:24,433
- That's beyond my control. - Let's give it a try.

195
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,533
Let's try putting it this way.

196
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:27,232
I want to, but...

197
00:09:27,232 --> 00:09:28,403
Let's try putting it this way.

198
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:30,673
This side will work too. It has a better view.

199
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:35,173
(Driver Kim is working hard as usual.)

200
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:37,173
- In this direction? - That's right.

201
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:41,382
You can come closer.

202
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:42,382
(He's driving with his face.)

203
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:43,952
Keep turning. Keep turning!

204
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:45,952
You can turn more!

205
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,622
(Safely filmed with the permission of a landowner)

206
00:09:47,622 --> 00:09:48,683
Keep turning!

207
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:52,793
Turn some more! Turn more to the right.

208
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,222
(Repositioning the car while flapping his hair)

209
00:09:55,222 --> 00:09:56,263
You can stop there.

210
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,393
Do I stop here?

211
00:09:58,393 --> 00:10:01,563
- It's a lot less windy. - This is the spot.

212
00:10:01,732 --> 00:10:04,173
- Is it okay? - Yes, we got it.

213
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:07,073
Right? It's much better.

214
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,943
- Yes, it's way better. - Come over here!

215
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:09,943
We're getting no wind here.

216
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,773
- It's way better. - It's not windy at all.

217
00:10:13,043 --> 00:10:15,882
(Their hair is much calmer now.)

218
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,722
(Wind rushing through his hair)

219
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:20,722
Come over here.

220
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,293
Come stand here. We're getting no wind here.

221
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:25,452
- It's way less windy. - Come here.

222
00:10:25,452 --> 00:10:26,462
Is it better?

223
00:10:26,563 --> 00:10:28,122
Look. Even the grass isn't moving.

224
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,063
How is it?

225
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:32,533
(Okay.)

226
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:34,163
Like this? Okay.

227
00:10:34,163 --> 00:10:36,403
(He nods reluctantly.)

228
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,403
It's so cold!

229
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,073
Are you still cold? Let's get ready, the guests will be here soon.

230
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,303
Okay. It's so cold.

231
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:42,303
- Si Wan. - Yes.

232
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,073
Heat up the house now.

233
00:10:44,073 --> 00:10:45,673
- Okay. - Heat up the house fast.

234
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:50,283
(Let me see.)

235
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:54,252
(Sliding his hands under the blanket)

236
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:58,023
(I hope it gets warm soon.)

237
00:10:58,622 --> 00:11:01,992
(Meanwhile, Dong Il and Hee Won set up the deck.)

238
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:06,232
We'll get to hear the sound of waves as much as we want.

239
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,263
I know.

240
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:10,472
We'll get to hear the sound of waves...

241
00:11:11,372 --> 00:11:12,643
as much as we want.

242
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:13,773
(The clear sound of waves fills the front yard.)

243
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:16,413
- Let's put one more deck here. - Okay.

244
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:18,943
Since we're at it, let's do it all the way.

245
00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:20,413
- What do you mean? - Let's put three more here.

246
00:11:20,982 --> 00:11:22,013
What? Where?

247
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,153
We can put three decks from here.

248
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:26,382
- Right next to each other? Okay. - Here. 1, 2, and 3.

249
00:11:27,783 --> 00:11:30,222
When we set out our decks,

250
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:32,523
it feels like we've become rich.

251
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:33,693
Oh, really? Then let's put some more.

252
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,992
You're dying to do the labor job.

253
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:38,033
No, that's not it.

254
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:41,063
It was my dream to live in a house with a deck.

255
00:11:42,263 --> 00:11:43,273
(Laughing)

256
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:44,602
It was my dream to live...

257
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:46,202
- in a house with a deck. - Oh, I see.

258
00:11:48,102 --> 00:11:49,342
(Struggling)

259
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,943
Put it down nicely. Come here.

260
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:52,882
- Is it good? - Like this.

261
00:11:52,982 --> 00:11:54,043
- Is it good? - Yes.

262
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:55,043
(Hee Won brought one more deck in the end.)

263
00:11:55,043 --> 00:11:56,053
It's looking good.

264
00:11:56,053 --> 00:11:58,183
(His dream came true.)

265
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:01,183
You're setting the chairs like the ones in theaters.

266
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:02,823
(The chairs are put side by side like the ones in theaters.)

267
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,423
Dong Il, we need to put up the tarp shelter.

268
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,962
- There will be a big difference. - But I'm not sure...

269
00:12:05,962 --> 00:12:08,492
if the tarp shelter will be able to stand against the wind.

270
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:13,403
(Hanging the tarp shelter)

271
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:16,372
Will this remain hanging?

272
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,573
Gosh, the wind is so strong.

273
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:20,602
I think it'll fly away.

274
00:12:21,102 --> 00:12:24,013
- I know. It won't hold out. - It's too...

275
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:25,612
(Struggling)

276
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,143
(It's not easy to even hang it on the hooks.)

277
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:29,582
Don't pull from that side.

278
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,053
- Okay. - He's not pulling. It's the wind.

279
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:37,122
- Gosh, this... This will fly away. - My goodness.

280
00:12:37,793 --> 00:12:39,193
I don't think this will work.

281
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:41,492
Si Wan, hold the edge.

282
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:42,862
Move away.

283
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,632
(Flapping)

284
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,332
The wind is too strong.

285
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:52,472
This is... It might hit your face.

286
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,842
(It might hit your face at this rate.)

287
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:54,842
This is...

288
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:56,372
I don't think this will work.

289
00:12:56,372 --> 00:12:58,472
Look at this! The wind is keeping this afloat!

290
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,382
I don't think this will work. Right?

291
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,783
I can't hold out alone.

292
00:13:05,783 --> 00:13:07,283
- I don't think I can. - Right.

293
00:13:07,283 --> 00:13:10,592
- I don't think I can hold out. - Let go of it.

294
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:12,222
Let go of it.

295
00:13:14,163 --> 00:13:17,962
(Dong Il holds the tarp as though he can handle it.)

296
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:21,702
(Bobbing)

297
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:26,443
(Laughing)

298
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:30,173
(Flapping)

299
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:32,643
It's not me. It's moving on its own.

300
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,653
(Paper doll 1 and 2 flap in the wind.)

301
00:13:38,712 --> 00:13:40,622
I don't think this will work, Dong Il.

302
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:43,092
This is... Let's just put it away.

303
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:45,352
- Right? It won't work. - Let's put it away.

304
00:13:45,352 --> 00:13:46,992
(He quickly gives up.)

305
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:50,632
(They take a break without the tarp shelter.)

306
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:53,862
(Suddenly at peace)

307
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:55,232
This is so nice.

308
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:56,602
(It's nice even without the tarp shelter.)

309
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,832
I think it was a good decision not to hang the tarp.

310
00:13:58,832 --> 00:14:00,972
It was a stroke of genius. What do you think of my decision?

311
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,913
- I agree. - Bravo, Dong Il.

312
00:14:02,913 --> 00:14:04,472
- That was totally... - Seriously.

313
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:05,943
the best and wonderful choice.

314
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:08,913
Look at the wind.

315
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:12,313
Look. It's really pretty.

316
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:18,293
I find it really beautiful when you can see the wind passing.

317
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:19,722
Like the waves.

318
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:20,962
(You can see the wind moving between the grass like the waves.)

319
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:22,693
I think it's really pretty.

320
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,163
When the guests arrive later,

321
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:30,173
let's tell them we picked this place on purpose...

322
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:32,303
to let them feel the spring breeze.

323
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:33,303
Okay.

324
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:35,403
"What's up with the weather?" That's what we're after.

325
00:14:35,872 --> 00:14:38,173
Let's tell them we picked this place on purpose...

326
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:39,643
- Okay. - to let them hear...

327
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:42,082
the sound of the waves and the sound of the wind.

328
00:14:42,443 --> 00:14:43,783
Let's set up a table.

329
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,683
- Goodness. - Let's go. Let's go.

330
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:49,323
I'm worried that the table might be blown away.

331
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,352
(Laughing)

332
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:56,063
Dong Il, why didn't you make this out of marble?

333
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,563
(Struggling)

334
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:01,602
I was going to, but...

335
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:03,903
Why didn't you make it out of marble while you were at it?

336
00:15:04,132 --> 00:15:07,643
Why did you make it out of wood when it's this heavy?

337
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,443
(The table is really heavy.)

338
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,212
Let me help.

339
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:14,513
It suits the house with a deck.

340
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,212
It's heavy indeed, my goodness.

341
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:21,183
- Jung Se. - Yes?

342
00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:22,183
Are you nervous?

343
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:24,693
- I'm not sure. - You seem nervous.

344
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:28,362
Your shoes are new, Jung Se.

345
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:31,092
- Sorry? - I thought you went to the salon.

346
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:32,632
- Didn't you go? - I did.

347
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,663
- You did? - Still, I look shabby.

348
00:15:36,273 --> 00:15:38,872
(The VIP guests will be arriving soon.)

349
00:15:39,132 --> 00:15:42,002
- Let's go in... - Do you want some tea?

350
00:15:42,002 --> 00:15:43,013
That'd be great.

351
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:44,013
(They decide to have some tea while waiting for the guests.)

352
00:15:45,413 --> 00:15:47,342
(Sliding)

353
00:15:47,342 --> 00:15:49,183
If you just open this,

354
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,183
you get a beautiful view.

355
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,382
See? The wind doesn't come in this way.

356
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:55,382
I know.

357
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:57,823
The wind doesn't come in at all.

358
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,992
I know. We can open this window...

359
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,163
- and eat. - Right.

360
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:03,992
It's way better.

361
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:08,362
Our front yard is that ocean? This is amazing.

362
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:12,173
(You can see the blue ocean through the window.)

363
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:13,972
Wow, the view is amazing.

364
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,102
(Holding out his arm)

365
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:16,102
- Dong Il. - Yes?

366
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:17,513
Look at this. If you just...

367
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:20,082
hold out your arm like this, that part gets cold.

368
00:16:20,183 --> 00:16:21,183
Because of the wind?

369
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:22,813
The wind does not come in at all.

370
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,182
Sit down. You need to come sit under the blanket.

371
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:28,453
That'll keep your body warm.

372
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:30,553
- My goodness. - There you go.

373
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:34,362
- It's warm and nice. - My goodness.

374
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:37,293
I'll need to floor my house with flat stones.

375
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:40,203
I know. It's warm and nice.

376
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:43,503
(What's Si Wan up to?)

377
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:46,033
(Rummaging)

378
00:16:48,303 --> 00:16:49,773
(Staring)

379
00:16:50,112 --> 00:16:51,973
- When they arrive, they'll be like, - Dong Il.

380
00:16:51,973 --> 00:16:54,713
"It's so cold out here!" But when they come inside...

381
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:57,053
Dong Il, there's something I couldn't tell you.

382
00:16:57,053 --> 00:16:58,053
What is it?

383
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:01,422
Si Wan just poured...

384
00:17:01,422 --> 00:17:03,122
- water into the coffee filter, - It got torn.

385
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,652
and the filter just fell into the cup.

386
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:08,263
The filter got torn, so I'm brewing it again.

387
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:12,063
(A while ago, when Si Wan was brewing coffee)

388
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:16,273
(Falling)

389
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,073
Oh, no. It got torn.

390
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:20,402
It got torn. What do I do?

391
00:17:20,402 --> 00:17:21,473
(Restless)

392
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:24,313
Why does it get torn?

393
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:27,283
(Clearing his throat)

394
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:31,352
(It was a trick to give tasty coffee coffee to Dong Il and Hee Won.)

395
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:35,283
(And Hee Won burst into laughter after catching that.)

396
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:38,253
So I was pondering whether to tell you this or not.

397
00:17:39,662 --> 00:17:43,092
- Si Wan was like, "What do I do?" - I thought you didn't see me.

398
00:17:43,092 --> 00:17:45,332
I acted really natural on purpose,

399
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,862
- and I even talked to myself. - Then he froze for a while.

400
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:50,303
He then wrapped the filter and threw it away.

401
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,203
I pretended not to have seen it.

402
00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:54,342
And you didn't tell us either.

403
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:55,942
I didn't tell you on purpose.

404
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:59,543
Jin Goo must've done that too. That must be why it took so long.

405
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,642
There's no reason to take so long.

406
00:18:03,713 --> 00:18:07,053
Right? He kept it to himself until now.

407
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:09,793
He could've just thrown away the filter.

408
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,263
Please pretend like you didn't see it.

409
00:18:13,563 --> 00:18:15,493
(Si Wan is adorable.)

410
00:18:16,122 --> 00:18:18,963
(Si Wan is almost done making coffee...)

411
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:21,763
(as though nothing happened.)

412
00:18:22,832 --> 00:18:26,642
(He prepares sword bean tea for Hee Won who doesn't drink coffee.)

413
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:29,473
(I hope it's tasty.)

414
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:34,483
Thanks to Si Wan, we get to enjoy the ocean view...

415
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:37,213
- in Pohang. - It smells so nice.

416
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:39,753
Hee Won, I think it smells really nice.

417
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:44,652
Yes, we're drinking coffee...

418
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:46,963
- in the mugs Doo Na gave us. - The mugs.

419
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:50,033
- Here's your coffee. - Thank you.

420
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:51,563
Thank you for the coffee.

421
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:53,963
Sit down. You worked so hard.

422
00:18:54,963 --> 00:18:56,973
Thanks to you, we get to enjoy coffee.

423
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,203
(Taking a sip)

424
00:19:02,803 --> 00:19:03,872
It's so good.

425
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:05,713
This coffee is delicious, Si Wan.

426
00:19:05,713 --> 00:19:07,743
I like this slightly deep flavor.

427
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:13,553
(They enjoy a relaxed tea time...)

428
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,753
(while gazing at the front yard.)

429
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:16,953
I feel drowsy.

430
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:20,122
This place is... I want to be here with my family.

431
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,463
- If the weather is nice, - Seriously.

432
00:19:22,963 --> 00:19:24,963
- it will be so nice. - It will be great.

433
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:29,563
(The nice view of the front yard that you want to enjoy with family)

434
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:34,442
Gosh. We opened the window, but there's no wind at all.

435
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:36,442
- That's what I'm saying. - Dong Il, I feel like a King.

436
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:39,473
(He likes this place.)

437
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:41,743
Why is he so positive...

438
00:19:41,743 --> 00:19:43,713
and hard-working today?

439
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,213
What's with you?

440
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:46,483
The deck.

441
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:48,422
- It's because of the deck, right? - The deck.

442
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:50,652
- Deck. - I feel generous.

443
00:19:50,652 --> 00:19:52,293
(The deck has made him generous.)

444
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:53,793
The state of my mind...

445
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,092
I became generous.

446
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:57,932
(It's good.)

447
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:59,162
I feel so drowsy.

448
00:19:59,263 --> 00:20:01,503
Dong Il, why don't you call her to ask where she is?

449
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:07,073
Yes, it's me.

450
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:09,043
Yes, aren't you coming?

451
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:10,112
(Dong Il is calling today's guest Hyo Jin.)

452
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:12,912
Oh Jung Se, what are you doing now?

453
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:14,983
Jung Se? What do you mean by that?

454
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:16,553
He hasn't made up his mind yet,

455
00:20:16,553 --> 00:20:18,412
so he's taking a deep breath now. We'll go up there soon.

456
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:20,723
He hasn't made up his mind, so he's taking a deep breath?

457
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:21,953
Right.

458
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:23,523
You know him, don't you?

459
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:27,122
We're almost there, right beneath. We'll go up now.

460
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:29,162
- Okay. Are you bringing some food? - Okay.

461
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:32,463
- I bought some this time too. - Okay. Thank you.

462
00:20:32,463 --> 00:20:33,832
- Yes. - Okay.

463
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:37,973
Hey. Since we have our place,

464
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:41,442
I want to look nice. I'll wear my sunglasses.

465
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:42,543
In a place like this,

466
00:20:44,073 --> 00:20:45,973
I should look nice. Hey, Hee Won.

467
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:47,642
I'll cover myself with a blanket nicely.

468
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:48,942
Don't do that.

469
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:51,713
We should sit outside although it's cold. Endure it.

470
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:53,323
Let's welcome them in style.

471
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:55,553
Jung Se is taking a deep breath now.

472
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:58,053
He's not going down the deep ocean.

473
00:20:58,352 --> 00:21:00,963
Yes, let's step out.

474
00:21:00,963 --> 00:21:02,092
Gosh. It's cold.

475
00:21:03,632 --> 00:21:04,892
Should we wait inside?

476
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:07,033
That's what I'm saying. Why should we look nice?

477
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:09,932
We don't have to look nice.

478
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:13,973
Well. We are at the beach.

479
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,743
I think it's a good manner to greet them outside.

480
00:21:17,412 --> 00:21:19,773
Hey, the wind is stronger than before. The waves too. Look.

481
00:21:20,142 --> 00:21:21,642
The waves really are higher than before.

482
00:21:23,043 --> 00:21:24,253
- This is no joke. - Right.

483
00:21:24,253 --> 00:21:25,483
(The waves are still high.)

484
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,352
Right. Don't show them too much.

485
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,352
- I should look nice. - Let's endure the cold.

486
00:21:32,753 --> 00:21:33,892
Sit over here.

487
00:21:35,392 --> 00:21:36,632
I'll go and look.

488
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:39,063
- Look. See if we look cool. - Okay. I'll take a look.

489
00:21:39,463 --> 00:21:42,203
(Do I look cool?)

490
00:21:42,263 --> 00:21:45,672
Dong Il. No, you shouldn't do that.

491
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:46,942
That's not it.

492
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:48,902
- Your hands are... Put them down. - Okay, like this?

493
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:51,713
- You have the vibe. You have it. - Okay.

494
00:21:51,713 --> 00:21:52,942
(They wait for the guests while being quite stylish.)

495
00:21:53,642 --> 00:21:57,112
Don't you think everyone would want to come to Pohang?

496
00:21:57,112 --> 00:21:58,483
- I guess they couldn't visit again. - That's right.

497
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,223
- I was here two weeks ago. - You said you were here.

498
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:02,422
- With your kids? - Yes.

499
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:03,953
Gosh. It’s my first time since then..

500
00:22:04,553 --> 00:22:06,793
- There... Right next to Camellia... - Yes.

501
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:08,422
- Is there a cafe now? - Yes, there's a cafe now.

502
00:22:08,422 --> 00:22:09,463
Where? The store which had been always vacant?

503
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:10,692
Right next to it. Next to it.

504
00:22:10,692 --> 00:22:11,892
- That store has turned into... - Really?

505
00:22:11,892 --> 00:22:13,233
(Dong Baek and Gyu Tae visited Pohang again.)

506
00:22:15,963 --> 00:22:17,273
("When the Camellia Blooms"...)

507
00:22:17,273 --> 00:22:20,473
(is set in Ongsan, and it was filmed in Pohang.)

508
00:22:20,543 --> 00:22:21,773
This is my area.

509
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:28,082
(Hyo Jin made people cry and laugh as "Dong Baek", the heroine.)

510
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:30,953
(And last summer, )

511
00:22:30,953 --> 00:22:34,723
(she came to House on Wheels...)

512
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:40,192
(and lived with us for a while.)

513
00:22:40,862 --> 00:22:44,432
(They even announced her as an official family member.)

514
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:47,963
(The official family member of House on Wheels, Kong Hyo Jin)

515
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,862
(And with Hyo Jin...)

516
00:22:50,073 --> 00:22:51,172
We are just...

517
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:56,172
(This man is so close with her, just like a sibling.)

518
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,342
(Swearing)

519
00:23:00,442 --> 00:23:04,783
(The master of comedy acting who even makes a villain charming)

520
00:23:05,013 --> 00:23:08,953
(The trending actor who can't be replaced, Oh Jung Se)

521
00:23:09,253 --> 00:23:11,922
(They have come to House on Wheels 2.)

522
00:23:12,152 --> 00:23:14,662
I feel like it's a national holiday,

523
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:16,192
and we're visiting our hometown.

524
00:23:16,192 --> 00:23:17,662
- That's right. - We're bringing so many gifts.

525
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:18,662
(They arrive like relatives who are visiting their hometown.)

526
00:23:19,362 --> 00:23:21,662
Anyway, you just have to trust me. Okay?

527
00:23:21,662 --> 00:23:22,733
I get it.

528
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:25,172
- I just need to follow your words. - Jung Se...

529
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:27,503
Don't try to do every work and be amiable.

530
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:28,902
- Don't do that, okay? This time... - That will never happen.

531
00:23:28,902 --> 00:23:30,672
- I won't be doing any work. - Okay.

532
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:32,473
Do you have to work there?

533
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:34,612
There are tons of work to do. You can't help it...

534
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:37,283
because the two guys there can't work.

535
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,582
(The two guys are waiting for them.)

536
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:42,382
Are these sunglasses too much?

537
00:23:42,652 --> 00:23:43,692
- No, it's not. - No, you look just...

538
00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:44,953
- Is it okay? - Dong Il, you look great now.

539
00:23:44,953 --> 00:23:46,622
- You look perfect with sunglasses. - You look great.

540
00:23:46,922 --> 00:23:49,223
I didn't bring the sunglasses you gave me.

541
00:23:49,223 --> 00:23:50,662
I'm feeling bad about it now.

542
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:52,733
- I may have worn it too. - My goodness.

543
00:23:53,963 --> 00:23:54,963
Si Wan...

544
00:23:55,963 --> 00:23:58,803
Hey. We'll look like Dumb and Dumber if we both wear them.

545
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:00,872
You and I should wear them.

546
00:24:01,243 --> 00:24:02,303
Look.

547
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:04,612
(The youngest goes to see their poses.)

548
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:05,672
Look.

549
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:08,283
(Like this?)

550
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:10,953
Don't rest your chin in your hands. Like this, with your fingers.

551
00:24:10,953 --> 00:24:12,813
Like a photoshoot in a catalog. Like this.

552
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:13,983
Okay.

553
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:16,352
You look like a pro camper.

554
00:24:16,652 --> 00:24:18,692
- Pro camping? - Pro camper.

555
00:24:19,152 --> 00:24:20,493
The one who camps.

556
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:21,963
(While the two who can't work are trying to look nice...)

557
00:24:22,422 --> 00:24:24,832
- The wind blows so strong again. - I know.

558
00:24:24,993 --> 00:24:26,432
(Groan)

559
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,332
- My gosh. Hold on. - The weather is nice.

560
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:32,632
(Tottering)

561
00:24:33,503 --> 00:24:35,342
I see. It's actually a house.

562
00:24:35,872 --> 00:24:38,112
I think the roof has become higher.

563
00:24:39,043 --> 00:24:40,283
Hello.

564
00:24:43,043 --> 00:24:44,852
(Welcome them in style)

565
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:46,682
Welcome!

566
00:24:46,682 --> 00:24:48,953
- Is he Jung Se? - Jung Se must be cold.

567
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:50,723
Jung Se looks so cold.

568
00:24:50,753 --> 00:24:52,493
Welcome, Jung Se.

569
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:54,323
- Hello. - Lovely Hyo Jin.

570
00:24:54,323 --> 00:24:55,392
- Hello. - My goodness.

571
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:58,862
- Hello. - Hello.

572
00:24:58,862 --> 00:25:00,263
- Hello. - Hello.

573
00:25:00,263 --> 00:25:02,733
- Hello. - Hello.

574
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:04,473
- Why did you bring so many? - I prepared these.

575
00:25:04,473 --> 00:25:05,473
- Let's go. - Let's go inside.

576
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:06,773
- Aren't you cold? - These are gifts.

577
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:07,842
- It's warm inside. - I see.

578
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:08,842
Isn't it heavy?

579
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,672
- How have you been? - Dong Il, how have you been?

580
00:25:11,973 --> 00:25:13,112
(Glad)

581
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:14,213
- Hello. - Hello.

582
00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:16,813
- Let's go. - Have you been well? It's so windy.

583
00:25:16,813 --> 00:25:17,882
- I know. - Are you okay?

584
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:19,682
- Get inside quickly. It's cold. - This is...

585
00:25:19,682 --> 00:25:21,053
- Hurry. - Let's go inside quickly.

586
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,523
- The outside is not for us. - Come in. Come.

587
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,723
He said we should wait outside just to look nice.

588
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:29,622
(The precious guests have come to our warm house today.)

589
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,033
(Guests enter the house first.)

590
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,063
Isn't it warm?

591
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:38,973
The inside is... It's warm inside.

592
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:40,703
- How's our house? - My goodness.

593
00:25:40,703 --> 00:25:41,973
Isn't it so warm in here?

594
00:25:42,602 --> 00:25:44,243
- The house is brand new. - It is, right?

595
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:45,513
Isn't it completely different?

596
00:25:45,513 --> 00:25:47,882
- Hee Won, have you been well? - I've been doing great.

597
00:25:48,182 --> 00:25:49,983
Hee Won, how have you been?

598
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:51,412
- It's been so long. - Yes.

599
00:25:51,412 --> 00:25:52,783
Hello, Si Wan.

600
00:25:52,983 --> 00:25:54,382
- Yes. - It's good to see you.

601
00:25:54,382 --> 00:25:56,053
- You've never met Si Wan, right? - Yes.

602
00:25:56,053 --> 00:25:57,223
- Hello. - Hello.

603
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,323
I was in "Hope for Love".

604
00:25:59,323 --> 00:26:00,592
- Yes, right. - I was in it.

605
00:26:00,763 --> 00:26:02,592
- We met just for a while. - Yes.

606
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:03,963
- Sit here. - Sit on the floor. It's warm.

607
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:06,162
- Sit on the floor. - It's burning hot.

608
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:08,263
- My gosh. - Give me the bag.

609
00:26:08,362 --> 00:26:10,172
Should we set the table first?

610
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:13,033
(Where should I sit?)

611
00:26:13,203 --> 00:26:14,803
- Jung Se, come here. - Yes.

612
00:26:14,803 --> 00:26:15,942
Come here.

613
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:18,872
(They let the guests sit on the warm floor first.)

614
00:26:19,313 --> 00:26:21,243
- Hyo Jin. - This room is burning hot.

615
00:26:21,243 --> 00:26:22,243
Sit comfortably.

616
00:26:22,243 --> 00:26:24,783
But it has become really pleasant in some way.

617
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,283
- A lot? Isn't it better? - Hey.

618
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:28,582
- It's not cold even if we open it. - The wind won't come in. It's okay.

619
00:26:28,582 --> 00:26:29,622
- It really is. - Yes.

620
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:31,422
(It's all set.)

621
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:33,152
Sit. Sit, Si Wan.

622
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:35,422
- I bought some stuff. - Good.

623
00:26:35,422 --> 00:26:38,362
- Behind you. - Is this it? Hyo Jin? This one?

624
00:26:38,362 --> 00:26:39,692
This is it? What is it?

625
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,662
I... I was here...

626
00:26:42,832 --> 00:26:46,073
for 4 to 5 months to shoot "When Camellia Blooms".

627
00:26:46,632 --> 00:26:49,142
- Jung Se too. - There are some famous places here.

628
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:51,342
- These are steamed buns. - Hee Won...

629
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:54,182
- You dip it in red bean porridge. - I see.

630
00:26:54,182 --> 00:26:55,213
Awesome!

631
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:56,582
(Dip)

632
00:26:56,783 --> 00:27:01,523
(Dip the steamed buns in sweet red bean porridge.)

633
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:05,352
(It looks delicious.)

634
00:27:05,352 --> 00:27:06,922
- It's delicious. It's good. - My gosh.

635
00:27:06,963 --> 00:27:10,122
This is... It's the gimbap famous in here.

636
00:27:10,122 --> 00:27:12,993
- We always ordered it when filming. - I see.

637
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,763
(Mini gimbap that goes well with the tangy mustard sauce.)

638
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:16,533
Anchovies, ham, tuna...

639
00:27:17,832 --> 00:27:18,932
Gosh. This is really...

640
00:27:18,932 --> 00:27:22,273
(A snack table full of delicacies of Pohang)

641
00:27:22,543 --> 00:27:24,442
Do you have chopsticks and stuff?

642
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:27,442
- Jung Se, didn't you bring them? - Chopsticks.

643
00:27:27,442 --> 00:27:28,813
I brought chopsticks. That...

644
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,882
No need. We have them.

645
00:27:29,912 --> 00:27:31,013
Hyo Jin, take a seat.

646
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:32,783
He brought spoons and chopsticks as a gift.

647
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:34,283
I brought spoons as a gift.

648
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:36,723
- Really? - Should we use them?

649
00:27:36,723 --> 00:27:37,953
- Yes. - All of them?

650
00:27:37,953 --> 00:27:39,652
- Open them up. - Open it up?

651
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,592
Jung Se, is there mine as well?

652
00:27:41,592 --> 00:27:42,763
- No, there isn't yours. - There isn't, right?

653
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:44,892
- I knew that. - Not for you.

654
00:27:44,892 --> 00:27:45,993
This is for you.

655
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:47,263
- Gosh. Really? - Yes.

656
00:27:47,503 --> 00:27:49,233
(Amazed)

657
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:52,602
- The spoon is so... - Isn't it too luxurious?

658
00:27:52,803 --> 00:27:54,473
Why is a spoon so luxurious?

659
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:57,473
- We have to eat to live. - Gosh.

660
00:27:58,142 --> 00:27:59,543
- Hyo Jin. - Yes?

661
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:01,783
- They are in pairs with spoons. - It's a set.

662
00:28:01,783 --> 00:28:02,813
- Right? - Yes.

663
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:04,912
I engraved here, Kim Hee Won.

664
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:06,313
- Really? - Did you?

665
00:28:06,713 --> 00:28:07,922
(A special spoon and chopsticks which have their names engraved)

666
00:28:07,922 --> 00:28:08,953
It's amazing.

667
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:10,953
(KHW, SDI)

668
00:28:10,953 --> 00:28:15,523
(Jung Se's gift with a hope that they eat well and live well.)

669
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:18,192
(My name is carved in it?)

670
00:28:18,493 --> 00:28:20,362
- It's amazing. - You can't see it, Dong Il?

671
00:28:20,362 --> 00:28:21,362
No.

672
00:28:21,563 --> 00:28:22,963
Why didn't you carve mine?

673
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:25,303
He did yours as well, but I can't see mine clearly too.

674
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,372
This is...

675
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,543
- I see. It's in the middle. - Yes, here it is.

676
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:31,043
- Here's Sung Dong Il. - That's right.

677
00:28:31,313 --> 00:28:32,743
SDI. Goodness.

678
00:28:32,743 --> 00:28:34,082
(The elder brothers can recognize them from far.)

679
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,283
But it's hard to use it casually.

680
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:38,983
- Right. Dong Il. - Right?

681
00:28:40,922 --> 00:28:43,023
It's the same. He didn't give me a better one.

682
00:28:43,023 --> 00:28:44,092
(Skeptical)

683
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:46,023
He has doubts. He's so skeptical.

684
00:28:46,023 --> 00:28:47,823
Yours look like silver.

685
00:28:48,523 --> 00:28:51,862
For Si Wan, I brought this instead of silverware.

686
00:28:51,862 --> 00:28:52,963
- Gosh. - Yes.

687
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:54,402
Why is his box bigger?

688
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,763
I...

689
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:58,102
(Curious about it)

690
00:28:58,432 --> 00:28:59,573
(What's the special gift that Jung Se prepared for Si Wan?)

691
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:01,303
Goodness. Dong Il, mine is...

692
00:29:01,642 --> 00:29:03,372
Bring it here.

693
00:29:03,372 --> 00:29:05,213
Mine is amazing.

694
00:29:05,872 --> 00:29:07,182
I was worried that you might not like it.

695
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:09,682
- No way. It's very hard to get. - What's that?

696
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:11,912
- This is... It's a tape. - Gosh.

697
00:29:11,912 --> 00:29:12,983
- A tape. It's a cassette. - It's vintage.

698
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:14,553
- It's a cassette. - How can I play this cassette?

699
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,082
For the tape, I brought this just in case.

700
00:29:16,082 --> 00:29:17,953
- Oh, dear! - In case you didn't have a player.

701
00:29:18,152 --> 00:29:22,392
- Hey. It's the original soundtrack. - Yes.

702
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:24,862
- Can't we listen to it today? - Play it now.

703
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:26,362
It's awesome.

704
00:29:26,563 --> 00:29:29,432
It's been so long since I last saw a tape.

705
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:32,003
I can't use this because I don't want to waste it.

706
00:29:32,273 --> 00:29:35,872
Hyo Jin, look at this. My name is carved here. So pretty.

707
00:29:35,902 --> 00:29:37,743
- That's right. I saw it. - This is yours.

708
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:38,912
- I have one too? - Yes.

709
00:29:38,912 --> 00:29:41,513
(He gives her a gift nonchalantly.)

710
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,942
Hyo Jin has one too.

711
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:44,612
You said there's none for me.

712
00:29:44,612 --> 00:29:46,182
(Laughing)

713
00:29:46,412 --> 00:29:47,852
There really is.

714
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,283
- Hyo Jin, use yours. - HJ.

715
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:53,622
(Why don't we eat with the chopsticks from Jung Se?)

716
00:29:53,622 --> 00:29:55,092
Dong Il, why don't we use these chopsticks?

717
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:56,993
- Yes. Shall we eat? - Shall we?

718
00:29:57,092 --> 00:30:00,192
(Jung Se who gave them gifts doesn't have chopsticks.)

719
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:01,832
Si Wan, you...

720
00:30:01,832 --> 00:30:04,533
(While the guest brings chopsticks by himself...)

721
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:06,332
It's okay. I gave him mine.

722
00:30:08,303 --> 00:30:09,543
Let's eat.

723
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:10,573
(Taking a bite)

724
00:30:10,573 --> 00:30:13,942
Hey, let the guests eat first.

725
00:30:13,942 --> 00:30:15,112
I'm checking if there's poison or not.

726
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:17,182
What poison? Your face is venomous.

727
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,882
(He takes another bite regardless of his scolding.)

728
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,483
(How do you like it?)

729
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:26,323
(Savoring)

730
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:27,592
This is good.

731
00:30:28,922 --> 00:30:32,432
(Steamed buns become even sweeter with sweet red bean porridge.)

732
00:30:33,293 --> 00:30:35,902
(Slathering)

733
00:30:36,162 --> 00:30:38,832
(Taking a bit bite)

734
00:30:40,503 --> 00:30:42,602
(Shaking his hands)

735
00:30:44,842 --> 00:30:46,543
Good. It's delicious.

736
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,852
(Chewing)

737
00:30:50,852 --> 00:30:54,122
Goodness. It's delicious.

738
00:30:54,783 --> 00:30:58,323
- I've been cutting grain lately. - Why?

739
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,892
- You mean you cut carbohydrates? - Yes, I've cut carbohydrates.

740
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:03,422
- Carbohydrates? - To see what happens if I do so.

741
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:06,293
Anyway, it's the first time in a month...

742
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:08,362
to eat grain such as flour.

743
00:31:08,362 --> 00:31:09,533
Also, sugar.

744
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,703
- My goodness. - Isn't it tasty?

745
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:13,473
It's so delicious.

746
00:31:14,402 --> 00:31:15,543
It's so good.

747
00:31:17,513 --> 00:31:20,543
(How can you cut it? It's so delicious.)

748
00:31:22,243 --> 00:31:26,182
(Want to try mini gimbap this time?)

749
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:29,283
(Carbohydrates)

750
00:31:29,523 --> 00:31:31,352
(More carbohydrates)

751
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:35,392
(Rush of carbohydrates set free in a month)

752
00:31:35,823 --> 00:31:37,892
It's delicious. Gimbap is good too.

753
00:31:37,892 --> 00:31:39,432
Hyo Jin likes to eat gimbap.

754
00:31:39,432 --> 00:31:40,632
- Last time... - She also brought gimbap last time.

755
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,402
- Last time too. In Jeju Island. - Right.

756
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:43,662
She brought gimbap.

757
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:46,632
She particularly likes steamed rice.

758
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,243
(Admiring)

759
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:51,313
His English is fatal.

760
00:31:52,612 --> 00:31:54,543
Isn't it a little late, Dong Il?

761
00:31:54,983 --> 00:31:56,682
Your English is a bit fatal.

762
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:58,082
(Laughing)

763
00:31:59,053 --> 00:32:04,323
(All the family members dig into steamed rice.)

764
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,993
- It is delicious, isn't it? - It's really delicious.

765
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:08,622
- It's so delicious. - Yes.

766
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:11,932
- This gimbap is so delicious. - It's delicious, right?

767
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:15,132
Yes, this is very unique.

768
00:32:15,132 --> 00:32:16,432
This is...

769
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:19,372
I ordered it when I had a shooting in the morning.

770
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:21,872
If I got hungry, I ate it.

771
00:32:21,872 --> 00:32:23,402
Is it only in Pohang?

772
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:25,713
Yes, they are famous restaurants in Pohang.

773
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,112
We know a lot of good restaurants in Pohang. Right, Jung Se?

774
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,283
Yes, I've never had it before.

775
00:32:29,582 --> 00:32:31,882
(Laughing)

776
00:32:31,953 --> 00:32:33,313
I was here for six months.

777
00:32:33,313 --> 00:32:35,253
He was here for six months, but it's the first time he tries it.

778
00:32:36,152 --> 00:32:38,652
What did you film here in Pohang?

779
00:32:38,793 --> 00:32:40,323
- "When the Camellia Blooms." - Camellia.

780
00:32:40,323 --> 00:32:41,793
- For five months. - Was it filmed in Pohang all along?

781
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,692
- Yes. - The outside and the marketplace.

782
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,303
I truly enjoyed watching "When the Camellia Blooms".

783
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:50,432
- Did you enjoy it? - Yes, I liked it.

784
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,632
The drama was really popular.

785
00:32:52,632 --> 00:32:54,803
- Yes. - Camellia. It was a sensation.

786
00:32:54,803 --> 00:32:57,713
There were so many crying scenes.

787
00:32:58,442 --> 00:33:00,112
Didn't you cry a lot, Jung Se?

788
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:01,483
- Me? - Yes.

789
00:33:01,483 --> 00:33:03,882
(Weeping)

790
00:33:04,112 --> 00:33:06,882
(Why are you crying now?)

791
00:33:06,983 --> 00:33:08,882
(He eats gimbap fully dipped in mustard sauce.)

792
00:33:08,882 --> 00:33:11,823
(His nose is burning.)

793
00:33:12,152 --> 00:33:14,122
- What's wrong? - Hee Won. Try this.

794
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,293
(Rubbing the bridge of the nose)

795
00:33:17,332 --> 00:33:18,632
It's effective.

796
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:20,162
- Really? - My gosh.

797
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:21,963
Who said it's not spicy?

798
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:25,602
- Try to make this sound. - Did you eat this?

799
00:33:25,872 --> 00:33:27,642
I dipped in it because someone said it's not spicy.

800
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:28,902
(The tangy flavor of mustard tickles the nose when you're off the guard.)

801
00:33:29,402 --> 00:33:31,643
Gosh. It's hot.

802
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:32,942
(It's hot.)

803
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:36,913
(He keeps eating in the midst of this.)

804
00:33:37,112 --> 00:33:38,353
(Glancing)

805
00:33:38,553 --> 00:33:40,553
- It's so... - Jung Se, are you okay?

806
00:33:42,123 --> 00:33:43,723
- Jung Se is... - What?

807
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:45,792
I've seen Jung Se several times,

808
00:33:46,353 --> 00:33:49,192
but I've never seen him dressed neatly like this.

809
00:33:50,123 --> 00:33:52,993
(Focusing on him)

810
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:56,402
(Feeling nervous)

811
00:33:57,873 --> 00:34:00,303
These days, he cares about his style.

812
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:01,473
Totally, yes.

813
00:34:04,073 --> 00:34:05,842
(Glancing)

814
00:34:06,442 --> 00:34:07,612
He's speechless.

815
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:09,342
Why? What's up?

816
00:34:09,513 --> 00:34:11,382
(He finds Jung Se so funny.)

817
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,683
- It's because he's so funny. - To see him wearing like that?

818
00:34:13,683 --> 00:34:14,823
No, it's not that.

819
00:34:14,823 --> 00:34:16,982
When she told us he was collecting his thoughts,

820
00:34:17,183 --> 00:34:18,493
I was skeptical.

821
00:34:18,553 --> 00:34:22,192
A little. He was always at ease...

822
00:34:22,192 --> 00:34:23,893
when I met him.

823
00:34:23,893 --> 00:34:25,062
Didn't you know?

824
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:27,362
When we were filming a drama, he was having fun with us,

825
00:34:27,362 --> 00:34:29,433
but when the making camera approached, he suddenly froze.

826
00:34:30,103 --> 00:34:32,502
He won't speak. Jung Se, say something.

827
00:34:32,933 --> 00:34:34,603
When I heard he was coming today,

828
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:37,042
I wondered if it was a good idea.

829
00:34:37,712 --> 00:34:38,712
(Sighing)

830
00:34:43,643 --> 00:34:44,652
(Sighing)

831
00:34:46,112 --> 00:34:48,522
(Here's a camera.)

832
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:51,252
(There's a camera too.)

833
00:34:51,553 --> 00:34:53,692
(Even on the ceiling)

834
00:34:53,893 --> 00:34:57,362
(Being shy with cameras)

835
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:03,402
(He keeps swaying his body as if he's feeling uncomfortable.)

836
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:05,873
(Swaying back and forth)

837
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:08,402
(Swaying sideways)

838
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,942
(He expresses his shyness with his whole body.)

839
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,913
(When Hee Won ate tangy mustard, )

840
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:17,243
(he glances at her secret method.)

841
00:35:17,712 --> 00:35:20,752
(Rubbing his nose quietly)

842
00:35:23,223 --> 00:35:26,092
(As careful as not to be caught)

843
00:35:26,223 --> 00:35:28,792
(But Hyo Jin is always next to Jung Se.)

844
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,732
(You only have to trust me.)

845
00:35:30,732 --> 00:35:33,132
(Okay, I will.)

846
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:35,833
(She offers him coffee.)

847
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:39,073
(She takes care of his chopsticks.)

848
00:35:39,672 --> 00:35:42,073
(Jung Se, you've got something on your mouth.)

849
00:35:42,272 --> 00:35:45,212
(She takes good care of her clumsy older brother.)

850
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,783
(Patting)

851
00:35:48,243 --> 00:35:49,743
(Chuckles)

852
00:35:50,212 --> 00:35:51,382
Say something.

853
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,513
(Laughing nervously)

854
00:35:52,553 --> 00:35:54,953
When I brought him here today, I told him to trust me.

855
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,252
- Jung Se, come closer. - Yes.

856
00:35:56,683 --> 00:35:58,522
It's usually cold at the corner of the electric pad.

857
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:00,652
(Groping)

858
00:36:00,652 --> 00:36:02,263
I've been sitting in the cold spot.

859
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:03,422
Right.

860
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:04,993
(Sloppy)

861
00:36:04,993 --> 00:36:06,592
We're filming "Mount Jiri" together.

862
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:07,902
- Yes, right. - Yes.

863
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:11,402
Jun Ji Hyun keeps making mistakes because he's being funny.

864
00:36:12,232 --> 00:36:13,973
- I see. - She laughs because of him.

865
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:15,042
Is that true?

866
00:36:15,402 --> 00:36:17,303
When I'm filming. When I'm acting.

867
00:36:17,303 --> 00:36:19,143
He's good with people,

868
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,212
- but not with cameras. - He feels nervous.

869
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,553
I can't get used to cameras. Even when I'm acting.

870
00:36:24,853 --> 00:36:26,612
- Even when you're acting? - Yes.

871
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:29,283
- But you're such a good actor. - Right.

872
00:36:29,382 --> 00:36:35,292
I've always seen him being funny, nice, and comfortable.

873
00:36:35,422 --> 00:36:36,922
I've never heard of it before.

874
00:36:38,033 --> 00:36:39,333
He can't say a word.

875
00:36:39,393 --> 00:36:41,002
(He just smiles.)

876
00:36:41,002 --> 00:36:42,803
Jung Se, what would you like to eat?

877
00:36:43,132 --> 00:36:46,033
What's your favorite food? Personally?

878
00:36:46,033 --> 00:36:48,643
I don't have a sensitive palate.

879
00:36:48,643 --> 00:36:51,312
I just eat when there's food. If not, I don't eat.

880
00:36:51,312 --> 00:36:52,942
(Feeling sorry for him)

881
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:55,382
That's not okay. This evening...

882
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,212
Later, we'll go grocery shopping.

883
00:36:57,453 --> 00:36:58,853
I'll get pakdal snow crab.

884
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:02,252
I'll make you kick your legs with joy while eating it.

885
00:37:02,752 --> 00:37:04,022
Then I won't eat this.

886
00:37:05,853 --> 00:37:08,623
I've ordered eight extra-large crabs.

887
00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:10,362
- Eight crabs? - Yes, extra-large ones.

888
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:12,263
- Pakdal snow crab? - Yes, pakdal snow crab.

889
00:37:12,393 --> 00:37:13,493
Extra large.

890
00:37:13,592 --> 00:37:15,402
- Do you like gwamegi? - Yes.

891
00:37:15,632 --> 00:37:17,473
- Do you like gwamegi too? - Yes.

892
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:19,803
I've also ordered gwamegi. It will be delivered.

893
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:21,002
Delivery? Here?

894
00:37:21,002 --> 00:37:22,743
We should steam crabs here.

895
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,473
We can steam it. It's simple.

896
00:37:24,473 --> 00:37:26,112
- Really? - We can steam it in a steamer.

897
00:37:26,112 --> 00:37:27,513
It'll be steamed quickly.

898
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,882
It won't take long to steam snow crabs.

899
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:32,013
Can you eat a large snow crab by yourself?

900
00:37:32,013 --> 00:37:33,652
- Sure, I can. - Are you sure?

901
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:34,953
- Of course. - By yourself?

902
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:36,723
But a crab has eight legs.

903
00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:38,192
Crab legs are this big.

904
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:40,353
- Pakdal snow crab. - No, it's this big.

905
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:43,962
From what I know, pakdal snow crabs aren't that thick.

906
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:45,592
How much can you eat?

907
00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:48,103
I can't eat a lot.

908
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:51,902
You're not feeling comfortable because of the cameras right now.

909
00:37:52,172 --> 00:37:53,333
I'm comfortable,

910
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:57,243
but this body is not.

911
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,743
I have another gift for you.

912
00:37:59,743 --> 00:38:00,772
- Really? - Really?

913
00:38:00,772 --> 00:38:01,783
- I guess Si Wan will use it... - Yes, right.

914
00:38:01,783 --> 00:38:03,542
- the most often. - We need this.

915
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:05,712
- It's my gift. - That's right.

916
00:38:06,913 --> 00:38:08,922
- I'll use it a lot. - Gosh.

917
00:38:08,922 --> 00:38:10,482
"From Kong Hyo Jin."

918
00:38:11,223 --> 00:38:12,493
This is mine.

919
00:38:13,953 --> 00:38:15,862
You can use it inside the house.

920
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:19,192
You two don't clean the house, so Si Wan...

921
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:21,803
When we open the window, the wind blows all the dust away.

922
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:25,172
That's why we made this house such an open place.

923
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:27,033
- This part has become bigger. - Yes.

924
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:29,772
We couldn't sit around here then. It was so cramped.

925
00:38:29,772 --> 00:38:32,373
The bathroom wasn't here. It was over there.

926
00:38:32,373 --> 00:38:33,942
- That's right. - The kitchen was next to it.

927
00:38:33,942 --> 00:38:35,283
Yes, it was a small kitchen.

928
00:38:35,283 --> 00:38:37,212
(He keeps finding it interesting.)

929
00:38:37,212 --> 00:38:39,812
Jung Se, why isn't this player working?

930
00:38:39,812 --> 00:38:41,323
It's because it's broken.

931
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,522
(He may be shy, but he can't give up on a lame joke.)

932
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,022
- Is it broken? - Did you bring a broken one?

933
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,123
- Did you give him a broken one? - Right.

934
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:48,763
It's my heart that matters.

935
00:38:48,763 --> 00:38:50,862
- Hey, your heart is important. - I'll fix it and use it.

936
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,163
Why? Isn't it working?

937
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,533
Gosh. Give it to me.

938
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:55,333
Just leave it there as a decoration.

939
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:56,462
It is...

940
00:38:56,462 --> 00:38:58,373
- Is it from Jung Se? - Yes, Jung Se...

941
00:38:59,632 --> 00:39:01,502
(It's easy for Dong Il.)

942
00:39:01,502 --> 00:39:02,502
It works!

943
00:39:02,502 --> 00:39:04,712
(Little dance)

944
00:39:04,712 --> 00:39:05,712
It works?

945
00:39:06,172 --> 00:39:09,312
- You should set it on tape, but... - I see.

946
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,413
The oldest is the smartest.

947
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:14,623
Only people around your age can figure that old machine out.

948
00:39:14,623 --> 00:39:16,283
When you've never seen it before, it's hard to figure out.

949
00:39:16,283 --> 00:39:17,382
(Eyes in swearing)

950
00:39:17,382 --> 00:39:19,022
I know that machine as well.

951
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:21,522
But, cassette players are not around these days.

952
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:23,763
- Since there is no... - It's cassette tape...

953
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:26,893
Dong Il, what's the music?

954
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,763
- What is it? - Has the tape been worn out?

955
00:39:30,163 --> 00:39:31,933
Jung Se, what did you say?

956
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:33,172
- What? - He thinks the tape is worn out.

957
00:39:33,172 --> 00:39:34,172
Isn't the music weird?

958
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:36,172
What kind of music is that?

959
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:37,873
I got it at Sewoon Plaza.

960
00:39:38,373 --> 00:39:39,413
Sewoon Plaza?

961
00:39:39,413 --> 00:39:42,042
(Laughing hard)

962
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,652
It sounds like Indian music.

963
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:46,513
Jung Se, what music is it?

964
00:39:46,982 --> 00:39:48,152
- Jung Se. - Yes.

965
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,522
It's cold here. Move to the other side.

966
00:39:49,522 --> 00:39:51,223
- I'm okay now. - No, just get in there.

967
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,453
Even your hood is cold. Get in.

968
00:39:53,453 --> 00:39:55,522
Sit next to Hyo Jin where it's warmer.

969
00:39:55,522 --> 00:39:56,522
(The guest is now in a warmer spot.)

970
00:39:56,522 --> 00:40:00,362
Jung Se, you know... It's also an electric blanket.

971
00:40:00,933 --> 00:40:03,402
- An electric blanket? - Yes. We take good care of guests.

972
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:05,803
Check this out. Don't you feel warm on your knees?

973
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:06,803
It is warm.

974
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:09,973
Are we all able to sleep here?

975
00:40:09,973 --> 00:40:11,342
Let's play the rock-paper-scissors game.

976
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,013
Are any of us supposed to sleep in the tent?

977
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:15,143
- That would work. - Sleep outside?

978
00:40:15,143 --> 00:40:18,152
- Are you sleeping in the tent? - I can do that.

979
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:20,353
Are you sleeping in the tent?

980
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:22,783
(Shaking his head)

981
00:40:22,783 --> 00:40:23,853
Aren't we all sleeping in here?

982
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:25,092
We can all sleep here.

983
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:27,922
1 over there, 2 right here,

984
00:40:27,922 --> 00:40:29,462
one there, and here.

985
00:40:30,422 --> 00:40:32,163
It's good enough for five.

986
00:40:32,692 --> 00:40:34,433
Jung Se, have you camped before?

987
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:35,902
- No. - Never?

988
00:40:35,902 --> 00:40:37,833
- No. - Have you slept in a tent?

989
00:40:38,672 --> 00:40:40,073
In a tent... No, I haven't.

990
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:41,073
Do you want to try tonight?

991
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:43,172
It feels good.

992
00:40:45,812 --> 00:40:46,812
I'm okay.

993
00:40:46,973 --> 00:40:49,183
We're not joking. It does feel good.

994
00:40:49,183 --> 00:40:50,542
- Is that so? - Seriously.

995
00:40:50,542 --> 00:40:52,083
(Should I believe it or not?)

996
00:40:53,252 --> 00:40:54,853
Today is very good.

997
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,453
It feels very relaxing.

998
00:40:57,453 --> 00:40:58,823
Si Wan, isn't it? It's good.

999
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,493
- It feels like real camping. - Oh, my...

1000
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:03,362
The wave is rough today.

1001
00:41:03,362 --> 00:41:04,893
Isn't it somewhat gentle?

1002
00:41:04,893 --> 00:41:06,993
Maybe it's because we're seeing it from here.

1003
00:41:08,462 --> 00:41:12,172
(The strong wind never stops.)

1004
00:41:12,772 --> 00:41:16,573
(The wave is very rough.)

1005
00:41:16,902 --> 00:41:19,172
It would be nice to own a house near an ocean like this.

1006
00:41:19,172 --> 00:41:20,672
It's a nice view to have at home.

1007
00:41:21,743 --> 00:41:22,842
It's time to go!

1008
00:41:23,842 --> 00:41:25,652
Someone needs to stay though.

1009
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:27,482
Whoever stays here...

1010
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:30,982
needs to prepare to steam crabs.

1011
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:33,152
You need to go as you're the driver.

1012
00:41:33,553 --> 00:41:35,263
- You are going. - I am.

1013
00:41:35,723 --> 00:41:37,933
Si Wan, you can also go. I will stay.

1014
00:41:37,933 --> 00:41:41,033
- What are you doing alone here? - I will prepare to cook.

1015
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:42,402
- Jung Se, you stay with me. - Okay.

1016
00:41:42,402 --> 00:41:43,833
You three go together.

1017
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:46,433
Buy enough of the crabs.

1018
00:41:48,203 --> 00:41:50,743
- Then, get some rest here. - Okay.

1019
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,873
Are you doing anything special without us?

1020
00:41:52,873 --> 00:41:54,312
No, not at all.

1021
00:41:56,143 --> 00:41:57,853
(Let's go to the market.)

1022
00:41:57,853 --> 00:41:59,553
It's been a while since I had pakdal snow crabs.

1023
00:42:00,283 --> 00:42:02,882
It's been a while to have pakdal snow crabs.

1024
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:06,623
I will make a list of what to buy.

1025
00:42:08,263 --> 00:42:10,062
What are we having for breakfast tomorrow?

1026
00:42:10,493 --> 00:42:11,592
- Tomorrow? - Yes.

1027
00:42:11,993 --> 00:42:14,333
Either crab ramyeon or crab stew.

1028
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,333
- That sounds good. - Because there must be...

1029
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,632
leftovers when we eat crabs today.

1030
00:42:17,632 --> 00:42:19,933
- Since we're buying eight of them. - I like that.

1031
00:42:19,933 --> 00:42:22,643
To cook crab stew, we need radish.

1032
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,712
- Radish? We're getting it. - That's good.

1033
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:28,283
Aren't they all we need, crab and radish?

1034
00:42:28,283 --> 00:42:29,842
Adding gochujang and doenjang, right?

1035
00:42:30,342 --> 00:42:32,752
- We have homemade doenjang. - I think so.

1036
00:42:32,752 --> 00:42:34,553
We also have gochujang. We have everything.

1037
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:36,453
Sounds good.

1038
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:40,252
(It's easier than I thought.)

1039
00:42:40,252 --> 00:42:41,723
Okay. We have enough even for breakfast.

1040
00:42:41,723 --> 00:42:42,792
We're good.

1041
00:42:44,192 --> 00:42:47,803
(Worrisome grocery shopping without Dong Il)

1042
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:49,833
(Driving for 30 minutes passing the ocean)

1043
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:52,373
We have the ocean right in the front.

1044
00:42:52,373 --> 00:42:53,873
It's amazing here.

1045
00:42:54,303 --> 00:42:55,672
It's got the ocean all around.

1046
00:42:55,672 --> 00:42:57,442
(The biggest market on the east coast)

1047
00:42:58,013 --> 00:43:01,643
(Endless overwhelming size)

1048
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:05,252
(Rare food Ingredients)

1049
00:43:05,712 --> 00:43:09,152
(A big warehouse and HUB terminal for seafood)

1050
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:12,922
(From fresh pakdal snow crabs...)

1051
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:17,123
(to Pohang's specialty like gwamegi)

1052
00:43:17,123 --> 00:43:20,132
(Full of various food ingredients)

1053
00:43:21,163 --> 00:43:24,062
(A treasure house of delicious food, )

1054
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:25,873
(It's Jukdo Market with 50 years of history.)

1055
00:43:25,873 --> 00:43:27,732
Dong Il said...

1056
00:43:28,342 --> 00:43:30,643
- he preordered it... - Yes.

1057
00:43:31,073 --> 00:43:33,342
- at a crab restaurant. - I see.

1058
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,342
It must be here. Right?

1059
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:39,053
- Hello. - Hello.

1060
00:43:39,152 --> 00:43:40,152
Hello.

1061
00:43:40,152 --> 00:43:42,522
- What was it? - It's pakdal snow crab.

1062
00:43:43,623 --> 00:43:45,353
It's written over there, pakdal snow crab.

1063
00:43:46,092 --> 00:43:47,493
What is pakdal snow crab?

1064
00:43:47,493 --> 00:43:48,962
(Curious)

1065
00:43:49,522 --> 00:43:51,862
(Finally facing the magnificent figure)

1066
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:53,163
(My goodness)

1067
00:43:54,292 --> 00:43:56,002
It's bigger than I thought.

1068
00:43:56,362 --> 00:43:59,873
It indeed is big. It's huge.

1069
00:43:59,873 --> 00:44:03,502
It's recognized pakdal snow crab by Pohang Suhyup.

1070
00:44:03,502 --> 00:44:04,573
- It's got the armband. - Yes.

1071
00:44:04,573 --> 00:44:06,342
(An armband is a mark.)

1072
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:07,612
It's the best snow crab.

1073
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:08,643
(It's the real top.)

1074
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:11,583
Are we buying eight of them?

1075
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:13,013
(That's right.)

1076
00:44:13,252 --> 00:44:15,752
Is 8 good for 4 people?

1077
00:44:15,752 --> 00:44:17,583
It's more than enough.

1078
00:44:17,723 --> 00:44:19,422
Then, should we go down to six?

1079
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:23,192
- 1 is... - How about 6?

1080
00:44:23,192 --> 00:44:25,062
Should we go with six?

1081
00:44:27,763 --> 00:44:30,103
It's about 1kg per person.

1082
00:44:31,062 --> 00:44:32,103
How heavy is that one?

1083
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:34,272
- It's about 1.23kg. - I see.

1084
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:36,672
(What should we do?)

1085
00:44:37,103 --> 00:44:39,073
(Indecisive eyes)

1086
00:44:39,712 --> 00:44:41,073
(He feels pressured.)

1087
00:44:41,073 --> 00:44:45,453
Dong Il said that he preordered for eight.

1088
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:48,053
I'd like to get eight.

1089
00:44:49,123 --> 00:44:51,823
One per person would be enough.

1090
00:44:53,053 --> 00:44:55,893
If you say so, 5, 6...

1091
00:44:56,092 --> 00:44:57,763
You said you want one for yourself.

1092
00:44:58,333 --> 00:45:02,002
I do. You said that you'd want just three legs.

1093
00:45:02,002 --> 00:45:03,333
Yes, I did.

1094
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,502
(I said so.)

1095
00:45:04,873 --> 00:45:08,473
If we eat 1 per person, we need 5.

1096
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:10,473
Adding it in ramyeon would make it seven.

1097
00:45:10,473 --> 00:45:12,772
Six would do even if adding it in ramyeon.

1098
00:45:12,772 --> 00:45:13,772
- Is it enough? - Yes.

1099
00:45:15,183 --> 00:45:18,913
What's this? This must be snow crab as well.

1100
00:45:18,913 --> 00:45:21,453
Look at this. It's moving.

1101
00:45:21,723 --> 00:45:23,553
Oh, my... They are having a fight.

1102
00:45:23,953 --> 00:45:25,853
They really grabbed each other.

1103
00:45:26,053 --> 00:45:28,223
They seem very...

1104
00:45:28,422 --> 00:45:30,323
Honestly, eight seems too much.

1105
00:45:30,862 --> 00:45:33,792
- Right? 6 crabs? - 6 is more than 1 per person.

1106
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,973
This one... Oh, look at that.

1107
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:40,203
(Snow crab war)

1108
00:45:40,272 --> 00:45:42,703
Eight would be...

1109
00:45:42,703 --> 00:45:44,603
Even six would be enough.

1110
00:45:44,603 --> 00:45:46,612
Don't we have gwamegi as well?

1111
00:45:46,612 --> 00:45:47,982
Gwamegi is getting delivered to us.

1112
00:45:47,982 --> 00:45:49,942
That's what I'm saying. Let's just get five.

1113
00:45:50,812 --> 00:45:52,453
We are taking five.

1114
00:45:52,453 --> 00:45:53,683
- You want 5? - Yes, 5.

1115
00:45:53,683 --> 00:45:56,183
Pick good ones. Wasting food is no good.

1116
00:45:56,183 --> 00:45:57,223
(Would it be okay?)

1117
00:45:57,223 --> 00:45:59,792
- That's right. - Let's get this next time.

1118
00:45:59,792 --> 00:46:01,893
(Cute)

1119
00:46:03,022 --> 00:46:04,562
Do you have sashimi?

1120
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:06,263
We have all kinds of seafood.

1121
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,703
Is that so? You like sashimi.

1122
00:46:09,562 --> 00:46:10,703
(Glancing)

1123
00:46:10,703 --> 00:46:12,632
- I don't know about sashimi. - No, you don't.

1124
00:46:12,632 --> 00:46:14,303
What's good for sashimi these days?

1125
00:46:14,303 --> 00:46:17,143
For sashimi, if you like it with bones,

1126
00:46:17,143 --> 00:46:18,542
flatfish would be good.

1127
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,612
Pohang is known for flatfish.

1128
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,013
- You said it's got the bones. - Yes.

1129
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:24,312
How am I supposed to eat with bones?

1130
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:25,853
You just chew it.

1131
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:27,583
- Even the bones? - There are people who like that.

1132
00:46:28,183 --> 00:46:29,252
He's got a child-like taste.

1133
00:46:29,252 --> 00:46:30,882
- He doesn't know a thing. - True.

1134
00:46:30,882 --> 00:46:32,353
Do you eat it with bones?

1135
00:46:34,353 --> 00:46:36,422
I'm not that fancy in taste.

1136
00:46:37,022 --> 00:46:39,062
- I'm also child-like... - I eat just...

1137
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,062
plaice and rockfish.

1138
00:46:40,062 --> 00:46:41,562
- Do you have rockfish? - Yes.

1139
00:46:42,402 --> 00:46:43,763
- I'm also... - We will get rockfish.

1140
00:46:43,763 --> 00:46:45,002
- Rockfish? - Rockfish.

1141
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,873
- With rockfish... - It's chewy.

1142
00:46:46,873 --> 00:46:49,243
- Rockfish is... - Chewy...

1143
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,243
Okay. Let us get rockfish.

1144
00:46:51,243 --> 00:46:52,473
(Polite)

1145
00:46:52,573 --> 00:46:54,373
- It's over 1kg for 3. - Yes.

1146
00:46:54,373 --> 00:46:55,743
- I'll charge it for 1kg. - Okay.

1147
00:46:56,712 --> 00:47:00,212
Si Wan, didn't you say that we need to get something?

1148
00:47:00,212 --> 00:47:02,123
Don't you have the list?

1149
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,823
(Si Wan is checking the list.)

1150
00:47:05,553 --> 00:47:07,053
- Zucchini. - Zucchini.

1151
00:47:07,053 --> 00:47:08,792
- Onion. - Onion.

1152
00:47:09,062 --> 00:47:10,092
Radish.

1153
00:47:10,792 --> 00:47:12,592
- Zucchini, onion, and radish? - Yes.

1154
00:47:13,993 --> 00:47:16,333
- We need to go to a vegetable shop. - Yes, we do.

1155
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:18,373
Zucchini, onion, and radish.

1156
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:21,333
There are vegetables.

1157
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:24,172
- Hello. - Zucchini is here.

1158
00:47:24,172 --> 00:47:26,842
- I see that. - Zucchini, radish, and onion.

1159
00:47:28,112 --> 00:47:29,643
Zucchini, radish, and onion.

1160
00:47:30,382 --> 00:47:32,752
(I shouldn't forget that.)

1161
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:34,312
I got radish.

1162
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:36,152
Zucchini. I will take two.

1163
00:47:36,152 --> 00:47:37,283
We got zucchini.

1164
00:47:38,092 --> 00:47:40,723
- What's next? - The next is... Onion.

1165
00:47:40,853 --> 00:47:41,893
We got onions.

1166
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:43,823
Onion is here.

1167
00:47:44,893 --> 00:47:46,562
What's next? Are we done?

1168
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:48,962
Don't we have something else?

1169
00:47:48,962 --> 00:47:49,962
(There must be something else.)

1170
00:47:49,962 --> 00:47:52,172
Zucchini, radish, and onion...

1171
00:47:53,033 --> 00:47:56,603
(It seems all.)

1172
00:47:57,842 --> 00:47:58,842
Are we done?

1173
00:47:58,973 --> 00:48:00,212
It seems so.

1174
00:48:00,212 --> 00:48:02,842
(It's very little compared to other time.)

1175
00:48:03,743 --> 00:48:06,183
It's time to get snacks.

1176
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:10,583
(Something feels missing.)

1177
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:16,792
We can get snacks later.

1178
00:48:16,993 --> 00:48:17,993
And...

1179
00:48:19,962 --> 00:48:21,333
That looks so delicious.

1180
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,333
(Snacks are passing right next to them.)

1181
00:48:22,902 --> 00:48:25,232
(Staring)

1182
00:48:25,232 --> 00:48:26,433
Should we get tangerine?

1183
00:48:27,703 --> 00:48:30,143
Tangerine goes well with the electric blanket.

1184
00:48:30,143 --> 00:48:32,672
Is tangerine in season?

1185
00:48:33,743 --> 00:48:35,013
Look at the red orange.

1186
00:48:35,183 --> 00:48:37,013
That's red orange. Hello, sir.

1187
00:48:37,942 --> 00:48:40,013
This one seems sweet, right?

1188
00:48:40,013 --> 00:48:41,252
Can we try it?

1189
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:42,723
(Touching)

1190
00:48:42,823 --> 00:48:44,083
Is it delicious?

1191
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:46,223
(Si Wan can't stop looking at it.)

1192
00:48:46,393 --> 00:48:47,723
Don't they look delicious?

1193
00:48:47,723 --> 00:48:50,062
(Should we get it or not?)

1194
00:48:50,263 --> 00:48:51,732
Let's get this as well.

1195
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:53,732
- Okay. Just get it. - Okay.

1196
00:48:53,732 --> 00:48:54,732
(Let's just get it.)

1197
00:48:54,962 --> 00:48:56,862
- Should I give you one of these? - Yes, red oranges.

1198
00:48:56,862 --> 00:48:58,062
(He buys red oranges while he's at it.)

1199
00:48:58,303 --> 00:48:59,703
Hey, I bought red oranges.

1200
00:49:00,672 --> 00:49:02,442
(So happy)

1201
00:49:02,772 --> 00:49:03,873
Right over here.

1202
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:04,873
(The empty basket is now full.)

1203
00:49:05,373 --> 00:49:06,643
What? Wow!

1204
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:10,112
(Tasty snacks keep catching their attention.)

1205
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:11,882
Wow, I'm just mesmerized.

1206
00:49:11,953 --> 00:49:14,312
(Sneaks towards it)

1207
00:49:14,583 --> 00:49:15,652
What should we do?

1208
00:49:15,882 --> 00:49:18,123
No, we shouldn't.

1209
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:20,692
- Go, just go. - No, we shouldn't.

1210
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:21,993
(Painfully looking away)

1211
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:25,333
(Meanwhile, these two people are viewing the front yard.)

1212
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:26,362
Look at that.

1213
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:29,132
(The strong ocean wind is strong enough to blow them away.)

1214
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,263
I'm getting pushed back.

1215
00:49:32,073 --> 00:49:33,272
Your legs are strong.

1216
00:49:34,203 --> 00:49:36,603
- I'm getting pushed back. - Me too!

1217
00:49:37,573 --> 00:49:40,143
- It's so refreshing, right? - Right.

1218
00:49:40,842 --> 00:49:43,342
(Feels like their frustrated minds are getting refreshed)

1219
00:49:44,143 --> 00:49:47,913
(They can take in the ocean in front of them as much as they want.)

1220
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:52,723
(A place where they can hear the refreshing sound of the waves, )

1221
00:49:53,993 --> 00:49:57,792
(and the sound of the wind brushing through the grass.)

1222
00:49:58,792 --> 00:50:02,333
(The front yard of the house)

1223
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:07,333
(Gazing off into the distance)

1224
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:09,603
Doesn't it seem like the sound of the waves got louder?

1225
00:50:09,603 --> 00:50:10,743
It got louder than before.

1226
00:50:11,772 --> 00:50:14,112
(As the waves crash closer)

1227
00:50:14,112 --> 00:50:16,413
- The waves are really big. - I know.

1228
00:50:17,183 --> 00:50:19,882
Should we buy some side dishes here?

1229
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,252
Sounds good!

1230
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:22,382
Bean leaves?

1231
00:50:22,382 --> 00:50:23,823
(Gyeongsang Province is famous for its bean leaves.)

1232
00:50:23,823 --> 00:50:25,623
Which one? This?

1233
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:26,922
(Looks delicious)

1234
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:28,393
This is good.

1235
00:50:29,562 --> 00:50:32,033
Bean leaves are good even with just rice, right?

1236
00:50:33,362 --> 00:50:34,763
(Spicy paste...)

1237
00:50:34,763 --> 00:50:36,232
(on savory bean leaves)

1238
00:50:36,462 --> 00:50:39,473
(Bean leaves kimchi, Gyeongsang Province's specialty)

1239
00:50:40,402 --> 00:50:42,402
Give us 10 dollars worth.

1240
00:50:44,803 --> 00:50:47,013
- That's good when it's just made. - So true.

1241
00:50:47,013 --> 00:50:48,073
(These two people don't care about the side dishes.)

1242
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:49,913
That looks so good.

1243
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,283
Say that you want to eat it.

1244
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,283
I can't concentrate.

1245
00:50:56,152 --> 00:50:58,022
The point of going to the market is to eat those things.

1246
00:50:59,092 --> 00:51:01,192
Eat it! Let's all have a bite then.

1247
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:02,922
10 pieces?

1248
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:04,422
Isn't that too much?

1249
00:51:04,592 --> 00:51:06,933
Then... Five!

1250
00:51:07,893 --> 00:51:10,033
- No, 6! - Okay, 6.

1251
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:11,362
Please give us six.

1252
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:13,132
Please give us the warm ones.

1253
00:51:13,433 --> 00:51:15,442
I'm going to hold them in my arms.

1254
00:51:16,002 --> 00:51:18,203
- Thank you for the food! - Thank you.

1255
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:19,212
(My precious)

1256
00:51:19,473 --> 00:51:20,712
We need to eat this when it's warm.

1257
00:51:20,712 --> 00:51:21,743
(Is there anything else to buy?)

1258
00:51:24,312 --> 00:51:26,152
What is it? It looks so good!

1259
00:51:26,312 --> 00:51:29,152
- Dong Il really likes these things. - Mugwort rice cakes!

1260
00:51:29,683 --> 00:51:31,323
Dong Il likes these things.

1261
00:51:31,323 --> 00:51:32,353
(Now they think of Dong Il.)

1262
00:51:32,353 --> 00:51:33,522
Let's get some mugwort rice cakes.

1263
00:51:33,522 --> 00:51:35,723
- Okay, how much are these? - 3 dollars.

1264
00:51:35,723 --> 00:51:36,792
Wow! Sikhye!

1265
00:51:37,623 --> 00:51:39,092
How much is this?

1266
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,533
Give us two!

1267
00:51:40,533 --> 00:51:42,433
(Even bought sikhye, which Dong Il likes)

1268
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:46,073
No, this isn't for me.

1269
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:48,573
- Dong Il likes this. - I know.

1270
00:51:49,103 --> 00:51:51,303
We finally found sikhye and mugwort rice cakes.

1271
00:51:51,303 --> 00:51:52,342
Let's go now.

1272
00:51:52,913 --> 00:51:54,812
(They head home...)

1273
00:51:54,812 --> 00:51:57,913
(with proud hearts!)

1274
00:52:01,683 --> 00:52:02,953
Oh, they're here!

1275
00:52:04,853 --> 00:52:06,853
- They're here. - Great job everyone.

1276
00:52:06,853 --> 00:52:07,922
Great job everyone.

1277
00:52:07,922 --> 00:52:08,962
(Finally returned to the front yard)

1278
00:52:10,163 --> 00:52:12,393
- Did you guys do anything? - We just stayed still.

1279
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:14,163
(Laughing)

1280
00:52:14,592 --> 00:52:16,103
Did you buy something good?

1281
00:52:16,103 --> 00:52:17,663
- I bought something for you. - Mugwort rice cakes!

1282
00:52:17,663 --> 00:52:18,873
We bought mugwort rice cakes.

1283
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:20,732
I thought I was getting groceries with you.

1284
00:52:22,243 --> 00:52:24,243
What did you do when you were with Hee Won?

1285
00:52:24,772 --> 00:52:28,272
No, as I was buying mugwort rice cakes,

1286
00:52:28,442 --> 00:52:29,942
I thought of you because I knew you like them.

1287
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:31,913
Hee Won really bought the mugwort rice cakes...

1288
00:52:31,913 --> 00:52:33,583
because he knew you like them.

1289
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,652
- Hee Won? - Yes!

1290
00:52:36,723 --> 00:52:38,453
- Oh, we need to take these out. - Snow crabs!

1291
00:52:38,723 --> 00:52:41,393
- Just leave them outside. - Snow crabs outside. Okay!

1292
00:52:42,462 --> 00:52:43,592
(Dong Il is organizing the groceries.)

1293
00:52:43,592 --> 00:52:45,022
- Jung Se, sit down. - Okay.

1294
00:52:45,022 --> 00:52:46,692
(Dong Il is organizing the groceries.)

1295
00:52:47,263 --> 00:52:50,333
(Jung Se is following him.)

1296
00:52:50,763 --> 00:52:52,473
(Curious)

1297
00:52:53,073 --> 00:52:54,772
Sikhye! My goodness!

1298
00:52:54,873 --> 00:52:57,103
You guys bought everything I like!

1299
00:52:57,772 --> 00:53:00,913
- That's right. - Dong Il, I'll organize that.

1300
00:53:00,942 --> 00:53:02,442
They said we need to peel and eat those.

1301
00:53:03,243 --> 00:53:04,982
They said this is famous.

1302
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:06,312
Should we peel and eat these?

1303
00:53:06,482 --> 00:53:08,522
- Dried snow crab legs? - Let's eat those.

1304
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:10,123
Sit down.

1305
00:53:10,223 --> 00:53:11,252
Wow, this feels like...

1306
00:53:11,752 --> 00:53:14,393
we're in the countryside, all of us bunched together.

1307
00:53:14,922 --> 00:53:16,223
Si Wan, give me some sikhye.

1308
00:53:16,223 --> 00:53:18,592
Dong Il, when I found the sikhye I cried out in happiness.

1309
00:53:18,592 --> 00:53:20,192
I shouted, "It's sikhye!"

1310
00:53:20,192 --> 00:53:21,192
(Receive my wink.)

1311
00:53:21,192 --> 00:53:22,333
I love you.

1312
00:53:22,362 --> 00:53:23,833
(You know my heart, right?)

1313
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:26,373
I love you.

1314
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:29,203
What is this?

1315
00:53:29,243 --> 00:53:31,002
- I've never seen this before. - They gave us this.

1316
00:53:33,013 --> 00:53:35,243
They said to eat the thing inside.

1317
00:53:35,243 --> 00:53:36,812
- Oh, the dried stuff? - Yeah, inside.

1318
00:53:37,842 --> 00:53:40,413
(They're snow crab legs...)

1319
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:43,583
(steamed in a steamer...)

1320
00:53:44,752 --> 00:53:47,223
(and dried with the cool ocean wind...)

1321
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:49,522
(and the warm sunlight.)

1322
00:53:49,522 --> 00:53:52,393
(These are dried snow crab legs.)

1323
00:53:54,493 --> 00:53:56,132
(Made into a sweet and salty delicacy.)

1324
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:57,333
Look at the legs.

1325
00:53:58,163 --> 00:53:59,533
They're really big.

1326
00:54:02,303 --> 00:54:04,573
- There's nothing to eat. - They said this is good.

1327
00:54:04,573 --> 00:54:06,272
You need to break it like this.

1328
00:54:07,042 --> 00:54:08,143
Oh, like this?

1329
00:54:08,143 --> 00:54:09,982
You need to open it.

1330
00:54:10,243 --> 00:54:11,413
Wow, but really...

1331
00:54:11,953 --> 00:54:14,013
I think it's the first time to see dried crabs.

1332
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:15,823
- It's my first time eating this. - Me too.

1333
00:54:15,823 --> 00:54:16,823
Me too.

1334
00:54:18,183 --> 00:54:19,453
Oh, like this?

1335
00:54:19,453 --> 00:54:20,922
(Takes a bite)

1336
00:54:26,533 --> 00:54:31,333
(Tastes sweeter the more you chew on it)

1337
00:54:33,033 --> 00:54:34,473
Hyo Jin, this is pretty good.

1338
00:54:35,473 --> 00:54:36,772
Right? It's fun, right?

1339
00:54:37,303 --> 00:54:39,812
- Wow, this would go well with beer. - It's amazing.

1340
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:44,812
(Nibbling)

1341
00:54:45,513 --> 00:54:47,882
(Glancing)

1342
00:54:49,022 --> 00:54:51,453
You need to break it and pull.

1343
00:54:51,453 --> 00:54:52,723
(Quickly teaching him)

1344
00:54:54,522 --> 00:54:56,223
(Empty)

1345
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:57,823
Throw those away.

1346
00:54:57,993 --> 00:54:59,462
(Okay...)

1347
00:55:00,493 --> 00:55:01,732
Try this too.

1348
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:02,862
(What did Si Wan bring?)

1349
00:55:03,203 --> 00:55:05,303
- Mugwort rice cakes! - I like mugwort rice cakes.

1350
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:06,502
(Bean flour mugwort rice cakes)

1351
00:55:07,632 --> 00:55:09,272
It's been so long since I've last had rice cakes.

1352
00:55:09,303 --> 00:55:11,303
(Satisfied)

1353
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:14,442
Hyo Jin has no shyness.

1354
00:55:14,612 --> 00:55:16,442
That's a strength of yours.

1355
00:55:16,442 --> 00:55:19,212
(A big bite)

1356
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,922
Dong Il, these are red oranges.

1357
00:55:22,482 --> 00:55:23,922
(Try one.)

1358
00:55:23,922 --> 00:55:25,723
- Give it to Hyo Jin first. - Hyo Jin.

1359
00:55:26,152 --> 00:55:27,252
Red oranges.

1360
00:55:28,353 --> 00:55:29,922
(Taking a bite)

1361
00:55:30,092 --> 00:55:31,692
Oh, the smell is so nice.

1362
00:55:31,692 --> 00:55:32,893
This is also really good.

1363
00:55:32,893 --> 00:55:35,062
(Taking a bite)

1364
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:37,333
(A bite of it...)

1365
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,502
(brings smiles all around.)

1366
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:40,073
(While everyone's into talking about the snacks)

1367
00:55:40,073 --> 00:55:41,533
This one's really good.

1368
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:43,902
This is really good, right?

1369
00:55:44,172 --> 00:55:46,172
It has a definite sweet taste and sour taste.

1370
00:55:46,172 --> 00:55:47,473
(Quietly trying them out)

1371
00:55:47,473 --> 00:55:48,542
It didn't have that before.

1372
00:55:49,413 --> 00:55:52,612
(Trying out the red orange)

1373
00:55:53,053 --> 00:55:57,723
(A bite of mugwort rice cake)

1374
00:55:59,123 --> 00:56:01,993
(Breaking off a small dried snow crab leg)

1375
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,763
I really like sikhye and mugwort rice cakes.

1376
00:56:03,763 --> 00:56:05,533
(Diligently eating)

1377
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:07,933
It's so good.

1378
00:56:09,263 --> 00:56:10,803
Tell him to do something.

1379
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:12,772
Say something Jung Se.

1380
00:56:12,772 --> 00:56:14,473
(Just joking around)

1381
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:16,942
(Did I just eat the whole time?)

1382
00:56:17,402 --> 00:56:19,812
Jung Se, if you want to eat some, just say so,

1383
00:56:19,812 --> 00:56:21,013
- and just eat it. - Okay.

1384
00:56:21,013 --> 00:56:22,812
- Don't just eat what we give you. - Okay.

1385
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,612
- No, it's yours. - Try this.

1386
00:56:24,812 --> 00:56:26,882
(Then I'll eat it.)

1387
00:56:27,853 --> 00:56:29,283
It doesn't have a sour taste at all, right?

1388
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,223
- It's good, right? - Say something. It's not sour?

1389
00:56:31,223 --> 00:56:32,522
It doesn't have a sour taste at all.

1390
00:56:34,353 --> 00:56:35,393
Say it correctly.

1391
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,362
(Just joking around)

1392
00:56:37,993 --> 00:56:39,033
Sour taste.

1393
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:40,462
Sour taste.

1394
00:56:40,462 --> 00:56:42,303
(Eating)

1395
00:56:44,203 --> 00:56:46,933
(After staving off hunger with snacks...)

1396
00:56:48,132 --> 00:56:49,143
(What do we do now?)

1397
00:56:49,143 --> 00:56:50,373
What do we do now?

1398
00:56:50,502 --> 00:56:52,172
- Now we need to boil them. - We need to boil them.

1399
00:56:52,212 --> 00:56:53,643
I bet the crabs will be so delicious.

1400
00:56:54,013 --> 00:56:55,212
Pakdal snow crabs.

1401
00:56:55,442 --> 00:56:59,553
And Si Wan said he'd make us crab shell fried rice.

1402
00:56:59,652 --> 00:57:01,382
(Impressed)

1403
00:57:01,882 --> 00:57:02,922
(Look forward to it)

1404
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:03,953
After lighting the fire,

1405
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:07,323
can we boil all of them in one pot?

1406
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:08,323
Yes, that's all.

1407
00:57:08,323 --> 00:57:09,522
They said to boil them for 20 minutes.

1408
00:57:09,522 --> 00:57:12,092
Boil for 20 minutes, and let it rest for 10 minutes.

1409
00:57:13,092 --> 00:57:14,933
I think it'll be difficult to light a fire...

1410
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:17,303
because it's so windy today.

1411
00:57:17,402 --> 00:57:20,902
(A bit worried...)

1412
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:24,803
Oh, that's why we prepared one that lights really well.

1413
00:57:25,973 --> 00:57:27,873
It'll boil quickly.

1414
00:57:28,373 --> 00:57:30,083
And we'll eat them right away.

1415
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,112
That's right.

1416
00:57:32,013 --> 00:57:33,083
- Hee Won, - Yes?

1417
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:34,683
bring me a pair of scissors. Let's open these up.

1418
00:57:34,783 --> 00:57:35,922
Scissors?

1419
00:57:36,123 --> 00:57:37,382
Let's take a look at these snow crabs.

1420
00:57:37,382 --> 00:57:38,652
(Needs to go if Dong Il tells him to)

1421
00:57:38,652 --> 00:57:39,893
Where are the scissors?

1422
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,553
Scissors...

1423
00:57:41,553 --> 00:57:45,962
(Diligent)

1424
00:57:47,592 --> 00:57:49,562
(Exclaiming)

1425
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:52,402
(This is pakdal snow crab.)

1426
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:53,703
Wow, what kind of snow crab...

1427
00:57:54,803 --> 00:57:55,942
Wow, it's alive!

1428
00:57:57,473 --> 00:57:58,743
Of course!

1429
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:01,243
Dong Il, they said that...

1430
00:58:01,243 --> 00:58:02,382
the blue thing is a mark.

1431
00:58:02,482 --> 00:58:03,842
Be careful of your hands.

1432
00:58:03,842 --> 00:58:05,382
(A fresh crab)

1433
00:58:05,382 --> 00:58:08,723
(So cool even after seeing it so many times.)

1434
00:58:09,422 --> 00:58:10,853
(Goodness!)

1435
00:58:12,453 --> 00:58:15,493
(Wriggling)

1436
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:16,792
Wow! Jung Se!

1437
00:58:18,092 --> 00:58:19,362
They're alive!

1438
00:58:20,092 --> 00:58:22,362
(Should I go outside?)

1439
00:58:22,362 --> 00:58:23,763
(No.)

1440
00:58:23,763 --> 00:58:25,873
(Should I just go outside?)

1441
00:58:25,873 --> 00:58:29,172
(No, let's just not...)

1442
00:58:29,942 --> 00:58:31,172
They're really big.

1443
00:58:31,873 --> 00:58:33,612
They really are big.

1444
00:58:33,612 --> 00:58:37,643
(His eyes are fixed.)

1445
00:58:38,683 --> 00:58:40,752
Wow, they open their claws like this.

1446
00:58:40,752 --> 00:58:42,853
(The pakdal snow crabs leave for now.)

1447
00:58:43,323 --> 00:58:44,982
(Enjoying his time)

1448
00:58:44,982 --> 00:58:46,053
It's cold.

1449
00:58:46,252 --> 00:58:48,823
- We're the guests, so let's sit. - Of course, of course.

1450
00:58:48,823 --> 00:58:51,323
That's our concept.

1451
00:58:51,323 --> 00:58:52,792
(Should I?)

1452
00:58:54,062 --> 00:58:56,163
Dong Il. I'm just going to rest today.

1453
00:58:56,163 --> 00:58:57,303
- Really? - Yes.

1454
00:58:57,303 --> 00:58:58,502
Try it if you can.

1455
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:00,473
My goodness.

1456
00:59:01,373 --> 00:59:03,603
I swept and wiped everything.

1457
00:59:03,603 --> 00:59:05,402
- You're right. - I organized everything.

1458
00:59:05,402 --> 00:59:06,643
You did.

1459
00:59:08,172 --> 00:59:10,913
(The person who says she's not going to work today...)

1460
00:59:10,913 --> 00:59:13,453
(The broom and the dustpan she brought as a gift)

1461
00:59:14,013 --> 00:59:16,853
(She even dismantled the wrapping herself.)

1462
00:59:17,623 --> 00:59:20,493
(Cleaning dried snow crab legs shells)

1463
00:59:21,493 --> 00:59:23,362
(She sweeps...)

1464
00:59:23,362 --> 00:59:25,763
(and wipes.)

1465
00:59:26,533 --> 00:59:29,163
(Lovely Hyo Jin couldn't stay still today either.)

1466
00:59:30,002 --> 00:59:31,303
Just stay comfortably as a guest.

1467
00:59:31,303 --> 00:59:32,303
- Can I do that? - It's your mission.

1468
00:59:32,303 --> 00:59:33,373
Of course.

1469
00:59:35,073 --> 00:59:36,473
He can't say a word.

1470
00:59:36,473 --> 00:59:38,143
- This is bad. - I spoke a lot earlier.

1471
00:59:41,172 --> 00:59:42,243
Here.

1472
00:59:42,243 --> 00:59:44,812
(Meanwhile outside...)

1473
00:59:46,112 --> 00:59:48,252
But because of the wind,

1474
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:50,022
shouldn't we cover it with something?

1475
00:59:50,022 --> 00:59:51,323
There's something for it.

1476
00:59:51,482 --> 00:59:52,652
Right?

1477
00:59:53,292 --> 00:59:54,893
We need to cover it with something.

1478
00:59:57,763 --> 01:00:01,263
(They get ready to steam pakdal snow crab!)

1479
01:00:04,763 --> 01:00:08,672
(They set up the windshield.)

1480
01:00:08,803 --> 01:00:10,902
- This... - No, put it here. Okay.

1481
01:00:10,902 --> 01:00:11,942
(He places the steamer.)

1482
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,712
- It works. - It works?

1483
01:00:14,973 --> 01:00:16,143
It's good!

1484
01:00:16,143 --> 01:00:18,712
(Powerful heat)

1485
01:00:19,353 --> 01:00:22,522
(Safely filmed with the permission of a landowner)

1486
01:00:24,453 --> 01:00:28,453
(Welcome, pakdal snow crab.)

1487
01:00:28,553 --> 01:00:31,223
(Staring intensely)

1488
01:00:32,692 --> 01:00:35,603
(Pakdal snow crab enters.)

1489
01:00:35,603 --> 01:00:36,763
Okay.

1490
01:00:37,562 --> 01:00:39,132
This is so big.

1491
01:00:39,573 --> 01:00:41,533
This is my first time touching a crab like this.

1492
01:00:42,573 --> 01:00:45,002
(It's ready.)

1493
01:00:45,073 --> 01:00:47,373
We should just cook this from now on.

1494
01:00:47,373 --> 01:00:48,913
- All the time? - It's easy to prepare.

1495
01:00:48,913 --> 01:00:51,112
- I see. - Because it's easy!

1496
01:00:51,342 --> 01:00:52,812
We can just set it up like this.

1497
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:56,522
It'll take 20 minutes from now.

1498
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:59,453
Set up an alarm for 20 minutes.

1499
01:00:59,453 --> 01:01:01,823
Yes. I set up the alarm...

1500
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,723
for 5:26pm.

1501
01:01:04,763 --> 01:01:07,792
(They are happy with his sense of humor.)

1502
01:01:08,902 --> 01:01:11,362
(While they're waiting, Si Wan brews coffee.)

1503
01:01:11,362 --> 01:01:13,303
This is fine, right?

1504
01:01:14,933 --> 01:01:19,342
(This time, he's careful not to break the filter again.)

1505
01:01:20,413 --> 01:01:23,342
(He's good.)

1506
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:24,942
- What's that? - Out of all things...

1507
01:01:24,942 --> 01:01:26,413
What are you going to do?

1508
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:29,482
- This is strong, and this is weak. - Thank you!

1509
01:01:29,482 --> 01:01:30,783
- That's what you like, right? - Yes.

1510
01:01:31,422 --> 01:01:32,422
(The wind is shielded well.)

1511
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,053
The crab must taste so good.

1512
01:01:35,022 --> 01:01:37,192
- It reminds me of back then. - What?

1513
01:01:37,192 --> 01:01:38,522
The white one, what was it?

1514
01:01:38,522 --> 01:01:42,333
The one dish that I ate when I came here last time...

1515
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:44,862
that drove me crazy was grilled hairtail.

1516
01:01:45,033 --> 01:01:46,703
- We really cooked well. - The one we ate like this.

1517
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,643
The hairtail was so delicious.

1518
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:51,803
Look at the silver color!

1519
01:01:52,203 --> 01:01:55,842
(This is the Jeju hairtail that Hyo Jin couldn't forget.)

1520
01:01:56,283 --> 01:01:58,442
(Gigantic)

1521
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,723
(It was cut into big pieces and grilled golden brown.)

1522
01:02:04,482 --> 01:02:07,422
(The unforgettable memory of hairtail...)

1523
01:02:07,422 --> 01:02:10,362
(that made her mouth full.)

1524
01:02:12,632 --> 01:02:16,232
(Today, it's freshly steamed pakdal snow crab.)

1525
01:02:17,062 --> 01:02:20,002
(The meat is thoroughly removed.)

1526
01:02:20,973 --> 01:02:22,442
Hold that side. Try it.

1527
01:02:24,603 --> 01:02:29,382
(Will pakdal snow crab surpass the grilled hairtail?)

1528
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:32,812
Hee Won, take this.

1529
01:02:32,812 --> 01:02:33,812
(Chef Sung prepared another menu to enjoy with pakdal snow crab.)

1530
01:02:33,812 --> 01:02:35,583
- Isn't this gwamegi? - It is.

1531
01:02:36,823 --> 01:02:38,482
Gosh, gwamegi.

1532
01:02:38,823 --> 01:02:41,692
Someone made saury gwamegi and herring gwamegi.

1533
01:02:41,692 --> 01:02:43,522
So we can eat pakdal snow crab,

1534
01:02:43,522 --> 01:02:46,592
gwamegi, and rockfish sashimi.

1535
01:02:46,893 --> 01:02:48,592
(Look forward to it this time too.)

1536
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:51,862
- Right? - Right.

1537
01:02:53,203 --> 01:02:57,873
(Now they just need to wait for pakdal snow crab to be cooked!)

1538
01:02:58,873 --> 01:03:00,513
I think the sky's going to clear soon.

1539
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:01,873
It's already brighter.

1540
01:03:02,013 --> 01:03:03,382
You're right!

1541
01:03:04,212 --> 01:03:05,482
It's clearing.

1542
01:03:06,053 --> 01:03:07,882
The weather must be clearing.

1543
01:03:11,522 --> 01:03:13,522
It's not even that cold outside anymore.

1544
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:14,853
- Right? - Yes.

1545
01:03:17,263 --> 01:03:19,792
(20 minutes have passed.)

1546
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:22,362
(Steamed pakdal snow crab is finally done!)

1547
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:24,663
(Peeking out)

1548
01:03:25,103 --> 01:03:28,703
(The steamer has been there for full 20 minutes.)

1549
01:03:29,342 --> 01:03:32,342
But why is it not steaming?

1550
01:03:32,612 --> 01:03:34,373
Did they add some water at the bottom?

1551
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:39,453
(It looks so still without a single steam.)

1552
01:03:39,853 --> 01:03:42,283
I think we need to cook a lot longer.

1553
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:50,123
(He checks the heat with this palm.)

1554
01:03:50,163 --> 01:03:52,993
Is it not hot even when you touch it?

1555
01:03:53,632 --> 01:03:54,893
(Freezing cold)

1556
01:03:54,893 --> 01:03:57,163
There's almost no heat on top.

1557
01:03:57,303 --> 01:03:59,973
- Is the water even boiling now? - I don't know.

1558
01:03:59,973 --> 01:04:02,172
Normally for things like that,

1559
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:05,103
you'll see white steam rising.

1560
01:04:05,203 --> 01:04:07,842
Exactly. I should've just steamed it before coming.

1561
01:04:07,842 --> 01:04:09,342
(Maybe because of the sea breeze, there's no sign of steam.)

1562
01:04:10,643 --> 01:04:13,712
If we steam it for an hour,

1563
01:04:13,712 --> 01:04:15,382
it will get cooked eventually.

1564
01:04:15,382 --> 01:04:16,652
(They decide to steam a little longer.)

1565
01:04:17,652 --> 01:04:20,152
(Let's just wait inside.)

1566
01:04:20,652 --> 01:04:23,862
Then what are we going to do here tomorrow afternoon?

1567
01:04:23,862 --> 01:04:26,062
Back then, we had a place to take a stroll.

1568
01:04:26,132 --> 01:04:27,893
Let's go to Guryongpo.

1569
01:04:29,703 --> 01:04:31,103
Returning home in glory.

1570
01:04:31,703 --> 01:04:33,703
Guryongpo. Let's do a car parade.

1571
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,632
You filmed a drama there, right?

1572
01:04:35,632 --> 01:04:39,143
I filmed a drama there and won an award.

1573
01:04:39,143 --> 01:04:42,913
Then in Guryongpo, they hung up banners...

1574
01:04:42,913 --> 01:04:44,712
- My gosh. - all around the place...

1575
01:04:44,712 --> 01:04:46,353
- Really? - which says that I won an award.

1576
01:04:46,353 --> 01:04:49,083
It said, "Gong Hyo Jin won the Grand Award!"

1577
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:50,623
It looked similar to those banners that say,

1578
01:04:50,623 --> 01:04:51,823
"Accepted to Seoul National University!"

1579
01:04:52,493 --> 01:04:54,353
- And normally... - That was amazing.

1580
01:04:54,353 --> 01:04:56,263
- I went to Guryongpo 2 weeks ago, - 2 weeks.

1581
01:04:56,263 --> 01:04:58,062
- and they asked to take a photo, - Guryongpo?

1582
01:04:58,062 --> 01:05:00,732
so I said yes, but they gave me the phone and went to sit by themselves.

1583
01:05:00,732 --> 01:05:02,333
So I helped them take a photo and left.

1584
01:05:02,703 --> 01:05:06,033
They asked you to take a photo of them?

1585
01:05:06,033 --> 01:05:07,333
- Yes. - Not to take one together?

1586
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:08,873
That's what I thought too, so I did like this,

1587
01:05:08,873 --> 01:05:10,402
but they went to sit by themselves.

1588
01:05:10,402 --> 01:05:11,603
(Great actor's spirit of service)

1589
01:05:11,842 --> 01:05:13,413
Then let's go there tomorrow.

1590
01:05:13,973 --> 01:05:15,573
- We'll have lunch first, - It reminds me of those days.

1591
01:05:15,573 --> 01:05:17,712
and go there in the afternoon.

1592
01:05:19,112 --> 01:05:20,382
(While chatting about this and that...)

1593
01:05:20,382 --> 01:05:21,953
It's going to start steaming.

1594
01:05:21,953 --> 01:05:23,623
(While chatting about this and that...)

1595
01:05:23,783 --> 01:05:25,022
I'm looking forward to it!

1596
01:05:25,022 --> 01:05:27,453
It feels like a rice cake shop!

1597
01:05:27,592 --> 01:05:29,493
The moment in a rice cake shop!

1598
01:05:29,493 --> 01:05:30,692
(Can't wait to see)

1599
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:32,862
- It's hot. - Now it's hot.

1600
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:34,893
(Their hearts flutter at the thought of meeting pakdal snow crab.)

1601
01:05:35,763 --> 01:05:36,902
Here.

1602
01:05:37,462 --> 01:05:39,473
(You saw that, right?)

1603
01:05:39,703 --> 01:05:40,902
(Fantastic)

1604
01:05:40,902 --> 01:05:42,743
- There's steam. - Pardon?

1605
01:05:42,743 --> 01:05:44,743
- There's steam. - Did you see the steam?

1606
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:46,342
- Clear the space, - Yes.

1607
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:48,013
- and set up the table. - Yes.

1608
01:05:48,013 --> 01:05:50,683
Unfold the table.

1609
01:05:50,982 --> 01:05:52,783
This isn't it. Whose clothes is this?

1610
01:05:53,312 --> 01:05:56,422
It's nice. It's so warm.

1611
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:58,982
So hot!

1612
01:05:59,252 --> 01:06:00,323
Let me see.

1613
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:01,652
(Really?)

1614
01:06:01,652 --> 01:06:03,393
(It's so hot.)

1615
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:05,022
- Finally. - It's hot, right?

1616
01:06:05,092 --> 01:06:07,592
It's hot and nice!

1617
01:06:07,692 --> 01:06:10,663
- I saw you get flustered. - My goodness.

1618
01:06:10,663 --> 01:06:12,462
I saw you get flustered and surprised.

1619
01:06:12,462 --> 01:06:15,433
This is so nice. It's so warm.

1620
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:17,873
Gosh, Dong Il.

1621
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:19,573
(Thanks to the hot steamer, they're feeling wonderful.)

1622
01:06:19,573 --> 01:06:20,643
Hot!

1623
01:06:21,172 --> 01:06:22,712
(You should feel it too.)

1624
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:24,913
- It's nice, right? - It is.

1625
01:06:24,913 --> 01:06:26,783
You should put your hands longer.

1626
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:28,212
I can't do that because it's too hot.

1627
01:06:28,413 --> 01:06:31,053
- I want to feel it too. - Okay.

1628
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:32,592
(Wait for a while, the warm hands are on their way.)

1629
01:06:32,592 --> 01:06:33,723
Hot!

1630
01:06:34,192 --> 01:06:35,553
- Gosh! - Right?

1631
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:37,062
- This is no joke. - It's warm, right?

1632
01:06:37,223 --> 01:06:39,632
Hey! Come here!

1633
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,062
- Show me your ears. - Why?

1634
01:06:41,592 --> 01:06:43,062
It should be this much at least.

1635
01:06:43,062 --> 01:06:45,902
(He's suffering.)

1636
01:06:46,033 --> 01:06:48,033
- So warm! - It should be this much.

1637
01:06:48,502 --> 01:06:49,902
It's hot.

1638
01:06:49,902 --> 01:06:51,842
(They're so cute.)

1639
01:06:51,942 --> 01:06:53,643
Let's check the color. Move aside.

1640
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:57,342
(The opening ceremony of the steamer lid)

1641
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:59,083
(Steaming)

1642
01:07:00,853 --> 01:07:02,513
Look at the color. They're cooked.

1643
01:07:02,513 --> 01:07:04,123
(Dazzlingly beautiful)

1644
01:07:04,123 --> 01:07:05,853
- I think they're cooked. - Yes.

1645
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,252
Let's see.

1646
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:11,493
Let's check one leg first.

1647
01:07:11,893 --> 01:07:14,033
You don't need to be so careful now.

1648
01:07:14,232 --> 01:07:17,303
Si Wan, you can be rough with it.

1649
01:07:18,303 --> 01:07:20,632
Cut it and see if it's cooked.

1650
01:07:24,243 --> 01:07:27,172
This is cooked.

1651
01:07:27,312 --> 01:07:28,873
Hyo Jin, Jung Se, try it.

1652
01:07:28,873 --> 01:07:30,442
It's surely different from just now.

1653
01:07:30,442 --> 01:07:33,013
- Is this from the top container? - Yes, from the top one.

1654
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:36,022
Look at this.

1655
01:07:36,022 --> 01:07:38,052
If the ones in the top container are cooked,

1656
01:07:38,052 --> 01:07:39,052
it means everything's cooked.

1657
01:07:39,152 --> 01:07:40,152
Here.

1658
01:07:41,293 --> 01:07:43,163
- It's hot. - Don't touch it! Eat.

1659
01:07:45,192 --> 01:07:48,692
(She takes a mouthful.)

1660
01:07:48,833 --> 01:07:51,203
(Astonished)

1661
01:07:51,203 --> 01:07:54,703
(Amazing)

1662
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:55,873
- She took it in one bite. - It's cooked.

1663
01:07:55,873 --> 01:07:57,173
- It is, right? - Is it good?

1664
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:58,802
- Yes. - In one bite, okay.

1665
01:07:58,802 --> 01:08:00,512
(It passed the test.)

1666
01:08:05,283 --> 01:08:08,152
- Let's just take one by one. - Okay.

1667
01:08:09,383 --> 01:08:11,623
- Should we go in now? - Yes.

1668
01:08:12,152 --> 01:08:13,453
Here.

1669
01:08:13,453 --> 01:08:14,753
(He carefully takes out the pakdal snow crab.)

1670
01:08:14,753 --> 01:08:16,562
My goodness.

1671
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:20,293
- Gosh. - Finally, pakdal snow crab.

1672
01:08:20,293 --> 01:08:21,892
(The pakdal snow crab finally makes a grand entrance.)

1673
01:08:22,703 --> 01:08:24,133
Come sit around.

1674
01:08:24,932 --> 01:08:26,432
Bring that here.

1675
01:08:26,432 --> 01:08:28,272
(Dazzling)

1676
01:08:28,573 --> 01:08:30,703
Shall we open it up?

1677
01:08:30,703 --> 01:08:32,402
- Yes! - Give me one too.

1678
01:08:33,043 --> 01:08:36,312
(Very expectant)

1679
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:38,743
I can't believe I'm having pakdal snow crab.

1680
01:08:39,753 --> 01:08:43,682
(He greets the snow crab humbly.)

1681
01:08:44,953 --> 01:08:46,222
Gosh.

1682
01:08:49,362 --> 01:08:51,762
(Completely focused)

1683
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:57,362
- Yes. - The soup.

1684
01:08:58,663 --> 01:08:59,673
Hold on.

1685
01:09:01,402 --> 01:09:02,402
What's this?

1686
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:04,772
What's this?

1687
01:09:05,503 --> 01:09:06,612
(Well...)

1688
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:10,413
Is it not cooked?

1689
01:09:11,243 --> 01:09:13,383
The inside, the meat...

1690
01:09:13,383 --> 01:09:15,052
(Pardon?)

1691
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:19,892
- I think the body isn't cooked. - That's right, it's not cooked.

1692
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:22,692
Yes. Why is that so?

1693
01:09:23,293 --> 01:09:26,463
How can it be cooked?

1694
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:28,362
- It's not cooked. - The leg was cooked, right?

1695
01:09:28,362 --> 01:09:29,362
Yes.

1696
01:09:29,362 --> 01:09:31,163
(He's sad.)

1697
01:09:31,932 --> 01:09:36,033
(His thought process stops.)

1698
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:39,873
- Some legs were too chewy. - No.

1699
01:09:39,873 --> 01:09:41,213
This isn't cooked, right?

1700
01:09:41,213 --> 01:09:42,743
- It's not cooked. - Even the legs are...

1701
01:09:42,743 --> 01:09:45,843
a bit tough, look.

1702
01:09:45,942 --> 01:09:47,913
- It's not cooked. - The meat inside...

1703
01:09:47,913 --> 01:09:49,383
does look slightly uncooked.

1704
01:09:49,383 --> 01:09:51,253
- It's almost raw. - Is it because of the water?

1705
01:09:51,652 --> 01:09:52,652
No, even I can see...

1706
01:09:52,652 --> 01:09:53,823
- It's not cooked. - that it's a bit different.

1707
01:09:53,823 --> 01:09:55,453
- Yes. - I'm sorry, Jung Se.

1708
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:57,762
I'm sorry, Jung Se.

1709
01:10:00,033 --> 01:10:03,362
(He goes outside to deal with it.)

1710
01:10:03,362 --> 01:10:04,902
- This... - What a waste.

1711
01:10:04,902 --> 01:10:06,802
- You need to start the fire again. - This?

1712
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:07,802
Got it.

1713
01:10:08,472 --> 01:10:09,673
What a waste.

1714
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:10,673
(Flustered)

1715
01:10:10,743 --> 01:10:12,573
(Tinkering)

1716
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:15,272
(He starts the fire again.)

1717
01:10:16,413 --> 01:10:20,352
(The pakdal snow crab goes back into the steamer.)

1718
01:10:21,913 --> 01:10:25,383
(They decide to steam a little longer.)

1719
01:10:27,522 --> 01:10:30,192
(Dong Il who feels uncomfortable...)

1720
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:33,262
(blocks the wind with chairs.)

1721
01:10:34,533 --> 01:10:40,003
(He somehow feels even more sorry.)

1722
01:10:41,272 --> 01:10:44,472
(In case it doesn't get cooked again from the sea breeze...)

1723
01:10:45,442 --> 01:10:48,743
(He blocks the wind thoroughly with the chairs.)

1724
01:10:48,743 --> 01:10:50,713
It must be because it's too cold outside.

1725
01:10:51,142 --> 01:10:52,383
Come inside.

1726
01:10:52,783 --> 01:10:54,152
- Faster. - Wouldn't it take some time?

1727
01:10:54,612 --> 01:10:56,083
- But this... - About 20 minutes?

1728
01:10:56,783 --> 01:10:59,253
Should I cook ramyeon at least?

1729
01:10:59,253 --> 01:11:00,493
It's okay.

1730
01:11:01,123 --> 01:11:06,593
(The assistant chef tries to do something first.)

1731
01:11:07,692 --> 01:11:10,203
(Even before the snow crabs are steamed, )

1732
01:11:10,203 --> 01:11:13,373
(he prepares the ingredients for crab shell fried rice.)

1733
01:11:14,272 --> 01:11:17,472
(Hyo Jin is in deep thought.)

1734
01:11:17,703 --> 01:11:20,812
Dong Il, we have a lot of other delicious food.

1735
01:11:20,812 --> 01:11:23,442
- Why don't we eat sashimi first? - What? Sashimi?

1736
01:11:23,442 --> 01:11:25,512
Should we taste the sashimi first while waiting for the crab?

1737
01:11:25,512 --> 01:11:26,812
- Yes. - Just tasting?

1738
01:11:26,812 --> 01:11:28,312
- We can have it here. - Sounds like a plan!

1739
01:11:28,312 --> 01:11:29,312
We can eat that later.

1740
01:11:29,312 --> 01:11:31,522
- Just eat as a proper meal. - Yes, eat.

1741
01:11:31,652 --> 01:11:33,423
- Exactly. - Set the table there.

1742
01:11:33,692 --> 01:11:34,852
I'll do it, step aside.

1743
01:11:35,493 --> 01:11:38,192
I'll move the icebox away.

1744
01:11:38,192 --> 01:11:39,192
This...

1745
01:11:39,222 --> 01:11:40,463
(The first side menu while the snow crabs get cooked)

1746
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:44,232
I should do it coolly.

1747
01:11:44,762 --> 01:11:46,802
(Tapping)

1748
01:11:48,133 --> 01:11:52,373
(The coolness that manifested from feeling sorry)

1749
01:11:53,112 --> 01:11:55,142
When did you learn how to plate it?

1750
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:56,982
This is the basics.

1751
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:00,083
We're all about the visual. You know that, Hyo Jin.

1752
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,283
(He puts some wasabi beside the sashimi.)

1753
01:12:01,552 --> 01:12:03,052
(Rockfish sashimi high-class edition is completed.)

1754
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:04,052
Then...

1755
01:12:04,123 --> 01:12:09,562
(He also cuts gwamegi into big pieces.)

1756
01:12:10,623 --> 01:12:13,362
I'll put the chewy tail parts near Hyo Jin.

1757
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:17,402
(They are quickly delivered to the guest's table.)

1758
01:12:18,232 --> 01:12:20,102
It looks so good. Can I try one?

1759
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:22,203
I can't hold it back anymore. You should eat first...

1760
01:12:22,203 --> 01:12:23,843
- so that I can eat comfortably. - Try it first.

1761
01:12:24,102 --> 01:12:25,743
(Sending a signal with her eyes)

1762
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:30,213
(Okay.)

1763
01:12:30,213 --> 01:12:31,642
(Hurry up and try.)

1764
01:12:31,883 --> 01:12:32,883
(My goodness.)

1765
01:12:33,253 --> 01:12:35,453
Do you want gwamegi or sashimi?

1766
01:12:37,652 --> 01:12:39,352
Gosh, chojang.

1767
01:12:39,352 --> 01:12:40,823
(She's getting ready to react.)

1768
01:12:42,423 --> 01:12:44,323
(Eating)

1769
01:12:44,963 --> 01:12:45,963
How is it?

1770
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:48,033
- Is it good? - Rockfish!

1771
01:12:48,033 --> 01:12:49,533
As expected of rockfish!

1772
01:12:50,003 --> 01:12:51,333
(Rockfish!)

1773
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,133
(As expected of rockfish!)

1774
01:12:55,873 --> 01:12:58,402
- This is so fresh, right? - Yes.

1775
01:12:58,402 --> 01:12:59,442
(He relaxes a bit after seeing them enjoy the food.)

1776
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:01,942
Imagine if we didn't buy the sashimi.

1777
01:13:02,043 --> 01:13:03,283
(Taking a glance)

1778
01:13:03,482 --> 01:13:04,612
Imagine if we didn't buy the sashimi.

1779
01:13:04,612 --> 01:13:05,982
(Did I do well?)

1780
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:09,012
(Yes, you did!)

1781
01:13:09,012 --> 01:13:11,823
Imagine if we didn't buy the sashimi.

1782
01:13:13,823 --> 01:13:14,823
You're right.

1783
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:16,423
(Jung Se takes a bite of rockfish sashimi.)

1784
01:13:17,663 --> 01:13:19,892
(Dong Il gives one to Si Wan who must be hungry too.)

1785
01:13:21,133 --> 01:13:23,062
(It makes him hum.)

1786
01:13:23,062 --> 01:13:25,062
Sashimi tastes the best.

1787
01:13:27,573 --> 01:13:30,003
- Because of a misunderstanding? - Because of a misunderstanding.

1788
01:13:30,003 --> 01:13:31,673
It didn't come out like that.

1789
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:34,472
- Try this. - It tastes good!

1790
01:13:34,472 --> 01:13:35,673
(Now they just need the pakdal snow crabs to be cooked!)

1791
01:13:35,673 --> 01:13:37,913
- It tastes like the sea. - Yes.

1792
01:13:38,442 --> 01:13:39,982
How is it, Jung Se?

1793
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:41,982
- It tastes good. - Nice.

1794
01:13:42,753 --> 01:13:46,152
Don't eat too much. We have five snow crabs left.

1795
01:13:47,392 --> 01:13:49,892
(Are they cooking well?)

1796
01:13:51,823 --> 01:13:54,062
(The pakdal snow crab is steamed well...)

1797
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:56,463
(while they're eating rockfish sashimi and gwamegi.)

1798
01:13:57,602 --> 01:14:03,003
(The steam is rising even before the lid is opened.)

1799
01:14:05,102 --> 01:14:07,472
It's finally starting to steam.

1800
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,272
Was it steaming like that before?

1801
01:14:09,373 --> 01:14:11,343
No, it wasn't steaming like that just now.

1802
01:14:11,642 --> 01:14:13,612
Should we check out the crabs?

1803
01:14:13,612 --> 01:14:14,783
- I'll check. - Shall we?

1804
01:14:15,652 --> 01:14:17,083
I'll go check them out.

1805
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:18,552
(Let's check them out as it's been some time...)

1806
01:14:18,552 --> 01:14:20,052
(since they started steaming them again.)

1807
01:14:20,793 --> 01:14:23,993
(Steaming)

1808
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:25,993
(How will it be this time?)

1809
01:14:25,993 --> 01:14:27,133
What is this?

1810
01:14:31,003 --> 01:14:33,432
(They're both expectant and worried.)

1811
01:14:34,373 --> 01:14:35,932
(Thick steam)

1812
01:14:35,932 --> 01:14:39,043
I can't see a thing. What's happening?

1813
01:14:39,043 --> 01:14:40,073
(The steam is so thick that they can't see anything.)

1814
01:14:40,073 --> 01:14:42,543
What's this, I can't see a thing!

1815
01:14:45,383 --> 01:14:47,312
- They don't look cooked, right? - The steam's rising up tons,

1816
01:14:47,312 --> 01:14:48,982
but I'm not sure if they're cooked.

1817
01:14:48,982 --> 01:14:49,982
They're not.

1818
01:14:49,982 --> 01:14:52,083
- How? - They're still red.

1819
01:14:52,753 --> 01:14:54,623
(If they're red, it means they're cooked.)

1820
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:57,362
I don't know what's happening.

1821
01:14:57,362 --> 01:14:58,362
Let me see.

1822
01:15:00,593 --> 01:15:04,102
(Chef Sung comes to their aid.)

1823
01:15:04,862 --> 01:15:06,402
I can't see anything even when I open the lid.

1824
01:15:06,573 --> 01:15:07,772
This is, my gosh.

1825
01:15:07,772 --> 01:15:09,003
(Thick steam)

1826
01:15:09,302 --> 01:15:12,442
I think we need to take one out.

1827
01:15:12,442 --> 01:15:14,642
(It's still foggy.)

1828
01:15:14,642 --> 01:15:17,843
(Can you see?)

1829
01:15:17,843 --> 01:15:20,583
(Checking)

1830
01:15:21,413 --> 01:15:23,482
- They're cooked. - Are they?

1831
01:15:23,482 --> 01:15:24,482
Yes.

1832
01:15:28,253 --> 01:15:30,663
I feel like it's cooked for a bit too long.

1833
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:32,093
It's overcooked now.

1834
01:15:32,093 --> 01:15:33,093
- Right? - It's overcooked?

1835
01:15:33,093 --> 01:15:34,932
Should I turn off the fire and cool them down?

1836
01:15:34,932 --> 01:15:36,392
Yes, let's do that.

1837
01:15:36,533 --> 01:15:37,902
Shall we turn off the fire...

1838
01:15:37,902 --> 01:15:40,703
and cool it down a bit while eating sashimi?

1839
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:41,703
Yes.

1840
01:15:42,732 --> 01:15:44,203
It's done, let's sit down.

1841
01:15:44,203 --> 01:15:45,673
(Let's eat for real.)

1842
01:15:45,673 --> 01:15:47,213
- Hyo Jin, you too. - Okay.

1843
01:15:50,682 --> 01:15:52,213
(They just need to cool it down for a while!)

1844
01:15:52,213 --> 01:15:53,512
Let's eat.

1845
01:15:53,512 --> 01:15:55,283
Yes, I'm hungry.

1846
01:15:55,612 --> 01:15:57,423
- It looks so good! - Try it.

1847
01:15:58,182 --> 01:15:59,722
(Let's start eating.)

1848
01:16:00,293 --> 01:16:01,293
It looks so good.

1849
01:16:01,293 --> 01:16:03,963
(Tasting of the gwamegi set)

1850
01:16:04,593 --> 01:16:07,993
("Gwanmok" means to pierce the eyes and dry.)

1851
01:16:07,993 --> 01:16:10,862
("Gwamegi" means to pierce the eyes and dry.)

1852
01:16:11,932 --> 01:16:14,073
(Gwamegi with a chewy texture is Pohang's delicacy...)

1853
01:16:14,073 --> 01:16:16,073
(along with snow crab.)

1854
01:16:16,073 --> 01:16:18,302
(Chewing)

1855
01:16:18,302 --> 01:16:21,173
(The dried laver that Jung Se likes...)

1856
01:16:21,913 --> 01:16:25,713
(is gopchang laver which has great texture and flavor.)

1857
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:29,783
(It goes perfectly well with gwamegi.)

1858
01:16:30,383 --> 01:16:34,253
(He wraps gwamegi in laver and takes a big bite.)

1859
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,522
Gwamegi is really good.

1860
01:16:37,663 --> 01:16:40,293
(Hyo Jin takes a bite.)

1861
01:16:40,293 --> 01:16:41,293
(Nice!)

1862
01:16:41,762 --> 01:16:45,802
(Jung Se takes a bite too.)

1863
01:16:46,362 --> 01:16:48,102
(It's delicious.)

1864
01:16:48,633 --> 01:16:50,543
Everyone's enjoying it.

1865
01:16:50,543 --> 01:16:51,972
(I'm glad they like it.)

1866
01:16:52,602 --> 01:16:55,213
(He checks to see if there's anything else he can serve.)

1867
01:16:55,772 --> 01:16:58,243
(Looking carefully)

1868
01:16:58,982 --> 01:17:00,812
(Glancing)

1869
01:17:01,612 --> 01:17:05,823
(He wraps gwamegi and garlic with gopchang laver.)

1870
01:17:06,253 --> 01:17:08,052
- Here you go. - Thank you.

1871
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:09,652
I put in raw garlic too.

1872
01:17:09,652 --> 01:17:11,722
(The assistant chef is the one to take care of Chef Sung.)

1873
01:17:11,722 --> 01:17:12,722
(Savoring)

1874
01:17:13,293 --> 01:17:15,732
The gwamegi doesn't taste fishy. Try it, Hee Won.

1875
01:17:15,732 --> 01:17:17,203
- Is it tasty? - Yes.

1876
01:17:17,902 --> 01:17:19,833
Have you tried gwamegi before?

1877
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:22,003
- I did try once. - Yes.

1878
01:17:22,673 --> 01:17:23,942
He has a childish palate.

1879
01:17:23,942 --> 01:17:28,243
I actually don't really like food like this.

1880
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:29,312
(Just try it once.)

1881
01:17:29,673 --> 01:17:31,713
But gwamegi...

1882
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:34,213
has a savory taste.

1883
01:17:34,213 --> 01:17:35,753
(He suspiciously takes a bite.)

1884
01:17:37,982 --> 01:17:40,493
(How is it?)

1885
01:17:41,793 --> 01:17:46,493
(Chewing)

1886
01:17:46,493 --> 01:17:48,333
(Nodding)

1887
01:17:48,732 --> 01:17:50,663
Gwamegi is very chewy.

1888
01:17:52,333 --> 01:17:53,902
(Thank goodness)

1889
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:55,133
- Jung Se, - Yes.

1890
01:17:55,633 --> 01:17:56,772
Try the one I give you.

1891
01:17:58,073 --> 01:18:01,043
Jung Se, eat the tails and talk a lot.

1892
01:18:01,142 --> 01:18:02,142
Okay.

1893
01:18:02,142 --> 01:18:03,142
(He gives the tails to Jung Se who must've been tense the whole day.)

1894
01:18:03,243 --> 01:18:04,883
How is it, Jung Se?

1895
01:18:05,142 --> 01:18:07,253
It's delicious.

1896
01:18:08,612 --> 01:18:11,283
(He feels at ease now since everyone enjoys the food.)

1897
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:15,552
(He sits down and takes a bite.)

1898
01:18:16,093 --> 01:18:17,123
(Amazing.)

1899
01:18:19,293 --> 01:18:21,163
Dong Il, gwamegi...

1900
01:18:21,593 --> 01:18:23,432
- It's nice. - Yes.

1901
01:18:23,602 --> 01:18:24,802
We're in Pohang!

1902
01:18:25,802 --> 01:18:28,133
Pohang is gwamegi.

1903
01:18:28,402 --> 01:18:29,472
We're in Pohang.

1904
01:18:29,472 --> 01:18:31,642
(The true taste of Pohang, gwamegi)

1905
01:18:32,772 --> 01:18:35,272
(For the rest who eats well)

1906
01:18:35,812 --> 01:18:39,112
This is chewy and cool, I really like this.

1907
01:18:42,052 --> 01:18:43,682
We should eat seaweed too.

1908
01:18:43,682 --> 01:18:45,482
Yes. We can eat it raw.

1909
01:18:45,482 --> 01:18:47,552
- Eat this with seaweed? - Yes.

1910
01:18:48,453 --> 01:18:50,663
Here, I want to eat this.

1911
01:18:51,923 --> 01:18:54,232
I'll just dip this in chojang,

1912
01:18:54,232 --> 01:18:57,663
(The scent of the ocean fills your mouth.)

1913
01:18:59,833 --> 01:19:00,902
It's delicious.

1914
01:19:01,402 --> 01:19:02,472
It's really nice.

1915
01:19:02,472 --> 01:19:06,743
(He adds gwamegi for a better taste.)

1916
01:19:08,012 --> 01:19:09,913
(Chewy)

1917
01:19:11,142 --> 01:19:14,453
(Adding napa cabbage and gwamegi to seaweed for a wrap)

1918
01:19:14,453 --> 01:19:16,453
The seaweed goes so well with gwamegi.

1919
01:19:20,123 --> 01:19:22,022
(He checks on the snow crabs even when he's eating.)

1920
01:19:22,293 --> 01:19:23,522
It's a little fishy,

1921
01:19:23,793 --> 01:19:25,722
but once you know the taste of it, you'll love it.

1922
01:19:25,722 --> 01:19:26,762
(Si Wan who has a small mouth...)

1923
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:30,133
(has a bite of gwamegi wrap...)

1924
01:19:30,133 --> 01:19:33,302
(and a bite of seaweed separately.)

1925
01:19:36,073 --> 01:19:37,673
This is seriously so good.

1926
01:19:38,743 --> 01:19:39,843
- Is it good? - Yes.

1927
01:19:39,843 --> 01:19:41,073
(Nodding)

1928
01:19:41,073 --> 01:19:43,012
He said he was hungry when we were at the market.

1929
01:19:43,312 --> 01:19:45,182
He kept zoning out like this.

1930
01:19:46,312 --> 01:19:48,012
I didn't know you guys would love gwamegi this much.

1931
01:19:48,012 --> 01:19:49,512
It has the taste of the ocean.

1932
01:19:49,883 --> 01:19:52,953
(The taste of the ocean enjoyed with the ocean waves)

1933
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:56,323
We need to get ready to have the pakdal snow crab.

1934
01:19:56,593 --> 01:19:58,663
- I'll go and check. - Don't eat this too much.

1935
01:19:58,993 --> 01:20:00,963
I'll go and take them out. Get them through the window.

1936
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,593
Okay, I'll clear the table then.

1937
01:20:02,593 --> 01:20:04,232
- Clear it a little. - Okay.

1938
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:05,663
(It's time to have the pakdal snow crab.)

1939
01:20:05,663 --> 01:20:07,533
Put the cutting board on here.

1940
01:20:10,703 --> 01:20:12,873
Has it been an hour and a half?

1941
01:20:13,073 --> 01:20:14,213
I know, right?

1942
01:20:14,213 --> 01:20:15,472
It's almost like samgyetang.

1943
01:20:15,713 --> 01:20:17,312
(Laughing)

1944
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,642
It's boiled like how samgyetang is made.

1945
01:20:19,913 --> 01:20:21,953
It's like making beef leg bone broth.

1946
01:20:21,953 --> 01:20:23,283
(It's time to have the pakdal snow crab.)

1947
01:20:23,283 --> 01:20:24,423
Why did you turn off the lights?

1948
01:20:25,552 --> 01:20:26,993
(Why did you turn off the lights?)

1949
01:20:27,593 --> 01:20:28,923
It wasn't me.

1950
01:20:29,352 --> 01:20:30,762
Wait, this is...

1951
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:33,692
(What's going on?)

1952
01:20:33,793 --> 01:20:37,503
(Looking around)

1953
01:20:41,673 --> 01:20:43,373
The fuse must be blown.

1954
01:20:43,402 --> 01:20:44,472
Put it back up again.

1955
01:20:46,073 --> 01:20:47,573
Dong Il, the switches are all on.

1956
01:20:47,713 --> 01:20:51,043
- It must be the electricity. - It must be. It sounded like that.

1957
01:20:52,043 --> 01:20:53,713
Are you doing this deliberately?

1958
01:20:53,713 --> 01:20:55,352
Are you making your trip difficult on purpose?

1959
01:20:55,352 --> 01:20:56,383
I know.

1960
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:59,352
- Move over. - They're all switched up. Look.

1961
01:20:59,352 --> 01:21:02,493
(Very concerned)

1962
01:21:03,052 --> 01:21:04,262
- Why is this happening... - Move over.

1963
01:21:04,262 --> 01:21:05,262
when I didn't even do anything?

1964
01:21:05,262 --> 01:21:07,432
- There are no spare parts? - Move over.

1965
01:21:07,432 --> 01:21:08,892
- Hang on. - Even the heater is off.

1966
01:21:11,663 --> 01:21:13,232
I think it'd be fun if we keep the lights off.

1967
01:21:13,232 --> 01:21:14,272
(Laughing)

1968
01:21:14,732 --> 01:21:16,402
(Laughing)

1969
01:21:16,802 --> 01:21:19,043
Does that mean we can't sleep here?

1970
01:21:19,772 --> 01:21:20,972
Should we look for hotels?

1971
01:21:20,972 --> 01:21:22,272
(Being guileful)

1972
01:21:22,913 --> 01:21:24,312
We have no other choice.

1973
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:25,682
(Laughing)

1974
01:21:26,953 --> 01:21:29,283
- I guess it was overloaded. - I know.

1975
01:21:29,283 --> 01:21:30,923
(He's being super guileful.)

1976
01:21:30,923 --> 01:21:32,083
(Dumbfounded)

1977
01:21:32,323 --> 01:21:33,323
(Electricity off)

1978
01:21:33,323 --> 01:21:35,652
Now that the lights are off, you're finally talking?

1979
01:21:35,652 --> 01:21:37,993
(Shyness off)

1980
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:40,432
It's so hard to eat the snow crabs. The timing...

1981
01:21:40,432 --> 01:21:42,562
- It's the worst timing. - It's the worst.

1982
01:21:42,562 --> 01:21:43,833
They must be getting cold.

1983
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:45,203
(They're in unfavorable conditions to have the pakdal snow crab.)

1984
01:21:45,203 --> 01:21:46,802
Outside...

1985
01:21:47,673 --> 01:21:48,703
(Lights on)

1986
01:21:49,373 --> 01:21:51,642
The lights are back on. Don't plug anything in there.

1987
01:21:51,642 --> 01:21:53,203
I didn't plug anything.

1988
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:57,083
(He's shy again.)

1989
01:21:57,982 --> 01:21:59,383
- That's right. - Let's continue eating now.

1990
01:21:59,383 --> 01:22:00,812
- Let's eat now. - Okay.

1991
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:02,413
(Will they finally get to taste the pakdal snow crab?)

1992
01:22:02,438 --> 01:22:04,757
Act as if nothing happened and act naturally.

1993
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:06,499
(Will they finally get to taste the pakdal snow crab?)

1994
01:22:06,499 --> 01:22:09,339
Act as if nothing happened and act naturally.

1995
01:22:09,339 --> 01:22:10,870
(We've been waiting for so long.)

1996
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:12,469
There are crabs here.

1997
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,539
Wow, that's amazing.

1998
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:17,905
(The pakdal snow crab who made everyone go through a hard time...)

1999
01:22:17,905 --> 01:22:19,275
Here it is!

2000
01:22:20,775 --> 01:22:23,015
So these are the popular pakdal snow crabs.

2001
01:22:23,015 --> 01:22:24,376
(Looking delicious)

2002
01:22:24,676 --> 01:22:25,746
(Exclaiming)

2003
01:22:26,445 --> 01:22:27,645
- Hyo Jin. - Yes.

2004
01:22:27,645 --> 01:22:29,015
You can eat all you want.

2005
01:22:29,615 --> 01:22:30,786
- Stuff yourself. - I got it.

2006
01:22:32,786 --> 01:22:33,985
Shall I eat them now?

2007
01:22:35,985 --> 01:22:39,296
(They get ready to eat solemnly.)

2008
01:22:39,466 --> 01:22:41,466
- Can I have a glove too? - Sure.

2009
01:22:43,395 --> 01:22:46,466
(Si Wan puts on a glove as well.)

2010
01:22:46,636 --> 01:22:48,336
Hang on. I'll cut them for you.

2011
01:22:48,636 --> 01:22:49,975
I'll cut them for you. You can go ahead and eat.

2012
01:22:50,376 --> 01:22:51,575
Open this up.

2013
01:22:51,735 --> 01:22:53,605
- Wow, the pakdal snow crab. - It's a treasure.

2014
01:22:53,605 --> 01:22:56,105
(Scarlet pakdal snow crab)

2015
01:22:56,975 --> 01:23:00,916
(The underdone tomalley broke Chef Sung's heart.)

2016
01:23:02,246 --> 01:23:04,115
- Open this up. - Wow, the pakdal snow crab.

2017
01:23:04,115 --> 01:23:05,155
It's a treasure.

2018
01:23:05,155 --> 01:23:06,756
(Inside the shell that opens softly...)

2019
01:23:07,855 --> 01:23:09,225
(is well-cooked tomalley that's mouth-watering.)

2020
01:23:09,225 --> 01:23:11,525
It's full of tomalley.

2021
01:23:11,796 --> 01:23:13,426
Hence the name, pakdal snow crab.

2022
01:23:13,765 --> 01:23:15,296
It's filled with meat.

2023
01:23:15,296 --> 01:23:16,765
(Filled with meat inside the red shell)

2024
01:23:17,435 --> 01:23:20,136
(Today's main dish, pakdal snow crab)

2025
01:23:21,006 --> 01:23:24,105
(Shall we eat it in earnest now?)

2026
01:23:25,376 --> 01:23:27,275
(Doing his best)

2027
01:23:28,006 --> 01:23:29,546
(He rips the legs for them.)

2028
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:30,815
Let me rip all of them first.

2029
01:23:31,475 --> 01:23:32,815
Eat the ones I ripped.

2030
01:23:32,815 --> 01:23:33,945
(Mouth watering)

2031
01:23:35,346 --> 01:23:38,556
(Hee Won's mouth waters as Dong Il rips the legs.)

2032
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:42,655
(Grabbing the leg...)

2033
01:23:42,655 --> 01:23:44,655
(and taking a bite)

2034
01:23:50,235 --> 01:23:51,935
My gosh, this is so good.

2035
01:23:51,935 --> 01:23:52,966
(And the hungry Si Wan...)

2036
01:23:52,966 --> 01:23:55,706
(takes a bite as well.)

2037
01:23:59,006 --> 01:24:00,975
(Meanwhile, Hyo Jin...)

2038
01:24:01,206 --> 01:24:02,575
We got scissors here.

2039
01:24:02,575 --> 01:24:03,876
(tries the legs first.)

2040
01:24:07,515 --> 01:24:09,716
(Putting it straight into her mouth)

2041
01:24:10,456 --> 01:24:11,556
It's still warm.

2042
01:24:11,556 --> 01:24:12,855
- Let me cut these for you. - Have one.

2043
01:24:13,956 --> 01:24:16,155
(Staring)

2044
01:24:17,155 --> 01:24:18,355
I'll give you one. Let's try it.

2045
01:24:18,355 --> 01:24:20,496
(Jung Se closely watches Hyo Jin.)

2046
01:24:21,195 --> 01:24:24,435
- I'll get the tomalley. - Right. Let's get the tomalley.

2047
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:25,695
I'll get all of the tomalley.

2048
01:24:26,336 --> 01:24:29,676
(Putting it straight into his mouth)

2049
01:24:30,275 --> 01:24:32,376
(It's good.)

2050
01:24:32,706 --> 01:24:34,605
This feels like having drumsticks.

2051
01:24:34,605 --> 01:24:36,475
(This time, Hyo Jin uses scissors.)

2052
01:24:36,746 --> 01:24:38,546
This feels like having drumsticks.

2053
01:24:38,546 --> 01:24:40,485
(Peeking)

2054
01:24:40,615 --> 01:24:43,685
You need to play with your kids on your days off, right?

2055
01:24:43,886 --> 01:24:45,685
Yes, I try to play with them on my days off.

2056
01:24:46,586 --> 01:24:49,525
- Its taste is incredible. - It's the natural taste of the sea.

2057
01:24:49,525 --> 01:24:52,496
(Skillful)

2058
01:24:53,126 --> 01:24:54,765
There's so much meat inside.

2059
01:24:55,496 --> 01:24:57,435
(Slurping)

2060
01:24:59,806 --> 01:25:01,836
Jung Se is eating so well without a word.

2061
01:25:01,836 --> 01:25:02,865
(He's slurping the snow crab following after skillful Hyo Jin.)

2062
01:25:03,775 --> 01:25:05,775
(Dong Il hurriedly takes a bite after going through a lot.)

2063
01:25:05,775 --> 01:25:07,546
This is also good for your health.

2064
01:25:08,246 --> 01:25:09,575
It's filled with meat.

2065
01:25:14,685 --> 01:25:16,485
(Happy)

2066
01:25:16,485 --> 01:25:17,655
It's so good.

2067
01:25:17,655 --> 01:25:19,485
(You like it that much?)

2068
01:25:19,725 --> 01:25:20,956
What did you say?

2069
01:25:21,256 --> 01:25:22,786
You can have this.

2070
01:25:22,956 --> 01:25:24,056
Have this.

2071
01:25:24,056 --> 01:25:26,225
(Thank you.)

2072
01:25:30,036 --> 01:25:31,865
(Have a bite, Hyo Jin.)

2073
01:25:31,865 --> 01:25:33,806
- Come on. - You're right.

2074
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,466
Thank you.

2075
01:25:35,935 --> 01:25:38,905
(Have a bite, Jung Se.)

2076
01:25:38,905 --> 01:25:40,506
Oh, thank you for this.

2077
01:25:40,506 --> 01:25:43,176
- Yours is here. - No, it's meant for you.

2078
01:25:44,475 --> 01:25:45,815
- We're feeding each other. - It's meant for you.

2079
01:25:45,815 --> 01:25:47,216
You can have this then.

2080
01:25:47,216 --> 01:25:48,815
(House on Wheels is especially heartwarming today.)

2081
01:25:49,855 --> 01:25:52,786
(The shells pile up as they affectionately share the crabs.)

2082
01:25:56,926 --> 01:25:58,395
Wow, look at this.

2083
01:25:58,926 --> 01:26:02,565
- Here. Here, here. Have this. - Thank you.

2084
01:26:03,935 --> 01:26:05,336
(Desperate)

2085
01:26:05,336 --> 01:26:07,706
Doesn't the meat between the claw taste the best?

2086
01:26:07,706 --> 01:26:10,075
(They share love as they share the crab meat.)

2087
01:26:10,075 --> 01:26:11,806
(Wrong delivery)

2088
01:26:11,806 --> 01:26:12,876
It's on his face.

2089
01:26:15,006 --> 01:26:16,876
(Flustered)

2090
01:26:17,046 --> 01:26:18,246
Is it from mine?

2091
01:26:19,475 --> 01:26:20,716
I'll save it for later.

2092
01:26:20,716 --> 01:26:21,916
What did you say?

2093
01:26:22,515 --> 01:26:24,485
(Sorry.)

2094
01:26:25,386 --> 01:26:27,786
