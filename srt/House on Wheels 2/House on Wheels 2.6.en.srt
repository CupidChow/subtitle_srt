1
00:00:28,318 --> 00:00:30,848
(Today's front yard is filled with silver grass.)

2
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:33,618
(It's Mount Taehwa's silver grass field.)

3
00:00:33,757 --> 00:00:37,087
(Today's guest appears casually.)

4
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:39,288
(Charismatic Jeon Hye Jin)

5
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:40,928
(Here. Hold it.)

6
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:42,327
(She casually gives away the gift as soon as she arrives.)

7
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:44,027
(You've become prettier.)

8
00:00:44,027 --> 00:00:46,097
(Cynical)

9
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:48,937
(Hye Jin's plan was to do nothing.)

10
00:00:49,137 --> 00:00:50,838
(Neat)

11
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:54,738
(She helps with the preparation too.)

12
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:56,747
(A cocktail show just for Hye Jin)

13
00:00:57,548 --> 00:00:58,808
(It's so good!)

14
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:00,948
(It's Hye Jin's first appearance on a variety show.)

15
00:01:00,948 --> 00:01:02,978
(What events are waiting for her?)

16
00:01:04,317 --> 00:01:09,717
(Yangdong Folk Village where spring rain is falling)

17
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:12,158
Hey, come here.

18
00:01:12,158 --> 00:01:14,027
Let's set up the tarp first.

19
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:16,667
We need to set it up to have Na Ra eat dinner outside.

20
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:18,728
We need to set up the tarp first.

21
00:01:18,728 --> 00:01:19,728
I'm so thirsty.

22
00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:21,597
Na Ra, you can sit and have sikhye.

23
00:01:21,597 --> 00:01:23,567
I'll make doenjang stew.

24
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,338
- Doenjang stew? Okay.
- Yes.

25
00:01:25,338 --> 00:01:26,838
Please make us nice doenjang stew.

26
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:28,207
- I'll go and make it.
- Okay.

27
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:30,347
(Heaped up)

28
00:01:31,147 --> 00:01:33,447
I'll need to prepare it first.

29
00:01:34,147 --> 00:01:37,617
I'll need to prepare it so I can wash it.

30
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:39,787
All right.

31
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:43,287
You're experiencing camping in earnest, Ms. Oh.

32
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:44,287
Right.

33
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:46,227
- Try lifting it.
- Na Ra, go inside.

34
00:01:46,227 --> 00:01:51,268
- You want me to go under here?
- Na Ra, go inside.

35
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:52,498
Oh, inside the house?

36
00:01:52,597 --> 00:01:54,697
We need to close the door. The space is too tight.

37
00:01:56,097 --> 00:01:57,367
All right, I will...

38
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,438
- Doenjang?
- make doenjang stew.

39
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:03,477
(Checking the ingredients in the fridge)

40
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:05,147
We have some beef brisket.

41
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:07,347
- Doenjang stew with beef brisket?
- Shall we have that?

42
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:09,918
Shall I make doenjang stew with beef brisket? Okay.

43
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,488
All right.

44
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:13,018
Okay.

45
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:14,957
(Shall I begin now?)

46
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:17,688
(Chopping)

47
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:21,557
(Her chopping skill is extraordinary.)

48
00:02:22,197 --> 00:02:23,998
(She evenly chops the small chilis.)

49
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:26,397
(She also cuts the tofu in neat cubes.)

50
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:28,438
(Glancing)

51
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:31,568
(Onara, onara)

52
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,008
(Come to me)

53
00:02:36,508 --> 00:02:38,277
(Neatly organize...)

54
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:40,478
(the ingredients that you chopped.)

55
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:41,978
The ingredients are ready.

56
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:43,048
(She's as good as Jang Geum.)

57
00:02:43,277 --> 00:02:46,318
- You must be good at cooking.
- What do you mean?

58
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,117
- They're all so neat.
- Come on.

59
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:51,657
They're very consistent in size.

60
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:54,698
All right. Nice.

61
00:02:54,997 --> 00:02:57,098
(Sizzling)

62
00:02:57,768 --> 00:02:59,168
You need to grill it first?

63
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:00,668
Yes, you should grill it first.

64
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:05,638
Then I'll grill it for you.

65
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:08,638
- Can I grill it however I want?
- Yes, as long as it gets cooked.

66
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:11,277
When it's almost cooked...

67
00:03:11,277 --> 00:03:13,307
Yes. It's done.

68
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:16,277
Well done. Add some radish.

69
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:21,117
Radish makes the broth more refreshing.

70
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,318
It removes the unpleasant taste.

71
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:25,527
(I see.)

72
00:03:25,527 --> 00:03:27,198
Keep stir-frying the meat and radish.

73
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:31,328
(Dong Il and Hee Won are preparing their dinner table.)

74
00:03:31,328 --> 00:03:33,598
Put this over there.

75
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:35,068
How do we turn this thing on?

76
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:37,238
- This? There's a switch here.
- This one?

77
00:03:38,038 --> 00:03:39,967
- Where?
- This one. It's on.

78
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:41,578
- You only need to press it once.
- Oh, it's on.

79
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:43,138
- Which one should I press?
- This one.

80
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:44,548
Okay.

81
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:47,518
I did what you can't do.

82
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:49,348
- What?
- There are things I can do...

83
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:50,418
which you can't.

84
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:53,117
We don't need anyone else's help now.

85
00:03:53,117 --> 00:03:55,018
(They make a good team.)

86
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:58,027
How's this, Ms. Oh? Isn't this enough to make you tear up?

87
00:03:58,027 --> 00:03:59,228
Wow, it's so nice.

88
00:03:59,228 --> 00:04:02,427
We don't invite people if we can't make a nice setting.

89
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:04,328
- You did it in no time.
- Come on.

90
00:04:05,768 --> 00:04:07,497
I'm done making the stew. We have rice, right?

91
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,497
I made it already.

92
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:11,837
- It's ready.
- We made it as soon as we got here.

93
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:13,638
- Really?
- As soon as we got back.

94
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:16,707
- You open it like this.
- Let me see.

95
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:23,348
You said you made it.

96
00:04:24,518 --> 00:04:26,348
We did. We really did.

97
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:27,418
(Of course. We know better than that.)

98
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:29,717
(Dumbfounded)

99
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:31,728
You made a lot, Dong Il.

100
00:04:31,728 --> 00:04:33,228
- It looks good.
- I did it on purpose.

101
00:04:37,497 --> 00:04:38,497
What's wrong?

102
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:40,997
- What is it?
- Is it not cooked?

103
00:04:40,997 --> 00:04:42,038
- Still?
- Yes.

104
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:45,937
Dong Il, you must've not plugged it in properly.

105
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:48,038
You're supposed to press the button.

106
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,377
- Is it uncooked?
- It's uncooked!

107
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:51,548
(Thanks to somebody, they'll have to eat it raw.)

108
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:53,377
- Then press the button now!
- Si Wan!

109
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:56,947
Si Wan! You should've pressed the button!

110
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:58,247
I cooked the rice today?

111
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:00,048
Who did it?

112
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:03,257
You did! Hee Won did it.

113
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:05,158
Hee Won, you did it.

114
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:08,228
Gosh, he slays me like this again.

115
00:05:08,427 --> 00:05:10,598
We always blame others.

116
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:13,228
How come we always blame others?

117
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:14,738
Who washed rice earlier?

118
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:17,538
- Rice? You did.
- No, I didn't.

119
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:20,007
This is so funny.

120
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,807
The rice is prepared well,

121
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:24,278
but somebody forgot to press the cook button.

122
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:25,877
- Right. I think so.
- Right.

123
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:28,478
The thing is, I don't know which button is the cook button.

124
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:31,848
So I'm sure it wasn't me. I'd have asked otherwise.

125
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:33,247
Then who is it? It's one of these two.

126
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:36,187
I always cook rice, but I don't remember...

127
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:38,387
- making it today.
- It's Hee Won.

128
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:43,398
- Is it you, Hee Won?
- It's Hee Won.

129
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:45,327
You washed the rice, didn't you?

130
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:48,437
Gosh, I'm getting all the blame again.

131
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:52,468
It wasn't my job to make rice today.

132
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:57,007
Right. Then is it me again? Is that it?

133
00:05:57,877 --> 00:06:00,208
- It's me again? I didn't do it.
- No, I didn't mean that.

134
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,947
Gosh, you're entertaining me...

135
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:03,788
- with rice.
- I really don't know the button.

136
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,065
Then who is it? It's one of these two.

137
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:08,606
Gosh, you're entertaining me...

138
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:10,406
- with rice.
- I really don't know the button.

139
00:06:11,146 --> 00:06:14,546
(It was in the morning when they were busy welcoming their guest.)

140
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,245
(Do we have any rice left?)

141
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:18,815
(Hee Won brings up rice first.)

142
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:23,286
(Dong Il took out the rice.)

143
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:26,226
(Hee Won only talks about it, but doesn't go anywhere near it.)

144
00:06:26,526 --> 00:06:28,656
(I should make it in advance.)

145
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,096
(Dong Il brazenly pours the rice into a bowl.)

146
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,135
(Nonchalant)

147
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,135
(He even washed the rice to cook it.)

148
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:43,235
(Wait, it's Si Wan who washed the rice.)

149
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:46,846
(He turns around after washing the rice.)

150
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,976
(Then he naturally puts the rice into the cooker.)

151
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:52,586
(He doesn't press the cook button and leaves nonchalantly.)

152
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:56,115
(It was Si Wan!)

153
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,356
This is so funny. It'll be so funny if we find out who did it.

154
00:06:58,356 --> 00:06:59,425
(Was it me?)

155
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:02,356
I think it was me. It'd be better if it was me.

156
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,466
No, it's okay. Things were hectic in the morning.

157
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:05,995
Did you press it?

158
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,266
- I did.
- Then it's all settled.

159
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:13,706
Wait. Then it'll take about 30 to 40 minutes, right?

160
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:15,206
- No, it'll take 20 minutes.
- It'll take 50 minutes.

161
00:07:15,706 --> 00:07:17,346
(Surprised)

162
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:18,575
- 50 minutes?
- Yes.

163
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:20,546
- Wait. What?
- It takes at least 50 minutes.

164
00:07:21,716 --> 00:07:23,445
(Sighing)

165
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:24,716
Do we have instant rice?

166
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:26,115
(Laughing)

167
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:28,216
- 50 minutes? Wow.
- It takes 50 minutes.

168
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:30,685
Doesn't it have the turbo function?

169
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,086
It does have the quick-cooking function.

170
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,125
Then press that button.

171
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:37,125
Let's just eat it even if it's uncooked.

172
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:43,036
It's more picturesque now that it's raining.

173
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:44,036
Isn't it so nice?

174
00:07:44,036 --> 00:07:45,906
And the vibe suits this village.

175
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:50,106
It's really nice to see rain falling on a thatched-roofed house.

176
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:51,106
(They enjoy the rainy evening while waiting for the rice to be ready.)

177
00:07:51,476 --> 00:07:54,776
It's the most tranquil evening we've had so far.

178
00:07:54,776 --> 00:07:55,776
That's right.

179
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:56,776
(A drizzle falling...)

180
00:07:56,776 --> 00:08:00,445
(in the tranquil village filled with hanok)

181
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:04,455
Why is it raining out of the blue in spring?

182
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:07,725
It's spring rain. Let's listen to "Spring Rain".

183
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:10,296
- "Spring Rain"?
- Spring rain.

184
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:11,526
(Spring rain, you make me cry)

185
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,166
You make me.

186
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,195
Wait, no. Why did I say that?

187
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:18,136
Na Ra, we'll play a song for you.

188
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:20,105
Sure. I'll look forward to it.

189
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:22,406
("Spring Rain" by Park In Soo)

190
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:23,406
No way.

191
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:26,376
You know this song, right?

192
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:29,746
(He gets closer so that Na Ra can hear it.)

193
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:30,746
Do you know this song?

194
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,355
Is that you? Oh, it's not.

195
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,815
It's "Spring Rain".

196
00:08:36,085 --> 00:08:37,626
Oh, it's "Spring Rain"?

197
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:42,055
Dong Il wanted to listen to this song because it's raining.

198
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:45,366
What happened? What's wrong with this thing?

199
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,296
This song...

200
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:49,465
(I know this song.)

201
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:52,506
(Flustered)

202
00:08:52,506 --> 00:08:53,506
What's wrong with this?

203
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:55,675
(Open your eyes)

204
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:56,776
(Suddenly cut off)

205
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:59,046
(The song is changed again.)

206
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:03,945
Oh, dear. I found out the reason.

207
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:06,516
- What is it?
- I need to pay for its membership.

208
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:07,955
Oh, it's a 30-second preview?

209
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:10,685
- I can play it for just 1 minute.
- 1 minute?

210
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:12,685
(It plays random songs every 1 minute.)

211
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,355
(Gosh, Hee Won.)

212
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:19,095
(The raindrops)

213
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:20,666
(Suddenly cut off)

214
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:22,766
(The song changed again.)

215
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,805
(This song is nice too.)

216
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:26,705
(Dancing)

217
00:09:27,036 --> 00:09:28,305
I like this song too.

218
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:30,646
(Dong Il likes it too.)

219
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:32,406
(Excited)

220
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,605
(Suddenly cut off)

221
00:09:33,605 --> 00:09:34,815
(Frustrated)

222
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:35,815
We can only listen to a minute of it?

223
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:37,685
I paid for the membership.

224
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:41,855
Now we can listen to a 2 minute and 40 second song.

225
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:45,386
(Enjoy it all you want.)

226
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:48,026
You know how to get into the rhythm.

227
00:09:48,225 --> 00:09:49,725
(Dancing)

228
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,766
(I'm a good dancer too.)

229
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,236
(Oh Jang Geum's doenjang stew with beef brisket recipe)

230
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:56,666
(Use a sieve to dissolve the doenjang well.)

231
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,006
I need gochujang.

232
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:00,236
(It's time to put in gochujang.)

233
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:04,175
I like adding gochujang to doenjang stew.

234
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,675
If you add a bit of sugar,

235
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,646
it removes the unpleasant taste of gochujang.

236
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:13,016
- Oh, really?
- Yes, and it doesn't become sweet.

237
00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:14,986
Just a bit.

238
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:16,085
(Add a bit of sugar to make gochujang softer.)

239
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:17,286
- Just a bit?
- Yes.

240
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:21,925
(Now it's time to add all sorts of vegetables.)

241
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:23,925
(Onions, )

242
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:25,965
(zucchini, )

243
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:27,666
(and tofu)

244
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,935
(Add all sorts of vegetables.)

245
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,305
My, the color is really pretty.

246
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:33,805
- Right? It looks so good.
- It's really pretty.

247
00:10:35,036 --> 00:10:37,445
(The doenjang stew with beef brisket is finally ready.)

248
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:39,945
What's the point of finishing it fast when the rice isn't ready?

249
00:10:40,205 --> 00:10:41,575
(Laughing)

250
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,286
That made me a little guilty.

251
00:10:45,116 --> 00:10:48,916
(They're having a good time.)

252
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:51,256
Hee Won, did something about them upset you?

253
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:54,996
(Displeased)

254
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:57,296
Come here. Watching them will only upset you.

255
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:00,666
We meant nothing to her.

256
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:03,266
What? What does he mean by that? What did he say?

257
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:04,906
Why would you mutter to yourself?

258
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:07,876
We have 15 more minutes until the rice is done.

259
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:09,776
It's almost ready.

260
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:13,406
- How do I cut it? In half?
- Cut it in half.

261
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,646
(They cut water parsley, the highlight of the day.)

262
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:15,845
That doesn't matter.

263
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:19,546
This is gondalbi. It's a Gyeongju specialty.

264
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,546
(Adding gondalbi, the Gyeongju specialty)

265
00:11:20,756 --> 00:11:22,215
Let's grill some tofu too.

266
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,685
(Adding tofu to grill)

267
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:26,386
(It looks like they'll be full from the vegetables alone.)

268
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,126
I'll bring it out.

269
00:11:28,126 --> 00:11:31,325
(They're done preparing vegetables for wraps!)

270
00:11:31,666 --> 00:11:33,195
Give it to me, I'll take it.

271
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:36,835
(Today's dinner is almost ready.)

272
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:37,835
Shall we open it?

273
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:39,036
(They finally check the long-awaited rice.)

274
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,675
(Impressed)

275
00:11:41,675 --> 00:11:44,345
- Did you just hear that sound?
- Look at its color.

276
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:45,746
(Thankfully, the rice is cooked well.)

277
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,246
- I have good news.
- What is it?

278
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:48,246
The rice is ready.

279
00:11:48,246 --> 00:11:49,445
- Is it?
- Yes.

280
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,715
It's well cooked, as white as snow.

281
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:52,815
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

282
00:11:53,585 --> 00:11:54,756
(Thick and juicy pork belly)

283
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,085
It looks so delicious.

284
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:59,455
- All the ingredients are fresh.
- Right.

285
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,325
We brought it from the village.

286
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:05,526
(Na Ra's doenjang stew with beef brisket)

287
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:09,736
It looks delicious indeed. What a lavish meal!

288
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:14,805
(Safely filmed with permission from the owner and the local government.)

289
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,175
(Exclaiming in admiration)

290
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:20,815
(Sizzling)

291
00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:21,876
Gosh, this is...

292
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:24,185
They say water parsley in spring is tasty.

293
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:25,416
(Adding water parsley which is in season in spring)

294
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:30,085
I'll slightly stir-fry water parsley in pork oil.

295
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:31,126
In pork oil.

296
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:32,725
Gosh, this is no joke.

297
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:34,526
Look at that visual.

298
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:36,055
(Eye-catching)

299
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:39,325
(He stir-fries water parsley first, )

300
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:41,835
- Try this first.
- Goodness.

301
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:43,496
- Look at this water parsley.
- Only water parsley?

302
00:12:44,506 --> 00:12:46,705
I'm so curious about this.

303
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:48,406
(What will the water parsley from the village taste like?)

304
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:51,006
(Taking a bite)

305
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:53,475
- How's it?
- It's so soft.

306
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:56,046
- Is the water parsley tasty?
- Yes, it's soft.

307
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:57,886
- Yes, it's delicious.
- Is it good?

308
00:12:57,886 --> 00:12:59,246
Yes, it's really soft.

309
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:00,786
It's not prickly at all.

310
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:02,986
Isn't it so soft?

311
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:05,986
How come this water parsley is so soft?

312
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,626
(How soft is it?)

313
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,026
(Savoring)

314
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,396
I like the smell of water parsley.

315
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:13,496
(Sniffing)

316
00:13:14,736 --> 00:13:15,766
(Proud)

317
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:17,065
- It's so good.
- Is it really?

318
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:18,136
Yes, gosh!

319
00:13:18,136 --> 00:13:19,605
(They only tried the water parsley, but it tastes so good.)

320
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,335
Okay, I'll give you the meat. Please cut it into pieces.

321
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,435
(While they're eating water parsley, the pork belly is grilled well.)

322
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,605
- Can I cut it up now?
- My gosh!

323
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,146
(Golden brown)

324
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:29,776
Please grill it until it's crisp.

325
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:30,916
- Really?
- Yes.

326
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,416
We always put priority on guests.

327
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:35,986
(Order received)

328
00:13:37,455 --> 00:13:39,126
- Hand me the dish.
- Which one?

329
00:13:39,126 --> 00:13:40,386
- The one with water parsley on it.
- Okay.

330
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:43,055
(Exclaiming)

331
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:45,996
(The pork belly is heaped upon the soft water parsley.)

332
00:13:46,996 --> 00:13:48,565
- Goodness, here it is!
- It's well cooked.

333
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,266
Try this with the water parsley.

334
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:52,335
Try it. Help yourself.

335
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:55,705
(Looking delicious)

336
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,435
I want to pick them all together.

337
00:13:57,776 --> 00:13:59,776
The water parsley is big.

338
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,546
(Succeeded!)

339
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:08,416
(Taking a mouthful)

340
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,126
(How is it, Na Ra?)

341
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:14,555
It's so good.

342
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:18,266
(The combination of water parsley and pork belly...)

343
00:14:18,266 --> 00:14:19,626
- It's so good.
- Is it really delicious?

344
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:20,695
Yes, goodness!

345
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:21,996
(makes her break into applause.)

346
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:26,636
(Si Wan tries the meat with water parsley too.)

347
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,406
- When I chew it, it's aromatic.
- Yes.

348
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:34,876
(Bursting)

349
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:36,016
It is indeed.

350
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:39,185
This is so delicious, isn't it?

351
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:40,646
(Gulping)

352
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:44,725
(An earnest nasal twang)

353
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:49,555
I think it enhances the aroma.

354
00:14:50,496 --> 00:14:51,896
I should use my hand with this.

355
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:54,266
That's right. You know how to eat.

356
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:56,366
You should eat it like this.

357
00:14:56,766 --> 00:14:59,006
You punk, I've known you for a long time to no end.

358
00:15:00,036 --> 00:15:01,935
(Are you talking about me?)

359
00:15:04,975 --> 00:15:07,305
(Savoring)

360
00:15:07,646 --> 00:15:10,546
- Water parsley is so soft indeed.
- Right.

361
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:13,116
This combination is awesome.

362
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:14,116
(Water parsley tastes even more savory with pork belly.)

363
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:15,286
It's awesome. So delicious.

364
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,116
The combination with water parsley...

365
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,585
- is incredible.
- Yes, it's so delicious.

366
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,455
- It makes me speechless.
- Right.

367
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:21,825
This is so good.

368
00:15:22,026 --> 00:15:24,126
Dong Il, the meat is crisp and so tasty.

369
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:26,595
We put our guests first no matter what.

370
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:29,636
This combination really is the best.

371
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:32,965
(The dinner in Gyeongju became perfect with fresh ingredients.)

372
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:37,305
(This is the new level of tastes.)

373
00:15:38,175 --> 00:15:39,675
The rice is cooked well.

374
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:41,616
Ssamjang is tasty too.

375
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:43,075
(Fully satisfied)

376
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:46,516
Gosh, my lower back hurts doing all this work for my family.

377
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:49,855
It's really delicious.

378
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:51,955
- Is it good?
- Yes.

379
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:54,496
(Still, it cheers him up to see them eat well.)

380
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:57,996
- Let's eat it slowly, with relish.
- Try it, Dong Il.

381
00:15:57,996 --> 00:15:59,026
(It's time to taste Na Ra's doenjang stew.)

382
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,166
(I hope it's delicious.)

383
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,366
(Let me try.)

384
00:16:06,906 --> 00:16:10,105
Dong Il, this stew is so delicious.

385
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:16,916
(It brings a smile to his face.)

386
00:16:17,546 --> 00:16:18,845
You really cooked it well.

387
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:23,916
The flavor is deep because of all the ingredients.

388
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:26,526
They are all in here, zucchini and everything.

389
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,726
(Taking another bite)

390
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,226
(Feeling glad)

391
00:16:30,226 --> 00:16:31,296
It's so good.

392
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:35,466
(Hee Won takes a big bite too.)

393
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:40,436
- Na Ra.
- She's really good.

394
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:42,905
Do you want to run a restaurant with me?

395
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,405
(Laughing)

396
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:47,605
(Approval)

397
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:49,345
That was so sudden.

398
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:50,345
(Delighted)

399
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,286
This stew is so delicious.

400
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:54,686
- The doenjang is delicious.
- This really is the best.

401
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:58,085
(He eats it with savory tofu.)

402
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:01,125
This stew is so delicious.

403
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,496
(Chewing)

404
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:05,095
- Na Ra, I...
- Yes?

405
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,835
Among doenjang stews, - Yes.

406
00:17:07,966 --> 00:17:10,936
- I don't know how to express it.
- Yes.

407
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:15,676
I don't know how to put it. It's the ideal doenjang stew for me.

408
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,176
(Admiring)

409
00:17:19,176 --> 00:17:20,676
(Embarrassed)

410
00:17:20,676 --> 00:17:21,976
- Si Wan.
- Yes.

411
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:23,016
My goodness.

412
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:25,186
(Pleased)

413
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:26,746
He melted my heart just now.

414
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,055
(He melted her heart.)

415
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,486
I wanted to tell you.

416
00:17:30,486 --> 00:17:32,186
- But it's really delicious.
- Right.

417
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,325
(He can't stop eating the tasty doenjang stew.)

418
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:37,256
Is it good?

419
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:38,625
It's amazing.

420
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,365
- It's savory.
- Right.

421
00:17:41,196 --> 00:17:43,565
(She sure is a good cook!)

422
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:45,936
It's tasty because it's handmade.

423
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:48,105
Handmade food shows your heart.

424
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,835
That's like an advertising copy.

425
00:17:50,835 --> 00:17:51,845
(Embarrassed with his own remark)

426
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,645
(Na Ra's doenjang stew has pleased everyone.)

427
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:55,815
It's so good.

428
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:59,085
They say you feel happy when people relish your food.

429
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:00,115
I think that's true.

430
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:03,115
(Sheer happiness)

431
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,655
The broth tastes simple and good.

432
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:07,125
This menu I ate today,

433
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,726
I won't forget it for about 6 to 7 months.

434
00:18:09,726 --> 00:18:10,895
That quickly?

435
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:12,926
(I'll remember it longer!)

436
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:18,706
(When the night falls in beautiful Gyeongju...)

437
00:18:19,206 --> 00:18:23,405
I think I remember being here, when I went on a school trip.

438
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:24,706
When I was in my second year in middle school.

439
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:26,145
How many years ago?

440
00:18:26,276 --> 00:18:28,075
About 7 or 8 years, I guess?

441
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,115
- Right. It hasn't been that long.
- 7 or 8 years.

442
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:31,915
(They're taking an evening walk after dinner.)

443
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:33,016
7 or 8 years?

444
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:37,585
Goodness, how tranquil it is!

445
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:43,256
Do people in Gyeongju go for a walk in historic sites like this?

446
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,466
(Envious)

447
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:50,196
(Following the footprints of ancestors)

448
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:53,036
(An ordinary but special walk)

449
00:18:53,036 --> 00:18:55,536
- There it is.
- Gosh, there it is.

450
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:57,845
That's the famous site I've seen only in the textbook.

451
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,506
(They arrive at Cheomseongdae during their evening walk.)

452
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,676
It's marvelous.

453
00:19:05,615 --> 00:19:09,786
It's amazing to think it's been here for 1,400 years.

454
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:14,926
- It's incredible, 1,400 years.
- Yes.

455
00:19:15,095 --> 00:19:17,456
Honestly, I didn't feel anything when I was in middle school.

456
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,095
(Now that she's an adult, she gets different feelings.)

457
00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:23,696
(Happy)

458
00:19:24,236 --> 00:19:28,105
(An exclusive privilege of House on Wheels)

459
00:19:28,105 --> 00:19:30,276
In fact, I carved the bottom part.

460
00:19:30,276 --> 00:19:32,105
I'm 1,400 years old.

461
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,115
Right, a rumor has spread that he lied about his age.

462
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:36,415
(He lied about his age.)

463
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:39,186
- It's so great.
- Right.

464
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:40,585
I like Gyeongju.

465
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:43,186
Wasn't it fun, the trip to Gyeongju?

466
00:19:43,186 --> 00:19:45,125
Yes, it was so fun.

467
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,655
I'm satisfied.

468
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:51,665
(An austere and satisfying memory in Gyeongju.)

469
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:57,496
(A warm and tender day in spring)

470
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:02,905
(House on Wheels is heading to its new front yard.)

471
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:04,276
We're here again.

472
00:20:06,276 --> 00:20:08,546
Hey, today's destination is rather close compared to other trips.

473
00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:11,915
It doesn't even feel like we're going on a trip.

474
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:14,385
If we're not going too far...

475
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:16,585
(For younger brothers who've been traveling around the country, )

476
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:18,325
(Pohang)

477
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:20,486
(Gyeongju)

478
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,496
(and for today's special guest we've invited with effort, )

479
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:28,436
(Dong Il prepared a special front yard today.)

480
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:31,805
(About an hour ride from Seoul)

481
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,506
(The place full of green leaves)

482
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:36,075
(Mountain)

483
00:20:36,075 --> 00:20:38,375
(There's nature everywhere you see.)

484
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,546
(Field)

485
00:20:39,546 --> 00:20:42,276
(It'll fill your heart with ease.)

486

488
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,055
Dong Il, do you know Hye Jin well?

489
00:20:53,256 --> 00:20:56,125
Yes, we filmed a movie together with producer Kwak Gyeong Taek.

490
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,996
We also had a drink together.

491
00:20:58,026 --> 00:21:00,565
- She's so cool.
- Right, she is.

492
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:01,766
You all know her too, right?

493
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:03,895
- Yes, we filmed "The Merciless".
- In "The Merciless".

494
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,966

00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:25,825
(Scary words)

500
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,026
(Hee Won is frightened.)

501
00:21:30,196 --> 00:21:35,095
(A scene-stealer who overwhelms the scene with her presence alone.)

502
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:37,966
I'm willing to die if I want to take someone down.

505
00:21:46,246 --> 00:21:48,016
Gosh, this is a lake.

506
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,645
- Is it a river?
- My goodness!

507
00:21:49,645 --> 00:21:50,676
This is awesome.

508
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:52,845
I think the water is clear here.

509
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,385

What will there be if we arrive?

515
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:16,405
Gosh, we're here.

516
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:17,976
(They arrive after driving along the silver grass field.)

517
00:22:17,976 --> 00:22:19,946

518
00:22:21,345 --> 00:22:23,246
(Today's front yard)

519
00:22:23,246 --> 00:22:30,716
(The silver grass field in Mount Taehwa)

520
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:37,496

521
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:48,176

523
00:22:54,546 --> 00:22:58,786
(there live goats.)

524
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:04,456
(It's a place for us to relax.)

525
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:10,456
(This special place near Seoul offers a chance to heal yourself.)

(Today, we live in the silver grass field in Mount Taewha.)

528
00:23:21,736 --> 00:23:23,006
(Safely filmed with the permission of the landowner)

529
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:25,506
- Oh, my!
- What's up?

530
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:28,976
Isn't that a wolf?

531
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,946
(There's a wolf?)

532
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,986
(You mean us?)

533
00:23:36,155 --> 00:23:38,226
- Isn't it a goat?
- It's a goat.

534
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:40,855
I see, they're not. I have bad eyesight.

535
00:23:40,926 --> 00:23:43,026
Hey, if it were a wolf, we should move out now.

536
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,996
- We should move out right away.
- I didn't see it right.

537
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,635
(A fuss about wolves has finished.)

538
00:23:51,036 --> 00:23:52,736
- Gosh, I'm thirsty.
- Are you thirsty?

539
00:23:52,736 --> 00:23:54,036
Do you want some water?

540
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:56,305
- Dong Il, coffee for you?
- Yes.

541
00:23:56,976 --> 00:23:59,075

546
00:24:11,555 --> 00:24:13,426
(He checks the ratio meticulously.)

547
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,496
(It rejuvenates him.)

548
00:24:17,796 --> 00:24:20,395
(Meanwhile, Si Wan...)

549
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:22,595
(is washing grapes for Hye Jin.)

550

00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,706
(Laughing)

553
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:34,706
Smile. Smile when you make food.

554
00:24:35,345 --> 00:24:37,446
(Flashing a smile)

555
00:24:37,546 --> 00:24:40,486
That's right. Look at the distant mountain.

556
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:41,986
(He's grinding leisurely.)

557
00:24:41,986 --> 00:24:45,286
That's it. Put nature into it.

558
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:46,486
(Working hard)

559
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:50,426
(When is Hye Jin coming?)

560
00:24:51,355 --> 00:24:55,335
(Passing by a tunnel of tall trees)

561
00:24:55,796 --> 00:24:59,506
(Along the silver grass trail)

562
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:03,905
(She's wearing casually as if she's in the neighborhood.)

563
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:07,905
(She's slinging her bag over her shoulder.)

564
00:25:09,516 --> 00:25:10,516
(Laughing softly)

565
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:13,186
(There they are.)

566
00:25:13,315 --> 00:25:15,456
Oh, I think Hye Jin is here.

567
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,716
(Where is she?)

568
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:18,555
- Isn't she?
- My gosh, you're right.

569
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:19,855
- My goodness.
- Hey!

570
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:21,855
Hey!

571
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:22,855
(Today's guest makes an appearance in such a cool way.)

572
00:25:23,026 --> 00:25:25,796
(My guest!)

573
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:29,865
(Si Wan runs towards his first guest.)

574
00:25:29,865 --> 00:25:32,405
Did you walk all the way from there?

575
00:25:32,436 --> 00:25:34,206
Here is your gift.

576
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:35,776
It's so heavy.

577
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:38,405
(Hee Won grinds the coffee faster.)

578
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:41,405
- Let's go and greet her, quickly.
- Yes. My gosh.

579
00:25:42,046 --> 00:25:43,476
I'm shy.

580
00:25:43,476 --> 00:25:45,016
(They're friends, but he's feeling shy.)

581
00:25:45,115 --> 00:25:46,686
- My gosh.
- You're here.

582
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:48,085
(They recognize each other.)

583
00:25:48,286 --> 00:25:49,756
- Hello.
- Welcome.

584
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,986
- It's been a while.
- Yes, seriously.

585
00:25:51,986 --> 00:25:53,226
(Dong Il and Hee Won's close friend)

586
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,055
(Actor Jeon Hye Jin whom the three brothers all adore)

587
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,256
It's cold. Have a seat.

588
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:58,365
Where should I sit?

589
00:25:58,365 --> 00:26:00,065
- Wherever convenient.
- The best spot, of course.

590
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:02,065
- Sunlight gleams on here.
- Wherever you want.

591
00:26:02,065 --> 00:26:04,065
- There's no sunlight at all.
- Where there's no sunlight at all.

592
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,006
- It's blocked out here.
- Okay.

593
00:26:06,006 --> 00:26:07,506
(They earnestly offer a seat to their precious guest.)

594
00:26:07,506 --> 00:26:10,176
- The light is blocked out here.
- Yes, here.

595
00:26:10,176 --> 00:26:12,176
- No, it's fine.
- Here.

596
00:26:12,176 --> 00:26:13,345
(I don't mind sitting anywhere.)

597
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,746
- Sit here.
- I'll sit here.

598
00:26:14,746 --> 00:26:16,946
- You sit over here in the shade.
- Right.

599
00:26:16,946 --> 00:26:18,845
(They are sincere in choosing their spots.)

600
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,345
(Looking around)

601
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:23,986
- So it's the new house, right?
- Yes, it's the new house.

602
00:26:23,986 --> 00:26:26,585
Since you were coming, we hurried...

603
00:26:26,926 --> 00:26:28,456
- to set up this place.
- I see.

604
00:26:29,026 --> 00:26:30,496
You look better than before.

605
00:26:30,496 --> 00:26:31,926
- How?
- I'm not sure.

606
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:33,565
Is it because I wore makeup?

607
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:36,065
I've seen you wearing makeup several times.

608
00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:39,865
When you walked towards us, you looked nice somehow.

609
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:41,165
I really liked how she looked too.

610
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:43,506
- She looked bright.
- Her outfit is my style.

611
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:45,776
I didn't have a clue what I would do here.

612
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:47,145
- There's nothing to do.
- It's my only outfit.

613
00:26:47,145 --> 00:26:50,046
Yes, I like casual outfits so much.

614
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:51,075
(She wore casually with her sweatsuit and sneakers.)

615
00:26:51,075 --> 00:26:52,615
It's a perfect outfit for camping.

616
00:26:52,615 --> 00:26:54,286
- Right, for camping.
- Right.

617
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,125
My gosh, the weather is so nice. Why are you wearing winter clothes?

618
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:02,026
- I already told him.
- It's cold.

619
00:27:02,026 --> 00:27:03,526
You'll see in a while.

620
00:27:03,526 --> 00:27:05,766
You'll be cold after a while.

621
00:27:05,766 --> 00:27:07,926
- Do you have an overgarment?
- I have one.

622
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,565
- Half of this.
- Yes, it's cold.

623
00:27:11,835 --> 00:27:13,805
I bought this from Sun Kyun.

624
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:14,966
Pardon?

625
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,676
- Seriously?
- I'm serious.

626
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,135
- Really?
- You wore it on purpose?

627
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,875
(Hye Jin and Sun Kyun...)

628
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:24,345
(are a married couple.)

629
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:26,345
I bought this from Sun Kyun.

630
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,486
Pardon?

631
00:27:27,585 --> 00:27:29,256
- Seriously?
- I'm serious.

632
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:30,385
- Really?
- You wore it on purpose?

633
00:27:30,385 --> 00:27:33,125
Sun Kyun was wearing this one day.

634
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,355
Does he sell clothes too?

635
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:36,296
- No.
- Hold on a second.

636
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:37,996
- So...
- How much did you pay for it?

637
00:27:38,095 --> 00:27:40,125
Was it 180 dollars?

638
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,865
Sun Kyun was wearing it,

639
00:27:41,865 --> 00:27:43,865
so I said, "I want that too."

640
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:45,905
He said, "You won't be sponsored."

641
00:27:47,236 --> 00:27:49,276
(An unexpected attack of a sponsored clothing.)

642
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:51,405
"I'll buy that!"

643
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:54,506
I paid his stylist to get this.

644
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:58,276
- I see. Right.
- Then you didn't buy it from him.

645
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:01,585
I love it. Totally.

646
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:02,716
(He's satisfied with it no matter what.)

647
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:05,256
(He's driving me crazy.)

648
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:06,526
My gosh.

649
00:28:07,256 --> 00:28:08,796
Did it come up here?

650
00:28:08,796 --> 00:28:10,055
- Yes.
- This...

651
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,726
You've seen the narrow road, right?

652
00:28:11,726 --> 00:28:13,565
Hee Won drove this through the road.

653
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:16,196
Even my car won't go up easily.

654
00:28:16,436 --> 00:28:17,996
(Did he?)

655
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:19,405
(Bragging)

656
00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:20,966
He's being arrogant again.

657
00:28:21,665 --> 00:28:23,805
We've all gotten an HGV license.

658
00:28:23,805 --> 00:28:26,446
- I see. You need that, right.
- Because of the program.

659
00:28:26,446 --> 00:28:28,915
But Hee Won always drives.

660
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:29,915
We can't.

661
00:28:29,915 --> 00:28:31,615
He's so into cars.

662
00:28:31,615 --> 00:28:35,016
If I ask him about cars, he knows a lot about them.

663
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:36,315
- Right.
- Yes.

664
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:37,885
He knows...

665
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,186
about a lot of useless stuff.

666
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,855
Lately, he's been studying stocks,

667
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,526
and invested quite a lot of money.

668
00:28:47,095 --> 00:28:49,395
He suddenly asked me, "Dong Il, do you know about stocks?"

669
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:52,436
He said he's curious about it since everyone seems to be doing it.

670
00:28:52,436 --> 00:28:55,335
I've never bought stocks in my life, so I said, "No, I don't."

671
00:28:55,335 --> 00:28:58,036
"I'll learn how to open an account first," he said.

672
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,845
I met him again later on.

673
00:28:59,845 --> 00:29:01,176
I asked, "Did you open it?"

674
00:29:01,176 --> 00:29:04,145
He said he opened it, but he didn't figure out how to put money in it.

675
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:05,615
So he's learning it again.

676
00:29:05,615 --> 00:29:07,786
But I don't know how to do it.

677
00:29:07,786 --> 00:29:09,815
- Do I have to use an app?
- It's done without contact.

678
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:12,055
So I need to do it with an app.

679
00:29:12,055 --> 00:29:15,196
I don't know which one's for selling and which one's for buying.

680
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:17,895
- You don't know selling and buying?
- No, I don't know about them.

681
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:19,595
Is he trying to invest in stocks without knowing it?

682
00:29:19,595 --> 00:29:22,966
I've practiced how to buy and sell stocks.

683
00:29:22,966 --> 00:29:24,865
I think he invested quite a lot.

684
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:26,736
50 dollars or something.

685
00:29:26,905 --> 00:29:28,936
- Dong Il, did you say 50 dollars?
- And then...

686
00:29:28,936 --> 00:29:30,905
Eight dollars? How much was it?

687
00:29:30,905 --> 00:29:32,105
1,000 dollars.

688
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:33,805
1,000 dollars? No way!

689
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:34,845
- Was it really 1,000 dollars?
- No.

690
00:29:34,845 --> 00:29:37,016
I invested 1,000 dollars and earned 50 dollars.

691
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:38,716
- Right.
- It's a five percent PE ratio.

692
00:29:38,716 --> 00:29:41,016
- He's going to treat us with it.
- My goodness.

693
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:43,716
- One stock item?
- Yes.

694
00:29:44,815 --> 00:29:46,155
You're curious, right?

695
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:49,956
You think I'll just tell you?

696
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,365
(I won't tell you a trade secret.)

697
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:53,595
50 dollars.

698
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:56,466
Do you think it's a child's play to earn 50 dollars?

699
00:29:57,895 --> 00:30:00,805
(Staring)

700
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:02,335
(Holding)

701
00:30:02,335 --> 00:30:04,375
- Don't buy more.
- Why?

702
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:07,476
Set yourself a limit like a game.

703
00:30:07,476 --> 00:30:09,815
You'll become envious of me later.

704
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:14,686
(He's cute.)

705
00:30:15,016 --> 00:30:18,055
(Grinding coffee beans after keeping his secret)

706
00:30:18,456 --> 00:30:20,456
What's your role here?

707
00:30:20,456 --> 00:30:21,486
- Here?
- Yes.

708
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,325
Well, he called the day before yesterday.

709
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,226
"Hye Jin is coming, what should I cook for her?"

710
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:29,736
He always calls me 2 or 3 times.

711
00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:31,665
- For his confirmation.
- What would I do?

712
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:34,036
- Oh, really? Does he cook?
- Yes.

713
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:35,305
- He's good at cooking.
- I see.

714
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:37,036
Look forward to my cooking too.

715
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,676
- Today?
- Yes.

716
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:40,405
(By the way...)

717
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,315
When can I have coffee?

718
00:30:42,315 --> 00:30:44,016
Hey, that's enough. Stop.

719
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:45,615
- That'll be enough.
- Is it enough?

720
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:47,946
- It'll become too strong.
- Really?

721
00:30:49,155 --> 00:30:50,786
(Pour in the ground coffee.)

722
00:30:50,786 --> 00:30:52,825
He's shaking again, my gosh.

723
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,825
(Pour water in.)

724
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:57,395
Gosh, it smells good.

725
00:30:58,996 --> 00:31:01,936
(They enjoy a relaxing coffee time.)

726
00:31:01,936 --> 00:31:03,536
It's perfect for me.

727
00:31:04,165 --> 00:31:06,835
(Glad)

728
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,375
(House on Wheels is known for its good coffee.)

729
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:10,805
Gosh, it's good.

730
00:31:10,976 --> 00:31:13,446
Let's eat first. I'm hungry.

731
00:31:13,845 --> 00:31:15,276
- Aren't you hungry?
- I'm hungry.

732
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:16,875
- She must be hungry.
- Yes, I'm hungry.

733
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,375
- Lunch.
- What do you like?

734
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:21,815
You can tell us what you really want to eat now.

735
00:31:21,885 --> 00:31:23,956
Well, I'm not picky.

736
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:25,216
Still, you're here for a special occasion.

737
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,996
I know. I like to grill food outdoors.

738
00:31:28,996 --> 00:31:31,456
We all know you like to drink.

739
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,466
These two don't like drinking that much.

740
00:31:33,466 --> 00:31:34,926
We two like to drink.

741
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:38,266
I heard there's a mushroom farm near here.

742
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:40,405
- Do you like mushrooms?
- I like mushrooms.

743
00:31:40,405 --> 00:31:42,006
Dong Il, mushroom hot pot,

744
00:31:42,006 --> 00:31:44,375
mushroom pork belly, - Right.

745
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,405
- and mushroom shabu-shabu?
- Broth, something with broth.

746
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,546
Shabu-shabu?

747
00:31:47,546 --> 00:31:48,645
- You want to drink?
- For dinner...

748
00:31:48,746 --> 00:31:52,115
- Alcohol lovers tend...
- Not, that. Just because it's cold.

749
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:53,546
to like soups.

750
00:31:53,686 --> 00:31:55,246
- Yes, we should have soup.
- I like it too.

751
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:58,216
We can decide whatever we want and go grocery shopping.

752
00:31:58,825 --> 00:32:01,885
By the way, I hope you don't ask me about food.

753
00:32:04,026 --> 00:32:05,565
- Just do whatever you want.
- Don't even ask?

754
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:09,665
What I like about my husband is that he always decides.

755
00:32:09,766 --> 00:32:13,165
He always thinks about what to eat, like 80 percent of his brain.

756
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:15,776
- That's a good match for a couple.
- Yes, it is.

757
00:32:16,405 --> 00:32:19,405
Still, there must be something you want, like meat...

758
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:23,345
If you change your mind and think of something else, that's good too.

759
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,615
If we don't have it ready, we can go out and get it.

760
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:28,486
I trust you guys.

761
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,756
Should I make perilla oil makguksu?

762
00:32:33,026 --> 00:32:34,986
(Oh, it sounds good!)

763
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:36,855
It's what I can do fast.

764
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:39,625
- Is it simple?
- I can make it fast.

765
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,526
- Anything fast is good. I'm hungry.
- Okay.

766
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:47,206
(Very simple perilla oil makguksu, for the family.)

767
00:32:47,736 --> 00:32:49,476
(With cold buckwheat noodles, )

768
00:32:49,476 --> 00:32:52,375
(seaweed flake and sesame are added.)

769
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:56,375
(Adding soy sauce and perilla oil would...)

770
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,246
(complete delicious perilla oil makguksu)

771
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,085
- Then, I will rush to make it.
- That's good.

772
00:33:03,085 --> 00:33:04,085
Okay.

773
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:06,486
Is he really making it?

774
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:09,956
Can I help you with anything?

775
00:33:10,496 --> 00:33:11,726
(Swish)

776
00:33:11,726 --> 00:33:13,895
You don't look like you mean it.

777
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:17,565
I can do it myself.

778
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:20,706
(Hye Jin looks at Si Wan.)

779
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,605
(Should I help?)

780
00:33:25,075 --> 00:33:29,345
Buckwheat noodles.

781
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:33,315
Seaweed flake.

782
00:33:35,656 --> 00:33:36,656
Chives.

783
00:33:36,656 --> 00:33:38,085
(He looks confident about buckwheat noodles.)

784
00:33:38,415 --> 00:33:40,855
Soy sauce and sugar.

785
00:33:42,926 --> 00:33:46,565
Look at him. Are they buckwheat noodles there?

786
00:33:46,665 --> 00:33:48,665
Yes, these are buckwheat noodles.

787
00:33:48,665 --> 00:33:51,065
Is that so? I like buckwheat noodles.

788
00:33:52,335 --> 00:33:53,366
Vinegar.

789
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:54,636
(Hye Jin likes buckwheat noodles.)

790
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:58,776
(Si Wan is even more confident.)

791
00:33:59,475 --> 00:34:02,616
(For hungry Hye Jin, Si Wan rushes to make the sauce.)

792
00:34:03,446 --> 00:34:06,785
We are lucky to have Si Wan here.

793
00:34:06,785 --> 00:34:07,785
I agree.

794
00:34:07,785 --> 00:34:09,556
(Gloating)

795
00:34:10,285 --> 00:34:12,285
He must be good at cooking.

796
00:34:12,285 --> 00:34:14,185
- His food is very delicious.
- Not that simple.

797
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,096
- Is he?
- He practices at home.

798
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:19,065
You know the menu, jjajang ramyeon.

799
00:34:19,065 --> 00:34:23,535
That's the jjajang ramyeon in Chef Lee Yeon Bok style.

800
00:34:24,165 --> 00:34:25,906
- It's delicious.
- During our previous trip,

801
00:34:25,906 --> 00:34:27,335
he made it really delicious.

802
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:30,035
- Spicy squid and pork belly.
- His spicy squid and pork belly,

803
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:31,636
- it was amazing.
- The spicy squid and pork belly...

804
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,375
- Did he marinate it?
- Yes.

805
00:34:33,576 --> 00:34:36,245
- It was delicious.
- It really was very delicious.

806
00:34:36,245 --> 00:34:37,776
He's talented at cooking.

807
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,585
Are you bored just talking?

808
00:34:40,815 --> 00:34:41,886
Do you need help?

809
00:34:42,785 --> 00:34:45,156
- I'll do it. That's easy.
- Do you need to grind it?

810
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:47,685
- Guests are not supposed to work.
- I'll do it.

811
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,426
Is that so? Then, you do it.

812
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:52,466
- Do I grind the sesame?
- You just need to do it like this.

813
00:34:53,366 --> 00:34:56,065
(Hee Won is grinding sesame.)

814
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:58,535
That smells good.

815
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:03,705
(Si Wan is getting ready to chop chives.)

816
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:06,975
(A knife?)

817
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:12,145
I've wanted to try this one. Let's do it.

818
00:35:13,216 --> 00:35:14,886
(The first time for a scissors cook to try a Chinese food knife!)

819
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:16,455
(Chopping)

820
00:35:18,926 --> 00:35:22,296
(A weird way to use a Chinese food knife)

821
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:25,995
(Hye Jin is worried.)

822
00:35:26,895 --> 00:35:29,895
(Si Wan is doing his best for Hye Jin.)

823
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,065
(Hee Won is also working hard for Hye Jin.)

824
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,736
(He's already exhausted.)

825
00:35:38,176 --> 00:35:40,406
I really don't get to be out of my seat.

826
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:41,975
I'm sure he's fine.

827
00:35:42,176 --> 00:35:43,745
That's enough grinding.

828
00:35:43,745 --> 00:35:46,015
- That seems too much.
- Are you getting oil out of it?

829
00:35:46,015 --> 00:35:48,285
Isn't the finer, the better?

830
00:35:48,285 --> 00:35:50,455
- No. This is enough.
- Is it?

831
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:52,455
This no more even makes the sound.

832
00:35:52,926 --> 00:35:55,225
- I'll pretend as if I did it.
- Go ahead.

833
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,826
(Well, okay...)

834
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:00,426
You're working too much.

835
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:02,366
That's too much.

836
00:36:02,796 --> 00:36:04,495
- I did it.
- Is it done?

837
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,035
- Yes.
- Thank you. That smells good!

838
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:10,335
(Glancing)

839
00:36:11,935 --> 00:36:15,205
- It smells so good.
- Si Wan, is it ground too much?

840
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:16,846
- This one?
- It's too much.

841
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:18,475
It looks good.

842
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:21,386
(Carefully chopped chives)

843
00:36:23,185 --> 00:36:24,185
He's good.

844
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:26,026
(Si Wan is doing well.)

845
00:36:26,955 --> 00:36:29,596
(On sesame ground by Hee Won, )

846
00:36:29,596 --> 00:36:33,225
(seaweed flakes are added.)

847
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:38,435
(With seaweed flakes, it becomes tastier.)

848
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:42,006
(Thanks to Si Wan, Hye Jin has no worries.)

849
00:36:43,736 --> 00:36:44,935
I will wash rice.

850
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:46,346
(Hye Jin is looking around the house.)

851
00:36:47,245 --> 00:36:48,645
How much rice did we cook last time?

852
00:36:48,645 --> 00:36:52,616
Rice? Approximately, about this much.

853
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:55,515
- Maybe not. About this much?
- Wait a minute.

854
00:36:55,515 --> 00:36:58,315
I think it seems good.

855
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,455
(When did you come in?)

856
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:03,656
It's not this one.

857
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,165
- Is this a storage?
- It's got something.

858
00:37:07,165 --> 00:37:09,596
- Oh, it is storage.
- These are pajamas.

859
00:37:09,596 --> 00:37:11,966
Are these all customized?

860
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,205
They are customized.

861
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,806
Hye Jin, how did you know there's a space under there?

862
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:18,806
- You're the first one...
- It's for granted.

863
00:37:19,176 --> 00:37:20,406
- to notice it right away.
- This is a bed.

864
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:22,205
- That's also a bed.
- I see.

865
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:23,415
(Hye Jin noticed the storage.)

866
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:25,015
(Here's also...)

867
00:37:26,015 --> 00:37:28,015
(Checking on the cup storage.)

868
00:37:28,986 --> 00:37:31,116
(Hye Jin checks on all storage.)

869
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,256
This is for cups.

870
00:37:32,455 --> 00:37:34,725
Storage spaces seem important.

871
00:37:36,926 --> 00:37:39,426
There are many kinds of stuff in the kitchen.

872
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,165
- I see that.
- The kitchen.

873
00:37:41,165 --> 00:37:42,565
It's almost a restaurant.

874
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:46,366
Look at these ingredients.

875
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:48,366
Do you want to eat pollack roe with that?

876
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,205
Should I add radish sprouts for the texture?

877
00:37:51,205 --> 00:37:52,806
(Hye Jin is very interested.)

878
00:37:53,346 --> 00:37:54,975
Those are LPs. Would you like some music?

879
00:37:54,975 --> 00:37:56,216
Do you have...

880
00:37:56,216 --> 00:37:57,745
- an LP player?
- Yes, we do.

881
00:37:57,745 --> 00:37:59,685
Oh, from the old days!

882
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:02,616
I will play it for you.

883
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,056
You've got nice music.

884
00:38:06,526 --> 00:38:08,995
We play the LP for our guests.

885
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,026
Do you?

886
00:38:12,096 --> 00:38:15,495
(It's an interesting intro.)

887
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:19,565
(It's a very touchy lyrical melody.)

888
00:38:19,736 --> 00:38:22,105
(Si Wan is dancing tapping on his apron.)

889
00:38:23,136 --> 00:38:24,835
(Laughing)

890
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:42,796
(This is it, the singer Sim Soo Bong.)

891
00:38:43,725 --> 00:38:45,296
(Humming)

892
00:38:45,696 --> 00:38:48,796
(Without a hateful heart)

893
00:38:49,696 --> 00:38:54,705
(Everyone loves "One Million Roses" by Sim Soo Bong)

894
00:38:55,006 --> 00:38:57,236
(One million...)

895
00:38:57,236 --> 00:38:59,306
(And chives are ready.)

896
00:39:00,245 --> 00:39:01,776
(Makguksu is almost done.)

897
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:04,616
(Oh, right!)

898
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:07,645
I brought some webfoot octopus.

899
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,616
- Webfoot octopus?
- I love webfoot octopus.

900
00:39:09,616 --> 00:39:10,616
Webfoot octopus?

901
00:39:10,785 --> 00:39:14,156
That's good. I can cook webfoot octopus.

902
00:39:14,156 --> 00:39:15,556
- It's all ready.
- Really?

903
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:17,326
- It's marinated.
- Is it already marinated?

904
00:39:17,326 --> 00:39:19,526
- I bought it marinated.
- Oh, yes!

905
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:21,096
She brought food.

906
00:39:21,096 --> 00:39:22,636
Dong Il, it's marinated.

907
00:39:22,636 --> 00:39:25,966
- It's so easy.
- Let's grill in on a pan.

908
00:39:26,435 --> 00:39:29,276
This will be really delicious when stir-fried.

909
00:39:29,306 --> 00:39:31,105
Si Wan, the water is boiling.

910
00:39:31,676 --> 00:39:33,946
- Let's make it over portion.
- What?

911
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:35,006
Let's make it over portion,

912
00:39:35,205 --> 00:39:36,475
so we can eat enough.

913
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:37,576
(A big portion as Dong Il wanted.)

914
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:39,986
Hye Jin, are you good at cooking?

915
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:41,285
She must be good.

916
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:43,955
- She's got children to feed.
- I do survival cooking.

917
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:45,716
- Is that so?
- I got better thanks to COVID.

918
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,756
Fusion cooking?

919
00:39:46,886 --> 00:39:49,656
No. Just to survive...

920
00:39:49,656 --> 00:39:51,156
- Survival cooking?
- Yes.

921
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,765
Survival cooking is actually delicious.

922
00:39:53,765 --> 00:39:55,596
- I just...
- It's true.

923
00:39:55,696 --> 00:39:59,806
My kids don't eat the same menu again for 3 meals.

924
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:02,165
When they complain,

925
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:04,335
I tell them to leave the table, not to eat,

926
00:40:05,335 --> 00:40:06,375
and they don't deserve to eat.

927
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,415
That's why I ask my mom only for kimchi stew.

928
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:13,116
- Is your mother not a good cook?
- Kimchi stew is the hardest.

929
00:40:13,116 --> 00:40:15,216
- My mom is a good cook.
- She is.

930
00:40:15,216 --> 00:40:18,256
I didn't want her to worry about what to cook.

931
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:22,125
So, I told her all I wanted was kimchi stew.

932
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:24,895
Let's put this here.

933
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,196
Dong Il, should I pass you a colander?

934
00:40:27,296 --> 00:40:28,466
Is it already done?

935
00:40:29,535 --> 00:40:33,065
(Dong Il is pouring well-cooked buckwheat noodles into iced water.)

936
00:40:33,065 --> 00:40:35,236
(Exclaiming)

937
00:40:35,236 --> 00:40:36,535
Put it in the cold water.

938
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,145
(A self sound effect)

939
00:40:41,176 --> 00:40:43,975
(Si Wan is happy to serve for Hye Jin.)

940
00:40:45,616 --> 00:40:46,616
So hot!

941
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:50,116
It's hot.

942
00:40:50,116 --> 00:40:51,116
(He's enduring the hot temperature.)

943
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:52,585
I'm washing it.

944
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,855
This looks chewy.

945
00:40:56,725 --> 00:40:57,955
Okay.

946
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,995
(Si Wan is rolling the buckwheat noodles.)

947
00:40:58,995 --> 00:41:00,495
Okay.

948
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:04,535
(He places it nicely in a bowl.)

949
00:41:04,535 --> 00:41:07,366
It looks pretty. It's pretty.

950
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:12,176
(He's well placing the buckwheat noodles.)

951
00:41:12,176 --> 00:41:13,245
How pretty!

952
00:41:15,446 --> 00:41:19,616
(Topping with savory seaweed flakes and sesame powder)

953
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,015
- It's ready.
- All done?

954
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:22,785
- We can eat.
- Can we eat now?

955
00:41:22,785 --> 00:41:23,785
We can?

956
00:41:23,986 --> 00:41:26,125
(Perilla oil makguksu by Si Wan is ready.)

957
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:28,455
(Dong Il is preparing to stir-fry...)

958
00:41:28,455 --> 00:41:30,096
(marinated webfoot octopus Hye Jin brought.)

959
00:41:30,826 --> 00:41:34,725
(Sizzle)

960
00:41:37,935 --> 00:41:40,605
This almost looks like squid, not webfoot octopus.

961
00:41:41,205 --> 00:41:44,035
(It's big in size.)

962
00:41:45,006 --> 00:41:47,245
- We need to cut it with scissors.
- Goodness.

963
00:41:48,946 --> 00:41:50,216
(Looking forward to the delicious lunch)

964
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,046
Speed is the most important thing for us.

965
00:41:53,546 --> 00:41:55,386
They gave us a lot. You're a regular there, right?

966
00:41:55,386 --> 00:41:57,585
Yes, the kids really like it.

967
00:41:57,685 --> 00:41:59,015
- Webfoot octopus?
- Yes.

968
00:41:59,015 --> 00:42:00,386
(Cooking on high heat)

969
00:42:00,386 --> 00:42:03,125
- Some perilla leaves.
- I'll rinse the perilla leaves.

970
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,296
(Following him)

971
00:42:06,296 --> 00:42:07,495
Why did I come here?

972
00:42:07,495 --> 00:42:08,526
The perilla leaves!

973
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,765
(Hye Jin quietly came next to Si Wan.)

974
00:42:09,765 --> 00:42:10,935
And the perilla leaves too...

975
00:42:12,705 --> 00:42:14,835
(Shaking aggressively)

976
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,435
This...

977
00:42:16,435 --> 00:42:18,875
(Helping Si Wan prepare the vegetables)

978
00:42:19,506 --> 00:42:22,776
With bean sprouts too, those who like it spicy can eat it separately.

979
00:42:23,616 --> 00:42:25,116
I don't have to chop it into really small pieces, right?

980
00:42:25,116 --> 00:42:26,315
Small pieces? No.

981
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:28,415
But it does taste better if you chop it into small pieces. That's it!

982
00:42:29,285 --> 00:42:31,355
This is good, right? This is good.

983
00:42:32,285 --> 00:42:33,785
Is this done now?

984
00:42:34,656 --> 00:42:37,196
My plan was to not do anything,

985
00:42:37,196 --> 00:42:38,855
but it's impossible for me to not do anything.

986
00:42:38,855 --> 00:42:40,495
- You end up doing something.
- Yes, that's right.

987
00:42:40,995 --> 00:42:42,326
What am I going to do if I stay still?

988
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,596
There's always a lot of work to do.

989
00:42:44,035 --> 00:42:46,665
It's not easy cooking up a meal.

990
00:42:46,906 --> 00:42:48,736
Use your chopsticks to taste it to see if it's cooked or not.

991
00:42:49,006 --> 00:42:50,136
Isn't this all cooked?

992
00:42:50,406 --> 00:42:51,935
If we overcook it, it gets too chewy.

993
00:42:53,176 --> 00:42:54,806
(Checking to see if it's cooked)

994
00:42:55,446 --> 00:42:57,716
I actually don't know how the cooked ones taste like.

995
00:42:58,315 --> 00:42:59,645
They just need to be cooked to a certain point.

996
00:42:59,645 --> 00:43:01,046
- Hye Jin!
- Why?

997
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:02,716
Taste this to see if it's cooked or not.

998
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:05,056
(Hye Jin, try this.)

999
00:43:05,315 --> 00:43:06,526
- Is this fully cooked?
- Yes.

1000
00:43:06,526 --> 00:43:07,625
Dong Il, she says it's cooked.

1001
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:10,495
Okay, everyone. Gather here.

1002
00:43:10,495 --> 00:43:11,796
(With everyone's help, the marinated webfoot octopus is quickly done.)

1003
00:43:11,796 --> 00:43:12,866
Come quickly.

1004
00:43:13,866 --> 00:43:15,026
Come here.

1005
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:16,035
(And Si Wan's work, perilla oil makguksu!)

1006
00:43:16,035 --> 00:43:17,065
Okay!

1007
00:43:17,665 --> 00:43:21,205
Wow, this is like dry noodles.

1008
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:23,136
No really, Dong Il. Look at this.

1009
00:43:23,136 --> 00:43:24,576
It has no soup.

1010
00:43:24,576 --> 00:43:25,875
(Are all makguksu like this?)

1011
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:28,446
Is it supposed to be like this?

1012
00:43:28,446 --> 00:43:30,946
That's what I'm saying!

1013
00:43:31,015 --> 00:43:33,046
No, we're supposed to put in that sauce.

1014
00:43:33,815 --> 00:43:35,815
Si Wan must have prepared something.

1015
00:43:37,056 --> 00:43:38,585
Si Wan!

1016
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:41,156
- Yes! That...
- Should we put in that sauce here?

1017
00:43:41,156 --> 00:43:42,926
- For that...
- How...

1018
00:43:42,926 --> 00:43:44,756
Oh, you shouldn't mix that right now.

1019
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:46,225
But why is it so dry?

1020
00:43:46,225 --> 00:43:48,196
It's dry because you haven't put this in.

1021
00:43:48,196 --> 00:43:49,696
See? I knew there was something.

1022
00:43:50,296 --> 00:43:51,665
Do we need to add sesame oil here?

1023
00:43:51,665 --> 00:43:53,705
- Yes, adding perilla oil is key.
- Oh, really?

1024
00:43:53,705 --> 00:43:54,935
Oh, you haven't added it yet, right?

1025
00:43:54,935 --> 00:43:55,966
That's right.

1026
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,276
That's good.

1027
00:43:57,276 --> 00:43:58,535
Aren't you putting in too much?

1028
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:01,506
(Is it supposed to be like this..?)

1029
00:44:02,245 --> 00:44:04,245
(Adding a lot to make the dry noodles wet)

1030
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:05,745
(Six spoonfuls)

1031
00:44:06,116 --> 00:44:07,185
(Seven spoonfuls)

1032
00:44:07,785 --> 00:44:08,815
(Eight spoonfuls)

1033
00:44:09,245 --> 00:44:10,285
(Nine spoonfuls)

1034
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:13,526
I think it'll be good even if it's dry.

1035
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:16,725
- Then should I add just a bit?
- Yes, three spoonfuls is good.

1036
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:20,125
(Adding a lot of savory perilla oil!)

1037
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:21,395
Are we supposed to eat it with so much perilla oil?

1038
00:44:21,395 --> 00:44:22,696
- It's...
- That's too much!

1039
00:44:22,696 --> 00:44:23,895
It's fine. It's fine.

1040
00:44:24,096 --> 00:44:25,596
This is perilla oil makguksu.

1041
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:27,205
Oh, perilla oil makguksu?

1042
00:44:27,435 --> 00:44:30,975
So if you need this broth,

1043
00:44:30,975 --> 00:44:33,145
you can add more if you'd like.

1044
00:44:33,145 --> 00:44:34,276
That's good for me.

1045
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:37,745
You like to put in a lot of that, right?

1046
00:44:39,046 --> 00:44:40,315
Hey, mine is drenched...

1047
00:44:40,315 --> 00:44:42,386
- with perilla oil.
- Omega-3 is good for you.

1048
00:44:42,386 --> 00:44:43,815
- Eat a lot of perilla oil.
- Perilla oil has a lot of Omega-3.

1049
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:45,986
- Omega-3 is good for you.
- What's good about Omega-3?

1050
00:44:45,986 --> 00:44:48,656
It's good. It's good for your blood.

1051
00:44:49,085 --> 00:44:50,895
It has to do with blood circulation, right?

1052
00:44:52,895 --> 00:44:56,026
(A slightly worrying amount of the soy sauce seasoning)

1053
00:44:56,866 --> 00:44:59,906
(Let's have a bite!)

1054
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:04,176
What are the health benefits of Omega-3?

1055
00:45:05,806 --> 00:45:06,846
(Does it taste okay?)

1056
00:45:06,846 --> 00:45:07,946
Is it good?

1057
00:45:10,716 --> 00:45:12,475
You put in too much sauce! It's too salty!

1058
00:45:12,475 --> 00:45:13,815
- Oh, really?
- Oh, my goodness.

1059
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:17,085
(It's like his tongue is withering...)

1060
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,056
Wait a minute.

1061
00:45:19,185 --> 00:45:20,426
Should I put in more noodles?

1062
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,556
(Screaming!)

1063
00:45:23,225 --> 00:45:26,056
(The saltiness can be felt as soon as the food enters the mouth.)

1064
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,665
Then, should we add more noodles?

1065
00:45:27,665 --> 00:45:29,225
(Even Hee Won, who put in just three spoonfuls, thinks it's salty.)

1066
00:45:29,225 --> 00:45:30,565
Yes, it's a bit salty.

1067
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:33,806
(So funny)

1068
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:37,406
(Shocked)

1069
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:40,776
(Quickly brings more noodles)

1070
00:45:40,776 --> 00:45:42,815
It's because you didn't say, "Stop."

1071
00:45:43,645 --> 00:45:45,216
(Gulping)

1072
00:45:45,515 --> 00:45:47,546
You didn't say, "Stop." - You should've said, "Stop."

1073
00:45:47,815 --> 00:45:50,285
I think it would've tasted it good if we ate it dry.

1074
00:45:50,515 --> 00:45:51,915
But this is too salty.

1075
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,256
What should we do?

1076
00:45:53,826 --> 00:45:54,886
Hye Jin, have some more.

1077
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:56,395
At least you got just a little.

1078
00:45:56,395 --> 00:45:59,096
I purposefully told him to put in only three spoonfuls.

1079
00:45:59,096 --> 00:46:00,696
It gets saltier as you eat it.

1080
00:46:00,696 --> 00:46:03,296
Yes, because it's all at the bottom.

1081
00:46:03,535 --> 00:46:04,866
Do we not have any rice?

1082
00:46:04,935 --> 00:46:06,665
We don't have any rice.

1083
00:46:08,236 --> 00:46:09,406
For me, I'm going to...

1084
00:46:09,406 --> 00:46:10,875
(Separating it before the noodles absorb the sauce)

1085
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:12,176
Let's gather it into one place.

1086
00:46:12,176 --> 00:46:13,375
Wow, look at the sauce.

1087
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:15,946
- I want to eat the dry version.
- Look. I have this much sauce.

1088
00:46:15,946 --> 00:46:17,576
- I see.
- Me too. I have a lot.

1089
00:46:17,576 --> 00:46:18,676
Look at this!

1090
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:19,815
(Flowing)

1091
00:46:19,815 --> 00:46:21,515
Wow, there's so much.

1092
00:46:21,685 --> 00:46:24,616
- Is this salty?
- That's no joke.

1093
00:46:26,015 --> 00:46:27,526
(That's strange...)

1094
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:29,955
I haven't tried it yet.

1095
00:46:31,796 --> 00:46:34,196
(Taking a large bite)

1096
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:36,796
(Goodness!)

1097
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:38,395
How is it? It's inedible, right?

1098
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,006
- It's so salty!
- It's so salty, right?

1099
00:46:41,406 --> 00:46:44,435
(You gave that to us Si Wan!)

1100
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,446
Wow, this is seriously salty.

1101
00:46:47,446 --> 00:46:48,975
(Actually, the soy sauce seasoning that Si Wan made...)

1102
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:51,676
(Sauce recipe: 9 Soy sauce for seasoning, )

1103
00:46:51,676 --> 00:46:53,645
(9 samplings of water, 3 vinegar, 3 sugar)

1104
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:55,616
(1, 2, 3 spoonfuls)

1105
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:57,656
(4, 5, 6 spoonfuls)

1106
00:46:57,656 --> 00:46:59,585
(A total of nine spoonfuls of soy sauce for seasoning!)

1107
00:46:59,585 --> 00:47:01,256
(7, 8, 9 spoonfuls)

1108
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,656
(For vinegar, )

1109
00:47:03,656 --> 00:47:04,955
(one spoonful, )

1110
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,426
(two spoonfuls, )

1111
00:47:06,426 --> 00:47:07,426
(three spoonfuls)

1112
00:47:08,696 --> 00:47:11,495
(3 small spoonfuls of sugar)

1113
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:14,265
(This is correct, right?)

1114
00:47:14,906 --> 00:47:15,906
(While he was preparing according to the recipe...)

1115
00:47:15,906 --> 00:47:17,776
(Why are we here?)

1116
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:21,176
(As they were talking outside, )

1117
00:47:21,176 --> 00:47:24,975
(Si Wan started talking as well.)

1118
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,616
Out of all the days we did this, today's weather is the best.

1119
00:47:28,216 --> 00:47:30,185
(Busy talking with Hye Jin)

1120
00:47:30,756 --> 00:47:33,486
(Because he was excited to talk to his guest, )

1121
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:37,926
(he picked up the black bottle again after talking.)

1122
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:40,725
(Soy sauce for taste..?)

1123
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:45,165
(He put in soy sauce for taste instead of water...)

1124
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:49,105
(Adding additional 9 spoonfuls of soy sauce for taste!)

1125
00:47:49,636 --> 00:47:52,276
(9 spoons of soy sauce for taste, 9 spoons of soy sauce for seasoning)

1126
00:47:52,806 --> 00:47:55,046
(And...)

1127
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:59,015
(Si Wan gave 9 spoons of this to Dong Il!)

1128
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:02,415
(The saltiness of 999)

1129
00:48:03,656 --> 00:48:05,986
(Should've tasted it when cooking)

1130
00:48:06,585 --> 00:48:07,886
(It's okay. You did well.)

1131
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:09,656
Wow, the soy sauce...

1132
00:48:10,725 --> 00:48:12,966
You worked so hard though.

1133
00:48:13,426 --> 00:48:16,966
(That's right. Si Wan made this for us.)

1134
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:20,435
I think the soy sauce for seasoning was really thick.

1135
00:48:20,435 --> 00:48:22,335
I think I need to add some water into this.

1136
00:48:22,335 --> 00:48:23,676
- What?
- This.

1137
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:26,276
I think I need to add water to this.

1138
00:48:26,276 --> 00:48:27,475
Yes, that will do.

1139
00:48:27,475 --> 00:48:29,306
(Yes. At least do something...)

1140
00:48:29,546 --> 00:48:32,645
(Si Wan does whatever he can to make it taste better.)

1141
00:48:33,216 --> 00:48:35,486
(Hye Jin feels bad for him...)

1142
00:48:35,486 --> 00:48:36,815
The webfoot octopus tastes good.

1143
00:48:36,815 --> 00:48:39,185
(Meanwhile, the webfoot octopus tastes great.)

1144
00:48:39,556 --> 00:48:40,656
I feel bad.

1145
00:48:40,656 --> 00:48:42,955
We didn't do anything.

1146
00:48:43,756 --> 00:48:45,096
(Taking a bite after wrapping it in lettuce)

1147
00:48:45,096 --> 00:48:47,225
- But this is just a snack.
- That's right.

1148
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:48,426
- The main dish is...
- Yes.

1149
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,395
I like eating food a little bland, but wow...

1150
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:52,866
(Craving spicy food because of the saltiness of the noodles)

1151
00:48:55,406 --> 00:48:57,076
The noodles are well-cooked.

1152
00:48:57,076 --> 00:48:58,375
Yes, they're well-cooked.

1153
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:00,245
(Keeps eating the webfoot octopus)

1154
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:03,046
Should we leave some of this?

1155
00:49:03,046 --> 00:49:05,046
(Si Wan rinsed the noodles.)

1156
00:49:05,446 --> 00:49:07,716
I rinsed them with water, so...

1157
00:49:08,085 --> 00:49:09,486
What about this?

1158
00:49:11,256 --> 00:49:15,185
(Cautiously adding perilla oil)

1159
00:49:15,926 --> 00:49:17,895
Si Wan, start with the good food.

1160
00:49:18,296 --> 00:49:20,065
- Si Wan's hurt right now.
- Just let it go and...

1161
00:49:20,065 --> 00:49:21,366
- It's okay.
- No, it's fine.

1162
00:49:21,366 --> 00:49:24,265
Since I rinsed it, I think it might be good now.

1163
00:49:24,636 --> 00:49:27,605
(Please let it be good this time...)

1164
00:49:29,535 --> 00:49:33,846
(Taking a bite with anticipation...)

1165
00:49:34,946 --> 00:49:35,946
How is it?

1166
00:49:36,346 --> 00:49:37,975
(How is it? Is it good?)

1167
00:49:38,046 --> 00:49:40,486
Si Wan, start eating this. It's no good if it gets cold.

1168
00:49:40,486 --> 00:49:41,486
You need to eat anyway.

1169
00:49:41,486 --> 00:49:43,216
Oh, this is still salty.

1170
00:49:43,216 --> 00:49:44,355
- Yes.
- It's...

1171
00:49:44,355 --> 00:49:47,225
As soon as the soy sauce was poured, the noodles absorbed it completely.

1172
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:49,895
I'll still eat it though.

1173
00:49:49,895 --> 00:49:51,395
This is good. I'm serious.

1174
00:49:52,596 --> 00:49:53,725
That?

1175
00:49:53,895 --> 00:49:57,335
You just need to mix new noodles into this.

1176
00:49:57,335 --> 00:49:59,596
Then, like Hee Won's saying,

1177
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,165
- it'll be good if we mix it.
- That's right.

1178
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:03,835
We just need to mix the salty noodles and the new ones.

1179
00:50:04,035 --> 00:50:05,205
I'll try it.

1180
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:06,605
It's good.

1181
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:10,375
(Taking a big bite for everyone to see)

1182
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,015
Yes, this is good.

1183
00:50:13,515 --> 00:50:14,886
(Glance)

1184
00:50:15,486 --> 00:50:17,116
Yes, this is good.

1185
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:23,826
(After seeing everyone enjoy the meal...)

1186
00:50:24,225 --> 00:50:25,495
Isn't this spicy?

1187
00:50:25,596 --> 00:50:26,596
- Not at all.
- Is this okay?

1188
00:50:26,596 --> 00:50:27,765
It's not spicy at all.

1189
00:50:27,765 --> 00:50:28,826
(Si Wan now tries the webfoot octopus.)

1190
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:29,866
- Hey.
- Yes?

1191
00:50:30,196 --> 00:50:31,435
We need to serve the guest,

1192
00:50:31,435 --> 00:50:33,466
but we're most satisfied with what the guest bought us.

1193
00:50:33,966 --> 00:50:35,866
At least you guys are enjoying this.

1194
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,276
- That's right.
- It's all thanks to Si Wan.

1195
00:50:37,276 --> 00:50:38,335
(The reversal of host and guest)

1196
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:42,046
I thought through it so much of what I should buy.

1197
00:50:42,346 --> 00:50:44,875
I'd like to say thank you for all this.

1198
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,015
(The makguksu was disappointing, but the lunch was good.)

1199
00:50:46,216 --> 00:50:47,915
Gosh, if we didn't have this webfoot octopus,

1200
00:50:47,915 --> 00:50:49,245
- it would've been a disaster.
- I know.

1201
00:50:49,245 --> 00:50:50,616
(Thanks Hye Jin)

1202
00:50:50,785 --> 00:50:52,455
Okay then.

1203
00:50:53,015 --> 00:50:55,125
I'll fry the rice.

1204
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:58,796
The highlight of webfoot octopus is the fried rice at the end.

1205
00:50:58,796 --> 00:51:00,466
- We have rice, right?
- That's why I cooked rice.

1206
00:51:04,835 --> 00:51:05,835
(Skillfully adding the ingredients)

1207
00:51:05,835 --> 00:51:07,466
- I think it'll be good.
- This means the sauce isn't ready.

1208
00:51:09,306 --> 00:51:10,506
Wow, I'm looking forward to this.

1209
00:51:10,506 --> 00:51:13,475
(Adding pickled radish, laver, and sesame powder)

1210
00:51:13,475 --> 00:51:15,276
I made that to put into the makguksu,

1211
00:51:15,276 --> 00:51:16,515
but I think it'll be better for the fried rice.

1212
00:51:16,515 --> 00:51:18,015
We can re-use them. This as well.

1213
00:51:18,015 --> 00:51:21,015
(They're using all of Si Wan's ingredients.)

1214
00:51:21,015 --> 00:51:22,116
Hold the ladle.

1215
00:51:22,116 --> 00:51:23,116
(If you add plenty of white rice...)

1216
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:24,216
That's it.

1217
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:25,955
(Looks great)

1218
00:51:25,955 --> 00:51:27,256
That's the stuff.

1219
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:31,995
It looks good.

1220
00:51:31,995 --> 00:51:33,125
(Thoroughly cooking...)

1221
00:51:33,125 --> 00:51:35,426
Hye Jin, I'm so glad you brought this.

1222
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:36,696
(for the sauce to be absorbed well.)

1223
00:51:37,035 --> 00:51:38,165
How were we going to wait until lunch?

1224
00:51:38,165 --> 00:51:39,265
At least I brought this.

1225
00:51:40,466 --> 00:51:42,705
If you didn't bring this, it would have been a disaster.

1226
00:51:43,776 --> 00:51:44,875
So true.

1227
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:45,906
(Nicely cooked)

1228
00:51:45,906 --> 00:51:47,406
It looks so good.

1229
00:51:48,975 --> 00:51:51,315
- Once it becomes sticky...
- Gosh.

1230
00:51:51,546 --> 00:51:52,975
Can't we eat now?

1231
00:51:52,975 --> 00:51:54,915
We just need to add that in.

1232
00:51:54,915 --> 00:51:56,315
- Cheese?
- We just need...

1233
00:51:56,315 --> 00:51:57,455
to add the cheese, right?

1234
00:51:57,455 --> 00:51:58,915
Are you adding that as well?

1235
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:01,185
- I was planning to.
- Just add it in.

1236
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:03,256
Should I just mix it so the cheese melts inside?

1237
00:52:03,256 --> 00:52:04,995
- Sure.
- It'll be fine, right?

1238
00:52:04,995 --> 00:52:06,355
Of course.

1239
00:52:06,355 --> 00:52:08,895
(Mine's added again.)

1240
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,966
Gosh, this looks so amazing.

1241
00:52:10,966 --> 00:52:13,535
Yes, that's the most delicious one.

1242
00:52:13,535 --> 00:52:15,765
(It's done!)

1243
00:52:15,806 --> 00:52:17,236
We can eat now.

1244
00:52:17,236 --> 00:52:19,375
- Go have a seat.
- Yes.

1245
00:52:19,946 --> 00:52:21,406
Here you go.

1246
00:52:21,406 --> 00:52:24,346
(It's full of Dong Il's heart and Si Wan's effort.)

1247
00:52:24,346 --> 00:52:26,846
We may look like we simply cook, - Amazing!

1248
00:52:26,915 --> 00:52:28,616
but look.

1249
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:32,486
It's simply cooked. You can dig in now.

1250
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:34,725
- It's so pretty!
- It's pretty.

1251
00:52:34,725 --> 00:52:35,855
It looks like a mountain, and it's pretty.

1252
00:52:35,855 --> 00:52:38,855
- This will be seriously delicious.
- Look, I'll make the steam rise.

1253
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:39,926
(It's amazing.)

1254
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:41,125
The cheese pops up.

1255
00:52:41,196 --> 00:52:44,065
- Gosh, look at the cheese!
- Yes!

1256
00:52:44,236 --> 00:52:46,495
- I should serve the guest first.
- Thank you for the food.

1257
00:52:46,495 --> 00:52:48,335
- No, no.
- Here.

1258
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:50,006
- The plate?
- Bring it here.

1259
00:52:50,205 --> 00:52:52,335
It'll be crunchy if I cook longer,

1260
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,705
but the bottom's already burnt, so I stopped here.

1261
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:55,906
It looks so good.

1262
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,745
I think adding the cheese at the end was a great idea.

1263
00:53:01,046 --> 00:53:02,645
- Cheese...
- I should fry it longer.

1264
00:53:02,645 --> 00:53:05,116
It's sticky. Right?

1265
00:53:05,116 --> 00:53:06,785
- Is it?
- Is it bland?

1266
00:53:06,785 --> 00:53:10,225
(Dong Il and Hee Won dig in too.)

1267
00:53:10,796 --> 00:53:12,096
- Dong Il, this is so good.
- Really?

1268
00:53:12,096 --> 00:53:13,196
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

1269
00:53:13,196 --> 00:53:14,265
It's good, right?

1270
00:53:17,136 --> 00:53:20,806
(Si Wan likes it too.)

1271
00:53:20,806 --> 00:53:22,366
It's so tasty!

1272
00:53:23,165 --> 00:53:25,076
There are some less sticky parts as well.

1273
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,205
- Did you feel that?
- Yes.

1274
00:53:26,205 --> 00:53:27,906
- I mixed with the burnt part.
- I see.

1275
00:53:27,906 --> 00:53:29,276
- It's so good.
- It's so good.

1276
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:30,546
- Really?
- Yes!

1277
00:53:30,546 --> 00:53:32,346
It's savory because I added Si Wan's perilla powder.

1278
00:53:32,346 --> 00:53:34,216
- We really added everything.
- Yes.

1279
00:53:35,085 --> 00:53:37,656
We added the sauce Si Wan made just now too.

1280
00:53:37,656 --> 00:53:39,415
- It's all in here.
- Exactly, we added the perilla...

1281
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:41,855
- You added that too?
- and seaweed flake you made.

1282
00:53:41,855 --> 00:53:44,355
- It really is savory.
- The savoriness lingers.

1283
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:46,495
- Yes.
- If you just leave it like that...

1284
00:53:46,495 --> 00:53:48,426
- This is really good.
- Nurungji at the bottom is tasty.

1285
00:53:48,426 --> 00:53:51,035
- This is it.
- That's the best part.

1286
00:53:51,035 --> 00:53:52,035
You're right.

1287
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:55,835
I'm so glad we have this.

1288
00:53:55,835 --> 00:53:57,035
(Dong Il gathers the best part for Si Wan.)

1289
00:53:57,276 --> 00:54:00,446
Webfoot octopus indeed is delicious.

1290
00:54:00,546 --> 00:54:01,906
The sauce is good.

1291
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:03,846
(He eats nurungji full of Dong Il's affection.)

1292
00:54:04,216 --> 00:54:06,315
(It makes him dance from how good it is.)

1293
00:54:06,315 --> 00:54:08,116
- This is amazing.
- Yes.

1294
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:10,386
Do you normally put in pickled radish as well?

1295
00:54:10,386 --> 00:54:11,756
Exactly. This is my first time seeing this.

1296
00:54:11,756 --> 00:54:13,926
- The pickled radish makes it sweet.
- Yes.

1297
00:54:13,926 --> 00:54:16,285
- Kids like it.
- It's just right for kids, yes.

1298
00:54:16,285 --> 00:54:18,625
I always put in some cheese.

1299
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:21,366
I'm a kid myself. I am.

1300
00:54:21,796 --> 00:54:23,495
(Laughing)

1301
00:54:24,236 --> 00:54:27,605
(It started rather messily, )

1302
00:54:27,605 --> 00:54:29,335
(but they ended up with a delicious lunch with all their efforts.)

1303
00:54:29,335 --> 00:54:31,035
- This is really tasty.
- Yes.

1304
00:54:31,035 --> 00:54:32,935
It's good. It's really good.

1305
00:54:37,546 --> 00:54:40,085
Gosh, it's much better here with the sunlight.

1306
00:54:40,085 --> 00:54:41,716
(They enjoy their free time after lunch.)

1307
00:54:43,315 --> 00:54:46,955
(Hye Jin looks at the pictures of the family.)

1308
00:54:46,955 --> 00:54:49,085
(Looking closely)

1309
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:51,556
Whenever a trip ends,

1310
00:54:51,556 --> 00:54:54,926
we always take a polaroid picture like that.

1311
00:54:55,026 --> 00:54:57,895
- Which ones are taken this season?
- This.

1312
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:00,105
- The ones with my face.
- Exactly.

1313
00:55:00,105 --> 00:55:01,665
- Look at this.
- We took more pictures,

1314
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:04,906
but we didn't put up everything. We took a lot more pictures.

1315
00:55:04,906 --> 00:55:06,906
(Hye Jin will become a part of the memory as well.)

1316
00:55:07,145 --> 00:55:08,605
(The treasure of the house)

1317
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:11,276
(Pictures taken with the guests)

1318
00:55:13,145 --> 00:55:15,145
(After looking at the pictures, they come out...)

1319
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,156
(to the front yard which is dyed in silver.)

1320
00:55:18,355 --> 00:55:19,415
(The siblings go for a walk cozily.)

1321
00:55:19,415 --> 00:55:22,085
Silver grass is so tall.

1322
00:55:22,785 --> 00:55:26,596
(In the silver grass field of Mount Taehwa, )

1323
00:55:27,895 --> 00:55:31,165
(Si Wan spends his time leisurely with Hye Jin.)

1324
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:33,636
Gosh, it's so pretty!

1325
00:55:33,636 --> 00:55:35,136
Hye Jin, look at this!

1326
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:37,236
They do this. If you look at mothers' old pictures,

1327
00:55:37,236 --> 00:55:38,835
they always pose like this with silver grass.

1328
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,806
Yes, I think my mom has one too.

1329
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:42,046
- It's always this pose.
- I think...

1330
00:55:42,046 --> 00:55:44,616
I took a picture like that when I was young as well.

1331
00:55:44,616 --> 00:55:46,145
They always pose like that.

1332
00:55:46,145 --> 00:55:47,546
I think I took one too.

1333
00:55:49,386 --> 00:55:52,486
It'll be fun to travel around Korea like this.

1334
00:55:52,486 --> 00:55:53,855
- I know, right?
- Yes.

1335
00:55:54,326 --> 00:55:58,926
There's a sense of relaxation that you can't feel in Seoul.

1336
00:55:58,926 --> 00:56:00,565
There's nothing to worry about.

1337
00:56:01,765 --> 00:56:03,665
It's good to move about.

1338
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:07,866
- Look, look! It's there!
- Is it there?

1339
00:56:07,866 --> 00:56:09,705
It's there.

1340
00:56:09,835 --> 00:56:10,835
(Smiling broadly)

1341
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:11,975
- It's there.
- The stone...

1342
00:56:11,975 --> 00:56:14,276
- It's there.
- I see it!

1343
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:18,846
(There is a small goat pen beside our house.)

1344
00:56:19,546 --> 00:56:22,446
Look at them running, it's so cute.

1345
00:56:23,656 --> 00:56:26,315
(Nice to meet you, Si Wan!)

1346
00:56:27,355 --> 00:56:29,926
(He throws the treats he prepared for the cuties...)

1347
00:56:29,926 --> 00:56:32,125
(with all his might!)

1348
00:56:33,326 --> 00:56:36,495
(Here you go!)

1349
00:56:36,495 --> 00:56:37,636
It looked at you!

1350
00:56:38,035 --> 00:56:39,966
- The goat looked at you.
- It looked at me.

1351
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:42,265
(After throwing the treats, he goes to stand beside Hye Jin.)

1352
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:44,035
- But they didn't see what you did.
- It's okay.

1353
00:56:44,035 --> 00:56:45,835
Don't mind me, just eat.

1354
00:56:47,576 --> 00:56:49,846
I think they're eating something more delicious.

1355
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:51,915
You threw it, - Yes.

1356
00:56:51,915 --> 00:56:53,346
but it didn't get past the rock.

1357
00:56:53,346 --> 00:56:54,986
Should I throw farther?

1358
00:56:56,515 --> 00:56:58,986
(He tries once again.)

1359
00:56:59,156 --> 00:57:01,056
- Gosh, I'm sorry.
- Look!

1360
00:57:04,455 --> 00:57:06,256
(It's eating!)

1361
00:57:07,696 --> 00:57:08,826
Did it eat the treat?

1362
00:57:09,495 --> 00:57:11,736
You saw that, right?

1363
00:57:11,736 --> 00:57:14,306
Come here. Let's have some treats!

1364
00:57:14,406 --> 00:57:16,535
(Happy for him.)

1365
00:57:19,506 --> 00:57:22,975
(He's so brave.)

1366
00:57:23,846 --> 00:57:25,415
Okay, hold on.

1367
00:57:27,085 --> 00:57:29,216
Did you see that?

1368
00:57:29,216 --> 00:57:30,285
(I saw that!)

1369
00:57:30,285 --> 00:57:31,855
- Did you see that?
- It's quite sociable.

1370
00:57:31,855 --> 00:57:33,315
It's amazing, right?

1371
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:38,326
(She starts taking pictures of Si Wan.)

1372
00:57:39,696 --> 00:57:41,466
Here, have the peel.

1373
00:57:41,696 --> 00:57:42,796
Here.

1374
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:44,935
(Even after that, )

1375
00:57:45,736 --> 00:57:51,375
(Si Wan kept feeding it without being aware of the time.)

1376
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:54,276
(Others will be waiting about now.)

1377
00:57:54,276 --> 00:57:57,276
Si Wan?

1378
00:57:57,276 --> 00:57:58,415
Let's go.

1379
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:00,216
Okay!

1380
00:58:00,346 --> 00:58:01,685
I'll get going.

1381
00:58:01,685 --> 00:58:03,656
(It's too bad, but they have to say goodbye.)

1382
00:58:04,085 --> 00:58:06,486
(See you again!)

1383
00:58:07,426 --> 00:58:10,596
(Two of them spent a cozy time together.)

1384
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:13,765
Shall we go pick some mushrooms?

1385
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:16,935
Yes. Let's go buy some groceries.

1386
00:58:18,966 --> 00:58:21,205
(I like mushrooms.)

1387
00:58:22,535 --> 00:58:25,835
(Mushrooms in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, )

1388
00:58:26,435 --> 00:58:29,776
(grow up absorbing Paldang Lake's clear water.)

1389
00:58:30,145 --> 00:58:33,585
(So they're known for a good scent and chewy texture!)

1390
00:58:34,046 --> 00:58:37,285
(If they're put in a soup dish that Hye Jin likes, )

1391
00:58:38,285 --> 00:58:41,256
(their flavor can be savored to the fullest.)

1392
00:58:42,026 --> 00:58:44,526
(They're on the way to pick those mushrooms!)

1393
00:58:45,326 --> 00:58:46,625
(They visit a mushroom farm near the house.)

1394
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:48,826
- Hello!
- Hello.

1395
00:58:48,826 --> 00:58:50,495
- Hello.
- You're here.

1396
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,765
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1397
00:58:52,835 --> 00:58:55,205
We'd like to buy some oyster mushrooms.

1398
00:58:55,205 --> 00:58:56,765
Sure thing! Let's get inside.

1399
00:58:58,776 --> 00:59:03,046
(They're fascinated by the mysterious looking inside.)

1400
00:59:03,745 --> 00:59:06,446
(Mushrooms are grown with blue LED which helps with their growth.)

1401
00:59:07,145 --> 00:59:09,986
(Thanks to that, the place is full of high-quality mushrooms.)

1402
00:59:10,216 --> 00:59:11,716
Sir, can I just pluck them?

1403
00:59:11,716 --> 00:59:13,685
Yes, you can just pluck them.

1404
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:15,756
It comes off easily.

1405
00:59:16,685 --> 00:59:19,955
(She skillfully does it with one hand.)

1406
00:59:20,565 --> 00:59:24,296
(She happily continued to pluck fresh mushrooms.)

1407
00:59:24,696 --> 00:59:25,696
(The basket is full of mushrooms.)

1408
00:59:25,696 --> 00:59:28,466
The quality looks really good.

1409
00:59:28,466 --> 00:59:30,776
- We'll enjoy it.
- Yes, have a safe trip.

1410
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:32,835
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1411
00:59:33,605 --> 00:59:35,776
- Goodness.
- They look so fresh.

1412
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:38,546
(The Avengers of mushrooms will be assembled for today's dinner.)

1413
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,616
Look, the ones we plucked ourselves.

1414
00:59:42,616 --> 00:59:44,015
Gosh, they're not easy to see.

1415
00:59:44,015 --> 00:59:45,915
- They're not easy to see.
- No.

1416
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:47,426
They're so fresh.

1417
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,926
(The highlight of the day!)

1418
00:59:49,926 --> 00:59:52,296
These are mushrooms.

1419
00:59:53,026 --> 00:59:54,696
Look at lion's mane mushroom.

1420
00:59:54,696 --> 00:59:58,196
My gosh, this is good.

1421
00:59:58,196 --> 01:00:00,966
It's the mane! Lion's mane.

1422
01:00:00,966 --> 01:00:02,435
Isn't it really cute?

1423
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:03,676
- It is.
- It really is.

1424
01:00:03,676 --> 01:00:04,975
Gosh, the mushrooms...

1425
01:00:05,136 --> 01:00:06,776
I've never seen some of them before.

1426
01:00:06,776 --> 01:00:10,145
Isn't this the first time seeing the one like a jellyfish?

1427
01:00:10,475 --> 01:00:12,975
That one has a name too, the one with long hair.

1428
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:14,015
- Gosh.
- What is it?

1429
01:00:14,015 --> 01:00:15,346
It's cordyceps!

1430
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:17,855
- The one with long hair.
- Cordyceps? Gosh.

1431
01:00:18,185 --> 01:00:20,116
- I see.
- This is so fascinating.

1432
01:00:20,656 --> 01:00:23,955
I played "One Million Roses" just now.

1433
01:00:23,955 --> 01:00:26,256
- Yes.
- This is beech mushroom.

1434
01:00:26,296 --> 01:00:28,596
- It's name?
- Yes, beech mushroom.

1435
01:00:28,665 --> 01:00:29,696
- Gosh.
- Really?

1436
01:00:29,696 --> 01:00:32,065
- Beech mushroom.
- One million roses.

1437
01:00:32,065 --> 01:00:33,636
Is that the name of the mushroom?

1438
01:00:33,636 --> 01:00:36,636
I did know about that one, but this is beech mushroom.

1439
01:00:36,636 --> 01:00:39,136
- Snow fungus?
- It's this one! Snow fungus.

1440
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,205
White mushroom.

1441
01:00:40,205 --> 01:00:42,605
So it's a white version of black ear mushroom.

1442
01:00:42,776 --> 01:00:44,315
Black ear mushroom is really good.

1443
01:00:44,315 --> 01:00:46,576
- Yes. They look the same.
- Gosh.

1444
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,616
- This is lion's mane mushroom.
- Lion's mane mushroom.

1445
01:00:48,616 --> 01:00:49,616
Look at this.

1446
01:00:49,616 --> 01:00:51,156
- This is golden enoki mushroom.
- Golden enoki mushroom.

1447
01:00:51,256 --> 01:00:52,315
Golden enoki mushroom.

1448
01:00:52,785 --> 01:00:54,585
I know this golden enoki mushroom too.

1449
01:00:54,585 --> 01:00:56,056
Golden enoki.

1450
01:00:56,056 --> 01:00:57,495
- Brown beech mushroom.
- This is brown beech mushroom.

1451
01:00:57,495 --> 01:00:58,596
Brown beech.

1452
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:02,165
Shiitake mushroom. I know this. Goodness.

1453
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,466
(She's excited to eat tasty food.)

1454
01:01:04,466 --> 01:01:06,895
First, we need to cook the broth.

1455
01:01:06,895 --> 01:01:08,806
And we need to start a charcoal fire.

1456
01:01:10,205 --> 01:01:11,776
It'll be done soon.

1457
01:01:11,776 --> 01:01:13,236
(Add a broth pack and a lot of water.)

1458
01:01:13,745 --> 01:01:17,176
(Onions to add sweetness!)

1459
01:01:18,145 --> 01:01:20,046
We cook very quickly.

1460
01:01:20,685 --> 01:01:23,085
(He cuts scallions into big chunks.)

1461
01:01:23,315 --> 01:01:26,116
Everything's in, right? I just need to add some radish.

1462
01:01:26,116 --> 01:01:28,486
- Yes.
- Okay.

1463
01:01:29,026 --> 01:01:31,225
(She adds some whole black pepper as the finishing touch.)

1464
01:01:31,225 --> 01:01:32,796
It's almost done.

1465
01:01:34,966 --> 01:01:37,535
I should place the charcoal on top like this.

1466
01:01:37,535 --> 01:01:39,366
- Gosh.
- I thought I grabbed it.

1467
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:41,165
Yes, this is what camping should be like.

1468
01:01:41,565 --> 01:01:44,006
- Right.
- What is it?

1469
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:48,006
I heard that Hye Jin is something,

1470
01:01:49,145 --> 01:01:51,145
so I came up with a memorable idea.

1471
01:01:51,145 --> 01:01:52,216
(A surprise event for Hye Jin)

1472
01:01:52,216 --> 01:01:53,676
(He takes out something.)

1473
01:01:54,986 --> 01:01:57,455
(Curious)

1474
01:01:58,085 --> 01:02:00,156
(Dong Il prepared a surprise present without telling anyone!)

1475
01:02:00,886 --> 01:02:02,955
(What is that?)

1476
01:02:03,185 --> 01:02:05,395
House on Wheels!

1477
01:02:05,395 --> 01:02:06,395
(A neon sign)

1478
01:02:06,725 --> 01:02:08,995
(It's a present for Hye Jin who traveled a long way for them.)

1479
01:02:08,995 --> 01:02:10,165
(Smiling broadly)

1480
01:02:10,966 --> 01:02:15,705
(He securely hangs it at a place that can be seen clearly.)

1481
01:02:15,935 --> 01:02:19,136
Okay, it's done. Turn it on!

1482
01:02:19,276 --> 01:02:20,546
Turn it on now!

1483
01:02:20,546 --> 01:02:21,546
(Dancing)

1484
01:02:21,645 --> 01:02:24,616
(House on Wheels)

1485
01:02:24,815 --> 01:02:27,245
(House on Wheels lights up.)

1486
01:02:27,616 --> 01:02:28,946
- House on Wheels.
- House on Wheels.

1487
01:02:28,946 --> 01:02:32,616
It's so pretty! It goes so well with the house like a tent bar.

1488
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:33,685
Like a tent bar.

1489
01:02:34,556 --> 01:02:36,285
It looks like House on Heels though.

1490
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:38,895
You're right, isn't this House on Heels?

1491
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,826
It's fine, better than nothing at all.

1492
01:02:42,165 --> 01:02:43,765
It's almost done.

1493
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:46,335
What a masterpiece. Look.

1494
01:02:46,335 --> 01:02:48,835
- It smells amazing.
- It's good.

1495
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:50,935
But we didn't season it at all.

1496
01:02:51,105 --> 01:02:54,145
Then should I season it with soy sauce...

1497
01:02:54,346 --> 01:02:55,645
(Soy sauce?)

1498
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,446
(Did you say soy sauce?)

1499
01:02:58,846 --> 01:03:01,216
(My mouth suddenly tastes salty.)

1500
01:03:01,886 --> 01:03:02,886
Soy sauce is prohibited today.

1501
01:03:02,886 --> 01:03:04,355
(The culprit of the incident)

1502
01:03:05,116 --> 01:03:07,085
We're sick of soy sauce today.

1503
01:03:07,085 --> 01:03:08,085
Exactly.

1504
01:03:09,056 --> 01:03:12,526
No, this... The sauce was good.

1505
01:03:12,526 --> 01:03:13,625
It's just that there was too much.

1506
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:15,725
What about putting in some Cheongyang chili...

1507
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,065
- to add the spiciness?
- Great!

1508
01:03:17,435 --> 01:03:18,866
- I think that'll be nice.
- Yes, we should add some chili.

1509
01:03:18,866 --> 01:03:21,435
- Exactly. About this much?
- Yes, that looks good.

1510
01:03:21,435 --> 01:03:23,265
Okay. Bring the mushrooms here!

1511
01:03:23,935 --> 01:03:24,935
Yes.

1512
01:03:25,576 --> 01:03:28,145
(The unique mushrooms make your mouth water.)

1513
01:03:28,576 --> 01:03:29,806
Cordyceps.

1514
01:03:31,446 --> 01:03:33,576
We're the best at plating.

1515
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:34,585
(He cuts them up nicely for shabu-shabu.)

1516
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:38,785
Look at how amazing they look.

1517
01:03:38,785 --> 01:03:39,915
(He carefully places 9 types of mushrooms.)

1518
01:03:39,915 --> 01:03:40,926
Here.

1519
01:03:41,725 --> 01:03:46,096
(9 types of mushrooms are on the way.)

1520
01:03:47,395 --> 01:03:48,866
(Happy)

1521
01:03:49,565 --> 01:03:52,866
They're amazing.

1522
01:03:52,866 --> 01:03:54,136
(They enjoy a healthy meal of mushrooms one hour away from Seoul.)

1523
01:03:54,136 --> 01:03:56,236
We put all our effort into plating.

1524
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:00,035
It's all about plating.

1525
01:04:00,035 --> 01:04:01,046
(He takes out dumplings to put into shabu-shabu!)

1526
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:04,946
- Food has to look pretty.
- Here it comes.

1527
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:08,585
We need to make the sauce with soy sauce.

1528
01:04:08,685 --> 01:04:13,015
Hye Jin, make a special sauce for us.

1529
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:16,725
- Me?
- Make a special sauce.

1530
01:04:16,926 --> 01:04:19,426
I'll look forward to it. The sauce is most important!

1531
01:04:19,826 --> 01:04:22,065
What do you need?

1532
01:04:22,296 --> 01:04:26,366
We need soy sauce and minced garlic.

1533
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:28,236
Minced garlic? Minced garlic...

1534
01:04:29,335 --> 01:04:32,236
Minced garlic is here.

1535
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:33,306
(Tell me whatever you need!)

1536
01:04:33,676 --> 01:04:36,475
Minced garlic. What else?

1537
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,815
What's this? It's that, right?

1538
01:04:38,815 --> 01:04:40,785
The problematic soy sauce.

1539
01:04:40,785 --> 01:04:42,346
I can use this soy sauce.

1540
01:04:43,185 --> 01:04:44,986
(You want to use this?)

1541
01:04:45,216 --> 01:04:46,815
Can you really resuscitate this?

1542
01:04:46,815 --> 01:04:48,285
(Just trust me.)

1543
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:50,125
Minced garlic.

1544
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,826
(To make special soy sauce, first add minced garlic.)

1545
01:04:52,395 --> 01:04:54,225
(The next is...)

1546
01:04:54,225 --> 01:04:55,895
(gochujang?)

1547
01:04:55,895 --> 01:04:57,696
(What's happening?)

1548
01:04:58,265 --> 01:05:00,196
(For shabu-shabu...)

1549
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:02,265
(Soy sauce)

1550
01:05:02,966 --> 01:05:04,806
(She casually adds gochujang.)

1551
01:05:05,076 --> 01:05:06,076
(1 spoonful of gochujang)

1552
01:05:06,176 --> 01:05:07,176
(2 spoonfuls of gochujang)

1553
01:05:08,645 --> 01:05:09,875
This is a lot.

1554
01:05:11,475 --> 01:05:13,375
- We don't need lots of rice, right?
- This is that soy sauce?

1555
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:14,386
It's that soy sauce.

1556
01:05:14,585 --> 01:05:17,486
Right? I just need to scoop a bit.

1557
01:05:18,386 --> 01:05:20,685
(Gochujang and that soy sauce)

1558
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:23,225
We'll split it later.

1559
01:05:23,225 --> 01:05:24,756
(Mysterious sauce...)

1560
01:05:26,926 --> 01:05:30,466
Isn't this dipping sauce for shabu-shabu?

1561
01:05:30,466 --> 01:05:32,765
- For napa cabbage and stuff?
- You're right.

1562
01:05:32,765 --> 01:05:35,035
- What sauce is this?
- It's just sauce.

1563
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,435
- Without any goal?
- No.

1564
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:40,875
Okay, then.

1565
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:42,975
Is it weird?

1566
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,475
Isn't it normally soy sauce with wasabi...

1567
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:47,446
- Okay, then...
- and garlic?

1568
01:05:47,446 --> 01:05:49,245
I'll make both of them.

1569
01:05:49,245 --> 01:05:50,716
- This one.
- Yes.

1570
01:05:50,915 --> 01:05:53,256
I'll add wasabi for this, and leave that one as it is.

1571
01:05:53,285 --> 01:05:55,285
- Yes, and add minced garlic.
- Minced garlic.

1572
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:57,225
I think this will taste good.

1573
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:59,196
(Right, come to think of it...)

1574
01:05:59,196 --> 01:06:01,526
Si Wan, it's the soy sauce made by you, right?

1575
01:06:01,526 --> 01:06:02,866
- It's that one.
- Right.

1576
01:06:03,065 --> 01:06:04,495
The problematic soy sauce.

1577
01:06:04,495 --> 01:06:06,636
But it's very salty.

1578
01:06:07,035 --> 01:06:09,006
- Should I add some water?
- Yes, I think we should.

1579
01:06:09,705 --> 01:06:11,236
Pour a lot of water.

1580
01:06:11,236 --> 01:06:14,076
But isn't this too watery?

1581
01:06:14,076 --> 01:06:15,406
It's supposed to be like that.

1582
01:06:15,745 --> 01:06:17,145
- Isn't it too watery?
- When you go to shabu-shabu shop...

1583
01:06:17,145 --> 01:06:19,276
Yes, they all serve like this in the restaurants.

1584
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:21,145
- Really?
- Yes. That's enough.

1585
01:06:21,145 --> 01:06:23,946
That's enough. But what sauce is this for?

1586
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:26,756
It's just for meat and stuff.

1587
01:06:26,756 --> 01:06:27,756
Is it?

1588
01:06:27,756 --> 01:06:29,026
(Humming)

1589
01:06:29,855 --> 01:06:30,855
(Groaning)

1590
01:06:31,056 --> 01:06:32,895
Look here. The meat.

1591
01:06:33,026 --> 01:06:35,326
- The set up is incredible!
- It's incredible indeed.

1592
01:06:35,326 --> 01:06:36,796
(The table is full of Chef Sung's artistic spirit.)

1593
01:06:36,796 --> 01:06:38,096
This is...

1594
01:06:38,196 --> 01:06:40,265
This is a masterpiece.

1595
01:06:40,665 --> 01:06:42,105
(Their dinner is set up fancily with fresh mushrooms from the town.)

1596
01:06:42,105 --> 01:06:44,506
- Come out now.
- Okay.

1597
01:06:44,705 --> 01:06:47,846
Check out the visual. Look at how it's boiling with charcoal fire.

1598
01:06:48,205 --> 01:06:50,406
Boiling, boiling.

1599
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,145
- Here.
- Shall we try?

1600
01:06:52,145 --> 01:06:53,616
Put in whatever you want first.

1601
01:06:53,616 --> 01:06:54,946
(Happy)

1602
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:56,946
Let's start with what we plucked today.

1603
01:06:58,785 --> 01:07:01,156
About this much.

1604
01:07:01,256 --> 01:07:03,386
Beef gets cooked the moment you put it in.

1605
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:04,895
I'll put one in.

1606
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,455
Dip one in.

1607
01:07:08,366 --> 01:07:09,725
The meat's oil will come out.

1608
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:11,366
Then the soup will get thick later.

1609
01:07:11,466 --> 01:07:13,466
- Give one to Hye Jin first.
- Try one first.

1610
01:07:13,466 --> 01:07:15,435
(They give the first meat to the precious guest, Hye Jin.)

1611
01:07:15,435 --> 01:07:19,535
Like this. You should have it together with napa cabbage.

1612
01:07:20,105 --> 01:07:21,676
And dip it in the sauce.

1613
01:07:21,676 --> 01:07:25,076
- The sauce.
- Dip it in slightly.

1614
01:07:25,276 --> 01:07:27,116
Tell us how it is.

1615
01:07:28,446 --> 01:07:30,585
(Will she like it?)

1616
01:07:31,056 --> 01:07:32,386
(How is it?)

1617
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:35,986
We should really have just a bit of the sauce. It's salty!

1618
01:07:37,085 --> 01:07:38,696
(It's salty.)

1619
01:07:38,696 --> 01:07:41,025
- It's scary!
- Everything's salty today.

1620
01:07:41,226 --> 01:07:43,995
- Add the meat.
- Meat's going in.

1621
01:07:43,995 --> 01:07:46,535
- It's delicious.
- Can't wait to taste it.

1622
01:07:46,535 --> 01:07:49,335
Take the meat first.

1623
01:07:49,806 --> 01:07:52,136
(He dips a bit of soy sauce.)

1624
01:07:53,176 --> 01:07:54,646
(He tries the mushroom too.)

1625
01:07:55,445 --> 01:07:58,676
(Si Wan tries brisket and oyster mushroom in one bite.)

1626
01:07:58,676 --> 01:08:02,085
Dong Il, I tried with this sauce,

1627
01:08:02,085 --> 01:08:04,115
- It tastes good.
- and it's so good.

1628
01:08:04,785 --> 01:08:05,816
It tastes good.

1629
01:08:05,816 --> 01:08:07,686
See, I told you it'll be nice.

1630
01:08:07,686 --> 01:08:08,686
Yes.

1631
01:08:09,155 --> 01:08:11,096
(The soy sauce whets your appetite.)

1632
01:08:11,525 --> 01:08:13,356
- It tastes good.
- A bit. Just a bit!

1633
01:08:13,596 --> 01:08:15,566
- It's salty. They're all salty.
- No.

1634
01:08:15,726 --> 01:08:17,636
It tastes good.

1635
01:08:17,835 --> 01:08:19,995
(She's happy to see them enjoy it.)

1636
01:08:20,466 --> 01:08:21,936
Hye Jin, what would you like next?

1637
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:24,136
I don't even dare to touch them.

1638
01:08:24,136 --> 01:08:26,535
- Because you want to keep them.
- I don't know what to do.

1639
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:29,375
- They won against beef, right?
- Yes.

1640
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:31,275
- They are the main dish.
- They're the main dish today.

1641
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:33,146
Let me try this first!

1642
01:08:33,146 --> 01:08:34,816
- That's cordyceps!
- Put it in.

1643
01:08:35,285 --> 01:08:37,016
Let me put in some cordyceps.

1644
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:41,525
Cordyceps! I'll try them one by one.

1645
01:08:44,396 --> 01:08:46,756
Yes, that's brown beech mushroom.

1646
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:48,195
Brown beech mushroom.

1647
01:08:48,266 --> 01:08:49,296
I see.

1648
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:51,096
Cordyceps.

1649
01:08:51,096 --> 01:08:52,695
(He smells it first.)

1650
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:55,665
(He's tasting cordyceps for the first time.)

1651
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:57,335
(Crunchy)

1652
01:08:58,905 --> 01:09:00,705
- Cordyceps is pretty hard.
- Yes.

1653
01:09:01,006 --> 01:09:02,375
It feels like I'm eating oriental medicine.

1654
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:04,816
(Cordyceps' healthy and deep flavor spreads in their mouth.)

1655
01:09:04,816 --> 01:09:05,875
- It tastes good.
- Nice.

1656
01:09:06,945 --> 01:09:07,945
Don't eat rice!

1657
01:09:08,285 --> 01:09:12,085
It's really deep. It'll be amazing to boil the soup with this.

1658
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:14,325
- It'll get tastier.
- Yes, it will.

1659
01:09:14,325 --> 01:09:15,556
Yes. This...

1660
01:09:15,556 --> 01:09:18,556
What kind of flavor is this. It's incredible!

1661
01:09:19,495 --> 01:09:20,865
We don't have any more cordyceps.

1662
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,226
There are not many cordyceps.

1663
01:09:22,226 --> 01:09:24,266
- Here you go.
- It's okay.

1664
01:09:24,266 --> 01:09:26,466
- Here.
- My gosh.

1665
01:09:26,466 --> 01:09:28,466
- I get the last one.
- We can have them again later.

1666
01:09:29,506 --> 01:09:31,436
- Hee Won, want some napa cabbage?
- Sure.

1667
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:34,875
- The cabbage is refreshing!
- It is.

1668
01:09:34,976 --> 01:09:36,705
For real. I'm not joking.

1669
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:39,476
(She slurps the last cordyceps deliciously.)

1670
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:42,386
Isn't it good? This has a good vibe.

1671
01:09:42,615 --> 01:09:45,085
- I should put in the mushrooms...
- Yes.

1672
01:09:45,085 --> 01:09:46,655
- one by one.
- I'll put them in too.

1673
01:09:46,655 --> 01:09:47,825
- Beech mushrooms?
- Yes.

1674
01:09:47,825 --> 01:09:50,585
(He puts in beech mushrooms that Hye Jin likes.)

1675
01:09:50,585 --> 01:09:52,025
- Lion.
- Lion's mane.

1676
01:09:52,025 --> 01:09:53,695
- Lion's mane.
- Put in some mane.

1677
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,226
Should I put in four pieces?

1678
01:09:57,266 --> 01:09:59,396
Dong Il, try some beech mushrooms.

1679
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:00,396
Okay.

1680
01:10:01,466 --> 01:10:02,535
Beech mushroom.

1681
01:10:03,136 --> 01:10:04,775
(Chewing)

1682
01:10:05,476 --> 01:10:07,335
It's so chewy and bouncy.

1683
01:10:08,306 --> 01:10:10,146
- It runs around in my mouth.
- Really?

1684
01:10:10,146 --> 01:10:12,516
- I think we should eat this fast.
- We should eat it fast.

1685
01:10:12,716 --> 01:10:14,285
Lion's mane? Hee Won.

1686
01:10:15,886 --> 01:10:18,556
There's nothing to chew for lion's mane.

1687
01:10:18,985 --> 01:10:21,186
- It just melts in your mouth.
- Yes.

1688
01:10:21,186 --> 01:10:22,785
(It melts away like magic.)

1689
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:24,856
This tastes good too.

1690
01:10:25,995 --> 01:10:29,825
I don't know if I should say this, but they all taste the same.

1691
01:10:30,796 --> 01:10:32,335
The textures are very different.

1692
01:10:32,466 --> 01:10:33,995
Cordyceps and black ear mushrooms and so on.

1693
01:10:33,995 --> 01:10:36,066
- But they're all mushrooms.
- Exactly.

1694
01:10:36,535 --> 01:10:38,006
- What should we eat next?
- Enoki?

1695
01:10:38,006 --> 01:10:40,235
I think this will taste good. Snow fungus.

1696
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:42,306
- Was it snow fungus?
- Snow fungus.

1697
01:10:42,306 --> 01:10:44,006
Snow fungus.

1698
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:45,245
- Put in one by one.
- Yes.

1699
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:46,575
- What's that?
- Black ear mushroom.

1700
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:48,285
Black ear mushroom. It's very expensive.

1701
01:10:48,915 --> 01:10:52,585
Now, pork jowl meat is on the way.

1702
01:10:52,585 --> 01:10:55,256
(Pork jowl meat is on the way.)

1703
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:57,995
(Pork jowl meat...)

1704
01:10:57,995 --> 01:10:59,025
(all of a sudden?)

1705
01:10:59,025 --> 01:11:03,266
Let's try this with mushrooms.

1706
01:11:03,466 --> 01:11:04,535
Wrap it with mushroom.

1707
01:11:07,266 --> 01:11:09,766
The texture will be chewy and nice.

1708
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,205
What is that, my gosh.

1709
01:11:12,306 --> 01:11:13,976
Look at that.

1710
01:11:14,035 --> 01:11:15,646
- Pork jowl meat looks good.
- Yes.

1711
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:19,075
(Well-cooked pork jowl meat...)

1712
01:11:19,075 --> 01:11:20,985
This is also amazing.

1713
01:11:21,346 --> 01:11:22,846
(together with soft snow fungus!)

1714
01:11:22,846 --> 01:11:25,985
Try this with mushrooms.

1715
01:11:26,816 --> 01:11:28,085
With the sauce.

1716
01:11:28,856 --> 01:11:32,195
(The combination of pork jowl meat and snow fungus)

1717
01:11:32,726 --> 01:11:35,566
The meat and the mushroom go quite well together.

1718
01:11:36,396 --> 01:11:39,695
(Si Wan takes a big bite!)

1719
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:41,936
Try this. This mushroom is pretty good.

1720
01:11:41,936 --> 01:11:43,905
(Snow fungus is amazing.)

1721
01:11:43,905 --> 01:11:45,775
(Pork jowl meat is also amazing.)

1722
01:11:46,205 --> 01:11:48,205
- Have this.
- Snow fungus?

1723
01:11:48,245 --> 01:11:49,375
(Try it, Hye Jin.)

1724
01:11:49,375 --> 01:11:50,676
Try it with the pork jowl meat.

1725
01:11:50,676 --> 01:11:53,146
- It goes with the meat so well.
- Let's see.

1726
01:11:53,146 --> 01:11:54,615
(Let's see.)

1727
01:11:54,615 --> 01:11:55,985
The texture is funny.

1728
01:11:58,016 --> 01:12:01,356
(Eyes opening wide)

1729
01:12:01,525 --> 01:12:02,856
- It's really nice, right?
- Yes.

1730
01:12:02,856 --> 01:12:03,926
(The combination of the two gives a fun texture.)

1731
01:12:03,926 --> 01:12:06,025
They don't feel different. It's fascinating.

1732
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,356
What's this mushroom called again?

1733
01:12:07,625 --> 01:12:09,896
- It's snow fungus.
- It's snow fungus.

1734
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:13,436
This feels different from other mushrooms.

1735
01:12:13,665 --> 01:12:16,106
Mushrooms and the pork jowl meat get along really well.

1736
01:12:17,306 --> 01:12:18,835
The texture is amazing.

1737
01:12:19,476 --> 01:12:20,676
It's the best.

1738
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:23,275
This is so good. I'm not kidding.

1739
01:12:23,275 --> 01:12:25,245
(Having pork jowl meat with black ear mushroom)

1740
01:12:25,245 --> 01:12:26,346
This is fantastic.

1741
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:28,816
(They enjoy the taste of Gwangju's nature.)

1742
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:30,316
It's so chewy.

1743
01:12:30,316 --> 01:12:31,356
(She's completely satisfied.)

1744
01:12:31,615 --> 01:12:34,256
It feels like they're perfect for each other.

1745
01:12:34,256 --> 01:12:35,485
(They finished the mushrooms in no time.)

1746
01:12:35,955 --> 01:12:37,625
(It's so good!)

1747
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,096
- I'm curious about this now.
- Right.

1748
01:12:40,096 --> 01:12:42,325
- What's this called?
- It's golden enoki mushroom.

1749
01:12:42,325 --> 01:12:43,625
Golden enoki mushroom.

1750
01:12:43,865 --> 01:12:45,596
- There's no time to waste.
- This is golden enoki mushroom.

1751
01:12:45,596 --> 01:12:46,796
We need to eat it before the broth is gone.

1752
01:12:47,735 --> 01:12:50,006
We should add some more water.

1753
01:12:50,006 --> 01:12:51,176
- Should we add some water?
- We should.

1754
01:12:51,176 --> 01:12:52,936
- I think we should. It's too thick.
- Right.

1755
01:12:52,936 --> 01:12:54,476
No, let's have this first.

1756
01:12:54,506 --> 01:12:56,106
- It won't be good if you add water.
- It won't be as good.

1757
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,676
Don't do it.

1758
01:12:57,976 --> 01:12:59,216
If you add water, it won't be good.

1759
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,386
It's shabu-shabu, not stew.

1760
01:13:02,886 --> 01:13:04,716
- There's a lot, actually.
- I know.

1761
01:13:04,915 --> 01:13:07,085
- No.
- It's supposed to be shabu-shabu.

1762
01:13:07,085 --> 01:13:09,386
- It looks like steamed food.
- No, the broth must be amazing.

1763
01:13:09,386 --> 01:13:12,125
- The broth is like a tonic.
- Right.

1764
01:13:12,426 --> 01:13:14,056
That's right. This is so nice.

1765
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,566
If we add a bit of gochujang...

1766
01:13:16,796 --> 01:13:19,466
- Gochujang mushroom hot pot?
- Exactly!

1767
01:13:19,466 --> 01:13:20,566
- Then...
- Shall we add gochujang then?

1768
01:13:20,566 --> 01:13:22,035
Shall we? Go and bring some.

1769
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,365
- Go and bring some gochujang.
- It's like a mushroom hot pot.

1770
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:25,335
All right, I got it. Bring some gochujang.

1771
01:13:25,335 --> 01:13:26,375
(It's unpredictable how their dinner will go.)

1772
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:28,205
There are four dumplings left.

1773
01:13:28,205 --> 01:13:29,445
- Let's have 1 each.
- For 4 of us.

1774
01:13:33,046 --> 01:13:35,516
- Add a spoonful.
- It needs sweetness too.

1775
01:13:35,516 --> 01:13:36,716
Add sugar too.

1776
01:13:36,716 --> 01:13:39,216
- It was a bit salty.
- I know, it'll be salty.

1777
01:13:39,216 --> 01:13:40,615
I'll just add a bit of it...

1778
01:13:40,615 --> 01:13:41,955
since we have garlic too.

1779
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:43,655
Crushed garlic.

1780
01:13:44,825 --> 01:13:46,426
It already smells spicy.

1781
01:13:47,865 --> 01:13:49,596
It really became a hot pot.

1782
01:13:50,066 --> 01:13:51,266
It looks so good.

1783
01:13:51,865 --> 01:13:53,896
I like this better, with all the ingredients added.

1784
01:13:54,835 --> 01:13:57,566
(He takes a spoonful of it to taste it.)

1785
01:13:58,636 --> 01:14:00,506
(Smacking)

1786
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:02,046
(Did we not add something?)

1787
01:14:02,046 --> 01:14:03,905
- It'll be salty if we add more, no?
- Yes, it'll be too salty.

1788
01:14:03,905 --> 01:14:05,046
(Red chili pepper powder?)

1789
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:06,716
How about red chili pepper powder?

1790
01:14:06,716 --> 01:14:08,716
- Go bring red chili pepper powder!
- Got it!

1791
01:14:09,016 --> 01:14:10,816
- Bring Cheongyang chili powder.
- I'll bring it!

1792
01:14:10,985 --> 01:14:13,516
- Yes, we need some chili powder.
- It'll be more refreshing.

1793
01:14:13,856 --> 01:14:16,285
It needs to be spicy to be tastier. We need to add this much.

1794
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:17,485
(Adding chili pepper powder thanks to Hye Jin's wit)

1795
01:14:18,025 --> 01:14:19,356
It smells so nice.

1796
01:14:20,056 --> 01:14:22,195
It changed as soon as you added chili pepper powder.

1797
01:14:22,195 --> 01:14:23,296
We need to add a lot of it.

1798
01:14:25,735 --> 01:14:26,796
(Impressed)

1799
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,335
(Taking a bite of dumpling that became spicy)

1800
01:14:29,335 --> 01:14:32,136
It's so good. This is the extract of the mushrooms.

1801
01:14:32,136 --> 01:14:34,676
(Gochujang mushroom hot pot made with the extract of mushrooms)

1802
01:14:34,676 --> 01:14:36,705
It's so good. It tastes better the more I try it.

1803
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:39,375
- I know. It has a deep taste.
- Right.

1804
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:41,945
It's impossible for it to taste bad.

1805
01:14:41,945 --> 01:14:43,245
It has every ingredient that's good for your health.

1806
01:14:43,945 --> 01:14:46,186
We added everything you can find in this town.

1807
01:14:46,186 --> 01:14:47,216
(A dinner filled with love to give everything that's good for health)

1808
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:48,726
- Everything in this district.
- I know.

1809
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:50,655
It has everything nice you can find around here.

1810
01:14:51,085 --> 01:14:53,096
- It's really luxurious.
- It's so good.

1811
01:14:53,096 --> 01:14:54,226
I'm so full.

1812
01:14:54,226 --> 01:14:56,596
(Thank you for the meal.)

1813
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:02,506
(After a satisfying meal...)

1814
01:15:03,806 --> 01:15:07,636
(Hee Won is in charge of washing the dishes.)

1815
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:09,146
There's a lot to wash though.

1816
01:15:09,275 --> 01:15:10,445
I'll do it.

1817
01:15:14,985 --> 01:15:16,046
Are you okay?

1818
01:15:16,046 --> 01:15:18,155
Yes, I'm almost done. It doesn't take long.

1819
01:15:19,785 --> 01:15:22,155
(While Hee Won and Hye Jin focus on washing the dishes...)

1820
01:15:22,155 --> 01:15:23,686
- Yes.
- Done. I'm done.

1821
01:15:25,056 --> 01:15:27,756
(Si Wan came to get something from the car.)

1822
01:15:30,266 --> 01:15:32,936
(He took out a big bag.)

1823
01:15:33,296 --> 01:15:34,936
(Clattering)

1824
01:15:36,405 --> 01:15:39,205
(The members are enjoying the music.)

1825
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,806
Oh, is it "New York, New York"?

1826
01:15:43,176 --> 01:15:46,176
(A mysterious bag that Si Wan brought without them noticing)

1827
01:15:46,176 --> 01:15:47,245
Your pronunciation is nice.

1828
01:15:48,316 --> 01:15:51,556
(He sits naturally as though nothing happened.)

1829
01:15:52,285 --> 01:15:53,856
This is dreamlike.

1830
01:15:56,726 --> 01:15:59,596
(This is really nice.)

1831
01:16:00,525 --> 01:16:02,325
The weather is so nice.

1832
01:16:02,695 --> 01:16:03,766
There's no wind at all.

1833
01:16:03,766 --> 01:16:04,766
(On a breezy spring night, the silver grass field is quiet.)

1834
01:16:06,365 --> 01:16:07,905
It's totally to my liking.

1835
01:16:07,905 --> 01:16:09,936
I love jazz too.

1836
01:16:09,936 --> 01:16:12,506
You know, I know a lot about jazz.

1837
01:16:12,575 --> 01:16:13,875
- Just listen.
- Okay.

1838
01:16:14,875 --> 01:16:15,905
(Okay.)

1839
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,176
"I know a lot about jazz"?

1840
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:20,745
It feels like a bar here.

1841
01:16:20,745 --> 01:16:22,085
- With the sign too, right?
- And we have the sign too.

1842
01:16:22,445 --> 01:16:25,256
- I should open Si Wan Bar one day.
- I know, you should.

1843
01:16:25,716 --> 01:16:28,455
We have the House on Wheels sign too.

1844
01:16:28,785 --> 01:16:30,025
The House on Wheels sign.

1845
01:16:30,226 --> 01:16:31,256
(Si Wan gets up quietly.)

1846
01:16:31,256 --> 01:16:32,726
The House on Wheels Bar.

1847
01:16:38,035 --> 01:16:39,195
What's that?

1848
01:16:39,796 --> 01:16:42,136
It's the ingredients for cocktails.

1849
01:16:42,266 --> 01:16:44,775
- Oh, my!
- They need a lot of ingredients.

1850
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:47,476
- Because we need to mix a lot.
- Are we going to die tonight?

1851
01:16:47,476 --> 01:16:50,346
No, their bottles are big, that's why.

1852
01:16:50,346 --> 01:16:51,676
(A bag full of cocktail ingredients)

1853
01:16:51,676 --> 01:16:55,915
I wanted to make cocktails for Hye Jin.

1854
01:16:55,985 --> 01:16:57,816
- Cocktails?
- All right!

1855
01:16:57,945 --> 01:16:59,056
Try it.

1856
01:16:59,056 --> 01:17:00,816
You don't add salt in cocktails, do you?

1857
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:02,186
(A painful memory)

1858
01:17:02,655 --> 01:17:04,726
- It's soy sauce.
- You don't, right?

1859
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:08,426
(He'll make up with cocktails.)

1860
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:10,896
Wow, he's an expert.

1861
01:17:10,896 --> 01:17:12,966
- Seriously...
- This is all because of you.

1862
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:13,995
Why?

1863
01:17:13,995 --> 01:17:16,035
He prepared all this to make you cocktails.

1864
01:17:16,035 --> 01:17:18,606
I'm not even kidding. He's serious about it.

1865
01:17:18,705 --> 01:17:21,676
Hye Jin, you don't have to feel uncomfortable.

1866
01:17:22,506 --> 01:17:23,546
You prepared all this for me?

1867
01:17:23,546 --> 01:17:26,846
- Of course.
- Of course. He brought it for you.

1868
01:17:27,846 --> 01:17:30,285
(She's getting more interested in it now.)

1869
01:17:30,386 --> 01:17:31,816
(Glancing)

1870
01:17:33,516 --> 01:17:35,356
Gosh, this is pressuring.

1871
01:17:36,525 --> 01:17:38,056
Gosh, seriously.

1872
01:17:38,056 --> 01:17:39,096
(Si Want wants to make up with cocktails.)

1873
01:17:39,096 --> 01:17:41,296
This is pressuring.

1874
01:17:41,296 --> 01:17:42,325
(He's very pressured.)

1875
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:43,426
Oh, gosh.

1876
01:17:43,426 --> 01:17:45,035
(She finds him cute.)

1877
01:17:46,136 --> 01:17:49,405
- My, are you here alone?
- Oh, yes.

1878
01:17:49,405 --> 01:17:50,535
It's nice to meet you.

1879
01:17:50,535 --> 01:17:52,006
- Hello.
- I heard it was newly opened.

1880
01:17:52,006 --> 01:17:53,235
I'm a regular here.

1881
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:54,575
Buddy, come here.

1882
01:17:54,575 --> 01:17:56,146
(A friend who tagged along unwillingly)

1883
01:17:56,146 --> 01:17:57,846
- "Buddy"?
- But I don't drink.

1884
01:17:58,676 --> 01:18:01,386
(The three of them are excited by the thought of having cocktails.)

1885
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:04,085
(They can't help but get excited, seeing all the fancy ingredients.)

1886
01:18:04,085 --> 01:18:06,556
- My gosh, this is...
- This is no joke.

1887
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:08,155
It really is no joke.

1888
01:18:08,155 --> 01:18:09,285
(Proud)

1889
01:18:09,285 --> 01:18:10,455
I know.

1890
01:18:10,785 --> 01:18:13,056
(You brought all this?)

1891
01:18:13,226 --> 01:18:14,396
It must be good.

1892
01:18:14,896 --> 01:18:18,195
I'm making yours,

1893
01:18:18,995 --> 01:18:19,995
Hee Won's,

1894
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:22,405
and Dong Il's separately.

1895
01:18:22,566 --> 01:18:24,035
I'm going to make one for you each.

1896
01:18:24,535 --> 01:18:27,006
That's why I brought all this.

1897
01:18:28,306 --> 01:18:30,006
There's a theme song for making cocktails, right?

1898
01:18:30,646 --> 01:18:32,816
(She doesn't know the title.)

1899
01:18:32,976 --> 01:18:35,245
(He doesn't know it either, but he's excited.)

1900
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:36,816
Kokomo!

1901
01:18:36,985 --> 01:18:38,615
- It's Kokomo.
- That's right.

1902
01:18:38,615 --> 01:18:41,085
- It's Kokomo.
- Hee Won knows all sorts of stuff.

1903
01:18:41,726 --> 01:18:43,655
- It's Kokomo's song.
- Go ahead and make it.

1904
01:18:44,256 --> 01:18:45,356
(Si Wan Bar is open.)

1905
01:18:45,356 --> 01:18:46,926
I'll make Hee Won's first.

1906
01:18:46,926 --> 01:18:48,025
Sure.

1907
01:18:48,726 --> 01:18:50,865
(Highly expectant)

1908
01:18:51,835 --> 01:18:53,535

1909
01:18:53,535 --> 01:18:54,936
(They're very excited.)

1910
01:18:55,566 --> 01:18:57,936
(What's the cocktail he's going to make for Hee Won?)

1911
01:18:58,976 --> 01:19:02,205
(Adding orange juice, )

1912
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:05,575
(pineapple juice, )

1913
01:19:05,575 --> 01:19:08,316
(and lemon juice)

1914
01:19:08,585 --> 01:19:10,985
(It's a parade of juices.)

1915
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:15,686
(He starts shaking the juice trio.)

1916
01:19:16,325 --> 01:19:17,726
It's Kokomo's song.

1917
01:19:18,726 --> 01:19:19,756
Shake it to the song.

1918
01:19:21,926 --> 01:19:23,966
(The song?)

1919
01:19:25,466 --> 01:19:26,995
(Being cute)

1920
01:19:27,296 --> 01:19:28,466
You're so cool.

1921
01:19:28,466 --> 01:19:29,535
(He loves it.)

1922
01:19:30,235 --> 01:19:32,405
(It's fun to watch.)

1923
01:19:32,405 --> 01:19:33,806
- I like it.
- I added many types of juices.

1924
01:19:33,806 --> 01:19:35,245
Can't you shake on the other side?

1925
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:39,216
(Like this?)

1926
01:19:39,216 --> 01:19:41,075
You keep shaking it on one side.

1927
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:42,445
I'm sorry.

1928
01:19:42,485 --> 01:19:44,046
(He's so innocent.)

1929
01:19:44,716 --> 01:19:45,716
(He can shake it downward...)

1930
01:19:45,716 --> 01:19:47,655
(and upward as well.)

1931
01:19:47,886 --> 01:19:50,386
(He's having a great time thanks to the bartender's cute tricks.)

1932
01:19:51,426 --> 01:19:53,296
(Passionate)

1933
01:19:53,756 --> 01:19:55,966
(You're incredible.)

1934
01:19:57,596 --> 01:20:01,035
(The cocktail Si Wan shook hard to make)

1935
01:20:01,035 --> 01:20:02,306
- You need arm muscles for that.
- Right.

1936
01:20:03,606 --> 01:20:07,205
(It's in yellow, which looks refreshing.)

1937
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:13,016
(The cocktail for Hee Won is ready.)

1938
01:20:13,316 --> 01:20:16,445
Actually, its taste is predictable.

1939
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:18,085
- but its name is funny.
- What is it?

1940
01:20:18,085 --> 01:20:19,256
It's called Cinderella.

1941
01:20:19,256 --> 01:20:20,615
Cinderella?

1942
01:20:20,985 --> 01:20:23,386
- It suits you.
- I thought it'd suit you.

1943
01:20:24,492 --> 01:20:26,862
- It's called Cinderella.
- Cinderella?

1944
01:20:27,763 --> 01:20:29,962
I thought it'd suit you.

1945
01:20:31,162 --> 01:20:32,332
It suits you.

1946
01:20:32,332 --> 01:20:34,103
Try it, Cinderella.

1947
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:37,242
(Cinderella tastes it.)

1948
01:20:37,242 --> 01:20:39,572
- It's good, right? It looks good.
- I only added juice.

1949
01:20:40,273 --> 01:20:42,412
(Nervous)

1950
01:20:42,412 --> 01:20:44,082
(Curious)

1951
01:20:44,542 --> 01:20:46,582
(This tastes like...)

1952
01:20:46,582 --> 01:20:48,923
- It tastes like Cool Peace.
- Cool Peace?

1953
01:20:48,923 --> 01:20:50,223
Cool Peace?

1954
01:20:50,223 --> 01:20:52,593
(Laughing)

1955
01:20:52,593 --> 01:20:54,093
Does it taste like pineapple?

1956
01:20:54,093 --> 01:20:56,662
It's the pineapple flavor of Cool Peace.

1957
01:20:56,662 --> 01:20:57,923
(To be exact, it's the pineapple flavor of Cool Peace.)

1958
01:21:00,032 --> 01:21:01,933
- I can't help it, you know.
- No.

1959
01:21:01,933 --> 01:21:03,902
- But it's good.
- It's...

1960
01:21:04,502 --> 01:21:06,572
It's not an ordinary juice. It's Cool Peace.

1961
01:21:06,572 --> 01:21:07,572
(This tastes familiar.)

1962
01:21:07,733 --> 01:21:09,502
(You're hilarious.)

1963
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:10,803
Cool Peace?

1964
01:21:10,803 --> 01:21:12,412
(It's even funnier because they know the taste.)

1965
01:21:12,843 --> 01:21:15,612
But it's way more delicious than that.

1966
01:21:15,612 --> 01:21:19,553
The taste is... It's really neat.

1967
01:21:20,412 --> 01:21:22,582
Cinderella suits you so well.

1968
01:21:22,782 --> 01:21:25,292
You make it so quickly, Si Wan.

1969
01:21:26,023 --> 01:21:27,992
My goodness. But that's...

1970
01:21:28,763 --> 01:21:30,622
(Fully focused)

1971
01:21:31,492 --> 01:21:34,563
(He switched up the ingredients for the palate of adults.)

1972
01:21:34,862 --> 01:21:37,702
- There he goes.
- You'd clink your glasses too.

1973
01:21:37,702 --> 01:21:38,733
(Exclaiming)

1974
01:21:40,433 --> 01:21:42,402
- Goodness.
- That's...

1975
01:21:42,402 --> 01:21:43,402
(Adding more alcohol)

1976
01:21:43,402 --> 01:21:45,542
- Is he using actual alcohol?
- Yes.

1977
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:46,712
It is actual alcohol.

1978
01:21:46,712 --> 01:21:48,612
You need to be strong to make that.

1979
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:49,612
(He added 5 different types of alcohol.)

1980
01:21:50,082 --> 01:21:51,752
(She's mesmerized.)

1981
01:21:52,712 --> 01:21:55,252
It looks good.

1982
01:21:56,452 --> 01:21:59,952
(He covers the lid and starts shaking it.)

1983
01:22:01,193 --> 01:22:03,763
(Shake it passionately.)

1984
01:22:04,563 --> 01:22:08,362
(Leave some space on top of a long glass as you pour it.)

1985
01:22:09,332 --> 01:22:11,133
Why is that so little?

1986
01:22:11,133 --> 01:22:12,773
I need to wrap it up with Coke.

1987
01:22:12,773 --> 01:22:16,042
- Wow, that's...
- He got the skills.

1988
01:22:17,443 --> 01:22:20,943
(A strong cocktail with the Coke's sweetness is ready.)

1989
01:22:21,643 --> 01:22:24,952
(Whose cocktail is this?)

1990
01:22:25,252 --> 01:22:27,183
(These two...)

1991
01:22:27,183 --> 01:22:29,322
(are highly expectant.)

1992
01:22:29,553 --> 01:22:32,652
Sir, here's the Long Island iced tea you ordered.

1993
01:22:33,122 --> 01:22:34,792
- What's it called again?
- Long Island iced tea.

1994
01:22:34,792 --> 01:22:36,662
- From Long Island...
- Long Island iced tea.

1995
01:22:36,662 --> 01:22:37,992
- It's an iced tea from there?
- Yes.

1996
01:22:37,992 --> 01:22:41,862
You can think of it as the boilermaker of cocktails.

1997
01:22:42,032 --> 01:22:45,502
I heard you like boilermakers.

1998
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,372
I have to take care of my health too.

1999
01:22:48,372 --> 01:22:50,572
The color on the bottom is different.

2000
01:22:50,572 --> 01:22:52,273
- Oh, it's because of ice.
- Right.

2001
01:22:53,443 --> 01:22:57,112
(Will it suit Dong Il's palate?)

2002
01:22:58,612 --> 01:23:01,582
(How is it?)

2003
01:23:04,223 --> 01:23:05,893
- It's good.
- Is it?

2004
01:23:05,893 --> 01:23:07,423
- Is it strong?
- It's really good.

2005
01:23:07,693 --> 01:23:09,962
Is it good? Is it okay?

2006
01:23:09,962 --> 01:23:12,093
It's very strong,

2007
01:23:12,093 --> 01:23:14,263
but it's fragrant too.

2008
01:23:14,763 --> 01:23:17,303
(He's very proud.)

2009
01:23:18,063 --> 01:23:19,532
It's actually pretty nice.

2010
01:23:19,532 --> 01:23:23,572
(Dong Il has fallen for the charms of cocktails.)

2011
01:23:25,343 --> 01:23:28,313
It's very charming.

2012
01:23:28,542 --> 01:23:30,983
(He succeeded in making Dong Il's cocktail.)

2013
01:23:31,582 --> 01:23:33,313
My gosh, I'm...

2014
01:23:33,313 --> 01:23:36,152
looking forward to the cocktail for our guest.

2015
01:23:36,152 --> 01:23:38,282
- Right. I'm making...
- Are you making mine now?

2016
01:23:39,465 --> 01:23:42,206
(What's the cocktail Si Wan prepared for Hye Jin?)

2017
01:23:42,206 --> 01:23:43,635
Tell us its name. What is it?

2018
01:23:43,635 --> 01:23:47,005
Her cocktail is called Godfather.

2019
01:23:47,005 --> 01:23:48,845
(Cocktail name: Godfather)

2020
01:23:49,505 --> 01:23:51,246
Godfather?

2021
01:23:51,246 --> 01:23:53,345
I should put together my hands like this.

2022
01:23:55,076 --> 01:23:58,085
(Is it my turn now?)

2023
01:23:58,185 --> 01:24:00,715
Godfather? My gosh.

2024
01:24:01,156 --> 01:24:02,326
That's so cool.

2025
01:24:02,326 --> 01:24:04,286
- The name is so cool.
- It's Godfather.

2026
01:24:04,286 --> 01:24:06,356
I thought you'd serve...

2027
01:24:06,356 --> 01:24:08,456
Kongjwi and Patjwi after Cinderella.

2028
01:24:08,696 --> 01:24:10,996
Didn't you think so? There's a series of them.

2029
01:24:10,996 --> 01:24:13,795
There's On Dal and Princess Pyeonggang.

2030
01:24:14,036 --> 01:24:15,095
There's Lion King too.

2031
01:24:15,095 --> 01:24:16,406
- There's a lot.
- Lion King?

2032
01:24:16,406 --> 01:24:18,505
- You can just name it.
- Right.

2033
01:24:18,835 --> 01:24:21,435
We need to use fire for this cocktail.

2034
01:24:21,435 --> 01:24:22,576
You'll use fire?

2035
01:24:22,645 --> 01:24:25,276
(She's really excited.)

2036
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:28,276
(He took out a torch.)

2037
01:24:28,986 --> 01:24:32,156
I'm giving a lot of effort to make Hye Jin's cocktail.

2038
01:24:32,156 --> 01:24:34,055
(Hye Jin is getting more excited.)

2039
01:24:34,356 --> 01:24:36,286
Whiskey is the base of this cocktail.

2040
01:24:36,286 --> 01:24:37,725
You're using whiskey.

2041
01:24:37,725 --> 01:24:38,895
(All attention is on him.)

2042
01:24:40,356 --> 01:24:41,656
I can't wait to see it.

2043
01:24:41,656 --> 01:24:44,196
(Godfather Recipe: Making a base with two different whiskeys)

2044
01:24:44,425 --> 01:24:48,135
I'm using a special glass for Hye Jin's.

2045
01:24:48,135 --> 01:24:49,706
He's using real fruit juice.

2046
01:24:49,706 --> 01:24:51,236
You're squeezing the peel.

2047
01:24:51,236 --> 01:24:54,175
Yes, I'm adding the zest to it.

2048
01:24:54,175 --> 01:24:56,776
It's very fragrant now.

2049
01:24:57,076 --> 01:24:59,675
(And...)

2050
01:25:00,715 --> 01:25:02,916
(The highlight of Godfather)

2051
01:25:03,286 --> 01:25:05,616
(Loading gas)

2052
01:25:05,616 --> 01:25:07,685
- Is it cinnamon?
- Yes, it is.

2053
01:25:07,685 --> 01:25:08,786
(Si Wan's hidden card)

2054
01:25:10,255 --> 01:25:13,055
No, I'm using its smoke to give a smoky flavor.

2055
01:25:15,765 --> 01:25:17,166
That needs a lot of effort.

2056
01:25:17,166 --> 01:25:19,935
I can smell cinnamon from here. It's so strong.

2057
01:25:19,935 --> 01:25:22,435
Its scent becomes really nice once you burn it.

2058
01:25:22,666 --> 01:25:24,866
You only gave him Cool Peace.

2059
01:25:24,866 --> 01:25:26,935
And you gave me Coke.

2060
01:25:26,935 --> 01:25:28,675
And why is hers so difficult to make?

2061
01:25:28,675 --> 01:25:31,305
I understand you're being nice to our guest, but...

2062
01:25:31,305 --> 01:25:32,916
Dong Il, you said to always put guests first.

2063
01:25:32,916 --> 01:25:34,276
That's true.

2064
01:25:34,515 --> 01:25:36,345
(You're so cute.)

2065
01:25:36,786 --> 01:25:38,486
(Si Wan catches on fast.)

2066
01:25:38,755 --> 01:25:40,085
- Here's...
- Is it ready?

2067
01:25:40,085 --> 01:25:41,356
the Godfather you ordered.

2068
01:25:41,356 --> 01:25:42,356
(Godfather, the special cocktail for Hye Jin is done.)

2069
01:25:42,356 --> 01:25:45,795
I'll add a stick of cinnamon for decoration.

2070
01:25:46,526 --> 01:25:47,956
It looks fancy.

2071
01:25:48,295 --> 01:25:49,895
Thank you.

2072
01:25:52,366 --> 01:25:56,206
(How does Godfather Si Wan worked so hard on taste like?)

2073
01:25:56,866 --> 01:25:59,076
(I hope it's good.)

2074
01:26:00,376 --> 01:26:04,206
(She tastes the Godfather Si Wan made with lots of effort.)

2075
01:26:07,045 --> 01:26:09,946
(Feeling nervous)

2076
01:26:12,156 --> 01:26:14,456
(Nodding)

2077
01:26:14,715 --> 01:26:17,486
(The charming scent of cinnamon spreads in her mouth.)

2078
01:26:18,085 --> 01:26:19,755
I should drink it slowly.

2079
01:26:20,126 --> 01:26:21,895
You should.

2080
01:26:22,566 --> 01:26:24,465
I might not go home tonight.

2081
01:26:24,626 --> 01:26:26,135
Hye Jin is not going home tonight.

2082
01:26:26,135 --> 01:26:29,566
Can you make two more glasses? She won't go home then.

2083
01:26:29,835 --> 01:26:31,036
I'll use it as a straw.

2084
01:26:31,965 --> 01:26:33,005
Let me see.

2085
01:26:33,005 --> 01:26:34,335
(He's curious.)

2086
01:26:35,135 --> 01:26:38,145
Dong Il! Its scent...

2087
01:26:38,606 --> 01:26:41,876
(The deep scent of cinnamon is made by smoking the cinnamon stick.)

2088
01:26:41,876 --> 01:26:43,616
- I recommend this one.
- This one?

2089
01:26:43,616 --> 01:26:46,215
- Yes, it's really nice.
- The scent is strong.

2090

(A night that suits delicate cocktails)

2092
01:26:56,366 --> 01:26:59,435
- This is so nice.
- Because I was so concerned,

2093
01:26:59,666 --> 01:27:01,935
I tried making it at home too.

2094
01:27:02,765 --> 01:27:05,265
- It's good.
- It's really good.

2095
01:27:05,265 --> 01:27:06,505
- Really?
- Thank you.

2096
01:27:06,505 --> 01:27:09,475
Not at all. I'm really glad.

2097
01:27:11,276 --> 01:27:15,715
(They make another memory on a special day.)

2098
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:18,585
(Today's front yard is surrounded by a green forest.)

2099

(Mount Cheonma Pine Tree Forest)

2100

2102

2103
01:27:32,736 --> 01:27:35,395
(With a deft touch, )

2104
01:27:35,465 --> 01:27:38,066
(she can make a nice meal within a second.)

2105
01:27:39,536 --> 01:27:42,805
(She's grown into an adult who knows how to enjoy fishing.)

2106
01:27:42,805 --> 01:27:43,975
(Heave-ho)

2107
01:27:44,305 --> 01:27:46,215
(Follow me.)

2108
01:27:46,316 --> 01:27:47,715
(Fish, fish.)

2109
01:27:47,845 --> 01:27:51,986
(She's still very bright.)

2110
01:27:53,085 --> 01:27:54,816
(Can I have one?)

2111
01:27:54,816 --> 01:27:57,225

(Eating)

2115
01:28:05,965 --> 01:28:07,996
(To Dong Il, You Jung eating food...)

2116
