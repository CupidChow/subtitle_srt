1
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:31,665
(House on Wheels with the whole family, Part Two)

2
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:35,864
(Happy birthday to Dong Il!)

3
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:38,774
(The members prepare an amazing meal for his birthday.)

4
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:41,474
(Chirping)

5
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:43,614
(Even the birds celebrate his birthday.)

6
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:46,445
(Dong Il feels happy.)

7
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:50,055
(House on Wheels moves along with the palm trees.)

8
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:51,685
It's beautiful!

9
00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:53,355
(The second front yard with the whole family, )

10
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:54,485
(an ocean meadow in Seogwipo)

11
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,825
(Dong Il is determined to catch fish this time.)

12
00:00:58,255 --> 00:01:00,794
(The finest opaleye sashimi that Jin Goo prepared)

13
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,224
(Concentrating)

14
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:07,035
(What events wait ahead on their second day of the trip?)

15
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,834
(They're having a great time as Jin Goo is back.)

16
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:16,505
(After their amazing dinner...)

17
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:18,614
It's cold. Let's sleep now. We worked a lot today.

18
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:21,044
- Let's wrap it up now. - Good work today.

19
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:22,745
- Let's wash up and go to bed. - Okay.

20
00:01:25,114 --> 00:01:28,424
(Jin Goo comes up to check the new bed.)

21
00:01:29,085 --> 00:01:32,154
(Checking if it's safe)

22
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:36,124
(He goes up on the bed.)

23
00:01:36,124 --> 00:01:37,495
- I'm settled. - Are you?

24
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:39,794
- It's cozy. - Is it okay? Is it nice?

25
00:01:39,794 --> 00:01:40,965
It's nice.

26
00:01:43,374 --> 00:01:46,874
(The lights are off.)

27
00:01:48,805 --> 00:01:50,814
This is a cozy bed.

28
00:01:52,814 --> 00:01:55,885
(Si Wan is sleeping on the bed next to the door tonight.)

29
00:01:57,254 --> 00:01:58,784
Hey, hey.

30
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,924
It's Dong Il's birthday tomorrow.

31
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:02,525
What should we do?

32
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:05,654
Will we be able to hide it completely?

33
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:08,394
I don't think we can. He gets up first.

34
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:11,034
Then let's do this.

35
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,665
After celebrating his birthday,

36
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:16,635
we should have seaweed soup before we leave.

37
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:18,975
Then how shall we do it? How should we signal each other?

38
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:21,544
- How shall we do it? - How should we signal each other?

39
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:24,044
I'm sure Dong Il would want to leave early tomorrow.

40
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,215
(Dong Il comes back right then.)

41
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:26,814
Or we can... He's back.

42
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:30,654
(Acting like nothing happened)

43
00:02:30,654 --> 00:02:32,914
- Dong Il. - Yes.

44
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:35,185
I'm sorry, but could you pick up my phone? I dropped it.

45
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:37,525
My gosh, you.

46
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,824
What did you learn while you were away from home?

47
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:41,594
- I'm sorry. I dropped it. - Hee Won.

48
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,795
What happened to him, Hee Won?

49
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:45,895
- He's always been like that. - Has he?

50
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:48,564
(Laughing)

51
00:02:48,564 --> 00:02:50,275
I'm turning off the lights.

52
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:52,735
- Okay. - Good night.

53
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:53,745
(They went to bed before they even finished planning the party.)

54
00:02:53,745 --> 00:02:54,775
Get some sleep.

55
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,104
- Good night. - Good night.

56
00:02:56,104 --> 00:02:57,275
Good night.

57
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:02,645
It's our 1st time sleeping indoors except for our 1st trip.

58
00:03:02,645 --> 00:03:03,654
I know.

59
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:05,914
It's been long since only the four of us are sleeping.

60
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:08,654
It's so nice.

61
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:12,455
(It's their first time to be sleeping without a guest.)

62
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:18,365
(Will they be able to manage Dong Il's birthday party tomorrow?)

63
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:27,045
(The dawn breaks in the new front yard.)

64
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:33,145
(The pond in the front yard contains the sunlight.)

65
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:39,515
(The sun that has risen high up above the hills...)

66
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:44,654
(brightens up the house.)

67
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:51,265
(The members have fallen deeply asleep...)

68
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:58,175
(until the sunlight filled the entire house.)

69
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:02,305
(Last year, in their old house)

70
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:06,074
(Struggling)

71
00:04:07,284 --> 00:04:08,685
(Moving about)

72
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:11,654
(Jin Goo slept in the bed that was too tight to move around.)

73
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:15,784
(Rolling)

74
00:04:15,784 --> 00:04:19,525
(Now he's sleeping comfortably in a bigger bed.)

75
00:04:21,164 --> 00:04:23,865
(The older guys are sleeping indoors after a long while.)

76
00:04:24,534 --> 00:04:27,835
(The birthday boy sleeps soundly.)

77
00:04:29,564 --> 00:04:32,874
(Tossing)

78
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:37,675
(And Hee Won sleeps noisily.)

79
00:04:39,374 --> 00:04:42,084
(Wriggling)

80
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:49,785
(Si Wan is up.)

81
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:56,143
(Si Wan is up.)

82
00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:01,082
(Are they still asleep?)

83
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:04,993
(Si Wan greets the morning earlier than the others.)

84
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:09,922
(Breezey)

85
00:05:10,863 --> 00:05:14,662
(He enjoys the calm in the morning.)

86
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:20,943
(It's warm.)

87
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:27,982
(He enjoys the calm morning in earnest.)

88
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:33,253
(He enjoys it with hallabong as he's in Jeju.)

89
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:35,352
(Taking a bite)

90
00:05:37,323 --> 00:05:40,363
(The beautiful view makes him look around.)

91
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:44,732
(Bengdui reservoir that spreads in the front yard...)

92
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:48,462
(and Utbamaegi Oreum that stands firmly in the back.)

93
00:05:51,303 --> 00:05:56,303
(Dong Il gets up as the sunlight shines upon him.)

94
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:01,013
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

95
00:06:01,113 --> 00:06:03,113
(Good morning.)

96
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:10,053
(Rustling)

97
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:14,763
Did you sleep well?

98
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:17,462
Hi, Jin Goo.

99
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:20,962
It's really comfortable up here.

100
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:22,462
Is it more comfortable than the last one?

101
00:06:22,462 --> 00:06:24,633
- This is... - You can sleep more.

102
00:06:26,573 --> 00:06:29,203
Hee Won, you're up.

103
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,143
No, I'm still asleep.

104
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:33,172
- You are? - What time is it?

105
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:36,542
- It's... - Is it around 7am?

106
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:37,553
It's 7am.

107
00:06:37,553 --> 00:06:38,782
(Current time: 7am)

108
00:06:38,883 --> 00:06:41,482
(Growling before getting up)

109
00:06:44,993 --> 00:06:46,823
(Grunting)

110
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:50,832
(Grunting as well)

111
00:06:54,803 --> 00:06:57,972
You need to make a lot of noise when you come downstairs.

112
00:06:57,972 --> 00:07:00,003
Aren't we supposed to sleep until 9am?

113
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:01,443
You can sleep more.

114
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:05,443
Hee Won, your hair...

115
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:08,912
(It's so cool.)

116
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:10,143
It's cool.

117
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:12,282
I've always been cool.

118
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:15,253
Hee Won is stylish today.

119
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:17,092
(Laughing)

120
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:19,022
The weather is great today.

121
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:22,623
(Nodding)

122
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:26,732
(It's a perfect weather to celebrate Dong Il's birthday.)

123
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:33,272
(The sunlight that shines upon the front yard...)

124
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:38,212
(and the sparkling pond)

125
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:43,042
(The correct way to enjoy the front yard)

126
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:44,712
The weather is great.

127
00:07:46,313 --> 00:07:47,323
(Exclaiming)

128
00:07:47,323 --> 00:07:49,422
The weather is great with the sun.

129
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:52,753
Look at the waves in the pond.

130
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:54,592
(The wind ruffles the water in the pond.)

131
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:55,593
There are waves?

132
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:01,233
I can hear the birds chirping.

133
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,662
(It's time for breakfast!)

134
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,932
Should we eat something?

135
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:10,473
We're out of ingredients because we used them up last night.

136
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:14,312
(What should I make them for breakfast?)

137
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:16,682
(Should we do it now?)

138
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:17,682
Now?

139
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:21,282
(Gather up.)

140
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:24,753
Let's sing him a birthday song now.

141
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:27,463
Let's sing it now.

142
00:08:27,963 --> 00:08:31,993
Should we tell him to sit still and that we'll be making breakfast?

143
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:36,432
(Dong Il, the birthday boy, has no idea what's going on.)

144
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:38,503
Should we turn on the birthday song?

145
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:41,103
- Okay, let's do that. - Yes.

146
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,942
- Should we turn it on now? - Yes.

147
00:08:44,312 --> 00:08:47,513
(Scuttling)

148
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:53,182
(Happy birthday to you)

149
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,782
(Happy birthday to you)

150
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:59,652
(It's my birthday today?)

151
00:09:00,093 --> 00:09:04,233
(Happy birthday to Dong Il!)

152
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,932
(Thanks, guys.)

153
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:13,402
(Happy birthday to you)

154
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:16,743
(Whistling)

155
00:09:16,743 --> 00:09:18,973
Let's eat. Let's eat now.

156
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:20,272
Dong Il. Don't move!

157
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:22,383
- Hold on. Hold on. - Don't move.

158
00:09:22,383 --> 00:09:25,253
- A guest should just relax. - No, no.

159
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:26,513
- A guest should just relax. - No, give it to me.

160
00:09:26,513 --> 00:09:27,522
I'll cook the rice first.

161
00:09:27,522 --> 00:09:29,353
- We'll do everything for you today. - Don't do anything.

162
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:30,723
Let's hurry up and cook rice.

163
00:09:31,593 --> 00:09:33,192
(Jin Goo wants to celebrate more.)

164
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:34,993
(Vocalizing)

165
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:36,593
- Sit down, Dong Il. - Okay.

166
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:37,932
- Would you like sikhye? - Yes.

167
00:09:38,162 --> 00:09:39,733
We'll do everything for you.

168
00:09:39,893 --> 00:09:41,532
A guest should just relax.

169
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,603
- Dong Il. - Yes.

170
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:45,133
(Jin Goo brings over something.)

171
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:46,133
We...

172
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:49,003
(What did Jin Goo take out?)

173
00:09:50,202 --> 00:09:56,013
(What's in the bag that Jin Goo brought with much care?)

174
00:09:57,483 --> 00:09:59,113
- Happy birthday, Dong Il. - We...

175
00:09:59,113 --> 00:10:01,052
- brought Jeju's seaweed. - It's seaweed?

176
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:04,723
We can make sea urchin roe seaweed soup.

177
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:07,562
And we'll make bulgogi and grilled tilefish, your favorite.

178
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:08,863
- Grilled tilefish. - Really?

179
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,192
- Let's fold the blankets. - Okay.

180
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:13,162
- Let's fold the blankets. - We should...

181
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,363
(Hee Won, Si Wan, and Jin Goo move about diligently.)

182
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,562
Goodness, you guys...

183
00:10:17,172 --> 00:10:20,473
You won't need to do anything today.

184
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:22,072
Trust us.

185
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:23,072
Is that so?

186
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:25,343
You should relax all day today.

187
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:27,542
- Really? - Of course.

188
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:29,442
(Embarrassed, awkward)

189
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:31,652
Don't fold this. Let's use it.

190
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:33,983
- Okay, Dong Il. - Okay, Dong Il.

191
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:36,922
Okay, Dong Il.

192
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:40,792
(They all burst into laughter as Jin Goo acts cute.)

193
00:10:40,993 --> 00:10:42,822
(Laughing)

194
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:46,162
Jin Goo, you became so sneaky.

195
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:49,963
- When he was away from home... - Gosh, seriously.

196
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:52,772
I'll just lie down then. I trust you guys.

197
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:55,202
Gosh, this is nice.

198
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:56,473
(Chef Sung is taking his day off as it's his birthday.)

199
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:58,643
Jin Goo, I will...

200
00:10:58,643 --> 00:11:01,113
- I'll make the seaweed soup. - You're going to make it?

201
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:04,452
If we use this all, we'll have enough seaweed soup for a year.

202
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:06,312
How much should we use?

203
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:08,282
(Si Wan and Jin Goo prepare seaweed soup first.)

204
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:09,723
You need to soak it first.

205
00:11:10,652 --> 00:11:13,422
- You need... - He said to soak it in water first.

206
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:14,562
- Okay. - Okay, Dong Il.

207
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:18,292
(Today, they'll have to listen to everything he says.)

208
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:21,233
(Soaking a big piece of seaweed in water)

209
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:23,003
Should we just use it all?

210
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:25,532
- No, that's too much. - You mean the seaweed?

211
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:26,932
- Dong Il. - Yes?

212
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:29,843
Would you like to have a lot of seaweed?

213
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:31,873
I'd like to have a lot.

214
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:34,412
- Jin Goo, that's too much. - I'd like to have a lot.

215
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:36,013
- He wants it a lot. - Use it all!

216
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:37,182
(What are you doing? Put it all in!)

217
00:11:37,652 --> 00:11:38,952
(They'll listen to whatever the birthday boy tells them.)

218
00:11:38,952 --> 00:11:40,723
- Okay, Dong Il. - Okay, Dong Il.

219
00:11:41,383 --> 00:11:44,292
(Next, he prepares white rice.)

220
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:46,522
(Staring)

221
00:11:46,522 --> 00:11:48,493
We shouldn't ruin the rice.

222
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:51,932
- I'll cook rice. I'm on it. - Okay.

223
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:53,863
I cooked rice well last time.

224
00:11:54,162 --> 00:11:55,162
I see. Okay.

225
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:57,062
You guys are making a birthday meal,

226
00:11:57,062 --> 00:11:59,373
but none of you guys washed up before cooking.

227
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:01,802
- Sorry? - No one washed up...

228
00:12:01,802 --> 00:12:03,103
after waking up.

229
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:05,343
Dong Il just gave a special command now.

230
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:08,682
Just prep the ingredients. We'll cook after we wash up.

231
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:10,652
- We'll cook after we wash up, okay? - Yes.

232
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:11,682
Okay.

233
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:14,383
Can't you wash up after we finish the meal?

234
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:17,522
- It changed. Wash after the meal. - Okay.

235
00:12:17,522 --> 00:12:18,993
- Got it, sir. - Yes, sir.

236
00:12:18,993 --> 00:12:20,792
(Satisfied)

237
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:23,792
(Measuring the amount of water with the back of his hand)

238
00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:27,503
(More careful than ever)

239
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:30,532
This much? I think this is enough.

240
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,532
Is it too much?

241
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:35,343
(Draining water)

242
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:38,672
(Pondering on the amount of water)

243
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:40,713
This much.

244
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:41,883
(This much would be fine.)

245
00:12:42,883 --> 00:12:43,912
I'm not sure about this.

246
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:47,383
Dong Il. It's your birthday, but let me ask you one thing.

247
00:12:49,452 --> 00:12:50,452
(He eventually asks Dong Il for help.)

248
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:51,452
Would this be enough?

249
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:54,263
- That's good. - Is it okay?

250
00:12:54,422 --> 00:12:57,763
(Returning to the kitchen after the approval on the water for rice)

251
00:12:58,463 --> 00:12:59,963
Okay.

252
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:01,133
(He puts it in the rice cooker, hoping for chewy rice.)

253
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:04,003
(Jin Goo prepares sauce for bulgogi.)

254
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:05,833
- The sauce for bulgogi? - Yes.

255
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,772
(Pouring)

256
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:13,013
(Pouring cooking wine)

257
00:13:13,373 --> 00:13:14,743
(Oligosaccharide)

258
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:16,243
(Plum syrup)

259
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:18,052
(Sugar)

260
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:20,883
(Here comes Jin Goo's hidden card.)

261
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:22,123
Jin Goo, what is that?

262
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:24,522
Dong Il, I add yuzu preserves in bulgogi.

263
00:13:24,522 --> 00:13:27,152
- I see. - When I chew yuzu while eating it,

264
00:13:27,322 --> 00:13:28,662
it's very...

265
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:29,963
- I see. It smells good. - Yes.

266
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:31,133
- And it's sweet. - I like how it tastes.

267
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,562
(Plenty of yuzu preserves)

268
00:13:39,373 --> 00:13:41,072
(Frowning)

269
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:43,042
Why? Is it good?

270
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:45,042
Yes, it's refreshing.

271
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:48,743
Hee Won, could you chop the scallion into big chunks?

272
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:50,682
I can chop it this way.

273
00:13:51,753 --> 00:13:53,152
(Chopping scallion with scissors)

274
00:13:53,152 --> 00:13:54,152
Like this?

275
00:13:54,522 --> 00:13:56,952
(Today, I'm the Scissors Cook.)

276
00:13:57,322 --> 00:14:00,093
(Jin Goo chops up onions.)

277
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:02,623
(Chopping evenly)

278
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:04,763
(He's doing good.)

279
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:08,363
(He shreds carrots in a minute.)

280
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,802
(He carefully makes cuts in mushrooms.)

281
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:13,873
It looks good.

282
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:14,873
(Decorating)

283
00:14:15,143 --> 00:14:16,743
Dong Il will love this decoration.

284
00:14:16,743 --> 00:14:19,042
(Decorating it as Dong Il likes)

285
00:14:19,743 --> 00:14:22,343
Are we going to eat such a fancy meal for breakfast?

286
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:24,312
It's for Dong Il's birthday.

287
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:25,513
(It's Dong Il's birthday meal, so it must look perfect.)

288
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:28,723
(Adding meat)

289
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,353
(Jin Goo mixes them evenly.)

290
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,822
Jin Goo, it already looks delicious.

291
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:36,463
That looks good.

292
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:38,333
(Staring)

293
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:40,463
The more, the better. Right?

294
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,003
This much?

295
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,233
I feel uneasy sitting here.

296
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:48,042
- Dong Il, you know how I feel now. - Yes?

297
00:14:48,802 --> 00:14:51,042
Now you know how I feel when I have nothing to do, right?

298
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:54,542
(Oh, have you always felt this way?)

299
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:56,643
Hee Won, I can't imagine how hard it was for you.

300
00:14:56,643 --> 00:15:00,253
Gosh, it was so hard for me to stay still all the time.

301
00:15:01,022 --> 00:15:04,052
Will you treat me like a guest until the sun goes down?

302
00:15:04,893 --> 00:15:06,522
- Until the sun goes down. - Yes, sir.

303
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,123
- Yes. - Yes, sir.

304
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:09,292
Really?

305
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:10,763
It's until the sun goes down.

306
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:11,993
(Hang in there for a while.)

307
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:16,733
Guys, it's until the sun goes down.

308
00:15:16,802 --> 00:15:18,633
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

309
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:22,143
Since it's such a happy day today,

310
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:26,513
I'll catch a damselfish that's about 40cm long.

311
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:29,083
A damselfish that big is...

312
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,452
I'll make you eat enough of it...

313
00:15:31,552 --> 00:15:33,182
and get sick of it at the end.

314
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:36,922
Cut the seaweed into small pieces.

315
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:39,022
Cut it into small pieces.

316
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:40,593
Yes, I'll cut it into small pieces.

317
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:41,863
Dong Il doesn't like it big.

318
00:15:42,463 --> 00:15:43,792
- I got it. - Yes.

319
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,302
We don't usually eat seaweed soup when we have an important event.

320
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:51,202
Call off the seaweed soup!

321
00:15:51,202 --> 00:15:52,603
We'll call off the seaweed soup.

322
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:56,172
(If I don't catch one, it's because of the seaweed soup.)

323
00:15:56,643 --> 00:16:00,312
(Adding sesame oil and soy sauce for soup)

324
00:16:00,713 --> 00:16:01,713
(Si Wan's effort)

325
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:03,983
(Jin Goo's effort)

326
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:06,013
(Hee Won's effort)

327
00:16:07,253 --> 00:16:11,792
(All family members put in a great deal of effort in it.)

328
00:16:12,452 --> 00:16:15,893
(Meanwhile, Dong Il takes a walk in the front yard.)

329
00:16:16,662 --> 00:16:20,963
(Thanks to the members, Dong Il can relax and enjoy the morning.)

330
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:23,603
It's beautiful.

331
00:16:23,603 --> 00:16:26,802
(Bengdui reservoir on the front yard welcomes Dong Il.)

332
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:34,412
Birds are chirping.

333
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:40,152
(Birds wash up their faces in the morning.)

334
00:16:40,752 --> 00:16:42,252
There's a water strider here.

335
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:43,982
What a surprise.

336
00:16:43,982 --> 00:16:45,452
(A water strider is taking a walk here.)

337
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:50,762
(All of these are the landscape of our front yard.)

338
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:52,762
It's so beautiful from here.

339
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:58,432
Hee Won, except for your parents,

340
00:16:58,432 --> 00:17:02,172
isn't this your first time making seaweed soup?

341
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:05,412
I haven't made it for my parents yet.

342
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:07,783
It's a special seaweed soup then.

343
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:10,182
You're almost like my dad, Dong Il.

344
00:17:11,383 --> 00:17:14,152
(Were you treating me like your dad?)

345
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:15,823
So this is the tilefish.

346
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:16,853
(Preparing grilled tilefish for Dong Il who's like his dad.)

347
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:19,452
- Tilefish. - Gosh, it looks delicious.

348
00:17:19,853 --> 00:17:21,162
Don't we have to add oil, Hee Won?

349
00:17:21,162 --> 00:17:23,462
- Should we add oil? - We should.

350
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:25,992
Which kind of oil should we use?

351
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:28,033
- Cooking oil... - Oligosaccharide?

352
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:29,462
- Cooking oil. - Cooking oil.

353
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:30,633
- Cooking oil? - Yes.

354
00:17:31,373 --> 00:17:33,073
Oligosaccharide is not oil.

355
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:35,202
It's not oil?

356
00:17:36,343 --> 00:17:38,613
(Embarrassed)

357
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:41,143
They all look similar, but it's not oil?

358
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,182
(Olive oil or oligosaccharide)

359
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:43,343
They look similar.

360
00:17:43,482 --> 00:17:44,982
They all look similar to me.

361
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:46,813
(Adding any similar-looking oil)

362
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:50,523
(Grilling tilefish as if frying in oil)

363
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:53,692
(Totally concentrated)

364
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,462
It smells good.

365
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:58,593
- Did you add some coarse salt? - No.

366
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:00,093
- You should. - I was about to add it.

367
00:18:00,093 --> 00:18:01,633
(Adding salt)

368
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,033
I need the skill to flip it over, right?

369
00:18:05,033 --> 00:18:06,273
You need to do it right.

370
00:18:06,472 --> 00:18:08,242
- Do you want to flip it over? - What?

371
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,103
You said it's difficult.

372
00:18:10,242 --> 00:18:11,412
Right.

373
00:18:11,643 --> 00:18:13,143
- Good luck! - I'll hold this for you.

374
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:14,143
(Worried)

375
00:18:16,643 --> 00:18:17,752
Okay.

376
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,252
It smells delicious.

377
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:24,023
(It looks delicious.)

378
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:26,192
Gosh, the flesh flakes.

379
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:28,722
Hee Won, it's cooked thoroughly.

380
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:30,492
- Is it cooked thoroughly? - Yes.

381
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:31,593
- Seriously? - Yes.

382
00:18:31,992 --> 00:18:33,462
(Grinning)

383
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:35,762
It looks fine. It looks fine enough.

384
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:40,633
Look at the flesh. Goodness.

385
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:43,942
Are we going to eat such a lavish breakfast?

386
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:48,343
(Grilled tilefish is ready.)

387
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:50,883
Let's sit.

388
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:54,783
We don't look so nice for your birthday meal.

389
00:18:55,982 --> 00:18:57,992
That's okay. I care about your heart.

390
00:18:58,452 --> 00:19:00,053
I don't care about such a mess.

391
00:19:00,053 --> 00:19:02,563
(Sure, our heart is what matters.)

392
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,093
(Checking)

393
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:07,962
- Goodness. Yes. - This is... Is it simmering?

394
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:09,002
(The seaweed soup has become rich.)

395
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:10,303
The broth became rich.

396
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:13,133
- Is the broth rich? - It looks just fine.

397
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:14,472
Cover up the lid.

398
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:15,603
Can I help you with something?

399
00:19:16,843 --> 00:19:18,773
Did I make it so quickly?

400
00:19:18,873 --> 00:19:21,543
No, seaweed soup gets even better as you boil it longer.

401
00:19:22,012 --> 00:19:24,113
- Seaweed soup or kimchi stew... - Yes.

402
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:25,652
- tastes better on the next day. - Is that so?

403
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:27,682
Then shall we add sea urchin roe right now when it's simmering?

404
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:29,182
- Seaweed soup is... - I should add it now then.

405
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:32,152
I'll add lots of sea urchin roe.

406
00:19:32,893 --> 00:19:33,952
Seriously.

407
00:19:34,222 --> 00:19:35,462
- Gosh, look at the sea urchin roe. - Goodness.

408
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:37,462
This looks great. Goodness.

409
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:38,563
Sea urchin roe.

410
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:39,662
(Gasping)

411
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:43,333
- Sea urchin roe is a game-changer. - Right.

412
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,603
It's almost cheating.

413
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:48,672
- It's a sort of cheat key. - The broth is...

414
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:49,672
(The visual bewitches Jin Goo who likes sea urchin.)

415
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:54,313
(Generous amount of sea urchin roe)

416
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:01,252
- Is it all done? - It's bland.

417
00:20:01,353 --> 00:20:04,283
We need to season it, but it tastes rich already.

418
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:10,393
I think it'll be just fine if we add a bit of soy sauce and salt.

419
00:20:10,922 --> 00:20:12,793
- I'll season it. - Okay.

420
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:13,833
(Jin Goo is in charge of seasoning.)

421
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:17,662
(Adding fermented tuna sauce for savory taste)

422
00:20:17,662 --> 00:20:20,172
Can we enjoy such a luxurious meal full of sea urchin roe?

423
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:22,103
This is really luxurious.

424
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:25,912
(The seaweed soup is ready now.)

425
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:30,383
(Jin Goo only has to stir-fry his bulgogi now.)

426
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:33,353
(Safely filmed with the permission of the landowner.)

427
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,553
Gosh, it looks good.

428
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:39,922
(Bulgogi is well seasoned with sauce.)

429
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:42,323
(I hope it's delicious.)

430
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:45,633
(Adding mushrooms on the center for decoration)

431
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:49,563
(The cook tastes vegetables first to see if they're well seasoned.)

432
00:20:49,702 --> 00:20:52,033
(Nodding in approval)

433
00:20:52,803 --> 00:20:55,402
(Our youngest is doing great.)

434
00:20:55,873 --> 00:20:58,172
(Sprinkling sesame salt)

435
00:20:58,273 --> 00:20:59,613
- Is it done? - Yes.

436
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:00,843
Jin Goo!

437
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:02,783
(Jin Goo's bulgogi is ready.)

438
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,853
It's a bit salty, but we can eat it with rice.

439
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:05,853
It's okay if we eat it with rice.

440
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:07,053
- Is it salty? - Yes.

441
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,353
Let's do it over.

442
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:10,482
I don't like salty food.

443
00:21:10,623 --> 00:21:13,893
Hey, he said he doesn't like salty food.

444
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:15,962
Give him a lot of rice.

445
00:21:15,962 --> 00:21:18,293
(Since he doesn't like salty food, give him a lot of rice.)

446
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:20,992
Why? What are you looking for?

447
00:21:21,803 --> 00:21:23,533
There's sea urchin roe whenever I ladle the soup.

448
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:24,773
Why are you looking for margarine?

449
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,172
It's good when we mix it with rice.

450
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:28,543
With raw egg.

451
00:21:28,543 --> 00:21:30,143
Dong Il, it's your birthday. Why don't you eat seaweed soup...

452
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:31,543
Right, do as you want.

453
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:33,343
(Since it's your birthday, eat as you want.)

454
00:21:33,343 --> 00:21:34,813
- Later. - Yes.

455
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:37,283
Hey, this sea urchin roe seaweed soup is...

456
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:40,283
(It must be delicious.)

457
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:42,922
As you know, sea urchin roe seaweed soup is fine food.

458
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:45,492
There's sea urchin roe whenever I ladle the soup.

459
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:49,462
(Plenty of sea urchin roe from Jeju Island)

460
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:51,023
Dong Il, it's your birthday. Why don't you eat seaweed soup...

461
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:52,262
It's a party.

462
00:21:52,262 --> 00:21:53,992
(Jin Goo takes the soup bowl from the outside.)

463
00:21:55,432 --> 00:21:57,873
There's sea urchin roe everywhere I see.

464
00:21:57,873 --> 00:21:59,472
We put soup bowls on the right. Am I correct?

465
00:21:59,472 --> 00:22:01,133
- Pardon? - Yes, put soup bowls on the right.

466
00:22:02,803 --> 00:22:04,813
We put them on the left for ancestral rites.

467
00:22:05,343 --> 00:22:07,143
Oh, I put it on the right.

468
00:22:07,143 --> 00:22:09,843
You would have been in big trouble if you had done the opposite.

469
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:11,553
- An ancestral rite on birthday? - It's my birthday.

470
00:22:12,353 --> 00:22:15,922
(What's the last side dish for his birthday?)

471
00:22:17,023 --> 00:22:22,192
(Tasty side dishes made with vegetables that Dong Il likes)

472
00:22:22,393 --> 00:22:24,593
- Si Wan, I didn't think of that. - Yes?

473
00:22:25,593 --> 00:22:27,533
- It's for his birthday. - Vegetables?

474
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:30,363
- My gosh. - Gosh, take a seat.

475
00:22:30,603 --> 00:22:31,732
Thanks.

476
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,773
Gosh, how nice this is.

477
00:22:35,143 --> 00:22:38,643
Hey, we haven't had such a big meal for breakfast so far.

478
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:40,942
This is quite a spread.

479
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,242
(Grilled tilefish from Jeju Island)

480
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:47,182
(Dong Il's birthday meal cooked by the members is ready.)

481
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,482
- Goodness. - Happy birthday, Dong Il!

482
00:22:49,482 --> 00:22:53,152
- Gosh, thank you for the meal. - Happy birthday!

483
00:22:53,553 --> 00:22:55,992
Gosh, can we eat this much for breakfast on Jeju Island?

484
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:58,732
For breakfast... What time is it now?

485
00:22:59,162 --> 00:23:00,333
It's an early hour.

486
00:23:00,992 --> 00:23:02,402
Let me see. I'll try the seaweed soup first.

487
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:04,232
- It's before 9am. - Gosh, it's not even 9am,

488
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:05,672
- and we're having such a big meal. - We're already eating breakfast.

489
00:23:05,672 --> 00:23:07,702
(Trying the sea urchin seaweed soup, the main dish of the birthday meal)

490
00:23:08,143 --> 00:23:10,043
- Gosh, this tastes so refreshing. - Is it delicious?

491
00:23:10,043 --> 00:23:11,313
Yes, totally.

492
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:14,982
(Let's all eat together.)

493
00:23:14,982 --> 00:23:15,982
(Exclaiming)

494
00:23:19,952 --> 00:23:21,353
(Savoring)

495
00:23:22,922 --> 00:23:24,523
(Savoring)

496
00:23:26,222 --> 00:23:28,823
It's so tasty because it's hot.

497
00:23:28,823 --> 00:23:30,262
(Hot broth is perfect for breakfast.)

498
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:33,893
I could eat this seaweed soup with only kimchi.

499
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:36,702
You cooked it surprisingly well.

500
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:41,672
(This is so delicious.)

501
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:45,043
Gosh, Hee Won usually doesn't eat breakfast.

502
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:47,813
- Right. I don't eat breakfast. - Seriously.

503
00:23:47,813 --> 00:23:50,742
But he's eating so much. He finished it.

504
00:23:50,742 --> 00:23:54,252
I like this seaweed soup so much. This seaweed soup.

505
00:23:55,353 --> 00:23:57,323
(My hard work pays off.)

506
00:23:57,323 --> 00:23:58,722
It's perfect.

507
00:23:58,722 --> 00:24:00,793
Now, I'll try this bulgogi.

508
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:03,262
(Next up is Jin Goo's bulgogi which looks delicious.)

509
00:24:03,262 --> 00:24:05,093
Goodness, seriously.

510
00:24:05,992 --> 00:24:08,262
I have to taste it first.

511
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:10,902
(Dong Il tries it first again this time.)

512
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:13,133
It's delicious, right?

513
00:24:13,432 --> 00:24:14,603
- Hey. - How is it?

514
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:15,643
Have you been running a restaurant?

515
00:24:15,643 --> 00:24:17,672
What did he learn while he was away from home? Try it.

516
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:19,912
- Is it good? - Yes, absolutely.

517
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:22,412
- Si Wan, try this. - Okay.

518
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:23,942
It's fantastic.

519
00:24:25,553 --> 00:24:26,613
Jin Goo.

520
00:24:29,682 --> 00:24:31,452
(Speechless)

521
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:33,992
I think Jin Goo learned something.

522
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:35,422
Am I right?

523
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:38,033
Are you preparing to start a business these days?

524
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:40,363
No, nothing like that.

525
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:41,762
(Taking a bite)

526
00:24:41,762 --> 00:24:43,633
It's not salty at all.

527
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:51,172
(It tastes distinctive with yuzu preserves in it.)

528
00:24:52,472 --> 00:24:55,113
Jin Goo's hands are magical like ramyeon soup base.

529
00:24:55,113 --> 00:24:56,783
(Eating a big piece of bulgogi with sea urchin seaweed soup)

530
00:24:56,843 --> 00:24:58,952
Hey, I can't help it. Let's go on another trip...

531
00:24:58,952 --> 00:25:01,313
when the weather is fine.

532
00:25:01,553 --> 00:25:03,553
Right? Gosh, this is...

533
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:07,192
The yuzu preserves were a stroke of genius.

534
00:25:07,393 --> 00:25:08,893
I've never had meat with yuzu preserves before.

535
00:25:08,893 --> 00:25:10,462
Me too. Where did you learn it?

536
00:25:10,823 --> 00:25:11,962
From my grandma.

537
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:14,803
- I see. It's your grandma's recipe. - Yes.

538
00:25:15,363 --> 00:25:18,133
That's right. Every family has its secret recipe.

539
00:25:18,472 --> 00:25:21,843
But the yuzu preserves go quite well with bulgogi.

540
00:25:21,843 --> 00:25:22,902
I know, right?

541
00:25:23,442 --> 00:25:26,343
- Next, it's Hee Won's... - Next up is...

542
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:30,182
He almost boned semi-dried tilefish. Let's try it.

543
00:25:30,982 --> 00:25:32,682
(The bone and flesh are separated.)

544
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:35,323
(Taking a bite)

545
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:38,192
(Tasting)

546
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:41,222
(Nervous)

547
00:25:42,063 --> 00:25:43,162
It's awful.

548
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,462
I apologize.

549
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:48,363
(Joking)

550
00:25:50,762 --> 00:25:51,803
- It's delicious. - Is it delicious?

551
00:25:51,803 --> 00:25:53,773
- Yes, it's good. - It's delicious, Hee Won.

552
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:55,303
It's good. I was joking.

553
00:25:56,143 --> 00:25:59,512
(It's delicious.)

554
00:25:59,512 --> 00:26:01,843
(Frowning)

555
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,512
(A birthday meal with the members' considerable effort)

556
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:11,492
(Devouring)

557
00:26:11,623 --> 00:26:12,922
Jin Goo, try this.

558
00:26:12,922 --> 00:26:15,063
- Okay. - It's good.

559
00:26:16,962 --> 00:26:19,232
(Chewing)

560
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:26,833
(Jin Goo slowly starts to devour the food.)

561
00:26:27,073 --> 00:26:29,172
(Glad to see him eat with gusto.)

562
00:26:30,442 --> 00:26:32,912
(His frowning shows that he's enjoying the food.)

563
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:34,773
The seaweed soup is so delicious.

564
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,383
Thank you, guys.

565
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:38,553
By the way,

566
00:26:39,383 --> 00:26:41,682
we don't have many chances to eat a birthday meal at home...

567
00:26:41,682 --> 00:26:43,283
- because of our schedules. - That's right.

568
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:45,192
- Only a few times. - Right.

569
00:26:45,192 --> 00:26:46,623
Because I was away from home most of the time.

570
00:26:47,593 --> 00:26:48,722
But...

571
00:26:50,563 --> 00:26:53,232
I've never had this kind of birthday meal outside my home.

572
00:26:54,902 --> 00:26:57,462
We don't have this kind of birthday meal for breakfast at home either.

573
00:26:57,462 --> 00:27:01,472
We usually have it for dinner. A simple meal with seaweed soup.

574
00:27:01,573 --> 00:27:03,373
But this kind of birthday meal is...

575
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:06,813
It's the first time in my life. Seriously, it's the first time.

576
00:27:07,672 --> 00:27:08,682
Really.

577
00:27:09,313 --> 00:27:10,512
It's so touching.

578
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:13,152
With the finest ingredients in Korea.

579
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:15,452
(Taking a mouthful)

580
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:21,192
(They're all glad that Dong Il likes it.)

581
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:25,962
I'm about to cry when I eat one more spoon of it.

582
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:28,063
Guys, let's stop eating. We should stop.

583
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,033
I'll put down my spoon.

584
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,932
We shouldn't make Dong Il cry on his birthday.

585
00:27:31,932 --> 00:27:34,133
- I saw him crying over there. - Yes.

586
00:27:35,043 --> 00:27:36,043
He was sitting there.

587
00:27:36,043 --> 00:27:38,412
I cried so much that the water level has risen up a bit.

588
00:27:38,412 --> 00:27:39,512
Right.

589
00:27:40,073 --> 00:27:42,442
Gosh, maybe it's because it's Dong Il's birthday,

590
00:27:42,442 --> 00:27:43,813
he's funnier than usual.

591
00:27:43,982 --> 00:27:49,383
(Chuckling)

592
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:53,053
Is it okay to eat this much for breakfast?

593
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:56,262
We have to fight with fish later.

594
00:27:58,563 --> 00:28:01,803
Hey, today... You know that, right?

595
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:05,232
- What? - Today...

596
00:28:05,402 --> 00:28:08,603
The battle will be between Dong Il and fish, okay?

597
00:28:09,073 --> 00:28:10,543
Okay.

598
00:28:11,043 --> 00:28:13,512
- I'll take off the hook. - Good.

599
00:28:14,472 --> 00:28:16,212
- For me? - Yes, Dong Il.

600
00:28:16,212 --> 00:28:17,313
Yes, Dong Il.

601
00:28:17,313 --> 00:28:20,212
(You go and catch lots of fish.)

602
00:28:21,152 --> 00:28:26,523
(Birds chirping)

603
00:28:26,523 --> 00:28:28,962
Eating breakfast while listening to birds chirping...

604
00:28:28,962 --> 00:28:31,192
Isn't it like a scene from a movie?

605
00:28:31,192 --> 00:28:32,962
- Yes, it is. - Seriously.

606
00:28:35,902 --> 00:28:38,603
- So beautiful. - "Happy birthday, Dong Il."

607
00:28:39,273 --> 00:28:40,273
That's right.

608
00:28:40,273 --> 00:28:42,472
"Once again, happy birthday."

609
00:28:42,942 --> 00:28:44,103
Birds are saying that?

610
00:28:44,103 --> 00:28:47,912
I can understand them a little. I have a certificate.

611
00:28:47,912 --> 00:28:49,343
(Si Wan is acting cute since it's Dong Il's birthday.)

612
00:28:49,843 --> 00:28:51,613
We'll trust everything if you've got a certificate.

613
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:54,553
(Birds chirping)

614
00:28:54,652 --> 00:28:56,682
They say you won't be able to catch fish, though.

615
00:28:56,682 --> 00:28:58,452
("You won't be able to catch fish, though.")

616
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,952
Ask them whose fault will it be?

617
00:29:01,053 --> 00:29:02,492
Because of whom?

618
00:29:02,722 --> 00:29:05,063
(Birds chirping)

619
00:29:05,063 --> 00:29:07,662
Oh, should I translate it?

620
00:29:08,962 --> 00:29:10,603
They say you should blame your own skill.

621
00:29:12,603 --> 00:29:15,073
(Bursting into laughter)

622
00:29:15,073 --> 00:29:16,143
I got it.

623
00:29:16,143 --> 00:29:18,912
(What a pity!)

624
00:29:20,873 --> 00:29:23,643
You worked hard to prepare the meal, and yet you end up like this.

625
00:29:23,643 --> 00:29:25,252
(Just kidding.)

626
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:28,553
(I'll catch fish no matter what.)

627
00:29:28,952 --> 00:29:31,083
Gosh, I'm so happy.

628
00:29:31,323 --> 00:29:32,793
I really ate a lot.

629
00:29:32,793 --> 00:29:34,722
I ate so much in two days.

630
00:29:35,893 --> 00:29:37,393
(A relaxing time after the meal)

631
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:40,893
Dong Il, we're going to set up our car when we get there.

632
00:29:40,893 --> 00:29:42,162
We'll set up our house.

633
00:29:42,162 --> 00:29:44,502
- Are we going on board right away? - We'll go right away.

634
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:45,533
Right.

635
00:29:46,432 --> 00:29:49,043
I get motion sickness easily.

636
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:53,172
(Where are you going?)

637
00:29:53,672 --> 00:29:55,543
Because of glaciers, the sea level will rise.

638
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,783
Dong Il, here's the package you ordered.

639
00:29:58,043 --> 00:29:59,512
(The package?)

640
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:02,323
- What? - It's nothing special.

641
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:05,093
It's a latex pillow you like.

642
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:08,323
Goodness. Si Wan...

643
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:11,063
Thank you. I like this so much.

644
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:12,793
- It's a latex pillow. - Right.

645
00:30:12,793 --> 00:30:14,533
Thanks.

646
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:16,363
(He even prepared a gift?)

647
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:20,502
- It's good for my neck. - I put my head on it.

648
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:22,242
- And... Yes. - Oh, really?

649
00:30:22,902 --> 00:30:24,202
So is it a used one?

650
00:30:25,942 --> 00:30:30,212
(A wicked jealousy)

651
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:34,113
I tried it and exchanged it with something better.

652
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:35,283
He used it before.

653
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:37,053
I got a new one.

654
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:39,123
Why don't you bring some used ones?

655
00:30:40,793 --> 00:30:43,662
(Maybe next year.)

656
00:30:44,762 --> 00:30:46,393
It already feels different.

657
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:48,762
You can feel it, right? It was really comfortable.

658
00:30:48,762 --> 00:30:51,202
(Comfortable)

659
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:54,103
I wish you sleep well at House on Wheels.

660
00:30:55,143 --> 00:30:57,843
- Thanks. - I'm glad you like it.

661
00:30:57,843 --> 00:30:59,672
- We've all prepared too. - Of course.

662
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:01,172
- Today, I'll... - Yes.

663
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:02,742
I'll give all the fish I catch.

664
00:31:04,043 --> 00:31:05,512
Gosh, I won't have any today.

665
00:31:06,512 --> 00:31:09,353
(Si Wan's powerful punch on Dong Il.)

666
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:11,252
Finally, Si Wan...

667
00:31:11,252 --> 00:31:12,323
(Sung Dong Il, The number of fish he's caught in House on Wheels: 0)

668
00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:14,192
knows for sure.

669
00:31:14,192 --> 00:31:15,793
(Feeling relieved)

670
00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:18,363
(Scowling)

671
00:31:18,363 --> 00:31:21,162
- Thank you. - My goodness.

672
00:31:21,162 --> 00:31:24,732
What did you learn when you were away? You can't read the room.

673
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:27,533
Hey, it's my birthday.

674
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:29,873
He was so hilarious.

675
00:31:31,702 --> 00:31:34,512
- Si Wan was so humorous. - Gosh, it's good.

676
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:38,212
- Okay, let's wash now. - Yes.

677
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:40,252
- Let's have a party in the evening. - Let's do that.

678
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:41,553
(Shall we set off to today's front yard?)

679
00:31:42,283 --> 00:31:45,152
(Now, it's time to say goodbye to Seonheul-ri virgin forest.)

680
00:31:45,793 --> 00:31:47,952
Okay, let's go to the second location.

681
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:49,662
(The members are heading to the second front yard.)

682
00:31:49,662 --> 00:31:52,133
I think this place will last in my memory for a long time.

683
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:54,833
- Yes. - Seriously.

684
00:31:55,732 --> 00:31:57,732
Gosh, look at that. In the front.

685
00:31:57,732 --> 00:31:59,633
(Horses came to see off the members.)

686
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:00,902
Goodbye.

687
00:32:02,343 --> 00:32:03,442
(See you again, horses.)

688
00:32:03,442 --> 00:32:04,603
Goodbye.

689
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:09,682
This neighborhood was like a place in a fairy tale.

690
00:32:10,883 --> 00:32:13,553
But where we're going now is even prettier than here.

691
00:32:13,912 --> 00:32:17,523
You can see the ocean and the wide plain there.

692
00:32:19,593 --> 00:32:21,323
It's so stunning.

693
00:32:22,363 --> 00:32:26,593
In fact, today will be really great.

694
00:32:26,593 --> 00:32:28,962
(Driving southwards)

695
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:32,672
(Today's front yard is the Southern Sea of Jeju Island.)

696
00:32:33,672 --> 00:32:37,843
(The southern sea is deep blue in color and wide.)

697
00:32:38,843 --> 00:32:43,012
(Seonheul-ri's virgin forest, The southern sea of Jeju Island)

698
00:32:43,012 --> 00:32:44,712
Gosh, the road is beautiful.

699
00:32:45,652 --> 00:32:48,053
(Exclaiming)

700
00:32:48,652 --> 00:32:51,783
- Look at the hill. - It's so mystic.

701
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,652
Looks like it soars into the air.

702
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:55,363
Right, isn't it beautiful?

703
00:32:57,462 --> 00:32:59,262
This road is so beautiful.

704
00:32:59,262 --> 00:33:00,432
(Sparkling eyes)

705
00:33:00,432 --> 00:33:01,432
Right?

706
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:04,563
Is that wind power generator the one we saw yesterday?

707
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:07,672
I think it's the one we saw from above, right?

708
00:33:08,573 --> 00:33:09,573
(Exclaiming)

709
00:33:09,843 --> 00:33:11,103
Goodness, it's amazing.

710
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:13,543
(With the warm wind, )

711
00:33:13,543 --> 00:33:16,442
(we drive with excitement.)

712
00:33:16,682 --> 00:33:20,682
I thought I've been to Jeju Island a lot so far,

713
00:33:21,512 --> 00:33:23,652
but I still find it so interesting to look around.

714
00:33:23,652 --> 00:33:24,922
(There's always something new on Jeju Island.)

715
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:28,192
Yes, we're not used to this kind of scenery. It's exotic.

716
00:33:28,823 --> 00:33:31,963
(What will today's front yard look like?)

717
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:35,362
Gosh, they must be living here. How nice.

718
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:39,373
I guess that kind of garage is quite common here.

719
00:33:40,132 --> 00:33:42,643
(Is there something wrong with him?)

720
00:33:43,572 --> 00:33:44,802
Do you want a massage?

721
00:33:45,313 --> 00:33:46,443
Gosh, that's relaxing.

722
00:33:47,412 --> 00:33:50,643
- Correct. - Gosh, this is so... It's really...

723
00:33:50,813 --> 00:33:52,583
Gosh. What is it, Jin Goo?

724
00:33:52,753 --> 00:33:55,012
- His hands. - Goodness.

725
00:33:55,353 --> 00:33:56,423
He made it clear.

726
00:33:56,983 --> 00:33:59,123
(Exclaiming with delight)

727
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:04,893
Have I slept in the wrong posture? I got a stiff neck.

728
00:34:05,893 --> 00:34:06,963
Gosh, that's soothing.

729
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:08,233
(Chuckling)

730
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,233
When you have a stiff neck, you should massage this spot.

731
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:11,362
Where?

732
00:34:11,362 --> 00:34:12,673
(Receiving his massage)

733
00:34:12,673 --> 00:34:14,103
- Here. - Where?

734
00:34:15,373 --> 00:34:18,543
(Massaging firmly)

735
00:34:21,472 --> 00:34:22,483
- Hey. - Yes?

736
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:26,213
Are you massaging my neck, or are you gripping it?

737
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:29,222
Seriously, what on earth did you learn?

738
00:34:29,782 --> 00:34:31,452
Why have you changed this much?

739
00:34:32,092 --> 00:34:34,023
I'm fine with him as he is.

740
00:34:34,023 --> 00:34:35,523
(I'm fine with Jin Goo as he is.)

741
00:34:36,222 --> 00:34:38,793
(Jin Goo gives Dong Il too much affection.)

742
00:34:38,992 --> 00:34:41,092
He's spoiled.

743
00:34:41,092 --> 00:34:42,662
(While expressing their affection toward one another, )

744
00:34:43,532 --> 00:34:46,273
(they arrive at the southern region of Jeju Island.)

745
00:34:46,603 --> 00:34:48,103
The houses are beautiful since they're low.

746
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:52,612
(The scenery has already changed from tall trees to low stone walls.)

747
00:34:53,242 --> 00:34:55,813
(Passing through a small village on Jeju Island)

748
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:59,213
- There are big pine trees here. - Goodness.

749
00:34:59,313 --> 00:35:03,182
Gosh, it looks like a foreign country.

750
00:35:03,182 --> 00:35:05,393
Gosh, this is amazing.

751
00:35:05,393 --> 00:35:06,452
It looks like Southeast Asia.

752
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:07,952
(Today's front yard is full of pine trees.)

753
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:11,063
- Gosh, this is great. - Goodness.

754
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:12,063
(Going deep into the palm tree forest)

755
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:13,393
Gosh, what is this?

756
00:35:13,393 --> 00:35:14,532
(It almost looks like a tropical rainforest.)

757
00:35:16,063 --> 00:35:17,333
Gosh, look at the cow over there.

758
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:19,903
- My goodness. - Is there a ranch here?

759
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,643
(Welcome!)

760
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:23,702
On Jeju Island?

761
00:35:24,003 --> 00:35:25,943
Goodness.

762
00:35:25,943 --> 00:35:28,012
(Where are they heading to?)

763
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:31,742
- Goodness, this is... - We're almost there now.

764
00:35:31,742 --> 00:35:34,382
(Soon after, the meadow is spread before House on Wheels.)

765
00:35:34,753 --> 00:35:37,382
How did they find a place like this?

766
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:42,523
(Simply amazing)

767
00:35:42,992 --> 00:35:44,862
Gosh. Seriously.

768
00:35:46,193 --> 00:35:50,233
(Excited)

769
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:53,603
(At the end of the wide meadow, blue waves gradually come in sight.)

770
00:35:53,632 --> 00:35:54,972
Look, the sea!

771
00:35:56,702 --> 00:35:59,842
(Seogwipo Beach right in front of our house)

772
00:36:01,143 --> 00:36:04,112
(Between the meadow and the beach, )

773
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:06,083
(there's a black basalt cliff.)

774
00:36:06,682 --> 00:36:10,253
(Untainted nature stands high.)

775
00:36:11,523 --> 00:36:17,222
(There's a vast meadow on the back.)

776
00:36:17,623 --> 00:36:20,862
(You can run as much as you want in the sea breeze.)

777
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:22,932
Gosh, it's so cool here.

778
00:36:23,262 --> 00:36:24,333
Awesome.

779
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:28,632
(A place you can enjoy the vast meadow and the blue sea)

780
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:33,143
(When the day is clear, )

781
00:36:33,143 --> 00:36:36,143
(you can even see Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak from here.)

782
00:36:36,943 --> 00:36:40,153
(A place you can only see in the warm, southern area of Jeju Island)

783
00:36:41,253 --> 00:36:44,052
(A place like a watercolor painting)

784
00:36:45,052 --> 00:36:51,193
(Today, we live in the Sea Meadow in Seogwipo.)

785
00:36:51,423 --> 00:36:54,333
(Safely filmed with the permission of the landowner.)

786
00:36:54,693 --> 00:36:55,802
(Exclaiming)

787
00:36:55,802 --> 00:36:57,103
- Seriously. - This is so...

788
00:36:58,162 --> 00:36:59,432
(Eyes wide open)

789
00:36:59,432 --> 00:37:02,072
- This is so nice. - It's just beautiful.

790
00:37:03,273 --> 00:37:04,373
(Admiring)

791
00:37:06,543 --> 00:37:08,612
- Gosh, this place is amazing. - Yes, totally.

792
00:37:08,612 --> 00:37:11,643
This place is so wide.

793
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:14,313
Gosh, it's fantastic.

794
00:37:14,313 --> 00:37:16,052
How come it's so wide and open?

795
00:37:16,052 --> 00:37:18,992
I love places like this.

796
00:37:19,623 --> 00:37:22,523
The color of the sea is so beautiful.

797
00:37:22,523 --> 00:37:23,523
Yes, it is.

798
00:37:23,523 --> 00:37:25,362
This is by far the best.

799
00:37:26,432 --> 00:37:27,793
This is really...

800
00:37:27,793 --> 00:37:29,403
(It's great!)

801
00:37:29,702 --> 00:37:32,833
Are they putting the cows out to pasture?

802
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,302
That's right. They put them out to pasture.

803
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:37,802
Gosh, the cows will be free here.

804
00:37:37,802 --> 00:37:38,813
I know.

805
00:37:38,813 --> 00:37:40,643
They live better lives than us.

806
00:37:41,043 --> 00:37:43,412
Gosh, it's so wide.

807
00:37:43,412 --> 00:37:44,483
I envy the cows.

808
00:37:46,282 --> 00:37:47,353
(The original and new youngest members start to set up the house.)

809
00:37:47,353 --> 00:37:48,923
Did you lock the brake?

810
00:37:49,023 --> 00:37:50,952
- Yes. I have to pull it, right? - Yes.

811
00:37:52,023 --> 00:37:53,722
They are all experts now.

812
00:37:54,552 --> 00:37:58,262
(Skilled)

813
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,032
That's it.

814
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,103
It feels weird to look at him like this.

815
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:10,503
(Jin Goo in the last trip)

816
00:38:10,503 --> 00:38:12,912
(They have the same posture.)

817
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:16,983
(It feels weird watching him.)

818
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:21,353
- It's sunny here, so we need shade. - Yes.

819
00:38:21,753 --> 00:38:24,222
(Dong Il is taking a rest for a while.)

820
00:38:24,222 --> 00:38:26,023
(Groaning)

821
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:28,222
(Groaning)

822
00:38:28,423 --> 00:38:30,862
(Nailing)

823
00:38:31,492 --> 00:38:33,393
(Jin Goo works hard too.)

824
00:38:34,532 --> 00:38:37,762
(Since there are two young members, they're twice as fast.)

825
00:38:38,302 --> 00:38:40,773
Dong Il, we're fully professionals now.

826
00:38:40,873 --> 00:38:42,702
- Is that so? - Yes, really.

827
00:38:43,003 --> 00:38:44,742
Now, we set it up at once.

828
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:47,512
- The strong one. - Here's strong coffee for you.

829
00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:48,912
This one's weak.

830
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:49,912
(Taking a coffee break after hard work)

831
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:53,412
This view, iced coffee, and this weather.

832
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:59,222
Gosh, I love this wide, open view.

833
00:39:00,123 --> 00:39:03,023
The weather is fine too. It's not too windy.

834
00:39:03,023 --> 00:39:06,693
- Right. Why isn't it so windy here? - Yes.

835
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:09,662
It's because I'm back.

836
00:39:11,262 --> 00:39:12,632
Right, it's because of Jin Goo.

837
00:39:12,632 --> 00:39:13,673
(I'll take that joke.)

838
00:39:13,673 --> 00:39:14,932
Since Jin Goo is here,

839
00:39:15,072 --> 00:39:16,072
(They are cute.)

840
00:39:16,072 --> 00:39:17,273
the wind is helping us.

841
00:39:18,543 --> 00:39:21,713
This place is really... Honestly, I wanted to build a house...

842
00:39:21,713 --> 00:39:24,083
in a place like this. I told you so.

843
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,782
- In an open place like this. - Yes.

844
00:39:26,153 --> 00:39:28,483
But this place is really...

845
00:39:29,253 --> 00:39:32,182
(Exclaiming)

846
00:39:32,182 --> 00:39:34,452
Right, an open place like this...

847
00:39:34,452 --> 00:39:36,523
I'm serious. I've never seen such a wide and open place before.

848
00:39:36,523 --> 00:39:38,523
- It's hard to see in our lifetime. - Right.

849
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:40,893
This place reminds me of the song that goes, "On that green meadow."

850
00:39:41,032 --> 00:39:43,063
- Right? - There are no telephone poles...

851
00:39:43,063 --> 00:39:45,003
or anything that blocks the view.

852
00:39:45,003 --> 00:39:46,503
(The emerald sea as big as the meadow in front of our house)

853
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:48,472
There's no boat around here.

854
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:49,543
(There's even no boat.)

855
00:39:50,103 --> 00:39:53,072
The ocean is so wide, there should be at least one boat.

856
00:39:53,373 --> 00:39:54,412
There's not even a boat.

857
00:39:55,112 --> 00:39:58,612
How come the horizon stretches so straight?

858
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:01,112
- The horizon is much clearer... - Yes.

859
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:02,882
than yesterday.

860
00:40:03,782 --> 00:40:05,382
Yes, the horizon is...

861
00:40:05,382 --> 00:40:08,253
- a perfectly straight line. - Right.

862
00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:11,822
- Go grocery shopping with Si Wan. - Yes.

863
00:40:11,822 --> 00:40:13,293
Buy something to eat.

864
00:40:14,063 --> 00:40:15,662
- Okay. - We can have them while fishing.

865
00:40:16,063 --> 00:40:17,963
- Could we go now? - Yes, see you.

866
00:40:17,963 --> 00:40:19,202
Oh, why did I say that?

867
00:40:19,403 --> 00:40:23,773
See? He's talking politely to Jin Goo and Hee Won.

868
00:40:23,773 --> 00:40:26,342
- I'll be back, Jin Goo. - You've grown that much.

869
00:40:27,043 --> 00:40:29,012
(Setting off to buy some snacks)

870
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:30,342
Let's go.

871
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:31,713
Okay. Hold on.

872
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:38,483
(A clear view in the front)

873
00:40:38,483 --> 00:40:40,893
- I like this place. - Goodness.

874
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:42,322
- This is really... - It's so good.

875
00:40:43,423 --> 00:40:46,333
- Doesn't it feel like driving? - Yes.

876
00:40:46,632 --> 00:40:48,862
We're driving where nothing's blocking us.

877
00:40:48,862 --> 00:40:50,903
- Let's drive around this place. - Sounds good.

878
00:40:50,903 --> 00:40:52,333
Let's take a round.

879
00:40:52,773 --> 00:40:55,103
Let's drive in a big circle.

880
00:40:55,802 --> 00:40:57,742
- In a circle like this. - This is...

881
00:40:58,242 --> 00:40:59,242
(Exclaiming)

882
00:40:59,242 --> 00:41:00,713
(Exclaiming for the 2nd time)

883
00:41:00,713 --> 00:41:01,713
(Exclaiming for the 3rd time)

884
00:41:01,713 --> 00:41:03,083
(Exclaiming for the 4th and 5th time)

885
00:41:03,282 --> 00:41:04,713
(Exclaiming for the 6th and 7th time)

886
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:05,983
(Exclaiming for the 8th time)

887
00:41:07,012 --> 00:41:09,382
- Goodness, it's so cool. - My gosh.

888
00:41:10,722 --> 00:41:13,523
- Isn't it exciting to drive? - Yes.

889
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:19,992
(Flapping)

890
00:41:20,532 --> 00:41:22,833
The wind is perfect.

891
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,833
- It's a warm breeze. - Yes.

892
00:41:26,603 --> 00:41:30,103
I love this place. It's the best place on Jeju Island.

893
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:37,083
When we first went on a trip together,

894
00:41:37,543 --> 00:41:40,313
we were lying under the shade just like this.

895
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:43,523
- Under the pine tree. - Yes. Under the pine tree.

896
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:44,782
We were having ice cream.

897
00:41:45,322 --> 00:41:46,592
- It was hot. - We were talking...

898
00:41:47,123 --> 00:41:49,063
about many things that day.

899
00:41:49,322 --> 00:41:50,762
How old is Sung Joon now?

900
00:41:50,862 --> 00:41:52,222
He's in second grade in junior high.

901
00:41:53,162 --> 00:41:54,233
Already?

902
00:41:54,463 --> 00:41:55,463
His hair is messy.

903
00:41:55,463 --> 00:41:56,463
(Friendly)

904
00:41:57,903 --> 00:41:59,733
We were at the beach that day just like today.

905
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:01,733
- We were. - Right.

906
00:42:02,472 --> 00:42:05,742
- Since we both like the ocean. - Right.

907
00:42:06,143 --> 00:42:07,242
That's why.

908
00:42:09,213 --> 00:42:13,213
(The cozy ocean comforts the hearts of the visitors.)

909
00:42:13,552 --> 00:42:15,983
If I were to build my house here, this would be what I'd like to do.

910
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:18,523
I would be relaxing like this in my yard.

911
00:42:19,592 --> 00:42:20,753
If my friends visit me,

912
00:42:21,893 --> 00:42:24,992
I would barbecue and have some beer with them.

913
00:42:25,693 --> 00:42:28,393
- It would be really happy. - Very happy.

914
00:42:28,393 --> 00:42:29,833
With my loved one,

915
00:42:30,103 --> 00:42:32,403
watching my children playing here...

916
00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:34,932
Children? You must be planning to have many.

917
00:42:35,773 --> 00:42:37,472
Didn't you say you want to get married early?

918
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:38,472
- Me? - Yes.

919
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,512
No, I've never thought of that.

920
00:42:40,912 --> 00:42:43,583
It's better to get married early.

921
00:42:44,882 --> 00:42:47,153
There's nothing special for getting married late.

922
00:42:48,682 --> 00:42:51,123
It's not that I'm picky about women.

923
00:42:51,623 --> 00:42:53,492
I just want to do more things for myself.

924
00:42:53,893 --> 00:42:55,123
- About your career? - Yes.

925
00:42:55,423 --> 00:42:56,662
- Career? - Yes, I want to do a lot more.

926
00:42:57,092 --> 00:42:58,722
(Hesitant)

927
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:02,632
I was actually struggling with mannerism for a while.

928
00:43:03,432 --> 00:43:04,563
- About your acting? - Yes.

929
00:43:04,903 --> 00:43:08,202
It was my first time to get complimented about my acting...

930
00:43:08,202 --> 00:43:09,572
and get awarded.

931
00:43:10,572 --> 00:43:13,512
(Jin Goo got from a Juvenile Award...)

932
00:43:13,742 --> 00:43:15,143
(to Rookie of the Year Award and Best Actor Award.)

933
00:43:15,143 --> 00:43:18,112
Acting was something very fun for me before that.

934
00:43:18,443 --> 00:43:20,052
But I became highly desired...

935
00:43:20,112 --> 00:43:22,853
to be very good at it and to be able to express more.

936
00:43:23,753 --> 00:43:25,992
I could no longer feel the same way about acting.

937
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,262
Acting became not as fun as when I was little.

938
00:43:29,822 --> 00:43:32,793
I kind of wished for my 20s to go by fast...

939
00:43:32,793 --> 00:43:33,992
because of that.

940
00:43:33,992 --> 00:43:35,063
- Did you? - Yes.

941
00:43:35,063 --> 00:43:36,103
(I see.)

942
00:43:36,302 --> 00:43:38,702
When time passes 10 to 15 years,

943
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:40,403
and I become in my 30s,

944
00:43:41,103 --> 00:43:42,572
I thought I would be...

945
00:43:42,572 --> 00:43:45,373
more confident. That's why I wanted my 20s...

946
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,012
to go by fast.

947
00:43:47,012 --> 00:43:48,143
My goodness.

948
00:43:48,813 --> 00:43:52,382
The actors always have...

949
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:56,322
to be judged by the public,

950
00:43:57,182 --> 00:44:00,452
so you will have to struggle until you stop acting.

951
00:44:00,452 --> 00:44:03,722
- Hee Won and I feel the same way. - I see.

952
00:44:05,123 --> 00:44:07,893
- I think you are doing well. - Thank you.

953
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:15,373
- I think we almost got there. - I think so too.

954
00:44:17,373 --> 00:44:18,873
I will wear my mask.

955
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:26,653
(Hee Won and Si Wan finally arrive at the store.)

956
00:44:28,983 --> 00:44:30,282
- Hello. - Hello.

957
00:44:30,282 --> 00:44:31,452
- Hello. - How are you?

958
00:44:31,452 --> 00:44:32,452
Hello.

959
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:34,552
We'd like to get some rice cakes.

960
00:44:35,963 --> 00:44:37,222
What we want is...

961
00:44:37,293 --> 00:44:38,762
This is delicious.

962
00:44:39,023 --> 00:44:41,592
- Is this pattteok? - It's omegi.

963
00:44:41,592 --> 00:44:42,762
- Omegi... - Hee Won.

964
00:44:42,762 --> 00:44:44,862
(It had red beans.)

965
00:44:45,262 --> 00:44:46,472
Isn't this kkultteok?

966
00:44:46,802 --> 00:44:48,302
- It's gamjatteok. - Is it gamjatteok?

967
00:44:48,472 --> 00:44:49,503
I'm getting everything wrong.

968
00:44:49,503 --> 00:44:50,842
(It's somewhat difficult.)

969
00:44:50,842 --> 00:44:52,342
Just give it a try until you get it right.

970
00:44:53,472 --> 00:44:54,773
I would get...

971
00:44:55,273 --> 00:44:58,512
- some omegi first. - I surely need to get omegi...

972
00:44:58,643 --> 00:45:01,012
- since we are in Jeju Island. - Omegi...

973
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:02,452
- Maybe 10? - Yes.

974
00:45:03,322 --> 00:45:04,382
And...

975
00:45:04,382 --> 00:45:05,483
(Staring)

976
00:45:05,782 --> 00:45:08,222
This looks very unique? What is it?

977
00:45:08,222 --> 00:45:09,722
This is made of sea mugwort.

978
00:45:09,893 --> 00:45:13,992
This is Jeju's traditional rice cake made of sea mugwort from Jeju.

979
00:45:13,992 --> 00:45:16,003
It's sticky rice cake and has a filling in it.

980
00:45:16,003 --> 00:45:19,702
Did you wrap it with something?

981
00:45:19,702 --> 00:45:21,873
- With plastic wrap. - Do we unwrap when we eat?

982
00:45:21,873 --> 00:45:22,873
Correct.

983
00:45:22,873 --> 00:45:23,903
How about 10?

984
00:45:24,702 --> 00:45:25,742
Sure.

985
00:45:25,972 --> 00:45:27,173
- Let's get 10. - Okay.

986
00:45:27,173 --> 00:45:29,713
I have another one that's also a specialty in Jeju.

987
00:45:29,713 --> 00:45:30,742
- What's that? - What's that?

988
00:45:30,943 --> 00:45:33,012
It's called solbyeonjeolbyeon. You can see it right here.

989
00:45:33,012 --> 00:45:34,452
- This one? - This one?

990
00:45:34,452 --> 00:45:36,182
- It's very delicious. - What did you say it's called?

991
00:45:36,182 --> 00:45:37,253
Solbyeonjeolbyeon.

992
00:45:38,222 --> 00:45:40,253
(When the rice was scarce in Jeju, )

993
00:45:40,253 --> 00:45:45,193
(it was served only for ancestral rites.)

994
00:45:46,793 --> 00:45:50,262
(Its name is a combination of solbyeon which symbolizes...)

995
00:45:50,862 --> 00:45:54,273
(the half-moon, and jeolbyeon which symbolizes the sun.)

996
00:45:54,273 --> 00:45:55,873
(It has two layers.)

997
00:45:57,842 --> 00:46:02,882
(It tastes good itself but also good with grain syrup.)

998
00:46:03,342 --> 00:46:04,342
(This is my first time seeing it.)

999
00:46:04,342 --> 00:46:07,012
- I've never heard of this before. - Solbyeonjeolbyeon.

1000
00:46:07,452 --> 00:46:09,583
It's similar to the jeolpyeon that's sold on land.

1001
00:46:10,753 --> 00:46:13,722
Dong Il likes to eat rice cakes with grain syrup.

1002
00:46:13,722 --> 00:46:15,423
- Okay. - Solbyeonjeolbyeon.

1003
00:46:15,423 --> 00:46:18,662
(Dong Il will be happy.)

1004
00:46:18,992 --> 00:46:20,333
- Thank you. - Sure.

1005
00:46:20,693 --> 00:46:22,463
- Thank you. - I hope you sell a lot.

1006
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,162
- Have a nice trip. - We will.

1007
00:46:26,103 --> 00:46:30,302
(They are headed back home.)

1008
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:35,112
- Some rice cakes are super tasty. - Right.

1009
00:46:35,912 --> 00:46:38,412
I loved garaetteok when I was little.

1010
00:46:38,412 --> 00:46:39,483
Garaetteok is delicious.

1011
00:46:39,983 --> 00:46:41,952
They are here. They're back earlier than I thought.

1012
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:45,182
Have you been relaxing enough?

1013
00:46:47,193 --> 00:46:48,322
What kind of rice cakes did you get?

1014
00:46:49,052 --> 00:46:50,923
We got everything you love.

1015
00:46:51,762 --> 00:46:52,833
- And... - Manggaetteok?

1016
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:54,963
There's a special rice cake that's only on Jeju Island.

1017
00:46:54,963 --> 00:46:56,262
- That's manggaetteok. - Sorry?

1018
00:46:56,262 --> 00:46:57,362
Manggaetteok.

1019
00:46:57,362 --> 00:46:59,572
I forgot its name, but it's not manggaetteok.

1020
00:47:00,273 --> 00:47:02,403
- Have you seen this kind? - Is this jeolpyeon?

1021
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,143
This one. Have you seen this?

1022
00:47:04,143 --> 00:47:07,412
And this one, it's also special. Take a look.

1023
00:47:07,543 --> 00:47:08,742
- Have you seen this? - Wait.

1024
00:47:09,213 --> 00:47:12,213
- It's something with mugwort. - Mugwort? Okay.

1025
00:47:12,213 --> 00:47:15,353
- Sea mugwort? I forgot the name. - Okay.

1026
00:47:16,182 --> 00:47:18,123
Dong Il, Isn't this unique?

1027
00:47:18,123 --> 00:47:19,123
(Hee Won forgot all those names.)

1028
00:47:19,452 --> 00:47:22,123
It's with sea mugwort or something like that.

1029
00:47:22,123 --> 00:47:23,793
- This one is? - Yes.

1030
00:47:24,693 --> 00:47:25,893
- It's my first time seeing it. - Okay.

1031
00:47:26,862 --> 00:47:31,063
(Dong Il tries the rice cake that's made of sea mugwort.)

1032
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:36,302
(Chewy)

1033
00:47:38,702 --> 00:47:39,773
(It suits Dong Il's taste.)

1034
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,143
- Dong Il, isn't it delicious? - It is.

1035
00:47:42,842 --> 00:47:46,153
(Hee Won also tries the sea mugwort rice cake.)

1036
00:47:46,153 --> 00:47:47,612
It's very good. Let me see.

1037
00:47:48,353 --> 00:47:49,353
It's good.

1038
00:47:51,782 --> 00:47:52,952
Hey, Si Wan.

1039
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:54,592
What was the name of this?

1040
00:47:56,193 --> 00:48:00,233
Wasn't this something about sea mugwort?

1041
00:48:00,233 --> 00:48:04,103
That one was something like songbyeon and jeolbyeon.

1042
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:05,833
It's sea...

1043
00:48:06,132 --> 00:48:08,233
This was something like sea mugwort.

1044
00:48:08,873 --> 00:48:11,143
It was something sticky rice cake.

1045
00:48:11,202 --> 00:48:14,043
This? Maybe. I don't know.

1046
00:48:14,873 --> 00:48:17,612
(Forget it. Let's just eat.)

1047
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:21,653
- Can I help you? - Jin Goo, Dong Il likes...

1048
00:48:21,653 --> 00:48:24,722
to eat rice cakes with grain syrup.

1049
00:48:24,983 --> 00:48:27,952
- You can bring... - Okay.

1050
00:48:27,952 --> 00:48:30,862
(The younger ones are preparing grain syrup.)

1051
00:48:33,463 --> 00:48:34,632
It gets scooped easier...

1052
00:48:35,233 --> 00:48:36,662
when it's warm.

1053
00:48:38,132 --> 00:48:42,032
(Jin Goo scoops it out generously.)

1054
00:48:42,173 --> 00:48:45,043
- Dong Il, here is grain syrup. - What?

1055
00:48:45,273 --> 00:48:48,412
If you eat it with grain syrup, you will become sweet guys.

1056
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,313
Oh, my gosh. Jin Goo is...

1057
00:48:54,512 --> 00:48:56,822
(He couldn't wait to make that joke.)

1058
00:48:56,822 --> 00:48:58,952
I can't believe he jokes like that.

1059
00:48:59,023 --> 00:49:01,322
He said we will become sweet.

1060
00:49:02,293 --> 00:49:03,463
I like that.

1061
00:49:05,123 --> 00:49:07,862
(In the meantime, Si Wan starts...)

1062
00:49:08,963 --> 00:49:12,532
(to make hallabong ade.)

1063
00:49:14,072 --> 00:49:17,242
(He cuts hallabong in halves, )

1064
00:49:18,702 --> 00:49:22,342
(and squeezes them.)

1065
00:49:23,782 --> 00:49:26,853
(Circling)

1066
00:49:27,583 --> 00:49:31,253
(Si Wan is a human juicer.)

1067
00:49:31,682 --> 00:49:34,293
Si Wan, this mugwort rice cake is so good.

1068
00:49:34,293 --> 00:49:35,293
That is...

1069
00:49:35,293 --> 00:49:37,322
It smells like mugwort a lot. Try it.

1070
00:49:39,463 --> 00:49:40,733
(It's delicious.)

1071
00:49:40,733 --> 00:49:41,833
It's so tasty.

1072
00:49:44,903 --> 00:49:46,932
Si Wan, try this after that. It's so good.

1073
00:49:46,932 --> 00:49:49,302
(Si Wan, try this too.)

1074
00:49:49,943 --> 00:49:52,842
(They continue to bring some for him as he's busy making ade.)

1075
00:49:52,842 --> 00:49:53,912
This is for our lunch.

1076
00:49:54,273 --> 00:49:56,882
(Chewing)

1077
00:49:57,912 --> 00:50:01,483
(Hallabong ade is almost ready.)

1078
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:09,423
(Fully sparkling)

1079
00:50:09,862 --> 00:50:11,492
- Hey. - You're supposed to dip it in here.

1080
00:50:12,893 --> 00:50:15,592
Was this not with two layers, but two pieces got stuck together?

1081
00:50:15,992 --> 00:50:17,662
- Yes. - These are stuck, right?

1082
00:50:17,963 --> 00:50:19,673
I think so. I'm not sure.

1083
00:50:19,903 --> 00:50:21,833
It seems like... Wait, two are stuck.

1084
00:50:22,733 --> 00:50:24,873
He said it's available only on Jeju Island.

1085
00:50:25,043 --> 00:50:26,943
You won't find stuck rice cakes anywhere else but on Jeju Island.

1086
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,472
(These are stuck hard.)

1087
00:50:29,072 --> 00:50:31,842
You can't separate them without a strong will to eat.

1088
00:50:31,842 --> 00:50:33,213
They are almost united.

1089
00:50:33,912 --> 00:50:35,552
(Laughing)

1090
00:50:35,552 --> 00:50:37,952
It needs to be warm to scoop out easily.

1091
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,623
Am I making hotteok or something?

1092
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:41,293
Are you supposed to make it like dumplings?

1093
00:50:41,492 --> 00:50:43,362
I'm not sure. I just can't help it any other way.

1094
00:50:44,063 --> 00:50:46,693
It's kkultteok, then. Isn't it?

1095
00:50:47,092 --> 00:50:48,262
It suddenly became kkultteok.

1096
00:50:49,762 --> 00:50:51,932
These rice cakes must be stuck so that we can put syrup in them.

1097
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:55,873
- Rice cake wrap. - Right.

1098
00:50:56,103 --> 00:50:57,903
Dong Il, the syrup is leaking to the side.

1099
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,543
Hurry and eat it.

1100
00:50:59,543 --> 00:51:02,213
(Dong Il takes a big bite.)

1101
00:51:07,282 --> 00:51:08,612
- Is it good? - It's very good.

1102
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:11,253
- Try it. It's so good. - Oh, it's hot.

1103
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:13,753
My gosh.

1104
00:51:14,893 --> 00:51:15,893
It got some syrup.

1105
00:51:18,523 --> 00:51:21,092
What was the name of the folk village?

1106
00:51:21,492 --> 00:51:23,262
I got this from the village,

1107
00:51:23,603 --> 00:51:26,873
not from just a market. The residents made this themselves.

1108
00:51:30,403 --> 00:51:33,713
- Here are your hallabong ades. - Oh, my hallabong ade.

1109
00:51:36,173 --> 00:51:38,282
(It looks good.)

1110
00:51:38,282 --> 00:51:40,382
- Si Wan, thank you. - Sure.

1111
00:51:44,983 --> 00:51:48,753
(Sour and refreshing)

1112
00:51:49,293 --> 00:51:53,762
(Dong Il takes a sip as well.)

1113
00:51:53,963 --> 00:51:55,063
- It's delicious! - It's sour, right?

1114
00:51:55,063 --> 00:51:56,503
Yes, but it's still delicious.

1115
00:51:56,603 --> 00:51:58,632
It's sweet. Very sweet.

1116
00:52:00,773 --> 00:52:02,202
- Grain syrup... - Dip it in.

1117
00:52:02,932 --> 00:52:05,103
Gosh, it's not sticking.

1118
00:52:05,943 --> 00:52:07,972
(Let me help you.)

1119
00:52:08,173 --> 00:52:10,242
You stay still.

1120
00:52:10,713 --> 00:52:11,842
Stay still.

1121
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:13,952
(Coating grain syrup)

1122
00:52:15,313 --> 00:52:17,882
- Do I move now? - Yes, eat. Sorry.

1123
00:52:17,983 --> 00:52:19,353
You should unfreeze me.

1124
00:52:19,353 --> 00:52:22,552
You definitely follow my words better than Hee Won.

1125
00:52:23,162 --> 00:52:25,123
- Try it. - It's good.

1126
00:52:25,123 --> 00:52:27,862
(Rice cake and Hallabong ade go perfectly well with each other.)

1127
00:52:31,762 --> 00:52:33,903
Gosh, all the rice cakes bought today taste great.

1128
00:52:33,903 --> 00:52:37,072
(All the rice cakes bought today taste great.)

1129
00:52:40,643 --> 00:52:42,012
We need to quickly finish eating and go fishing.

1130
00:52:42,012 --> 00:52:43,782
- We shouldn't be like this. - What time is it now?

1131
00:52:43,912 --> 00:52:45,713
The appointment's at 2pm, and there are only 10 minutes left.

1132
00:52:45,713 --> 00:52:47,713
- Gosh, we should hurry. - We should leave immediately.

1133
00:52:47,713 --> 00:52:49,112
We should hurry.

1134
00:52:49,612 --> 00:52:51,923
- Let's go! - Yes.

1135
00:52:51,923 --> 00:52:54,222
(They finally drive to the sea to fish.)

1136
00:52:54,722 --> 00:52:56,923
(Fish, I'm coming.)

1137
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,592
The weather is so good!

1138
00:52:59,023 --> 00:53:03,132
Today, I'll show you what a big catch is.

1139
00:53:05,063 --> 00:53:08,532
(They drive to the fishing spot with high hopes.)

1140
00:53:09,742 --> 00:53:13,003
- Let's enjoy fishing today. - Without any regrets.

1141
00:53:13,003 --> 00:53:14,612
(The weather is perfect for fishing.)

1142
00:53:14,612 --> 00:53:19,612
Today, I'll try to catch rubber, rudderfish.

1143
00:53:19,713 --> 00:53:22,782
- Rubber. - Why do you keep saying rubber?

1144
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,353
- Do you have any memory with it? - Why do I keep saying that?

1145
00:53:24,353 --> 00:53:25,822
Rudderfish fishing.

1146
00:53:26,822 --> 00:53:30,293
From what I read just now, it neither lives on top nor bottom,

1147
00:53:30,293 --> 00:53:33,563
but it lives in the middle level of the sea.

1148
00:53:33,932 --> 00:53:37,362
The middle of the sea.

1149
00:53:38,403 --> 00:53:41,603
(Today's goal is the representative fish of Jeju's sea, )

1150
00:53:41,603 --> 00:53:44,373
(rudderfish.)

1151
00:53:46,472 --> 00:53:49,572
(It shines like silk under the sunlight.)

1152
00:53:50,643 --> 00:53:53,012
(The fish is loved by fishermen who visit Jeju...)

1153
00:53:53,012 --> 00:53:56,382
(as the best fish for sashimi.)

1154
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:59,353
(Due to its sensitive nature, it turns into dark blue on land.)

1155
00:54:00,523 --> 00:54:04,523
(So it is called the sea's black knight.)

1156
00:54:05,222 --> 00:54:06,963
(It is sensitive and strong, )

1157
00:54:06,963 --> 00:54:09,733
(so it is hard to catch.)

1158
00:54:10,563 --> 00:54:14,032
(But its chewy meat is top-notch.)

1159
00:54:16,032 --> 00:54:18,143
(If it is boiled with gochujang and various vegetables, )

1160
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:21,313
(you can fully enjoy the taste of Jeju sea's deep taste.)

1161
00:54:22,273 --> 00:54:25,412
(They are on the way to catch some.)

1162
00:54:25,412 --> 00:54:28,253
- But I am really curious. - We have 2km more to go.

1163
00:54:28,313 --> 00:54:30,523
I don't think I've ever caught a fish bigger than 20cm!

1164
00:54:30,523 --> 00:54:31,552
20cm?

1165
00:54:31,552 --> 00:54:32,583
I've never caught a fish...

1166
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:33,853
- that big either. - What about the one before?

1167
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:36,492
- Even that didn't exceed 20cm. - That's right.

1168
00:54:37,463 --> 00:54:38,963
How big was the one I caught back then?

1169
00:54:39,362 --> 00:54:42,833
What do you mean? You didn't catch anything.

1170
00:54:42,992 --> 00:54:44,403
I'm asking because I can't remember.

1171
00:54:44,403 --> 00:54:45,403
Exactly, you can't remember...

1172
00:54:45,403 --> 00:54:47,032
- because you didn't catch any. - Just in case.

- Gosh, behind your smile, - Of course.

1177

He's aiming for a twist.

- He's already planning it. - He's aiming for a twist.

1182

- He's already... - Hee Won who said he won't catch...

1183
00:55:09,592 --> 00:55:13,092
He's planning a twist since yesterday.

No, Dong Il. I can't win you on your birthday.

(I'm so thankful that I'm tearing up.)

1187
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:23,103
If he really catches one,

1188
00:55:23,273 --> 00:55:25,543
then he will let it go in front of me.

1189
00:55:25,643 --> 00:55:28,412
- Release it. - Showing off like this.

1190
00:55:29,342 --> 00:55:30,912
Oops, I dropped it.

1191

Gosh, how can I drop it?

1193
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:40,923
There is a thing called best of three. You will lose badly today.

Who do you think will catch the biggest fish?

1196
00:55:45,623 --> 00:55:47,333
- Jin Goo! Jin Goo. - Is it hard to choose?

1197
00:55:47,463 --> 00:55:49,333
Jin Goo has good luck with fish as well.

1198
00:55:50,362 --> 00:55:51,632
From his previous fishing...

1199
00:55:51,632 --> 00:55:53,373
I'm really not confident today.

1200
00:55:53,702 --> 00:55:55,503
No, he's planning for it as well.

Your competitive side is turned on, right?

Now that we're nearing the battlefield,

1203

I'm starting to feel fluttered.

We're here.

Are we going to conquer the sea?

- We're going to the sea again. - Gosh.

- The view... - The scenery is good.

Yes, the scenery is amazing.

- Exactly. - Feels like my heart is unblocked.

I'm looking forward to fishing.

1247
00:57:50,382 --> 00:57:52,923
I hope I can catch a 50cm fish.

00:57:56,923 --> 00:57:58,123
of the sharp edges on top...

1250
00:57:58,123 --> 00:58:01,333
Hee Won, say something. You seem to be tense.

1251
00:58:02,262 --> 00:58:03,333
I'm not.

No matter what happens,

1254
00:58:07,202 --> 00:58:09,702
let's take Hee Won down a peg.

1255
00:58:09,873 --> 00:58:12,673
He's become way too triumphant.

1256
00:58:14,543 --> 00:58:17,313
Today, you'll be doing drift fishing.

1257
00:58:17,313 --> 00:58:18,583
- I see. - Here.

1258
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:21,313
The difficulty level is high.

1259
00:58:21,313 --> 00:58:23,353
I see, it suits me then.

1260
00:58:23,353 --> 00:58:24,853
Yes, you're right.

1261
00:58:24,952 --> 00:58:27,693
- It's for people with experience. - Yes.

1262
00:58:28,222 --> 00:58:30,023
Drift fishing literally means...

1263
00:58:30,023 --> 00:58:32,722
- The line... - The line needs to drift that way.

1264
00:58:32,822 --> 00:58:34,992
Then it will drift away...

1265
00:58:34,992 --> 00:58:35,992
- diagonally like this. - I see.

1266
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:37,003
(The fishing line will drift away following the tide.)

1267
00:58:37,802 --> 00:58:40,903
For now, it will only drift away at the speed of the tide.

1268
00:58:41,072 --> 00:58:44,702
And suddenly, it will move very quickly as if something's wrong.

1269
00:58:44,802 --> 00:58:46,702
Because the fish bites it and swims away.

1270
00:58:46,702 --> 00:58:48,912
So the fishing today will depend on...

1271
00:58:48,912 --> 00:58:51,813
who can drift the line better.

1272
00:58:52,342 --> 00:58:54,313
This is pretty difficult.

1273
00:58:54,853 --> 00:58:56,612
- It's difficult. - It's difficult.

1274
00:58:56,612 --> 00:58:58,782
- Like this... - It's not easy.

1275
00:58:59,552 --> 00:59:01,423
I'll give you some bait.

1276
00:59:02,592 --> 00:59:05,222
Grab your fishing rod each.

1277
00:59:06,023 --> 00:59:07,733
It's not easy.

1278
00:59:08,293 --> 00:59:11,103
This really won't be easy.

1279
00:59:11,733 --> 00:59:12,963
- Hee Won. - Yes?

1280
00:59:12,963 --> 00:59:14,432
Stay alert.

1281
00:59:15,373 --> 00:59:18,603
(Full of enthusiasm)

1282
00:59:19,242 --> 00:59:20,512
I want to catch one!

1283
00:59:20,673 --> 00:59:23,043
I want to catch rudderfish while looking at Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak!

1284
00:59:25,342 --> 00:59:27,353
But it keeps going down, how strange.

1285
00:59:27,353 --> 00:59:28,452
(The line keeps going down.)

1286
00:59:29,112 --> 00:59:30,882
The tide is so fast.

1287
00:59:30,882 --> 00:59:31,983
(The moment it enters the water, the line drifts away very fast.)

1288
00:59:32,282 --> 00:59:34,523
I can't differentiate if something's caught or not.

1289
00:59:34,523 --> 00:59:36,123
(Is this the tide or the fish?)

1290
00:59:36,423 --> 00:59:37,893
It drifts away so fast.

1291
00:59:39,123 --> 00:59:40,162
(Confused)

1292
00:59:40,162 --> 00:59:41,262
No.

1293
00:59:42,063 --> 00:59:44,032
Why does mine drift away so well, Hee Won?

1294
00:59:44,032 --> 00:59:46,833
Pardon? Isn't it good for the line to drift away well?

1295
00:59:48,072 --> 00:59:49,072
Is it?

1296
00:59:49,072 --> 00:59:50,543
(Is it?)

1297
00:59:51,173 --> 00:59:54,313
I don't even know how long the line is in.

1298
00:59:54,313 --> 00:59:56,072
The tide is so fast.

1299
00:59:56,072 --> 00:59:57,242
(It's hard to figure out just with the line.)

1300
00:59:57,242 --> 00:59:59,713
I shouldn't get fooled by the fast tide.

1301
01:00:00,512 --> 01:00:03,353
It's difficult. I have no idea how to do this.

1302
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:04,623
(While everyone is lost...)

1303
01:00:06,023 --> 01:00:08,023
(He quickly lifts it.)

1304
01:00:08,793 --> 01:00:09,893
Did you feel it?

1305
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,762
It's quite heavy, my goodness.

1306
01:00:13,222 --> 01:00:14,932
I think you caught it!

1307
01:00:14,932 --> 01:00:16,162
(Looking forward)

1308
01:00:16,432 --> 01:00:18,262
What does it feel like? Gosh.

1309
01:00:18,262 --> 01:00:19,463
(The fishing rod bends strongly!)

1310
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,202
Oh, I got it!

1311
01:00:21,773 --> 01:00:23,432
I got it!

1312
01:00:23,742 --> 01:00:25,742
- I got it! - Pull it here.

1313
01:00:26,972 --> 01:00:29,612
(The unknown fish flaps at the end of the line.)

1314
01:00:30,512 --> 01:00:32,713
Just pull it up and reel in.

1315
01:00:32,882 --> 01:00:35,713
- I caught it! - You did it!

1316
01:00:35,782 --> 01:00:37,322
- What? - I got it!

1317
01:00:37,322 --> 01:00:39,583
- You did! - I got it!

1318
01:00:40,822 --> 01:00:41,992
I caught it.

1319
01:00:41,992 --> 01:00:43,592
(Envious)

1320
01:00:43,862 --> 01:00:45,293
- He got the first fish. - Goodness!

1321
01:00:45,293 --> 01:00:47,162
First fish!

1322
01:00:47,762 --> 01:00:50,362
I'm so envious. It's quite big.

1323
01:00:50,362 --> 01:00:51,702
(A big fish right from the start)

1324
01:00:52,503 --> 01:00:54,103
I caught it!

1325
01:00:54,103 --> 01:00:55,773
(The fish shows off its jade color.)

1326
01:00:56,673 --> 01:00:59,273
When the line seemed to drift away super fast just now...

1327
01:00:59,273 --> 01:01:01,342
- That's when I caught it, right? - Yes, that means you caught it.

1328
01:01:01,443 --> 01:01:03,072
- Is this a rudderfish? - Pardon?

1329
01:01:03,273 --> 01:01:05,612
- Is this a rudderfish? - It's a long-finned rudderfish.

1330
01:01:05,612 --> 01:01:06,882
- Really? - If you look here,

1331
01:01:06,882 --> 01:01:08,182
I caught a rudderfish!

1332
01:01:08,182 --> 01:01:09,912
- you can see the black stripes. - Amazing.

1333
01:01:10,483 --> 01:01:11,483
Amazing.

1334
01:01:11,483 --> 01:01:12,523
(It's rudderfish?)

1335
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:15,793
Amazing! Then I just need to repeat what I did just now, right?

1336
01:01:15,793 --> 01:01:16,793
The same, yes.

1337
01:01:17,023 --> 01:01:19,423
(Si Wan is full of joy from his first catch, )

1338
01:01:19,693 --> 01:01:21,932
(but Dong Il and Hee Won can't even celebrate with him...)

1339
01:01:21,932 --> 01:01:23,233
(and are way too quiet.)

1340
01:01:25,262 --> 01:01:26,463
Are you all right?

1341
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:31,673
I think both Dong Il and I are having motion sickness.

1342
01:01:31,673 --> 01:01:32,873
- Really? - Yes.

1343
01:01:32,873 --> 01:01:34,443
You should go and rest.

1344
01:01:34,443 --> 01:01:38,282
You were resting because of motion sickness.

1345
01:01:39,182 --> 01:01:41,983
(Groaning)

1346
01:01:43,653 --> 01:01:46,952
(Their expressions...)

1347
01:01:46,952 --> 01:01:49,952
(slowly worsen.)

1348
01:01:50,793 --> 01:01:53,222
(Looking sad)

1349
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,162
(For today, )

1350
01:01:56,162 --> 01:01:58,733
(I will show you what a big fish looks like.)

1351
01:01:59,103 --> 01:02:02,003
(He really wanted to do well today.)

1352
01:02:02,333 --> 01:02:04,242
(I'll have to know about it to not catch it.)

1353
01:02:04,373 --> 01:02:06,972
(But I just catch it as soon as I put the line in the water.)

1354
01:02:07,242 --> 01:02:08,313
(Fisher King is not blessed with luck today.)

1355
01:02:08,313 --> 01:02:10,512
(Pitiful)

1356
01:02:10,912 --> 01:02:15,782
(They were too arrogant just a few minutes ago.)

1357
01:02:16,713 --> 01:02:20,293
(They reflect on their actions.)

1358
01:02:20,923 --> 01:02:22,193
(Forget about a big catch.)

1359
01:02:22,393 --> 01:02:24,393
(Knocked out)

1360
01:02:25,123 --> 01:02:28,262
(Lonely)

1361
01:02:29,032 --> 01:02:31,532
- Are you about to die? - Yes.

1362
01:02:31,532 --> 01:02:33,503
This is my first time having motion sickness on the boat as well.

1363
01:02:33,503 --> 01:02:35,972
(Two confident men are knocked out by motion sickness.)

1364
01:02:36,532 --> 01:02:39,503
(Worried)

1365
01:02:40,202 --> 01:02:41,612
Are they having a hard time?

1366
01:02:42,313 --> 01:02:43,612
Let me check.

1367
01:02:45,882 --> 01:02:48,512
(They are indeed having a hard time.)

1368
01:02:49,412 --> 01:02:52,023
(What should we do?)

1369
01:02:53,523 --> 01:02:54,952
Let's continue for now, Jin Goo!

1370
01:02:55,793 --> 01:02:58,492
There's not enough sashimi with just one fish.

1371
01:02:59,862 --> 01:03:02,032
It's better to catch more fish.

1372
01:03:02,032 --> 01:03:03,032
(They decide to catch one more in Dong Il and Hee Won's places!)

1373
01:03:03,563 --> 01:03:07,103
Let's catch a lot of fish!

1374
01:03:08,032 --> 01:03:10,773
(Passionate...)

1375
01:03:10,773 --> 01:03:13,202
(reeling)

1376
01:03:13,503 --> 01:03:14,742
(Sighing)

1377
01:03:14,742 --> 01:03:17,382
(Worried)

1378
01:03:17,682 --> 01:03:18,842
(Gosh.)

1379
01:03:18,943 --> 01:03:21,353
(We need to quickly catch one.)

1380
01:03:22,012 --> 01:03:23,483
(Please, just one more!)

1381
01:03:23,483 --> 01:03:24,552
Let's do this.

1382
01:03:25,322 --> 01:03:27,623
Just two more blind fish.

1383
01:03:27,623 --> 01:03:28,623
(They have become impatient because of the elder two's conditions.)

1384
01:03:28,923 --> 01:03:29,952
Please.

1385
01:03:29,952 --> 01:03:30,963
(Please get caught!)

1386
01:03:31,623 --> 01:03:35,563
(Completely focused on the fishing rod)

1387
01:03:35,963 --> 01:03:38,733
Please bite, please bite!

1388
01:03:42,273 --> 01:03:43,273
Did you get it?

1389
01:03:44,043 --> 01:03:45,773
There's something!

1390
01:03:47,213 --> 01:03:50,342
There's something! I can feel the weight constantly.

1391
01:03:50,342 --> 01:03:51,342
(Dong Il came to watch as well.)

1392
01:03:51,943 --> 01:03:54,483
Is there really something? I wonder what it is.

1393
01:03:54,583 --> 01:03:55,583
There's something.

1394
01:03:56,713 --> 01:03:58,483
I can feel the weight constantly.

1395
01:03:58,483 --> 01:03:59,782
(Desperate)

1396
01:04:00,653 --> 01:04:02,092
- I got it! - You caught it!

1397
01:04:03,092 --> 01:04:05,123
(Yes, I got it!)

1398
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:09,032
(As if to answer to their hard work, the fish makes its appearance.)

1399
01:04:09,233 --> 01:04:11,262
It's bigger than the previous one!

1400
01:04:11,532 --> 01:04:12,662
You caught a big one!

1401
01:04:14,072 --> 01:04:15,572
Si Wan is good.

1402
01:04:15,572 --> 01:04:16,873
(Huge)

1403
01:04:17,302 --> 01:04:21,443
(The rudderfish is bigger than the first one!)

1404
01:04:21,673 --> 01:04:25,083
I caught it! We have enough for sashimi at least.

1405
01:04:25,842 --> 01:04:28,612
- Good job. - Thank you.

1406
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:33,083
Today's second rudderfish.

1407
01:04:33,753 --> 01:04:35,552
Si Wan caught two.

1408
01:04:35,552 --> 01:04:38,862
Today is Si Wan's day. Good job, guys.

1409
01:04:39,592 --> 01:04:41,132
Should we head back then?

1410
01:04:42,793 --> 01:04:46,503
(Are we going back home?)

1411
01:04:47,702 --> 01:04:50,202
Today was supposed to be a match between Hee Won and me,

1412
01:04:50,443 --> 01:04:51,943
but we're both knocked out by motion sickness.

1413
01:04:51,943 --> 01:04:53,103
(It's too bad, but they leave behind their dream to catch big fish...)

1414
01:04:54,273 --> 01:04:57,143
(and come back home early.)

1415
01:04:57,912 --> 01:05:03,213
(They try to recover from the aftermath of fishing.)

1416
01:05:03,782 --> 01:05:05,552
I think I'll be fine after 30 minutes.

1417
01:05:05,552 --> 01:05:09,592
Okay! Rest well. Don't do anything, just rest well.

1418
01:05:10,023 --> 01:05:12,862
I normally don't have motion sickness.

1419
01:05:13,423 --> 01:05:17,233
This is my first time giving the fish my everything.

1420
01:05:17,802 --> 01:05:20,162
(Rest well, guys.)

1421
01:05:21,333 --> 01:05:24,572
(While they recover from the motion sickness...)

1422
01:05:24,773 --> 01:05:27,512
You are the ones who ordered whatever menu the chef wants,

1423
01:05:27,512 --> 01:05:28,612
- right? - Yes.

1424
01:05:29,173 --> 01:05:30,713
We'll serve you a customized dish.

1425
01:05:30,713 --> 01:05:31,713
Okay.

1426
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:34,282
(They are worried about it.)

1427
01:05:34,782 --> 01:05:37,583
(Will they be fine on their own?)

1428
01:05:38,052 --> 01:05:40,753
(But with overflowing enthusiasm, he wears the apron.)

1429
01:05:41,822 --> 01:05:44,492
(He opens the box to check their catch.)

1430
01:05:44,923 --> 01:05:47,233
(Let me see.)

1431
01:05:50,362 --> 01:05:53,233
(They only have three rudderfish, including one given by the captain.)

1432
01:05:54,972 --> 01:05:56,903
These guys...

1433
01:05:58,773 --> 01:06:02,112
(He takes them out first.)

1434
01:06:02,943 --> 01:06:04,282
(What should I cook to help Dong Il and Hee Won feel better?)

1435
01:06:04,282 --> 01:06:06,112
(Thinking carefully)

1436
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:09,583
(How to cook rudderfish deliciously)

1437
01:06:10,182 --> 01:06:11,623
(They are working hard.)

1438
01:06:11,623 --> 01:06:14,923
Since we caught the fish, let's make sashimi...

1439
01:06:16,052 --> 01:06:20,532
Then Jin Goo, I'll cook spicy fish stew.

1440
01:06:21,262 --> 01:06:23,432
You can prepare the vegetables.

1441
01:06:24,032 --> 01:06:25,032
Okay!

1442
01:06:26,262 --> 01:06:29,403
(Shall we start now?)

1443
01:06:31,003 --> 01:06:34,873
(Jin Goo removes the rudderfish's scales first.)

1444
01:06:37,043 --> 01:06:39,912
Where did you learn to prepare a fish?

1445
01:06:40,713 --> 01:06:43,052
- YouTube. - YouTube?

1446
01:06:43,412 --> 01:06:46,253
Right. YouTube is really...

1447
01:06:46,952 --> 01:06:49,923
- Yes, it's a teacher. - a great teacher.

1448
01:06:50,353 --> 01:06:51,623
(Staring)

1449
01:06:51,623 --> 01:06:53,293
I'll help you guys in 30 minutes.

1450
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:55,063
It's okay!

1451
01:06:55,063 --> 01:06:56,963
You don't have to.

1452
01:06:56,963 --> 01:06:58,503
(Hee Won is concerned about them even as he's feeling unwell.)

1453
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:01,103
(Just leave everything to us.)

1454
01:07:03,673 --> 01:07:07,572
How can you prepare so well from just watching YouTube?

1455
01:07:08,912 --> 01:07:12,182
(Once he washes it cleanly with flowing water, )

1456
01:07:13,813 --> 01:07:15,182
(he's ready to remove the bones!)

1457
01:07:15,182 --> 01:07:16,452
Let's cut the meat.

1458
01:07:16,452 --> 01:07:18,083
(He's ready to remove the bones!)

1459
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:20,893
I'll prepare spicy fish stew now.

1460
01:07:22,722 --> 01:07:26,193
Homemade doenjang, it was somewhere here.

1461
01:07:27,893 --> 01:07:31,063
(They are doing their best to recover.)

1462
01:07:32,003 --> 01:07:34,032
Found it, homemade doenjang.

1463
01:07:34,032 --> 01:07:36,233
(First, he takes out the homemade doenjang that Dong Il likes.)

1464
01:07:37,403 --> 01:07:38,403
Soy sauce.

1465
01:07:42,512 --> 01:07:47,483
(He gathers all the ingredients he needs.)

1466
01:07:47,483 --> 01:07:48,682
Here you go.

1467
01:07:49,052 --> 01:07:50,682
(He starts making the sauce for spicy fish stew...)

1468
01:07:50,682 --> 01:07:52,453
(to make Dong Il and Hee Won feel better.)

1469
01:07:53,353 --> 01:07:56,922
(He measures every ingredient accurately!)

1470
01:07:57,592 --> 01:08:01,132
(He adds crushed garlic and his effort.)

1471
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:03,262
This much of homemade doenjang.

1472
01:08:03,262 --> 01:08:04,762
(Once he adds homemade doenjang for the savory taste, )

1473
01:08:06,163 --> 01:08:10,132
(the spicy sauce is ready.)

1474
01:08:11,143 --> 01:08:13,703
(Let me taste it.)

1475
01:08:17,212 --> 01:08:19,913
- Jin Goo... - Yes?

1476
01:08:20,483 --> 01:08:21,953
The spicy fish stew...

1477
01:08:23,382 --> 01:08:25,523
Try tasting the sauce later.

1478
01:08:26,153 --> 01:08:28,552
(I will, Si Wan.)

1479
01:08:29,523 --> 01:08:34,132
(While they are trying their best to cook dinner, )

1480
01:08:34,132 --> 01:08:36,932
(it starts raining outside.)

1481
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:41,703
(Dong Il and Hee Won still look unwell.)

1482
01:08:41,903 --> 01:08:45,443
(Looking ill)

1483
01:08:45,703 --> 01:08:49,243
I think we tried too hard to catch the fish.

1484
01:08:49,243 --> 01:08:51,643
The swelling waves were bad today.

1485
01:08:52,643 --> 01:08:55,752
(They are still sick.)

1486
01:08:57,113 --> 01:09:00,023
(In the end, he lies down.)

1487
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,853
They must be feeling really unwell.

1488
01:09:05,792 --> 01:09:06,962
Should I cut the meat first?

1489
01:09:07,592 --> 01:09:08,592
Sure.

1490
01:09:09,063 --> 01:09:10,092
(He takes the knife.)

1491
01:09:10,092 --> 01:09:11,103
This...

1492
01:09:14,832 --> 01:09:16,502
How did I do it? I forgot.

1493
01:09:16,502 --> 01:09:18,002
(He starts separating the meat from bones nervously.)

1494
01:09:19,372 --> 01:09:23,672
(He recollects his memory and proceeds step by step.)

1495
01:09:27,853 --> 01:09:33,283
(He carefully separates the meat from bones.)

1496
01:09:35,552 --> 01:09:37,393
(Groaning)

1497
01:09:38,393 --> 01:09:41,462
(The meat is so bouncy.)

1498
01:09:41,733 --> 01:09:44,533
(He tries to cut it with force.)

1499
01:09:46,332 --> 01:09:49,372
(He managed to separate them with effort.)

1500
01:09:49,872 --> 01:09:51,603
The spicy fish stew should taste great.

1501
01:09:52,472 --> 01:09:53,943
Because there's so much meat.

1502
01:09:54,672 --> 01:09:56,813
There's so much meat stuck here.

1503
01:09:56,813 --> 01:09:58,913
(Meat stuck on the bones that will be used for the stew)

1504
01:09:59,113 --> 01:10:01,682
(It is not as easy as it seems.)

1505
01:10:01,953 --> 01:10:04,252
This is still great.

1506
01:10:07,153 --> 01:10:08,153
One is done.

1507
01:10:10,052 --> 01:10:13,393
(The meat for sashimi that he carefully prepared...)

1508
01:10:13,393 --> 01:10:16,962
(goes to age in the fridge for savoriness.)

1509
01:10:18,063 --> 01:10:20,663
(Meanwhile, Si Wan starts cooking spicy fish stew.)

1510
01:10:21,672 --> 01:10:24,672
(He adds radish first for the refreshing taste.)

1511
01:10:24,872 --> 01:10:27,203
Can I put the whole thing in the stew?

1512
01:10:27,203 --> 01:10:29,042
I think you need to wash it first before putting it in.

1513
01:10:29,042 --> 01:10:30,613
- Do I need to wash it once? - Yes.

1514
01:10:30,613 --> 01:10:31,613
(Got it.)

1515
01:10:33,012 --> 01:10:35,613
(To add the taste to the soup, )

1516
01:10:35,613 --> 01:10:38,983
(he adds rudderfish bones.)

1517
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:41,922
(He adds the generous amount of vegetables...)

1518
01:10:41,922 --> 01:10:43,393
(such as zucchini and onions...)

1519
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:47,893
(and adds a lot of spicy sauce he made with care.)

1520
01:10:49,163 --> 01:10:51,962
(Mix well.)

1521
01:10:52,363 --> 01:10:54,773
(How is it going?)

1522
01:10:55,733 --> 01:10:57,672
I hope the spicy fish stew turns out fine.

1523
01:10:59,203 --> 01:11:01,842
(He is worried about cooking without Chef Sung, )

1524
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:03,913
It looks really delicious.

1525
01:11:03,913 --> 01:11:06,182
(but he doesn't forget to encourage Jin Goo in between.)

1526
01:11:07,413 --> 01:11:08,413
How is it going?

1527
01:11:08,853 --> 01:11:10,752
Thankfully, we have all the ingredients,

1528
01:11:11,483 --> 01:11:13,082
so we can work on it easily.

1529
01:11:13,882 --> 01:11:16,292
(I should quickly get a grip and help them!)

1530
01:11:18,422 --> 01:11:21,792
(Dong Il wakes up just in time.)

1531
01:11:22,332 --> 01:11:23,332
Are you okay?

1532
01:11:24,233 --> 01:11:25,603
Yes, I got better.

1533
01:11:26,932 --> 01:11:27,972
(How are they doing?)

1534
01:11:27,972 --> 01:11:29,172
(He immediately starts worrying about Si Wan and Jin Goo.)

1535
01:11:29,172 --> 01:11:31,502
What would we have done without Si Wan and Jin Goo?

1536
01:11:32,243 --> 01:11:33,842
We're getting well-treated today.

1537
01:11:34,512 --> 01:11:36,372
I'm honestly not sure about the taste.

1538
01:11:36,472 --> 01:11:38,382
We can't guarantee the taste.

1539
01:11:39,182 --> 01:11:40,682
I'm not sure about the taste.

1540
01:11:40,682 --> 01:11:42,953
(Hee Won and Dong Il are proud of Si Wan and Jin Goo.)

1541
01:11:42,953 --> 01:11:44,353
It's been so long since I prepared raw fish.

1542
01:11:45,422 --> 01:11:48,052
(He finishes cleaning the last fish.)

1543
01:11:48,422 --> 01:11:50,693
(Washing it with water)

1544
01:11:51,122 --> 01:11:52,222
We're out of water.

1545
01:11:53,262 --> 01:11:54,832
(Flustered)

1546
01:11:55,592 --> 01:11:57,363
There's no water?

1547
01:11:58,462 --> 01:12:00,132
(Then...)

1548
01:12:00,132 --> 01:12:02,802
(They get up right away.)

1549
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:07,403
(They set off to add more water.)

1550
01:12:08,012 --> 01:12:09,643
Gosh, I should come to myself.

1551
01:12:10,342 --> 01:12:11,443
Let me hold it.

1552
01:12:13,012 --> 01:12:15,582
(Struggling)

1553
01:12:17,783 --> 01:12:19,483
(Jin Goo can use water now thanks to Hee Won and Dong Il.)

1554
01:12:19,483 --> 01:12:20,823
Thank you, guys!

1555
01:12:21,922 --> 01:12:24,962
(We should do this for you at least.)

1556
01:12:26,893 --> 01:12:29,462
Should we just go outside and boil this?

1557
01:12:29,462 --> 01:12:32,203
We should use high heat...

1558
01:12:32,203 --> 01:12:33,432
to boil this.

1559
01:12:35,472 --> 01:12:36,603
(You're going to boil it outside?)

1560
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:37,603
Let's add this first.

1561
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:38,972
You should bring the portable stove.

1562
01:12:38,972 --> 01:12:41,243
We should boil the stew outside as it needs to boil hard.

1563
01:12:41,243 --> 01:12:43,472
(They set off to get the portable stove.)

1564
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:47,483
(They're not fully recovered, but he helps Si Wan and Jin Goo.)

1565
01:12:47,512 --> 01:12:50,052
(Heave-ho)

1566
01:12:50,052 --> 01:12:52,582
- Are we eating outside today? - Let's eat outside.

1567
01:12:53,983 --> 01:12:58,592
(They're setting up the table as Si Wan and Jin Goo cook.)

1568
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:01,393
(They must be feeling better now.)

1569
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:03,993
You only need to boil this hard now.

1570
01:13:04,363 --> 01:13:05,962
Si Wan seasoned the broth well.

1571
01:13:08,672 --> 01:13:13,243
(Safely filmed with permission from the landowner.)

1572
01:13:13,243 --> 01:13:15,613
We need to boil it for quite a bit.

1573
01:13:16,073 --> 01:13:18,182
I think the soup will be nice.

1574
01:13:18,712 --> 01:13:20,783
(Dong Il tastes the soup.)

1575
01:13:22,052 --> 01:13:23,182
It only needs to boil down.

1576
01:13:23,582 --> 01:13:25,222
How is it, Dong Il?

1577
01:13:25,382 --> 01:13:27,622
It's not bad. Good work, Si Wan.

1578
01:13:27,622 --> 01:13:29,453
(It's good.)

1579
01:13:29,622 --> 01:13:31,663
(He's relieved.)

1580
01:13:31,893 --> 01:13:34,063
(I'll do the finishing touch.)

1581
01:13:34,962 --> 01:13:39,132
(Adding salt to season it one last time)

1582
01:13:41,073 --> 01:13:42,172
I'll hold it.

1583
01:13:44,802 --> 01:13:48,743
(Adding lots of scallions together)

1584
01:13:51,143 --> 01:13:52,413
- That's enough. - Okay.

1585
01:13:52,413 --> 01:13:54,313
(They finish up the stew instead of Si Wan.)

1586
01:13:54,313 --> 01:13:55,882
Should I add this now?

1587
01:13:55,882 --> 01:13:58,082
We should add water parsley later with bean sprouts.

1588
01:13:58,453 --> 01:13:59,682
We can add it at the end.

1589
01:13:59,682 --> 01:14:01,292
(The spicy fish stew is almost done.)

1590
01:14:02,693 --> 01:14:06,523
(Meanwhile, Jin Goo, who's in charge of sashimi, )

1591
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:11,203
(carefully prepares it.)

1592
01:14:13,403 --> 01:14:15,302
(Slipping)

1593
01:14:16,033 --> 01:14:18,802
(It seems like he's doing it well, )

1594
01:14:19,643 --> 01:14:20,943
(but he slips again.)

1595
01:14:20,943 --> 01:14:22,643
It's so hard to peel the skin.

1596
01:14:24,012 --> 01:14:26,212
(It's so hard to peel the skin.)

1597
01:14:27,182 --> 01:14:29,283
(Shouting)

1598
01:14:31,582 --> 01:14:34,082
(He peels it off with his teeth clenched.)

1599
01:14:34,823 --> 01:14:36,893
(Let's see.)

1600
01:14:37,622 --> 01:14:39,762
(Flopping down)

1601
01:14:39,762 --> 01:14:40,823
What's wrong?

1602
01:14:43,462 --> 01:14:46,002
Let me see, Jin Goo. What's wrong?

1603
01:14:46,863 --> 01:14:49,302
No, no. You did it right. You peeled it okay.

1604
01:14:49,603 --> 01:14:50,802
You're doing well.

1605
01:14:50,802 --> 01:14:52,143
I lost this much.

1606
01:14:52,703 --> 01:14:53,872
It'll be fine if you peel it off.

1607
01:14:53,972 --> 01:14:56,913
- I'm panicking. I lost this much. - We still have plenty of time.

1608
01:14:56,913 --> 01:14:58,783
It's okay, it's okay.

1609
01:14:59,082 --> 01:15:00,582
Gosh, this is so hard.

1610
01:15:00,582 --> 01:15:02,983
(As Si Wan cheers him on...)

1611
01:15:03,382 --> 01:15:04,382
It's really hard...

1612
01:15:04,382 --> 01:15:05,382
(He removes the rest of its skin.)

1613
01:15:05,382 --> 01:15:06,953
to peel off rudderfish.

1614
01:15:08,953 --> 01:15:13,323
(He cuts each piece with much care.)

1615
01:15:14,663 --> 01:15:16,993
(Fully concentrating)

1616
01:15:18,063 --> 01:15:22,332
(It's looking like sashimi now.)

1617
01:15:22,903 --> 01:15:24,073
Jin Goo, you're amazing.

1618
01:15:24,073 --> 01:15:25,203
(You're doing great, Jin Goo.)

1619
01:15:26,672 --> 01:15:27,913
He's pretty good.

1620
01:15:28,212 --> 01:15:29,443
You're going great.

1621
01:15:29,443 --> 01:15:30,842
(The rudderfish sashimi is done.)

1622
01:15:30,872 --> 01:15:31,882
I hope you'll meet someone...

1623
01:15:32,582 --> 01:15:35,212
who's better at preparing sashimi next time.

1624
01:15:38,353 --> 01:15:39,523
Well done, Jin Goo.

1625
01:15:39,523 --> 01:15:40,523
(He's proud of Jin Goo.)

1626
01:15:41,393 --> 01:15:43,252
Are you feeling better now?

1627
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:44,993
- Yes, I'm okay now. - That's a relief.

1628
01:15:45,422 --> 01:15:49,092
(Hee Won and Dong Il recover thanks to Si Wan and Jin Goo's care.)

1629
01:15:49,533 --> 01:15:52,403
(Piling one by one)

1630
01:15:52,563 --> 01:15:53,603
(The dinner is getting ready.)

1631
01:15:53,603 --> 01:15:55,033
It looks so good.

1632
01:15:55,802 --> 01:15:57,273
It's really firm.

1633
01:15:57,533 --> 01:15:59,703
- Really? - The meat is really firm.

1634
01:16:00,143 --> 01:16:04,172
(Si Wan sits in the corner...)

1635
01:16:04,443 --> 01:16:07,682
(and chops garlic to have with rudderfish sashimi.)

1636
01:16:08,512 --> 01:16:10,382
(They do their own parts without anyone telling them to.)

1637
01:16:10,382 --> 01:16:13,182
- This is what a family looks like. - That's right.

1638
01:16:13,182 --> 01:16:14,323
(They do their own parts without anyone telling them to.)

1639
01:16:16,092 --> 01:16:21,063
(The sun sets over the horizon, and the darkness falls.)

1640
01:16:21,632 --> 01:16:23,033
- It's all set. - Okay.

1641
01:16:23,363 --> 01:16:25,762
Here. Everything is ready, right?

1642
01:16:25,802 --> 01:16:27,563
We just need to bring spoons and chopsticks. right?

1643
01:16:28,172 --> 01:16:29,203
Okay.

1644
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:32,443
My, it looks so good.

1645
01:16:32,443 --> 01:16:35,243
(A dinner feast prepared with much love)

1646
01:16:35,712 --> 01:16:37,413
- This is the fish we caught, right? - Yes.

1647
01:16:37,413 --> 01:16:39,643
- Si Wan caught it. - Yes, the one Si Wan caught.

1648
01:16:40,483 --> 01:16:41,953
Help yourselves.

1649
01:16:42,783 --> 01:16:44,953
(Is he not going to eat?)

1650
01:16:46,722 --> 01:16:49,422
(Si Wan gives a piece to Dong Il who isn't feeling well.)

1651
01:16:49,853 --> 01:16:52,523
(Jin Goo is a bit nervous as he prepared the sashimi.)

1652
01:16:53,823 --> 01:16:56,363
(This is good.)

1653
01:16:56,863 --> 01:16:58,563
(He's eating it well.)

1654
01:16:58,563 --> 01:17:00,462
It's so good!

1655
01:17:02,103 --> 01:17:04,002
- Si Wan, it's too bad. - Why?

1656
01:17:04,472 --> 01:17:06,403
I should've caught one for you.

1657
01:17:06,603 --> 01:17:07,802
I know.

1658
01:17:07,802 --> 01:17:09,913
I was able to catch it because you didn't catch it.

1659
01:17:10,273 --> 01:17:12,042
(Chewy)

1660
01:17:12,042 --> 01:17:13,182
(Exclaiming)

1661
01:17:13,783 --> 01:17:15,913
(The rudderfish suits their palate.)

1662
01:17:17,082 --> 01:17:19,353
(Si Wan takes a bite after they have it.)

1663
01:17:19,882 --> 01:17:21,453
So this is how rudderfish sashimi tastes like.

1664
01:17:22,292 --> 01:17:24,762
Jin Goo, you did a good job. There are no bones.

1665
01:17:25,122 --> 01:17:26,363
(Proud)

1666
01:17:26,363 --> 01:17:27,422
I'm relieved.

1667
01:17:28,063 --> 01:17:32,802
(Jin Goo who's relieved now has a bite too.)

1668
01:17:33,533 --> 01:17:35,472
- It's really firm. - Right.

1669
01:17:37,372 --> 01:17:39,542
It's the most expensive sashimi.

1670
01:17:39,542 --> 01:17:40,643
(It's much chewier than other sashimi.)

1671
01:17:40,643 --> 01:17:41,813
It's really rare too.

1672
01:17:43,212 --> 01:17:45,283
I don't have much experience in preparing sashimi,

1673
01:17:45,283 --> 01:17:46,913
but when I cut its flesh,

1674
01:17:48,052 --> 01:17:49,653
it made crisp sounds.

1675
01:17:50,453 --> 01:17:52,323
- It was really firm. - Oh, really?

1676
01:17:53,082 --> 01:17:55,653
I'll make sushi using this.

1677
01:17:56,393 --> 01:17:57,693
Rudderfish sushi?

1678
01:17:58,323 --> 01:17:59,422
That's right.

1679
01:17:59,493 --> 01:18:01,663
You still seem to remember that sushi we had last time.

1680
01:18:01,663 --> 01:18:02,733
(It was delicious.)

1681
01:18:04,193 --> 01:18:08,972
(Dong Il made sushi in the last season too.)

1682
01:18:09,733 --> 01:18:11,342
You don't have to open that wide.

1683
01:18:11,672 --> 01:18:12,743
How is it?

1684
01:18:12,743 --> 01:18:15,273
(It's guaranteed to be delicious.)

1685
01:18:15,813 --> 01:18:18,712
(Look over here.)

1686
01:18:20,382 --> 01:18:23,653
(He even puts on a fancy show.)

1687
01:18:25,983 --> 01:18:33,122
(Dong Il's sushi is both fun and delicious.)

1688
01:18:34,023 --> 01:18:35,893
It's my first time trying it.

1689
01:18:36,393 --> 01:18:38,703
- You've never had it, right? - It's my first time.

1690
01:18:38,703 --> 01:18:39,832
- That's right. - Yes.

1691
01:18:40,502 --> 01:18:44,132
When Dong Il put on a performance on the ship, he was really cool.

1692
01:18:44,132 --> 01:18:46,872
- He put on a show on the ship? - Grab a bit of rice, and...

1693
01:18:46,872 --> 01:18:49,172
(He's going to show off his skills.)

1694
01:18:49,943 --> 01:18:51,813
This is the crucial part.

1695
01:18:52,682 --> 01:18:54,283
- I'm seeing it after a long while. - Yes, it's been a while.

1696
01:18:54,682 --> 01:18:56,483
You need to shake your hand like this.

1697
01:18:56,613 --> 01:18:59,622
This forms a layer of air...

1698
01:19:00,023 --> 01:19:02,193
- A layer of air. - between rice grains.

1699
01:19:03,393 --> 01:19:05,993
(Si Wan is just fascinated.)

1700
01:19:06,622 --> 01:19:07,792
Add a bit of wasabi.

1701
01:19:07,792 --> 01:19:10,733
(Adding a bit of wasabi...)

1702
01:19:10,733 --> 01:19:14,432
(and a big piece of rudderfish sashimi on top)

1703
01:19:15,002 --> 01:19:18,203
(He's shaking it again.)

1704
01:19:18,703 --> 01:19:21,372
(Looking forward)

1705
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:23,472
Let me give it to Si Wan first as he caught the fish.

1706
01:19:23,472 --> 01:19:27,443
(He's giving it to Si Wan who is trying it for the first time.)

1707
01:19:29,212 --> 01:19:31,483
(Eyes going wide)

1708
01:19:31,853 --> 01:19:33,082
It's so good.

1709
01:19:33,082 --> 01:19:34,483
The sushi is good.

1710
01:19:34,483 --> 01:19:36,222
(He keeps exclaiming.)

1711
01:19:37,092 --> 01:19:38,722
Since you're a guest, I'll give you a piece.

1712
01:19:40,722 --> 01:19:42,292
(He gives the second sushi to Jin Goo.)

1713
01:19:42,292 --> 01:19:43,332
Try it.

1714
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:47,533
(Yes, this hits the spot.)

1715
01:19:47,832 --> 01:19:49,002
Is it good?

1716
01:19:49,002 --> 01:19:50,033
(Mouthwatering)

1717
01:19:50,733 --> 01:19:52,243
(Dong Il's sushi is always good.)

1718
01:19:52,243 --> 01:19:54,813
Let's try it.

1719
01:19:55,842 --> 01:19:56,943
I'll give you one.

1720
01:19:56,943 --> 01:19:57,972
(Hee Won is desperate for the sushi.)

1721
01:19:58,813 --> 01:20:00,212
(He also tries a piece after a long wait.)

1722
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:01,512
Natural rudderfish...

1723
01:20:02,082 --> 01:20:03,512
It's really rare.

1724
01:20:03,783 --> 01:20:05,552
(It's indeed nice.)

1725
01:20:05,552 --> 01:20:07,983
We're only tasting it thanks to Si Wan who caught it.

1726
01:20:08,353 --> 01:20:10,993
- Thanks to Si Wan. - Yes, it's thanks to Si Wan.

1727
01:20:11,193 --> 01:20:13,393
- My gosh, it's... - It's really good.

1728
01:20:13,393 --> 01:20:14,733
- Right? - It's really good, right?

1729
01:20:14,733 --> 01:20:16,092
- Yes. - This is...

1730
01:20:16,432 --> 01:20:18,103
much chewier than others.

1731
01:20:18,103 --> 01:20:21,262
It's much firmer than other fish.

1732
01:20:22,103 --> 01:20:23,203
Right?

1733
01:20:24,103 --> 01:20:27,073
The fish Si Wan caught is much firmer.

1734
01:20:27,502 --> 01:20:30,342
- Wow, this is really good! - I think so too.

1735
01:20:30,443 --> 01:20:31,483
It's really good.

1736
01:20:31,483 --> 01:20:33,882
(I caught that fish.)

1737
01:20:34,512 --> 01:20:36,353
I want to have that sushi all night.

1738
01:20:36,353 --> 01:20:37,453
(Si Wan has fallen in love with Dong Il's sushi.)

1739
01:20:38,323 --> 01:20:41,222
That's how everyone reacts when they taste his sushi.

1740
01:20:41,792 --> 01:20:43,153
I'm just waiting for it.

1741
01:20:43,153 --> 01:20:44,153
(Please give me more.)

1742
01:20:44,153 --> 01:20:46,922
- Dong Il, I want more sushi. - Dong Il, I want more sushi.

1743
01:20:47,823 --> 01:20:49,092
I want another piece.

1744
01:20:49,092 --> 01:20:50,092
(You want more sushi?)

1745
01:20:50,563 --> 01:20:53,132
(If it's for Si Wan and Jin Goo...)

1746
01:20:53,533 --> 01:20:57,502
(He moves more dynamically this time.)

1747
01:20:58,172 --> 01:20:59,943
(I hope it turns out to be good.)

1748
01:21:00,203 --> 01:21:03,472
Try it. The sashimi is bigger,

1749
01:21:03,472 --> 01:21:06,882
so I added more rice for better texture.

1750
01:21:07,582 --> 01:21:10,413
(Hee Won has a bite too.)

1751
01:21:11,082 --> 01:21:12,122
My gosh.

1752
01:21:12,122 --> 01:21:13,353
(When Dong Il feeds them sushi, )

1753
01:21:13,353 --> 01:21:16,493
- Thank you. - We're out of rice anyway.

1754
01:21:16,493 --> 01:21:18,393
(their entire face lights up.)

1755
01:21:18,393 --> 01:21:19,592
It's so good!

1756
01:21:20,693 --> 01:21:23,092
(It's so good!)

1757
01:21:23,493 --> 01:21:25,663
(Dong Il's sushi is the best!)

1758
01:21:25,663 --> 01:21:26,903
Did you throw it?

1759
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:28,273
What do you mean?

1760
01:21:28,273 --> 01:21:30,002
- Can I say something? - No, you can't.

1761
01:21:32,273 --> 01:21:34,073
I'm not kidding when I say that I don't eat sashimi.

1762
01:21:34,073 --> 01:21:35,372
- He really doesn't. - He doesn't eat sashimi.

1763
01:21:35,372 --> 01:21:36,712
He doesn't enjoy sashimi.

1764
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:41,752
Because Si Wan caught the fish and Jin Goo prepared it, it's...

1765
01:21:41,752 --> 01:21:43,252
Of course it's incredible.

1766
01:21:43,853 --> 01:21:46,182
You can never taste it elsewhere.

1767
01:21:46,182 --> 01:21:48,122
(The sushi is even tastier as everyone worked hard for it.)

1768
01:21:49,592 --> 01:21:51,762
Now that we're done with sushi, let's have spicy fish stew.

1769
01:21:52,262 --> 01:21:53,292
All right.

1770
01:21:54,323 --> 01:21:58,632
(Dong Il and Hee Won...)

1771
01:21:58,632 --> 01:22:00,832
(try it first.)

1772
01:22:01,302 --> 01:22:03,632
(How is it?)

1773
01:22:05,603 --> 01:22:07,002
I'm feeling a lot better with this.

1774
01:22:07,773 --> 01:22:10,012
Right? It helps you relieve nausea.

1775
01:22:10,913 --> 01:22:13,143
(Today's dishes are all successful.)

1776
01:22:13,143 --> 01:22:14,783
It's so good.

1777
01:22:17,853 --> 01:22:18,983
(Exclaiming)

1778
01:22:21,752 --> 01:22:24,323
(Putting his head down)

1779
01:22:24,863 --> 01:22:27,523
(Putting his head down also)

1780
01:22:28,533 --> 01:22:33,403
(Dong Il and Hee Won's spicy fish stew ASMR)

1781
01:22:33,962 --> 01:22:35,603
(Slurping)

1782
01:22:35,972 --> 01:22:37,172
(Slurping)

1783
01:22:38,443 --> 01:22:44,512
(Is spicy rudderfish stew the best remedy for seasickness?)

1784
01:22:45,313 --> 01:22:48,813
(They couldn't stop eating the stew for a while.)

1785
01:22:49,283 --> 01:22:51,922
Because they added the head of the rudderfish,

1786
01:22:52,382 --> 01:22:54,182
the aftertaste is really refreshing.

1787
01:22:54,182 --> 01:22:58,393
(The aftertaste of the stew is neat and refreshing.)

1788
01:22:58,693 --> 01:22:59,722
Would you like some rice?

1789
01:23:02,563 --> 01:23:04,962
Let's have it as a sushi bowl.

1790
01:23:06,262 --> 01:23:07,403
Let's mix everything in here.

1791
01:23:07,863 --> 01:23:10,273
- You mean sashimi bibimbap? - Yes, that's it. How does it sound?

1792
01:23:10,273 --> 01:23:11,542
- I'd love to. - Really?

1793
01:23:11,542 --> 01:23:12,773
Yes, I'd love to have it.

1794
01:23:12,773 --> 01:23:14,042
Bring the scissors.

1795
01:23:14,042 --> 01:23:16,313
(Chef Sung has fully recovered.)

1796
01:23:16,413 --> 01:23:18,042
- Should I wash some perilla leaves? - Perilla leaves?

1797
01:23:18,042 --> 01:23:20,313
I think we have some that are already washed. Bring them.

1798
01:23:20,313 --> 01:23:24,082
We need to add a bit of vegetable to create an air layer.

1799
01:23:24,252 --> 01:23:26,153
So the rice doesn't stick to each other.

1800
01:23:28,323 --> 01:23:30,422
Sashimi bibimbap is nice with just lettuce alone.

1801
01:23:30,552 --> 01:23:32,323
It's good with vegetables.

1802
01:23:33,493 --> 01:23:35,993
(Adding sweet and sour chojang)

1803
01:23:36,262 --> 01:23:38,063
You don't need to measure it. Add just the right amount.

1804
01:23:38,063 --> 01:23:39,132
(Adding sesame oil that'll add savory flavor)

1805
01:23:39,132 --> 01:23:40,903
It's good even if you don't follow the recipe strictly.

1806
01:23:40,903 --> 01:23:43,672
(Mixing)

1807
01:23:43,733 --> 01:23:47,243
Not many people can have sashimi bibimbap with rudderfish.

1808
01:23:47,243 --> 01:23:48,273
(That's true.)

1809
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:49,842
Get the perilla leaves. This looks great.

1810
01:23:49,943 --> 01:23:52,913
Someone sprinkle some sesame seeds...

1811
01:23:52,913 --> 01:23:54,882
on top.

1812
01:23:56,212 --> 01:23:58,082
Be bold. Be bold when it comes to food.

1813
01:23:58,523 --> 01:24:00,653
Be bold when it comes to food. Don't be flustered.

1814
01:24:01,153 --> 01:24:02,222
That's enough.

1815
01:24:03,092 --> 01:24:05,893
Spread it out and scoop.

1816
01:24:06,592 --> 01:24:07,663
Spread it out.

1817
01:24:09,163 --> 01:24:10,832
Try it. Seriously, try it.

1818
01:24:10,832 --> 01:24:12,663
Hee Won, try it. It's really good.

1819
01:24:12,863 --> 01:24:14,233
Try it with the fish.

1820
01:24:14,233 --> 01:24:15,832
(He takes a spoonful of the fish and rice.)

1821
01:24:15,832 --> 01:24:18,203
It's the best. Try it.

1822
01:24:21,372 --> 01:24:23,773
- My gosh. - It's the best, right?

1823
01:24:25,313 --> 01:24:28,082
It's really good. I'm not even kidding.

1824
01:24:29,353 --> 01:24:30,582
It's totally delicious.

1825
01:24:34,023 --> 01:24:35,052
(Frowning)

1826
01:24:35,052 --> 01:24:36,552
I added just a bit.

1827
01:24:36,552 --> 01:24:38,493
I think it's seasoned just right.

1828
01:24:39,563 --> 01:24:42,092
It's really savory.

1829
01:24:42,193 --> 01:24:45,033
Jin Goo scratches his head and frowns when it's delicious.

1830
01:24:46,132 --> 01:24:49,273
(It's so good.)

1831
01:24:49,672 --> 01:24:52,042
My gosh, we're listening to the rain in Jeju.

1832
01:24:52,773 --> 01:24:53,972
How lucky are we?

1833
01:24:53,972 --> 01:24:56,073
(As they listen to the rain falling on the tarp, )

1834
01:24:56,172 --> 01:24:58,042
Isn't this incredible?

1835
01:24:58,042 --> 01:25:01,653
(they enjoy their delicious dinner by the seaside of Jeju.)

1836
01:25:02,589 --> 01:25:03,990
(Enjoying)

1837
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:05,620
- How come it's so fresh? - This is so good.

1838
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:09,290
Considering how I was seasick,

1839
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:11,389
- aren't I eating so well? - I know.

1840
01:25:12,129 --> 01:25:14,499
It was only a few hours ago.

1841
01:25:14,929 --> 01:25:16,429
I think this trip...

1842
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:20,540
was the best one...

1843
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:22,770
- among all the trips I had. - Really?

1844
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:23,870
(His trip to Jeju Island was the best one he had.)

1845
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:26,139
If a family member feels that way,

1846
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,480
that means the trip was really nice.

1847
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:29,950
The food was delicious too.

1848
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,809
It's so nice.

1849
01:25:31,809 --> 01:25:34,679
(It was even more fun because the whole family was there.)

1850
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:35,790
It's nice.

1851
01:25:35,889 --> 01:25:39,190
Jin Goo, you must have the last piece.

1852
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,520
(If you say so...)

1853
01:25:41,959 --> 01:25:42,959
(Gathering the leftover rice)

1854
01:25:42,959 --> 01:25:45,530
I knew he'd do this. I saw the rice here.

1855
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:48,129
I thought you'd gather it to eat it.

1856
01:25:48,129 --> 01:25:50,099
I was waiting to see if he'd gather the rice or not.

1857
01:25:50,129 --> 01:25:53,139
And he did gather the rice.

1858
01:25:53,469 --> 01:25:54,799
- My gosh. - This is...

1859
01:25:54,799 --> 01:25:57,270
It looks like the big bite that those guys do on another show.

1860
01:25:57,809 --> 01:25:59,980
(A huge wrap with the leftover rice)

1861
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:01,209
Will that fit into his mouth?

1862
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:03,650
Maybe Si Wan will have it after Jin Goo made the wrap.

1863
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:04,780
That's right.

1864
01:26:05,209 --> 01:26:06,280
Jin Goo.

1865
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,620
(No way.)

1866
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:08,650
Why would you take that?

1867
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:12,320
(He can fit the big wrap in his mouth.)

1868
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,459
My gosh, you eat it easily as if it's candy.

1869
01:26:16,559 --> 01:26:19,230
(It's indeed good.)

1870
01:26:19,759 --> 01:26:21,299
The best part...

1871
01:26:22,299 --> 01:26:25,099
The best part of the dinner...

1872
01:26:25,099 --> 01:26:27,270
was the fish that Si Wan caught.

1873
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:31,410
I can't believe Jin Goo still remembers how to prepare sashimi.

1874
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:34,009
I know, the teamwork was great.

1875
01:26:34,009 --> 01:26:35,980
Si Wan caught the fish, and he prepared it.

1876
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:38,309
I cooked, and you just ate.

1877
01:26:38,809 --> 01:26:41,150
The teamwork was perfect.

1878
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:42,620
- He just ate? - He did.

1879
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:45,219
He pretended to be sick and just ate without working.

1880
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:49,360
Actually, I don't do much work whether I'm seasick or not.

1881
01:26:50,129 --> 01:26:51,889
(Laughing)

1882
01:26:51,889 --> 01:26:54,929
I just eat the food after doing some errands.

1883
01:26:55,999 --> 01:26:59,299
(Even when their enjoyable dinner was done, )

1884
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:03,639
(the rain is picking up.)

1885
01:27:03,639 --> 01:27:05,709
It feels completely different...

1886
01:27:05,709 --> 01:27:08,209
- now that it's raining. - It's more picturesque.

1887
01:27:08,209 --> 01:27:11,480
But it didn't rain until we came back home.

1888
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,179
- Right, during the afternoon. - Right.

1889
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:15,719
I'm too sad to let today go.

1890
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:18,419
It's a bummer that I didn't get to catch fish.

1891
01:27:18,419 --> 01:27:20,589
I feel like I ruined the mood...

1892
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,830
because I got seasick.

1893
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:24,389
- No, not at all. - No, not at all.

1894
01:27:24,459 --> 01:27:27,099
I thought I was going to catch the most fish.

1895
01:27:27,099 --> 01:27:28,200
(Upset)

1896
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:31,230
- But that's unexpected. - I know.

1897
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:33,370
Even though you said you wouldn't catch it.

1898
01:27:33,499 --> 01:27:34,799
I was so upset.

1899
01:27:34,799 --> 01:27:38,139
Also, just sitting still made me feel uncomfortable...

1900
01:27:38,139 --> 01:27:40,139
when they were busy cooking.

1901
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:44,349
But you don't have to mind it.

1902
01:27:44,780 --> 01:27:47,950
I think differently from Hee Won.

1903
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,089
They did what they had to do...

1904
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:54,059
to prepare dinner when we didn't tell you anything.

1905
01:27:54,459 --> 01:27:57,089
I was happy to have those two around me.

1906
01:27:57,089 --> 01:27:59,200
I was grateful to have them as my family.

1907
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,700
Like I said earlier,

1908
01:28:03,099 --> 01:28:06,669
it was so good to be on a trip with you guys again.

1909
01:28:06,669 --> 01:28:10,709
So I had so much fun during the trip.

1910
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:12,440
(That's right. It was fun.)

1911
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:14,209
I think we enjoyed it a lot.

1912
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:16,410
We had so much fun.

1913
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:18,980
I realized once again...

1914
01:28:19,849 --> 01:28:22,219
that the charm of going on a trip...

1915
01:28:22,219 --> 01:28:25,620
is getting to know each other more...

1916
01:28:25,620 --> 01:28:28,059
and getting close to each other.

1917
01:28:29,929 --> 01:28:32,030
I think we should stop here.

1918
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:33,360
Why?

1919
01:28:35,595 --> 01:28:37,866
I think we should stop here.

1920
01:28:38,095 --> 01:28:39,105
Why?

1921
01:28:39,135 --> 01:28:42,206
(Wait, I'm tearing up.)

1922
01:28:42,805 --> 01:28:46,175
- We got to see them cry today. - I want to hear that more.

1923
01:28:46,946 --> 01:28:48,906
- I want to hear that more. - Dong Il did in the afternoon,

1924
01:28:48,906 --> 01:28:50,546
- and Hee Won is crying at night. - I'm serious though.

1925
01:28:50,546 --> 01:28:52,246
We're getting to know each other more.

1926
01:28:52,385 --> 01:28:56,156
It doesn't matter where you go or what you eat...

1927
01:28:56,156 --> 01:28:58,515
as long as you're with the people you like.

1928
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:01,055
