1
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:32,084
(House on Wheels in Jeju)

2
00:00:32,994 --> 00:00:36,193
(Today's House on Wheels is surrounded by woods.)

3
00:00:36,393 --> 00:00:39,333
(The guest we've been waiting for has come to House on Wheels.)

4
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:42,034
(Our youngest member, Yeo Jin Goo, is back!)

5
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:44,363
(He grinds coffee beans after a long while.)

6
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:47,173
(He sets up a tarp after a long while too.)

7
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:50,144
(Jin Goo is still a good cook.)

8
00:00:50,304 --> 00:00:51,973
(It's the best jjamppong in the world.)

9
00:00:52,074 --> 00:00:54,274
(I'm so happy today.)

10
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:56,844
(A trip to Jeju Island with the whole family...)

11
00:00:56,844 --> 00:00:59,453
(starts now.)

12
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:03,353
(The beginning of summer where spring is fading)

13
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:06,923
(The first place in the country to greet summer)

14
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:09,463
We're on Jeju Island!

15
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:12,364
(Jeju Island)

16
00:01:13,164 --> 00:01:18,533
(House on Wheels has come to Jeju to welcome summer!)

17
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:21,103
Goodness. Look at the waves.

18
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:23,243
Look at those waves...

19
00:01:23,243 --> 00:01:25,444
that have come up to the surface.

20
00:01:25,444 --> 00:01:27,243
They really did.

21
00:01:30,444 --> 00:01:32,954
Our house might get splashed on.

22
00:01:32,954 --> 00:01:34,153
(The seawater has come up to the road.)

23
00:01:34,713 --> 00:01:36,424
The big one is coming.

24
00:01:37,353 --> 00:01:40,924
(Due to the endlessly raging waves, )

25
00:01:40,954 --> 00:01:43,064
It really came up.

26
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:45,524
(the water has come up to the road.)

27
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:48,534
We're really on Jeju Island.

28
00:01:49,364 --> 00:01:51,133
It's so pretty.

29
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:55,133
(This is nice.)

30
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,674
(Staring)

31
00:01:56,674 --> 00:01:59,174
(They can't help but stare at the beautiful scenery.)

32
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:01,644
The color of the ocean is really beautiful.

33
00:02:01,644 --> 00:02:03,084
Everything is beautiful in Jeju Island.

34
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:04,883
It's beautiful.

35
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:07,114
(The Jeju ocean is emerald.)

36
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:08,513
It's magnificent.

37
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:10,853
I'm just so happy to be on Jeju Island.

38
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:12,524
- Really? - Yes.

39
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:14,123
(Exclaiming)

40
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:18,894
Why did you dress like Lieutenant Columbo today?

41
00:02:18,894 --> 00:02:20,763
(Lieutenant Columbo)

42
00:02:20,963 --> 00:02:22,534
You never wear a trench coat.

43
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:24,334
You're mysterious.

44
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:27,233
I was going to wear the denim shirt only,

45
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:29,403
but it's too cold here because it's windy.

46
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:31,503
- So? - It was so cold,

47
00:02:31,503 --> 00:02:34,243
so I put something on top. That's why I'm wearing this.

48
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:37,243
Why did you suddenly change your image to look good?

49
00:02:37,544 --> 00:02:39,454
I just grabbed anything and put it on,

50
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:41,084
but he said I look good. I made it.

51
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:43,924
I only put it on because it's cold.

52
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:47,093
(The real reason why Hee Won dressed up)

53
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:49,924
(In the beginning of House on Wheels, )

54
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:52,394
(we had a fashionista.)

55
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:54,764
(Keeping him in check)

56
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:58,063
(Even when he wears what look like ordinary sandals, )

57
00:02:58,063 --> 00:03:00,304
(they look different.)

58
00:03:00,533 --> 00:03:03,373
(Jin Goo, whom Hee Won kept in check...)

59
00:03:03,743 --> 00:03:07,943
(and who ran away from home, is coming back.)

60
00:03:08,574 --> 00:03:09,614
(Looking cool)

61
00:03:09,614 --> 00:03:12,183
(I'll be waiting for you, Jin Goo.)

62
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:13,653
(House on Wheels is heading toward a beach?)

63
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:14,913
It's Hamdeok Beach.

64
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:18,454
- By the way, Dong Il... - Yes?

65
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:23,324
Wait a minute. Didn't we say we'll go and buy sea urchins?

66
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:25,394
Yes, we need to buy sea urchins.

67
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:28,963
My wife told me she was surprised by how good sea urchin gimbap was...

68
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:31,704
when she came to Jeju Island with our kids.

69
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:33,674
We're having gimbap today?

70
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:35,503
I'm going to make our own sea urchin gimbap.

71
00:03:35,503 --> 00:03:36,743
(Let's have sea urchin gimbap.)

72
00:03:37,544 --> 00:03:41,044
(Dong Il's special gift for Jin Goo, whom he hasn't seen for a while)

73
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:45,614
(On top of well-made gimbap, )

74
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:51,283
(add an abundant amount of sea urchin roe.)

75
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:56,663
(The sea urchin gimbap that even Dong Il's wife was surprised by)

76
00:03:57,294 --> 00:04:00,693
If you drive straight to the end, we can buy sea urchins there.

77
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:04,704
I'll let you enjoy sea urchin roe as much as you want.

78
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:06,433
Let's use it as a sheet mask too.

79
00:04:06,634 --> 00:04:08,373
- Yes! - We can use that as a sheet mask?

80
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,903
(This is exciting!)

81
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,122
(Hee Won drove to the spot Dong Il told him.)

82
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:15,862
It's here. There they are.

83
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:18,531
Look. There are haenyeos over there.

84
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:22,132
(This is exciting!)

85
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:25,442
(This morning, the haenyeos of Jeju...)

86
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:27,641
(Diving)

87
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:31,411
(caught...)

88
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:33,812
(the fresh sea urchins themselves.)

89
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:40,252
(They're cleaning the sea urchins in front of the sea.)

90
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:42,862
- Hello. - Hi.

91
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:45,992
- My, hello. Nice to meet you. - Hello.

92
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:47,232
My goodness!

93
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:51,161
- I saw you on TV! - You seemed familiar.

94
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,632
I saw you on TV.

95
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:56,201
I'm going to get a lot of sea urchin roe...

96
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:57,971
and massage my face with it.

97
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:01,211
(Laughing)

98
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:08,011
(Collecting sea urchin roe one by one)

99
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:11,482
My gosh, I'm so happy to see so much sea urchin roe at once.

100
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,321
Its color is...

101
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:17,461
- It's pretty, right? - Yes, it's pretty.

102
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:19,062
I know.

103
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:22,391
(Patting)

104
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:25,161
The spines are really hard.

105
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:28,302
What do sea urchins eat?

106
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:30,802
- Seaweed! - I see.

107
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:32,841
Did you think they eat rice?

108
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:34,011
(Laughing)

109
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:37,841
I thought they hunt fish with their spines and eat it.

110
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:43,882
I mean... I really thought they use their spines...

111
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:46,021
to kill fish.

112
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:47,021
(What an incredible imagination.)

113
00:05:47,122 --> 00:05:49,321
Right. You could think like that.

114
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:51,922
Since they are poisonous.

115
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:54,891
- Please be understanding, ma'am. - Okay.

116
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:56,461
He's over 50.

117
00:05:57,461 --> 00:06:00,971
So the spines are there to defend themselves?

118
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:02,672
- Of course. - Right?

119
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:04,002
Of course they use them to defend themselves.

120
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:05,771
Yes, you can take it like that.

121
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:08,571
Its color is beautiful though.

122
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:11,911
Ma'am, we'll buy some of it.

123
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:15,382
- Pay them. - Okay. Ma'am, here it is.

124
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:16,552
- Here, it's for the sea urchins. - Thank you.

125
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:18,752
- Stay healthy, everyone. - Thank you.

126
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,651
- Thank you. Goodbye! - Thank you.

127
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:22,292
- Goodbye. - Stay healthy!

128
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,721
(They're going to cook them in various ways.)

129
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:26,862
- It's a sea urchin feast. - It's a feast indeed.

130
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:29,802
(Pushing back his hair)

131
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:32,261
(They finished getting sea urchins, but they're hanging about.)

132
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:35,901
Dong Il, we are meeting Jin Goo here, right?

133
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:37,141
He'll come to this place.

134
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:40,312
He's coming here? He's finally coming!

135
00:06:40,312 --> 00:06:41,312
Right.

136
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:43,182
- He ran away from home, and... - My gosh.

137
00:06:43,182 --> 00:06:46,552
He's coming back after he ran because he has nothing better to do.

138
00:06:47,052 --> 00:06:48,682
That's how kids are like.

139
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:51,021
(Fixing his eye on the road)

140
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:54,151
(Hee Won moves to the roadside to fetch Jin Goo.)

141
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:57,362
(Peeping)

142
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:00,031
(They're all eagerly waiting for him.)

143
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:01,192
It's about time he came.

144
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:05,062
(He's walking toward them from afar.)

145
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:06,102
It's so nice.

146
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:12,841
(The silhouette and stride we're familiar with)

147
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:14,942
Yes, I'm home!

148
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:18,911
(Our youngest member, Jin Goo, is back!)

149
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:23,021
(Jin Goo is almost home.)

150
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:27,692
(They haven't found him.)

151
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:29,292
(Sighing)

152
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:33,192
What should I do? How should I surprise them?

153
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:36,732
(He spotted Jin Goo.)

154
00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:37,862
Jin Goo is here.

155
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:39,261
He is?

156
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:42,942
(What should I do?)

157
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:46,911
(Turning left all of a sudden)

158
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:49,011
Did you think we wouldn't recognize you if you turned?

159
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:51,312
- Where? - He's looking elsewhere.

160
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:52,312
You punk!

161
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:54,982
(Running toward them)

162
00:07:55,612 --> 00:07:59,952
- My goodness. How have you been? - Dong Il.

163
00:08:00,122 --> 00:08:02,891
I was going to surprise you. Why did you see me?

164
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:05,222
My gosh, Jin Goo.

165
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:07,061
(Hugging)

166
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:09,132
- Did you see how he walked to us? - How?

167
00:08:09,132 --> 00:08:10,401
From over there...

168
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:13,171
(Embarrassed)

169
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:16,872
He was walking toward us, but he turned when I spotted him.

170
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,171
(Hee Won excitedly reenacts how Jin Goo walked.)

171
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:20,171
(Jin Goo gave a big laugh to them as soon as he got here.)

172
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:21,271
Gosh, you.

173
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:23,441
I wanted to surprise you.

174
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:25,482
- Where should I put your stuff? - I was going to surprise you.

175
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:29,551
(The official barista of House on Wheels)

176
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:33,021
(He doesn't even look at the grinder when he grinds coffee.)

177
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:37,661
(An assistant chef who can prepare sashimi)

178
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:44,561
(He isn't picky and eats everything well.)

179
00:08:45,102 --> 00:08:47,931
(He expresses everything through his face.)

180
00:08:49,332 --> 00:08:53,411
(He's even clumsy.)

181
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:58,082
(He often bickers with Hee Won, )

182
00:08:58,742 --> 00:09:02,181
(and he's received lots of love from Dong Il.)

183
00:09:02,181 --> 00:09:04,921
My dear Jin Goo. It was a nice trip.

184
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:08,452
(He met Si Wan through "Moon Embracing the Sun".)

185
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:12,761
(Si Wan was Jin Goo's mentor in the drama.)

186
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:18,261
(He successfully finished his job in "Beyond Evil".)

187
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:22,102
(I'm returning to House on Wheels.)

188
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:25,801
(Jin Goo is back.)

189
00:09:26,872 --> 00:09:30,041
(Si Wan takes his luggage first.)

190
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:31,541
(Dong Il and Hee Won are just glad to see him again.)

191
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,952
I recognized you right away.

192
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:36,181
I know. And there was no one around.

193
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:38,752
- Really? How have you been? - How have you been?

194
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:39,891
My gosh.

195
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:42,452
- You've had a good life, I see. - You brat.

196
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:45,191
If you finished your job, you should've come back sooner.

197
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:46,992
What took you so long?

198
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:48,092
(I missed you.)

199
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:50,132
You'll be cold here.

200
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,531
- It's perfect for me. I love it. - Really?

201
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:55,632
- Really? - Really? But the wind is strong.

202
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:57,702
You got healthier after leaving home.

203
00:09:58,342 --> 00:10:00,212
- Gosh, Jin Goo. - Looks like you've had some tonics.

204
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:02,472
He got healthier because he was busy.

205
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,742
- The house is... - This is our house.

206
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:09,051
It's way prettier than what I saw on TV.

207
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:11,952
We upgraded the house with the money you sent.

208
00:10:11,952 --> 00:10:15,191
The money you made through acting. Let's get going first.

209
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:17,291
- We need to hurry. - Let's get going. Get in.

210
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,862
- Okay. - Get in the car.

211
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:21,332
- Get in. - You can get in first.

212
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:23,301
You can put this in the back.

213
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:26,872
- I'll put it in the back. - Okay.

214
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:28,572
(Jin Goo brought a lot of stuff.)

215
00:10:28,632 --> 00:10:30,602
I'll need to hold this.

216
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:31,742
- Why? - No, it's okay.

217
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:33,511
- No, no. You can put it there. - Is it fragile?

218
00:10:34,072 --> 00:10:36,281
- I can put it right here. - Yes, put it there.

219
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:38,811
(The bag is back in the cargo box.)

220
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:41,212
- There. - Is it okay to leave it here?

221
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:43,151
You didn't bring sikhye again, did you?

222
00:10:43,151 --> 00:10:44,822
- I did. - I knew it!

223
00:10:44,822 --> 00:10:46,622
He brought sikhye again.

224
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:48,622
- You made it, right? - I think it turned out well.

225
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:49,622
I made it at home.

226
00:10:49,622 --> 00:10:51,021
We need to have it as soon as we arrive.

227
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:52,622
We couldn't have it last time because it went bad.

228
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:55,332
He's obsessed with sikhye.

229
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:59,572
(Jin Goo brought sikhye last summer.)

230
00:11:00,832 --> 00:11:04,842
(Is it bad? Or has it gone bad?)

231
00:11:04,842 --> 00:11:06,002
(It's just bad.)

232
00:11:06,002 --> 00:11:08,842
(Upset)

233
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:12,482
(Give it to me! I'll have it!)

234
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:16,322
(I made this delicious sikhye!)

235
00:11:16,852 --> 00:11:18,952
(Jin Goo has a bad memory about sikhye.)

236
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:21,191
(Hurt)

237
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:25,061
My, he brought sikhye again.

238
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:27,931
I made it at home.

239
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:28,931
Really?

240
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:33,801
(Carefully carrying the sikhye Jin Goo brought, )

241
00:11:34,702 --> 00:11:39,271
(they move to the front yard where it'll host the family.)

242
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:43,041
We're seeing Jin Goo after a long while,

243
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,712
but it doesn't feel that way.

244
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:47,681
Thank you.

245
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:51,822
- You watched our show, right? - Yes.

246
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:56,122
So? Did you want to come or not?

247
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:59,391
The first thing I noticed is how much the house has changed.

248
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:02,462
So I thought I'd need some time to get used to it.

249
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:05,661
It got a lot better than the first one.

250
00:12:05,661 --> 00:12:08,572
- The house? - Yes, it's much prettier.

251
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:14,011
Are you here as our family or are you here as a guest?

252
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:16,982
- I actually thought about it. - I know.

253
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:18,882
Just tell us what you think.

254
00:12:19,082 --> 00:12:20,811
Just tell us what you want.

255
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:22,482
- You came back today. - I'm not sure.

256
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,681
Our attitude toward you depends on it.

257
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:25,722
(Their attitude toward Jin Goo is up to his decision.)

258
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:27,051
Well...

259
00:12:28,191 --> 00:12:30,291
Can I be your guest until the sun goes down?

260
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,661
(He'll be their guest before sunset.)

261
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:34,161
Until the sun goes down? Is that what you want?

262
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:35,431
- Before sunset? - No, that's not it.

263
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:37,462
No, I'd rather be your family.

264
00:12:37,462 --> 00:12:39,502
(On my second thought, I'd rather be your family.)

265
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:42,271
- I imagined what it would be like. - Right.

266
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:43,602
I imagined that I was here.

267
00:12:44,072 --> 00:12:45,541
"Jin Goo, you stay still."

268
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,112
"You don't have to move. You're a guest."

269
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:50,041
"Guests don't do anything." I imagined how I would feel...

270
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,641
if I hear these things.

271
00:12:52,882 --> 00:12:53,952
Jin Goo.

272
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:55,911
Do you seriously think we'd treat you like that?

273
00:12:57,952 --> 00:13:00,492
"Jin Goo, you stay still."

274
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:02,222
"Stay still and raise your arms."

275
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:04,492
"Face the wall."

276
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,332
- "Raise your arms and stay still." - He even said, "Face the wall."

277
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:08,061
"Face the wall and raise your arms. Stay still."

278
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:09,391
(The older brothers are having fun teasing the youngest.)

279
00:13:09,391 --> 00:13:11,202
Gosh, Jin Goo gave it a thought.

280
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:15,332
So you came up with the idea that you'll be our guest until sunset?

281
00:13:15,632 --> 00:13:17,372
Until sunset, and you can't stand it longer?

282
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:22,941
(House on Wheels is full of laughter thanks to Jin Goo.)

283
00:13:23,242 --> 00:13:24,982
Dong Il, I'll make tteokbokki today.

284
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:26,712
- We'll have tteokbokki today? Okay. - Tteokbokki.

285
00:13:27,382 --> 00:13:29,582
- You guys will do... - We'll make up for our mistakes.

286
00:13:29,582 --> 00:13:31,781
the exact same thing as before.

287
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:33,891
- He's set on making tteokbokki. - Right.

288
00:13:34,322 --> 00:13:36,322
- Jin Goo is set on making sikhye. - I will...

289
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:41,332
Jin Goo was the only one who liked my tteokbokki.

290
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:44,661
I'll get to eat the legendary tteokbokki today.

291
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:50,202
(The day Hee Won made his first tteokbokki.)

292
00:13:50,641 --> 00:13:53,911
(He presented his tteokbokki confidently.)

293
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:56,511
(After tasting it, )

294
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:59,181
(his friends were out of words.)

295
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:02,911
(They even compared it to spicy freshwater fish stew.)

296
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:05,122
(Upset)

297
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:11,862
(Jin Goo ate it with gusto.)

298
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:15,832
(You can even sell this.)

299
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:17,632
I'm serious.

300
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:18,862
Are you serious?

301
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:21,401
Anyway, tteokbokki is... I don't know.

302
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:23,342
- I'll make it for you, Jin Goo. - Okay.

303
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:25,771
In fact, Jin Goo told me this.

304
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:27,811
- What did he tell you? - He was afraid...

305
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:29,011
to upset you by saying that it tasted bad.

306
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:30,342
But I really enjoyed it.

307
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:32,281
- And I... - Dong Il.

308
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:33,911
Jin Goo never lies.

309
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:35,011
He's good at lying.

310
00:14:35,612 --> 00:14:36,852
He's good at lying.

311
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:37,882
(He's good at lying.)

312
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:39,252
He's good at lying.

313
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:40,992
(Joking)

314
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:44,092
He seemed quite sincere to me.

315
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,531
- Did he? - I'll evaluate it critically.

316
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,431
I'll look forward to it.

317
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:55,232
You can't tell the origin of the food.

318
00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:58,342
- Jin Goo. - Yes?

319
00:14:58,641 --> 00:14:59,641
Never mind.

320
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:00,972
Tell him quickly.

321
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:02,112
It's nothing.

322
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:06,112
Please assist me by my side.

323
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:12,982
- Assist with what? - When we made tteokbokki before,

324
00:15:12,982 --> 00:15:14,952
Jin Goo helped me a lot...

325
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:17,092
by saying, "Hee Won, try this, try that."

326
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:19,261
Is that the reason why Jin Goo found it delicious?

327
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:21,531
- No way. - I wasn't really into it.

328
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:24,801
- I wasn't really into it. - Hey.

329
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:25,832
(Jin Goo was only partly involved in it.)

330
00:15:25,832 --> 00:15:26,872
- Did you share credit? - Yes.

331
00:15:26,872 --> 00:15:28,602
We were on it together.

332
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:34,641
(While they brought back the memories on their way, )

333
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:37,941
(the scenery has changed from the ocean...)

334
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:41,011
(to the stonewall path, )

335
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,651
(and to the shade of green trees.)

336
00:15:45,322 --> 00:15:50,261
(House on Wheels is driving to get closer to nature.)

337
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,431
Dong Il, it became quite tranquil.

338
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,502
It's so quiet here.

339
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,671
(Observing)

340
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:05,502
This area is quite different from where we went before.

341
00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:08,411
Right, we picked it carefully because of you.

342
00:16:10,612 --> 00:16:12,582
Do we have an ocean view today?

343
00:16:13,252 --> 00:16:15,212
Well, we'll have both.

344
00:16:15,212 --> 00:16:17,722
(There will be both.)

345
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:19,891
I missed the ocean.

346
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:21,191
- Did you? - Yes.

347
00:16:21,992 --> 00:16:23,092
You must have felt frustrated.

348
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:28,961
(Going to see the front yard with Dong Il's kind heart)

349
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:31,461
(House on Wheels goes deeper and deeper.)

350
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:32,931
The path is too narrow.

351
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:36,641
- We're brushing against trees... - Right.

352
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:38,072
as we drive.

353
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:42,911
(Impressed)

354
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:45,211
Look, we're brushing past the trees.

355
00:16:45,211 --> 00:16:46,342
(House on Wheels is going into the unknown world.)

356
00:16:46,342 --> 00:16:47,751
We can't pass by without brushing against them.

357
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:49,552
(The thick forest stretches as they approach the front yard.)

358
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:51,451
The lane is so narrow here.

359
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:55,522
- It's so narrow here. - My gosh.

360
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,292
What do we do?

361
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,832
- Dong Il, there's no streetlight. - No, there isn't.

362
00:17:01,332 --> 00:17:02,762
(Driving away from the city)

363
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:03,901
What is this? Gosh.

364
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:07,302
I think we could run into King Kong around here.

365
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:09,032
King Kong.

366
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:10,772
It's plausible.

367
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:11,772
There's a grass field.

368
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:13,542
(Only Dong Il seems relaxed.)

369
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:14,711
I have a good feeling about this.

370
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:15,971
(Nervous)

371
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:17,842
Is this the right place?

372
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:19,512
- Yes. - My gosh.

373
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:21,512
- Are we going in even deeper? - Seriously.

374
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:22,651
That's right.

375
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:23,882
My goodness.

376
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:27,221
(Shaking)

377
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:29,751
(After passing through a rough path...)

378
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:31,092
Enduring hardship and ordeal.

379
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,421
My gosh.

380
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:33,961
(Exclaiming)

381
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:34,961
It is pretty indeed.

382
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:37,532
(Exclaiming)

383
00:17:37,802 --> 00:17:40,802
(Today's front yard that fills you with admiration)

384
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:46,842
(Seonheul-ri's virgin forest)

385
00:17:49,012 --> 00:17:52,382
(A large stretch of forest on the front yard...)

386
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:56,981
(contains primitive nature in it.)

387
00:17:58,751 --> 00:18:02,251
(From Utbamaegi Oreum which is today's backyard, )

388
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:07,691
(you can take in the view of the ocean and the parasitic volcanoes.)

389
00:18:08,632 --> 00:18:12,862
(Bengdui reservoir in the front yard...)

390
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:19,201
(provides a place to rest for forest animals.)

391
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:22,671
(It is serene in the daytime...)

392
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:28,582
(and tranquil at night.)

393
00:18:30,382 --> 00:18:36,822
(Today, we live in Seonheul-ri's virgin forest.)

394
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:38,792
Where's the house key?

395
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,231
Open it.

396
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:41,891
(Safely filmed with the permission of the landowner.)

397
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:45,862
They designed it to give openness to space.

398
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,401
They got rid of the walls.

399
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:48,532
- It looks so airy. - Like this.

400
00:18:48,532 --> 00:18:51,241
- It's very spacious. - Absolutely.

401
00:18:51,272 --> 00:18:52,572
It's the same from the back.

402
00:18:53,072 --> 00:18:55,572
- Goodness. - And we also have a foothold now.

403
00:18:55,572 --> 00:18:57,842
We used a plastic box before.

404
00:18:57,842 --> 00:18:59,411
- That's right. - Step inside.

405
00:18:59,582 --> 00:19:01,852
Our youngest is going in.

406
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:03,921
Show Jin Goo around the house.

407
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:05,552
- Yes, okay. - He moved out to be independent.

408
00:19:05,552 --> 00:19:08,122
We made this house with the money you had sent us.

409
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:09,592
I'll show Jin Goo...

410
00:19:10,022 --> 00:19:12,421
We expanded the house...

411
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:13,731
(He enters the new house with the brothers' support.)

412
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:15,231
with the money you made in Season One.

413
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,832
Gosh, Jin Goo. Your sikhye.

414
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:20,072
- I should put it in the fridge. - Right.

415
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:21,701
(Si Wan takes good care of Jin Goo's sikhye.)

416
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:23,941
- We must protect it by all means. - I went to bed after 12am...

417
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:25,401
- because of this. - Right.

418
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:27,872
- Seriously. - We should protect the sikhye...

419
00:19:27,872 --> 00:19:29,312
above all things.

420
00:19:29,312 --> 00:19:30,342
(Making room for the precious sikhye)

421
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:33,882
Should we put one in the fridge...

422
00:19:33,951 --> 00:19:35,681
- and the other two in the freezer? - In the freezer?

423
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,282
On my first trip,

424
00:19:37,852 --> 00:19:40,292
I made it really hard,

425
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:43,122
but it went sour soon. I was really frustrated.

426
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,362
Hey, open this window.

427
00:19:46,062 --> 00:19:47,562
- Should we open this? - Open all the windows.

428
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,562
(They want to make sure Jin Goo enjoys the airy space.)

429
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,661
It opens here. Goodness.

430
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:54,102
(Exclaiming)

431
00:19:54,102 --> 00:19:56,401
- This place is so airy. - My goodness.

432
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:58,971
(Starting from opening the windows...)

433
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:00,342
- Like this. - I see.

434
00:20:00,772 --> 00:20:01,772
(Exclaiming)

435
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:03,441
Let's take a look around the house.

436
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:06,141
Jin Goo, you almost touched...

437
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:08,411
- the ceiling when you lay down. - Right.

438
00:20:08,411 --> 00:20:11,322
(Last summer, the ceiling was right in front of his nose.)

439
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:14,022
We have more space now.

440
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:17,522
This place became so spacious. It's made of wood.

441
00:20:17,522 --> 00:20:18,822
- It's so nice. - Right.

442
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:22,362
- Look at those knives. - Right.

443
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,661
You never run out of knives...

444
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,701
when you cook.

445
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:28,901
(His eyes sparkle at the new kitchen appliances.)

446
00:20:28,901 --> 00:20:30,342
Here it is. Look.

447
00:20:31,102 --> 00:20:32,842
This must be Dong Il's knife.

448
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:34,512
- How did you know that? - Right.

449
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:40,812
(Checking the kitchen cabinet)

450
00:20:41,082 --> 00:20:44,481
There's oyster sauce. Great.

451
00:20:45,322 --> 00:20:46,421
Okay.

452
00:20:46,421 --> 00:20:48,122
(He has familiarized himself with the house.)

453
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:50,292
Jin Goo, let's eat sikhye before it goes bad.

454
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,461
- Okay. - We won't repeat the mistake.

455
00:20:53,122 --> 00:20:57,431
Finally, it's time to taste Jin Goo's sikhye.

456
00:20:58,802 --> 00:21:00,062
I hope it'll be delicious.

457
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:02,431
This? It must be delicious.

458
00:21:02,931 --> 00:21:05,872
It's hard to season it at home.

459
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:07,112
- Sikhye? - Yes.

460
00:21:07,272 --> 00:21:09,572
I can't make sikhye by myself.

461
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:12,112
Hold on a second, Jin Goo.

462
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:15,812
(Worried)

463
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:19,181
(Will they eat the delicious sikhye today?)

464
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:20,721
Here's the sikhye you ordered.

465
00:21:21,092 --> 00:21:22,221
Have a seat, Jin Goo.

466
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:23,391
It's been so long.

467
00:21:23,391 --> 00:21:25,691
- The chairs have changed too. - You upgraded the cushions.

468
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:28,191
Yes, it's lighter and more comfortable.

469
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:30,302
(While Jin Goo is getting adjusted to the new chair, )

470
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:31,862
(Impressed)

471
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,132
(Hee Won tastes the sikhye first.)

472
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:36,132
Hey.

473
00:21:36,632 --> 00:21:38,501
(Surprised)

474
00:21:38,901 --> 00:21:40,971
Sikhye was better the other day than this time.

475
00:21:40,971 --> 00:21:43,042
(Was it better the other day than today?)

476
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:44,042
Are you serious?

477
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:48,382
(Gulping down in surprise)

478
00:21:48,812 --> 00:21:52,782
(Si Wan also takes a sip.)

479
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:56,651
(Dong Il also tastes it.)

480
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:58,262
(Savoring)

481
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:03,262
(I put it in a cool bag this time.)

482
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:05,431
It tastes thick and rich.

483
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:08,401
(Thick and rich?)

484
00:22:08,401 --> 00:22:09,471
I'm saying it's good.

485
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:11,641
That's a relief.

486
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:13,072
It's way more delicious than before.

487
00:22:13,072 --> 00:22:15,641
I was joking earlier. It's better this time.

488
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:17,082
I like it.

489
00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:21,451
(Feeling relieved)

490
00:22:21,451 --> 00:22:23,981
- Oh, it's great. - Hee Won, I redeemed...

491
00:22:24,622 --> 00:22:27,022
- I know. - I redeemed myself with this.

492
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:29,251
This sikhye is delicious.

493
00:22:29,491 --> 00:22:32,421
I tasted it a lot yesterday, so I'm not sure...

494
00:22:32,522 --> 00:22:34,362
- if it's good enough. - Don't worry. It's good.

495
00:22:34,362 --> 00:22:35,931
Your sikhye passed the screening test.

496
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:38,161
Gosh, it passed. What a relief!

497
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:41,032
But this is somehow relaxing.

498
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:43,171
Being here...

499
00:22:43,272 --> 00:22:45,342
- and eating sikhye. - I know.

500
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:47,612
I can't believe we're on Jeju island.

501
00:22:47,612 --> 00:22:48,812
(They feel relieved after teasing their younger brother.)

502
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:50,582
(Chirping)

503
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:53,211
Gosh, birds are chirping incessantly.

504
00:22:54,382 --> 00:22:56,112
It's so nice to listen to birdcall.

505
00:22:56,112 --> 00:22:57,221
- Right. - Yes, it is.

506
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:58,352
(The front yard surrounded by nature)

507
00:22:58,622 --> 00:22:59,921
Goodness, this is great.

508
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,622
- Gosh, this is like... - How peaceful.

509
00:23:01,622 --> 00:23:04,122
It's like the birdcall I heard on TV when I was young.

510
00:23:04,122 --> 00:23:05,262
Right.

511
00:23:05,262 --> 00:23:08,161
There's no wind, so it's even better.

512
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:09,661
- What we have right now is perfect. - Right.

513
00:23:09,661 --> 00:23:12,302
- It's warm and... - It's just perfect.

514
00:23:12,302 --> 00:23:14,501
- There's a light breeze. - It's great.

515
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:15,602
(Listening to the sound of nature)

516
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,671
Gosh, the weather is so nice.

517
00:23:17,671 --> 00:23:19,042
That's right. My goodness.

518
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:22,542
- The pond creates a tranquil mood. - Right.

519
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:24,911
It's quite unique that there's such a small pond.

520
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:26,582
It's like a courtyard in a house.

521
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:32,421
(A gentle breeze, )

522
00:23:32,421 --> 00:23:37,122
(a stretch of green trees, )

523
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:40,461
(and wildflowers)

524
00:23:42,062 --> 00:23:47,931
(Relishing the precious time in the front yard)

525
00:23:48,372 --> 00:23:49,971
Now that we have Jin Goo here...

526
00:23:50,302 --> 00:23:53,812
He asked us to treat him as a guest before the sunset,

527
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:57,012
- so we'll do our best. - Right.

528
00:23:57,012 --> 00:23:59,481
But there's less burden on us.

529
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:02,911
He's not like our usual guests.

530
00:24:02,911 --> 00:24:06,052
Honestly, I'm feeling at ease now.

531
00:24:06,552 --> 00:24:09,322
Today's trip is a lot different from the previous trips.

532
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:11,622
Gosh, I love this.

533
00:24:12,421 --> 00:24:15,461
I do feel more comfortable than before.

534
00:24:15,461 --> 00:24:17,001
- Yes, a lot. - Right.

535
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:19,562
This is so nice. There's no burden.

536
00:24:19,562 --> 00:24:21,431
(The older brothers are happy to have Jin Goo here.)

537
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:24,671
First, we have to cook rice.

538
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,272
- Whenever we're on a trip. - Okay.

539
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:28,911
- What about tteokbokki, Dong Il? - We'll make tteokbokki...

540
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:31,241
- as well as rice. - We'll cook rice to start with.

541
00:24:31,241 --> 00:24:33,441
- I got it. - We'll cook rice to start with.

542
00:24:33,882 --> 00:24:35,282
My gosh.

543
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:40,352
Since Jin Goo came here today,

544
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:41,991
I'll make tteokbokki.

545
00:24:42,092 --> 00:24:43,522
Okay, tteokbokki.

546
00:24:43,721 --> 00:24:47,862
I've found a recipe for tteokbokki.

547
00:24:48,062 --> 00:24:49,862
Yes, he found a recipe,

548
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:51,632
but he can't use the internet here.

549
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,272
- The thing is the cellphone... - He's worried.

550
00:24:56,272 --> 00:24:57,602
He can't use the internet here.

551
00:24:57,602 --> 00:24:59,941
We have bad reception here.

552
00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:01,441
This is... My gosh.

553
00:25:01,812 --> 00:25:03,941
Finally, we'll get to eat that tteokbokki.

554
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:05,681
No, today...

555
00:25:05,782 --> 00:25:08,481
I can't cook delicious tteokbokki.

556
00:25:09,151 --> 00:25:10,782
(He's starting again.)

557
00:25:11,522 --> 00:25:14,022
(Hee Won is making an excuse even before starting.)

558
00:25:14,022 --> 00:25:16,352
(What was the recipe?)

559
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:19,762
Are you here to find your daughter?

560
00:25:19,762 --> 00:25:22,891
- No, I'm not. - You have that air with grey hair.

561
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:23,901
(A worried father who can't remember something)

562
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:26,901
Pardon?

563
00:25:27,102 --> 00:25:28,671
This is not grey hair. I added some highlights.

564
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:30,572
- Did you add highlights? - Highlights.

565
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:33,201
- They are highlights. - Highlights.

566
00:25:33,971 --> 00:25:35,612
I highlighted my hair.

567
00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:36,612
Oh, I see.

568
00:25:36,612 --> 00:25:37,711
(Don't get flustered even though I can't remember the recipe.)

569
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:40,451
Tteokbokki is always delicious, Hee Won.

570
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:41,481
Pardon?

571
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:43,352
Gochujang. What else do I need?

572
00:25:43,352 --> 00:25:45,822
Red chili pepper powder and minced garlic.

573
00:25:45,822 --> 00:25:47,391
- Right. - Plum syrup.

574
00:25:47,491 --> 00:25:50,092
Won't it be delicious enough with these ingredients?

575
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:52,292
- But I've found a recipe. - Sugar.

576
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:53,891
That's right. We need sugar.

577
00:25:54,062 --> 00:25:55,691
This is... Hold on.

578
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,032
Do we have packed kelp?

579
00:25:58,401 --> 00:26:00,332
- Yes, we have it here. - Here it is.

580
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:01,501
Here's packed kelp.

581
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:03,971
- We have to make broth with it. - With kelp.

582
00:26:03,971 --> 00:26:05,401
- We'll make broth with it? - Right.

583
00:26:05,401 --> 00:26:07,072
- As we did before. - Right.

584
00:26:07,572 --> 00:26:10,171
- And then... - My goodness.

585
00:26:10,171 --> 00:26:12,082
It won't make much difference,

586
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:13,582
but do we need to soak rice cake in water?

587
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:15,411
- Rice cake? - Yes.

588
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:18,852
Okay, go ahead.

589
00:26:18,882 --> 00:26:19,981
Wash it lightly.

590
00:26:19,981 --> 00:26:22,151
Then I'll wash it quickly.

591
00:26:23,221 --> 00:26:25,391
(Where's my phone?)

592
00:26:26,592 --> 00:26:28,661
Gosh, I can't use my phone here.

593
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:29,691
He can't use the recipe.

594
00:26:30,762 --> 00:26:32,461
It's good that he can't use his phone.

595
00:26:32,461 --> 00:26:33,532
It makes him flustered.

596
00:26:33,532 --> 00:26:35,072
(Giggling)

597
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:37,872
It's going pretty well.

598
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:43,272
(I should have saved the recipe.)

599
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:46,112
(He's going to soak rice cake in water first.)

600
00:26:46,112 --> 00:26:47,481
- Where's rice cake? - My gosh.

601
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,151
- What did they do? - Hold on. Where's the rice cake?

602
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:50,782
They were scared of it. Here it is.

603
00:26:50,882 --> 00:26:52,022
- Because of a stranger's dog? - That startled me.

604
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:53,782
- What? - It was under here.

605
00:26:54,522 --> 00:26:57,262
(Hee Won can't even find rice cake.)

606
00:26:57,562 --> 00:27:00,022
Are we going to soak this in water?

607
00:27:00,562 --> 00:27:02,931
We can soak it in water briefly.

608
00:27:03,262 --> 00:27:06,661
No, it'll take a while. I need some time to make the broth.

609
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:08,332
It'll take a while.

610
00:27:08,632 --> 00:27:09,731
Will two bags suffice?

611
00:27:09,731 --> 00:27:11,641
- Yes, two bags will be just enough. - Okay.

612
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:12,641
(They start to boil the kelp broth.)

613
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:15,572
(Next step is...)

614
00:27:15,741 --> 00:27:19,241
Now I have to make a recipe.

615
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:21,112
- A recipe? - And sauce.

616
00:27:21,112 --> 00:27:24,221
Right, sauce. The sauce...

617
00:27:24,822 --> 00:27:27,592
We can make the sauce here.

618
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:29,721
You can make the sauce then.

619
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:32,262
As for the vegetables,

620
00:27:32,822 --> 00:27:35,391
this much will be enough for tteokbokki.

621
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:37,931
- Scallions and onions. - Right.

622
00:27:39,332 --> 00:27:41,372
Oh, I got a good idea.

623
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:42,401
What is it?

624
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:44,372
How about we put scallion roots in the broth?

625
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:46,401
- What do you say? Isn't it good? - Right, that'll be good.

626
00:27:46,401 --> 00:27:47,671
That's it. It'll be great.

627
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:49,441
Gosh, you add scallion roots to the broth?

628
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:51,082
- That's great. - It's impressive.

629
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:53,211
- Here goes the root. - That's a useful tip.

630
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:54,852
(Adding scallion roots to enhance the flavor of the broth!)

631
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:57,582
(I'll make the sauce.)

632
00:27:57,582 --> 00:27:58,882
And then...

633
00:28:00,822 --> 00:28:02,221
(Hesitant)

634
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:04,161
What do I do next?

635
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:05,991
(What do I do next?)

636
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:07,832
Hee Won, do you need something for sauce?

637
00:28:07,832 --> 00:28:09,961
- Is this that thing? - Red chili pepper powder.

638
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:13,362
But Hee Won, coarse red chili powder will be better than that.

639
00:28:13,362 --> 00:28:14,701
- Is that so? - Yes.

640
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:18,401
- Mix it with fine red chili powder. - Hey, but this is...

641
00:28:18,772 --> 00:28:20,072
- Oh, this is... - Yes, mix them.

642
00:28:20,072 --> 00:28:21,411
- Do I have to mix these? - Yes.

643
00:28:22,372 --> 00:28:23,772
Wait a second.

644
00:28:24,141 --> 00:28:25,181
One.

645
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:27,751
- And coarse red chili powder. - Two.

646
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,552
- The ratio is... - Right.

647
00:28:29,552 --> 00:28:30,981
- This will enhance the flavor. - Three.

648
00:28:30,981 --> 00:28:32,322
Okay, three spoons.

649
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:35,022
And shall I add this?

650
00:28:35,921 --> 00:28:37,191
Okay, this one.

651
00:28:37,191 --> 00:28:38,421
(Add one spoon of fine red chili powder.)

652
00:28:38,421 --> 00:28:39,822
A total of four spoons.

653
00:28:40,362 --> 00:28:41,661
And what else should we add?

654
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:43,062
Four spoons and...

655
00:28:43,862 --> 00:28:45,931
- Gochujang. - Here's gochujang.

656
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:47,832
Gochujang.

657
00:28:48,302 --> 00:28:50,201
Is this soy sauce? Is this for seasoning?

658
00:28:50,201 --> 00:28:51,272
It's soy sauce for seasoning.

659
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:52,471
(Si Wan gets ingredients ready for Hee Won.)

660
00:28:52,471 --> 00:28:53,641
Gochujang.

661
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:56,112
And then, we need sugar.

662
00:28:58,012 --> 00:28:59,711
It'll be delicious if we use brown sugar.

663
00:29:00,012 --> 00:29:01,451
Right, brown sugar makes it delicious.

664
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,112
White sugar is delicious too.

665
00:29:03,112 --> 00:29:04,421
It's better with sugar.

666
00:29:04,721 --> 00:29:07,651
(Jin Goo is already chopping up the vegetables.)

667
00:29:09,451 --> 00:29:12,592
(Chopping)

668
00:29:13,562 --> 00:29:16,161
(Chopping up onions evenly)

669
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:20,461
(Chopping up scallions diagonally)

670
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:24,941
(He's still good with the knife.)

671
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:27,941
We bought this at the traditional market.

672
00:29:29,112 --> 00:29:30,312
Dong Il, are you making gimbap now?

673
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,812
I'll prepare ingredients for gimbap.

674
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,112
- I can make it outside. - Okay.

675
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:39,251
- Si Wan, beat this for me. - Okay.

676
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:42,921
Again, he's an assistant chef.

677
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:47,391
Gosh, it feels like the whole family gathered on a holiday.

678
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:50,592
I think it's the first time that four of us...

679
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:53,931
are cooking at the same time.

680
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:55,501
It's because I started cooking today.

681
00:29:58,302 --> 00:30:00,042
What is this? Sugar?

682
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:01,072
Yes.

683
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:03,312
(A little bit of sugar)

684
00:30:08,552 --> 00:30:10,282
- My gosh. - What happened?

685
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:11,822
It'll be delicious if there's a lot of sugar.

686
00:30:11,822 --> 00:30:12,951
- Is that so? - Yes.

687
00:30:13,951 --> 00:30:15,891
- It's okay. - That's a relief.

688
00:30:16,322 --> 00:30:18,421
There's a lot of sugar in tteokbokki than you think.

689
00:30:18,421 --> 00:30:19,661
- Oh, really? - Yes.

690
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:22,592
Sugar and gochujang.

691
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:26,262
Did I add too much gochujang?

692
00:30:27,102 --> 00:30:29,201
You can make it first and taste it later.

693
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:31,241
Right. This is it.

694
00:30:31,602 --> 00:30:33,941
(It's weird.)

695
00:30:34,671 --> 00:30:36,572
Isn't this supposed to look different?

696
00:30:39,382 --> 00:30:40,852
- Hee Won, at this point, - Yes,

697
00:30:41,251 --> 00:30:42,882
I highly recommend you add this.

698
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,352
- What's that? - It's ketchup.

699
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:46,122
Ketchup?

700
00:30:46,122 --> 00:30:48,221
It's really delicious if you add a little ketchup to it.

701
00:30:48,522 --> 00:30:49,691
How much?

702
00:30:51,362 --> 00:30:52,461
How much?

703
00:30:52,461 --> 00:30:53,762
About a spoon?

704
00:30:53,762 --> 00:30:57,092
Considering the amount, we'll need one spoon and a little more.

705
00:30:58,032 --> 00:30:59,102
It'll give a sweet and sour taste.

706
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:01,731
It'll be your fault if it becomes weird.

707
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:05,501
That's all for it. We don't have bottled water?

708
00:31:05,802 --> 00:31:08,141
- We have bottled water. - Why do we add water?

709
00:31:08,671 --> 00:31:09,872
Isn't it too sticky?

710
00:31:09,872 --> 00:31:11,941
- No, it's smooth. - A little... Really?

711
00:31:11,941 --> 00:31:13,542
- You can add water. - Sorry?

712
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:14,711
- You can add water. - Just a little bit.

713
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:15,852
Okay, add some.

714
00:31:15,852 --> 00:31:16,852
(Approving quickly)

715
00:31:16,981 --> 00:31:18,451
Add some water.

716
00:31:18,622 --> 00:31:20,552
Jin Goo played a role in it.

717
00:31:20,552 --> 00:31:22,491
- Yes, I played a role. - You did?

718
00:31:23,552 --> 00:31:25,862
Jin Goo, I'm doing this for you.

719
00:31:25,862 --> 00:31:28,991
I'm adding ingredients to make it as you like.

720
00:31:28,991 --> 00:31:31,562
What else do you want me to put in? Just tell me.

721
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:35,072
Hey, if you keep helping him, he'll blame you if it turns out bad.

722
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:36,471
Don't you know how he is?

723
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:38,342
(Dong Il knows me too well.)

724
00:31:38,342 --> 00:31:40,572
You see? Hee Won is making a plan...

725
00:31:40,572 --> 00:31:42,441
- to put blame on you. - No, I'm not.

726
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:45,342
No, I made the base for the sauce.

727
00:31:46,612 --> 00:31:49,012
Add minced garlic.

728
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:51,282
- About this much? - That'll be enough.

729
00:31:51,282 --> 00:31:52,622
Should we add some ginger?

730
00:31:52,622 --> 00:31:53,921
We should.

731
00:31:54,322 --> 00:31:55,522
A little bit of ginger.

732
00:31:56,421 --> 00:31:57,421
Good.

733
00:31:58,221 --> 00:31:59,522
- What's that? - It's cooking wine.

734
00:32:01,191 --> 00:32:02,891
(Jin Goo's share in the sauce is gradually increasing.)

735
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:03,891
Good.

736
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:06,802
- What's that? - It's plum syrup.

737
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:07,832
(Plum syrup)

738
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:11,471
(The sauce is completed without Hee Won's recipe.)

739
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:14,001
It's a little cheating but...

740
00:32:14,512 --> 00:32:15,612
I like that.

741
00:32:16,312 --> 00:32:17,812
- What's that? - It's oyster sauce.

742
00:32:18,411 --> 00:32:19,711
Why do you put oyster sauce here?

743
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,112
It makes the taste better.

744
00:32:21,112 --> 00:32:24,082
(Put it in!)

745
00:32:24,421 --> 00:32:26,451
This seems enough. Doesn't it?

746
00:32:26,451 --> 00:32:27,891
(Thanks to Jin Goo, tteokbokki sauce is completed.)

747
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:30,921
- Is this done? - The taste...

748
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:32,421
(I'd like to taste...)

749
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:35,292
- Hey, we don't taste it. - You don't?

750
00:32:35,292 --> 00:32:36,592
Not at all. You can eat it later.

751
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:38,762
Have you seen me testing a taste before?

752
00:32:38,762 --> 00:32:41,072
- After doing this, - We don't taste it.

753
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:44,102
That's why yours doesn't taste good.

754
00:32:44,102 --> 00:32:45,141
Dong Il, would it be okay?

755
00:32:45,372 --> 00:32:47,401
I told you before. Try this.

756
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:51,141
It looks like an egg bun.

757
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:52,582
- The eggs! - Right?

758
00:32:52,582 --> 00:32:55,211
The fillings for gimbap are almost done.

759
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:57,882
- Yes, we are always... - You're very fast.

760
00:32:57,882 --> 00:32:58,882
(This is Chef Sung!)

761
00:32:59,651 --> 00:33:02,592
(Dong Il is grilling the pork to put inside of gimbap.)

762
00:33:03,122 --> 00:33:04,822
(Sprinkling pepper)

763
00:33:05,691 --> 00:33:08,592
(Is the broth ready?)

764
00:33:09,132 --> 00:33:10,132
(Boiling)

765
00:33:10,132 --> 00:33:12,401
- The broth smells very good. - What?

766
00:33:12,401 --> 00:33:13,762
The broth smells so good.

767
00:33:14,332 --> 00:33:16,971
It seems tteokbokki will taste very good this time.

768
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:19,241
- Yes. I got the feeling. - Right?

769
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:21,211
I will put rice cakes in.

770
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:23,241
Rice cakes? Put them in.

771
00:33:24,241 --> 00:33:26,512
Wait, I'll do it with gloves on.

772
00:33:28,711 --> 00:33:30,711
Hee Won is very caring.

773
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:33,081
Of course, Jin Goo is here.

774
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:35,552
(Smiling)

775
00:33:35,552 --> 00:33:37,322
Aren't we supposed to put warty sea squirts first?

776
00:33:37,322 --> 00:33:38,921
You can put them here all together now.

777
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:41,262
You put warty sea squirts in tteokbokki?

778
00:33:41,392 --> 00:33:43,831
- It makes the soup taste better. - I see.

779
00:33:43,992 --> 00:33:46,101
This is the first time trying tteokbokki with warty sea squirts.

780
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:48,231
The warty sea squirts smell like the ocean.

781
00:33:49,432 --> 00:33:52,702
- Isn't it similar to tot gimbap? - Yes.

782
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:54,512
Tot is very new to me.

783
00:33:54,871 --> 00:33:57,041
A guest has brought us tot gimbap as a gift before.

784
00:33:57,981 --> 00:34:01,481
It'd taste good with chojang.

785
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:05,621
Okay. We can just close the lid and boil.

786
00:34:05,621 --> 00:34:07,552
(The taste of Jeju island is getting added here.)

787
00:34:08,621 --> 00:34:10,291
Are we supposed to stir it?

788
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:11,892
It may stick to the bottom.

789
00:34:12,862 --> 00:34:14,762
We put rice cakes too soon.

790
00:34:15,392 --> 00:34:16,561
No, we didn't.

791
00:34:17,132 --> 00:34:18,202
Didn't we?

792
00:34:19,202 --> 00:34:21,331
(Hee Won fails to blame someone else.)

793
00:34:22,371 --> 00:34:23,901
- It's okay. - Until the sun goes down,

794
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:25,202
Dong Il is on my side.

795
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:27,041
Right.

796
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:28,742
(It doesn't work.)

797
00:34:29,742 --> 00:34:31,211
It may overflow.

798
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:33,441
- Overflow? - It looks like it will overflow.

799
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:35,052
We can use a bigger pot.

800
00:34:35,112 --> 00:34:37,251
- Yes, we can. - Should we switch that now?

801
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:38,351
Should we?

802
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:41,121
- Yes, before it gets hot. - Now...

803
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,791
- Let's use this one. - Okay.

804
00:34:43,651 --> 00:34:45,992
- Let's rinse it with water. - Okay.

805
00:34:47,691 --> 00:34:49,862
Something feels uneasy that we keep using bigger ones.

806
00:34:50,362 --> 00:34:51,401
Why?

807
00:34:51,702 --> 00:34:54,432
(Last time...)

808
00:34:55,932 --> 00:34:57,302
(The cause of the last failure)

809
00:34:57,302 --> 00:34:58,742
(The big pot)

810
00:34:59,142 --> 00:35:01,371
(It seems too big...)

811
00:35:02,072 --> 00:35:04,642
(The pot is very big.)

812
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:08,552
(It tasted bland as they made too much.)

813
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:11,822
(It will be fine this time.)

814
00:35:12,322 --> 00:35:13,322
(Worried)

815
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:16,452
Be careful with the broth. It's got a lot of effort.

816
00:35:16,452 --> 00:35:19,222
- It's slippery. - Okay.

817
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:22,362
It looks just delicious.

818
00:35:22,492 --> 00:35:24,961
It seems tteokbokki will come out very delicious.

819
00:35:24,961 --> 00:35:28,202
I know. Jin Goo, aren't we supposed to put the sauce now?

820
00:35:28,202 --> 00:35:30,401
We can put it in now and boil it. It will just be...

821
00:35:30,401 --> 00:35:31,771
- The same? - Yes, similar.

822
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:33,702
We should add it after tasting it.

823
00:35:33,702 --> 00:35:35,171
We don't need to.

824
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:39,412
It's better to put it in than wasting it. Don't you agree?

825
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:42,981
Oh, the smell! Hee Won!

826
00:35:43,682 --> 00:35:45,521
(Smelling)

827
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:47,621
- Hee Won! It smells... - Tteokbokki.

828
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:49,291
- so good. - Of course.

829
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:52,291
It seems about the right time to put vegetables in.

830
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,961
- Vegetables? - Okay.

831
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:57,132
(Hee Won puts vegetables into ocean-smell tteokbokki.)

832
00:35:57,132 --> 00:35:58,432
It's awesome.

833
00:35:58,432 --> 00:35:59,561
It looks good today.

834
00:35:59,662 --> 00:36:00,662
The smell is...

835
00:36:01,401 --> 00:36:03,302
It's boosting my appetite.

836
00:36:03,302 --> 00:36:04,371
(Everyone is into the smell.)

837
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:06,501
Since my mouth is watering...

838
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:08,671
even before it boils, it must be delicious.

839
00:36:08,842 --> 00:36:11,682
Do we have the lid? It needs to be boiled hard.

840
00:36:12,981 --> 00:36:14,512
(The lid is here.)

841
00:36:14,512 --> 00:36:16,481
(My gosh)

842
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:18,822
- You're the master chef. - Right.

843
00:36:18,981 --> 00:36:21,222
Should we recycle it? Pour some oil and cook something?

844
00:36:22,191 --> 00:36:23,952
(Laughing)

845
00:36:23,952 --> 00:36:26,822
- Maybe some eggs... - Right, with some oil.

846
00:36:26,822 --> 00:36:28,291
That's a good idea.

847
00:36:28,392 --> 00:36:31,262
Gimbap will be delicious with those fillings.

848
00:36:31,461 --> 00:36:35,072
Let's have each one make gimbap based on our own taste.

849
00:36:35,202 --> 00:36:37,132
The ingredients will be all here.

850
00:36:37,271 --> 00:36:39,541
- Is each one making his own gimbap? - Yes, each one.

851
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:41,871
- Do we have sea urchin roe? - Yes.

852
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:43,072
Gimbap will be buffet-style.

853
00:36:43,072 --> 00:36:44,412
That's good.

854
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:46,541
Wait. We don't need to cook sea urchin roe, right?

855
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:47,882
We can eat sea urchin roe as is.

856
00:36:47,882 --> 00:36:49,282
Okay, we can eat as is.

857
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:52,322
- This is sea urchin roe. - We are having bunsik dishes today.

858
00:36:52,322 --> 00:36:53,521
Tteokbokki and gimbap.

859
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:58,592
This kind of tteokbokki and gimbap are very...

860
00:36:58,592 --> 00:36:59,892
These don't exist.

861
00:37:01,862 --> 00:37:04,092
I will put cucumber in sea urchin roe gimbap.

862
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:06,802
Cucumber? Give it to me.

863
00:37:06,802 --> 00:37:08,831
How would like your cucumber to be cut? Thin and long?

864
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:10,532
Thin slices would be good.

865
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:12,101
Thin slices or what?

866
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:15,912
Or maybe long like gimbap.

867
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:17,811
(Working hard)

868
00:37:18,682 --> 00:37:19,682
- This is good. - My gosh.

869
00:37:19,682 --> 00:37:21,851
- It's nice to have them lined up. - Because I...

870
00:37:21,851 --> 00:37:23,282
set them nicely.

871
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,651
(This must be how the guests have felt.)

872
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:26,822
I can just put these here, right?

873
00:37:26,822 --> 00:37:28,992
- Yes. - Should I add more water...

874
00:37:28,992 --> 00:37:31,291
or water from the cabbage is enough? I'm not sure.

875
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,621
Water from the cabbage will be enough.

876
00:37:32,621 --> 00:37:33,762
- Is that so? - Yes.

877
00:37:34,492 --> 00:37:36,561
This is good.

878
00:37:38,162 --> 00:37:41,371
I'll cut these with scissors and...

879
00:37:42,972 --> 00:37:44,871
- Shrimp cakes. - Yes.

880
00:37:46,302 --> 00:37:47,742
- Are you putting the whole thing? - Yes.

881
00:37:48,371 --> 00:37:49,771
He said he will put them at the last minute.

882
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:53,481
(Perilla leaves and shrimp cakes are added.)

883
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:54,512
It smells good.

884
00:37:55,151 --> 00:37:59,021
This is it. No one will say it's not delicious.

885
00:37:59,021 --> 00:38:01,222
Dong Il, I'm sure this is delicious.

886
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:03,421
I think it will be good today.

887
00:38:03,651 --> 00:38:06,421
- This is done. - Okay.

888
00:38:06,421 --> 00:38:09,662
Don't we need a tarp as the sun is strong?

889
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,401
- Shall we pitch it? - Yes.

890
00:38:11,401 --> 00:38:13,302
- Okay. - I'll be pitching it, then.

891
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:14,632
Let's pitch the tarp.

892
00:38:14,632 --> 00:38:16,371
(It's been a while since he pitched a tarp.)

893
00:38:18,342 --> 00:38:21,512
(I will hook this here first.)

894
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:26,211
- Do you hook it there? - Yes.

895
00:38:26,642 --> 00:38:28,412
It doesn't need to go to the very end.

896
00:38:28,412 --> 00:38:29,651
What? Right.

897
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:32,452
Pull the end and see if it fits.

898
00:38:32,782 --> 00:38:35,222
It does. We can keep going with it.

899
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:36,592
(The tarp is getting pitched as Hee Won directed.)

900
00:38:38,362 --> 00:38:39,362
Like this.

901
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:42,291
What? Is it done?

902
00:38:42,532 --> 00:38:44,802
Not like that. You should hook from this side.

903
00:38:45,561 --> 00:38:49,572
That's the end. There are no more hooks.

904
00:38:49,932 --> 00:38:53,771
This is not how it works. Unhook them there.

905
00:38:54,472 --> 00:38:56,342
Shouldn't this part be hooked to the end?

906
00:38:57,211 --> 00:38:59,282
We need to use the door here.

907
00:39:06,682 --> 00:39:10,322
Am I wrong? Do I hook this to that side?

908
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:12,092
Give me a second.

909
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:15,162
This seems not right. Do you mean it should be here?

910
00:39:15,992 --> 00:39:17,662
Once this part...

911
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:20,362
- comes here, it should be good. - Like this?

912
00:39:21,202 --> 00:39:22,432
Hee Won, that's how it works.

913
00:39:23,371 --> 00:39:26,072
- Let's just do it anywhere. - This is right.

914
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:28,572
- Is it okay? - Yes.

915
00:39:28,572 --> 00:39:29,572
(Jin Goo is better at it even after a long time.)

916
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:31,242
That's done, and this should be...

917
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:33,382
(Stumbling)

918
00:39:34,682 --> 00:39:36,912
- like this. - Right?

919
00:39:37,012 --> 00:39:38,222
Okay, good.

920
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:39,452
(It's done easily as they followed Jin Goo's direction.)

921
00:39:39,452 --> 00:39:40,651
- Like this? - Good.

922
00:39:41,182 --> 00:39:43,322
- Wait, then... - We need to hammer now.

923
00:39:43,322 --> 00:39:44,322
Right.

924
00:39:44,552 --> 00:39:45,561
(Who does the hammering?)

925
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:46,961
Right?

926
00:39:48,331 --> 00:39:49,862
(Laughing)

927
00:39:49,862 --> 00:39:51,702
- This is... - Why?

928
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:53,061
- Si Wan. - Yes?

929
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:56,072
- Hold this for me. - Okay.

930
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:58,302
You can hammer them now.

931
00:39:59,342 --> 00:40:00,371
(Jin Goo is good at hammering even though it's been a while.)

932
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:02,171
That looks good. Do one on Si Wan's side.

933
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:05,142
(Strong hammering)

934
00:40:07,311 --> 00:40:10,481
Okay. Since the wind is refreshing...

935
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:11,682
I can smell tteokbokki.

936
00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:13,521
Can you smell it there?

937
00:40:13,521 --> 00:40:15,722
Tteokbokki smell got here with the breeze.

938
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:17,492
This is perfect.

939
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:21,592
Jin Goo, let's eat once that boils.

940
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:25,802
Once it boils, we can just bring it out and eat it.

941
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:26,961
Let's do that.

942
00:40:28,171 --> 00:40:31,601
Whenever I finish something, I feel hungry.

943
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:32,642
- Right? - Yes.

944
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:34,171
(They are now resting together.)

945
00:40:34,572 --> 00:40:36,072
Have some water.

946
00:40:36,072 --> 00:40:37,742
I will pick out the cold one.

947
00:40:37,742 --> 00:40:38,742
(Dong Il and Hee Won went somewhere for the moment.)

948
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:40,581
(Peeking out)

949
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:43,452
(Hesitating)

950
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:48,492
When they're not here, I will put...

951
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:50,121
Which one?

952
00:40:50,452 --> 00:40:51,662
Let me taste it first.

953
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:57,492
(Jin Goo had been worried as no one has tasted it.)

954
00:40:58,231 --> 00:40:59,231
This is not sweet.

955
00:41:00,702 --> 00:41:01,731
It needs to be sweeter.

956
00:41:03,302 --> 00:41:06,202
(Should I add sugar or not?)

957
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:08,842
- Does it need to be sweeter? - It's better when it's sweet.

958
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:11,112
It will be tastier when it's sweet.

959
00:41:11,412 --> 00:41:12,412
- Si Wan. - Yes?

960
00:41:12,412 --> 00:41:15,151
- Do you trust me? - What's that?

961
00:41:16,651 --> 00:41:17,882
I trust you. Just do it.

962
00:41:18,822 --> 00:41:20,682
No, not that much.

963
00:41:20,682 --> 00:41:23,722
- It's sugar. - Not that much.

964
00:41:23,722 --> 00:41:24,862
I don't trust you that much.

965
00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:26,461
(Laughing)

966
00:41:26,892 --> 00:41:30,291
- I trust your taste. - It's a little salty.

967
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:34,901
As Hee Won did his best making this,

968
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:37,972
I want him to say, "I told you it's delicious."

969
00:41:37,972 --> 00:41:39,041
I agree.

970
00:41:40,001 --> 00:41:42,112
(Once again)

971
00:41:46,012 --> 00:41:47,682
It finally tastes like tteokbokki.

972
00:41:47,682 --> 00:41:51,081
Does it? I trust your taste, Jin Goo.

973
00:41:51,481 --> 00:41:54,722
(They are coming.)

974
00:41:55,921 --> 00:41:58,291
- Was it boiling? - It's boiling now.

975
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:00,561
- Did it boil? - It's almost boiling.

976
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:01,592
Is it?

977
00:42:02,032 --> 00:42:03,892
Let's eat now.

978
00:42:06,162 --> 00:42:08,601
It's not boiling enough.

979
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:09,632
- Good. We can eat. - It's enough.

980
00:42:09,632 --> 00:42:10,802
It's good. Let's eat.

981
00:42:11,202 --> 00:42:13,302
- Here. - Put this over there.

982
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:16,041
- Turn off the fire. It's done. - Bring a ladle.

983
00:42:17,072 --> 00:42:19,682
I believe in your sense of taste.

984
00:42:19,682 --> 00:42:20,782
My goodness.

985
00:42:21,382 --> 00:42:22,481
How will it be?

986
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:24,012
- How will it be? - Hee Won's...

987
00:42:24,012 --> 00:42:25,521
Because Jin Goo is here,

988
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:27,481
- especially for him... - His second tteokbokki.

989
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:30,251
- Ta-da. - Ta-da.

990
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:33,061
I can't carry this. This is too heavy!

991
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:34,722
Stop saying nonsense.

992
00:42:34,722 --> 00:42:36,392
(Hee Won is already in his best mood!)

993
00:42:36,961 --> 00:42:38,032
It looks so good!

994
00:42:38,032 --> 00:42:39,461
(How does Hee Won's tteokbokki taste like?)

995
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:41,001
Dong Il, I think this will taste good.

996
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:43,532
- Hee Won, scoop it for us. - Yes.

997
00:42:43,532 --> 00:42:45,441
I remember how the previous one tasted like.

998
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:47,101
Gosh, Dong Il.

999
00:42:47,342 --> 00:42:49,041
This definitely tastes good.

1000
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:50,142
(Full of confidence)

1001
00:42:53,441 --> 00:42:54,912
It does make me salivate.

1002
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:57,612
It smells really good.

1003
00:42:58,722 --> 00:43:00,882
- Dong Il, have some first. - I'll try first.

1004
00:43:00,882 --> 00:43:02,322
Try this much first then have more later.

1005
00:43:02,322 --> 00:43:03,322
I'll try first.

1006
00:43:05,092 --> 00:43:07,262
(How is it?)

1007
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:09,592
(Si Wan looks more nervous.)

1008
00:43:10,492 --> 00:43:11,802
It tastes really good.

1009
00:43:12,202 --> 00:43:13,432
- Is it? - It's just how I like it.

1010
00:43:13,532 --> 00:43:15,432
(Thank goodness.)

1011
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:16,831
It's just how I like it.

1012
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:20,941
(Relieved Jin Goo tries the soup first.)

1013
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:23,412
- Is it really good, Dong Il? - How is it?

1014
00:43:23,412 --> 00:43:25,211
(Chewing)

1015
00:43:26,142 --> 00:43:27,682
Hee Won, this tastes like a tonic.

1016
00:43:27,682 --> 00:43:29,251
(Hee Won, this tastes like a tonic.)

1017
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:32,421
- Right? - It doesn't taste like tteokbokki.

1018
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:33,782
Did you hear what he said?

1019
00:43:33,952 --> 00:43:35,251
- "It doesn't taste..." - But it tastes better...

1020
00:43:35,251 --> 00:43:36,291
- "like tteokbokki." - than tteokbokki.

1021
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:41,791
- It tastes good! - How is it, Hee Won?

1022
00:43:43,362 --> 00:43:44,691
This is the best tteokbokki!

1023
00:43:45,762 --> 00:43:47,231
(Good job, Jin Goo.)

1024
00:43:49,032 --> 00:43:51,132
(Proud)

1025
00:43:51,401 --> 00:43:53,271
I like thick soup like this.

1026
00:43:56,311 --> 00:43:57,472
(I like it too.)

1027
00:43:57,472 --> 00:43:59,412
- Warty sea squirt. - Yes, and ginger.

1028
00:43:59,412 --> 00:44:00,541
Warty sea squirt tastes good.

1029
00:44:01,282 --> 00:44:02,351
Dong Il,

1030
00:44:03,012 --> 00:44:07,052
I'm not joking, and I'm not saying this because I cooked,

1031
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:09,222
but isn't the flavor of perilla leaves good?

1032
00:44:09,222 --> 00:44:10,592
- Yes. - Perilla leaves flavor.

1033
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:12,092
I love perilla leaves in here.

1034
00:44:12,162 --> 00:44:14,061
I'm always straightforward with you,

1035
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:15,392
but this is really good.

1036
00:44:16,061 --> 00:44:18,032
(Thank you.)

1037
00:44:18,231 --> 00:44:20,101
(Nodding in agreement)

1038
00:44:21,262 --> 00:44:23,302
(Tteokbokki made with the heart of caring for each other...)

1039
00:44:23,302 --> 00:44:25,142
- It's good. - It's really tasty.

1040
00:44:25,972 --> 00:44:26,972
It's good.

1041
00:44:26,972 --> 00:44:28,311
(tastes sweeter.)

1042
00:44:28,842 --> 00:44:29,972
Eat the rice cake too.

1043
00:44:31,682 --> 00:44:34,512
(Rice cake for me as well)

1044
00:44:36,512 --> 00:44:37,512
It's good.

1045
00:44:40,521 --> 00:44:42,291
It will taste good to fry some rice with this.

1046
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:43,621
- That sounds good! - With some seaweed flake.

1047
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:44,992
Yes. Amazing!

1048
00:44:44,992 --> 00:44:47,561
(That's the best compliment for a soup dish!)

1049
00:44:48,162 --> 00:44:50,132
The soup is seriously amazing!

1050
00:44:52,601 --> 00:44:53,632
Delicious.

1051
00:44:54,061 --> 00:44:55,432
It's really delicious.

1052
00:44:55,601 --> 00:44:56,671
- Right? - Yes.

1053
00:44:57,101 --> 00:45:00,202
Try the fish cake and the shrimp.

1054
00:45:00,202 --> 00:45:01,342
(Try the shrimp cake.)

1055
00:45:01,342 --> 00:45:02,871
- Okay. - This...

1056
00:45:04,142 --> 00:45:05,142
Dong Il...

1057
00:45:05,142 --> 00:45:07,541
(He takes a bite of plump shrimp cake.)

1058
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:10,882
(The flavor of red-banded lobster spreads in his mouth.)

1059
00:45:10,882 --> 00:45:11,882
Let me try.

1060
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:16,291
(Dong Il takes a big bite as well.)

1061
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:17,992
The shrimp cake is amazing.

1062
00:45:20,162 --> 00:45:22,432
(Taking a bite)

1063
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:23,961
This is really delicious!

1064
00:45:25,862 --> 00:45:26,932
- Hee Won. - Yes.

1065
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,702
- I'll acknowledge this. - It's good, isn't it?

1066
00:45:29,532 --> 00:45:31,871
- This is really good. - You made it big toward the end.

1067
00:45:32,541 --> 00:45:34,572
- It's really good. - It is indeed.

1068
00:45:34,572 --> 00:45:36,211
I'll only cook from now on.

1069
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:37,642
(Serious)

1070
00:45:39,742 --> 00:45:42,512
Dong Il, you take charge of the outdoor works.

1071
00:45:42,981 --> 00:45:46,182
(Laughing)

1072
00:45:48,521 --> 00:45:50,222
(Chewing)

1073
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:53,892
Warty sea squirt was the genius move for the soup.

1074
00:45:54,362 --> 00:45:56,992
How did you think of adding warty sea squirt?

1075
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:59,362
Should I tell you guys?

1076
00:46:00,331 --> 00:46:01,461
Is it a trade secret?

1077
00:46:04,802 --> 00:46:06,802
You're making me choke many times.

1078
00:46:07,142 --> 00:46:08,842
(Kidding)

1079
00:46:10,742 --> 00:46:13,512
- The soup is addictive. - Yes, the soup's addictive.

1080
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:15,751
That's what I intended.

1081
00:46:16,052 --> 00:46:17,151
Really?

1082
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:20,182
(How cute)

1083
00:46:20,581 --> 00:46:22,392
- It's really refreshing. - Yes, it's refreshing.

1084
00:46:23,651 --> 00:46:24,921
We ate a lot.

1085
00:46:24,921 --> 00:46:26,121
(Tteokbokki is almost finished already.)

1086
00:46:26,722 --> 00:46:29,561
You got your signature dish now.

1087
00:46:31,162 --> 00:46:32,831
When someone comes next time, I'll just cook them this.

1088
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:33,831
(His confidence in tteokbokki explodes.)

1089
00:46:33,831 --> 00:46:36,101
(Laughing)

1090
00:46:39,371 --> 00:46:40,842
"Would you like some tteokbokki?"

1091
00:46:41,072 --> 00:46:42,242
We won't!

1092
00:46:42,242 --> 00:46:43,242
(They enjoyed Hee Won's signature dish, tteokbokki.)

1093
00:46:43,242 --> 00:46:44,472
When a guest comes next time.

1094
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:45,842
Now...

1095
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,882
Should I place the board here?

1096
00:46:48,581 --> 00:46:49,651
Thank goodness.

1097
00:46:49,981 --> 00:46:51,612
- It's good. - Yes.

1098
00:46:51,612 --> 00:46:53,581
That genius move at the end.

1099
00:46:55,421 --> 00:46:56,722
- That... - It tastes better...

1100
00:46:56,722 --> 00:46:58,662
- with a bit of sweetness, right? - Yes.

1101
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:04,862
I'm proud to see all four family members gathered together.

1102
00:47:05,231 --> 00:47:07,302
Jin Goo came back as a chef.

1103
00:47:07,461 --> 00:47:10,532
- Really? - He's making soy sauce for taste...

1104
00:47:10,532 --> 00:47:14,072
for sea urchin roe.

1105
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:15,711
How much sea urchin roe are you going to eat?

1106
00:47:16,371 --> 00:47:17,441
Punk.

1107
00:47:17,441 --> 00:47:19,142
- You said I can put it on my face. - Yes.

1108
00:47:19,941 --> 00:47:21,012
(Jin Goo's soy sauce for taste: Add water, )

1109
00:47:21,012 --> 00:47:22,651
(soy sauce, )

1110
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:24,452
(vinegar, )

1111
00:47:24,452 --> 00:47:25,921
(cooking wine, )

1112
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:27,421
(and sugar.)

1113
00:47:27,421 --> 00:47:29,092
(Add kelp pack for soup.)

1114
00:47:29,092 --> 00:47:31,552
(And boil them.)

1115
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,021
It's so salty! Gosh!

1116
00:47:34,362 --> 00:47:35,532
You put in a lot of soy sauce for seasoning, right?

1117
00:47:35,532 --> 00:47:37,691
No, this thing is pre-seasoned.

1118
00:47:38,331 --> 00:47:39,461
This kelp pack.

1119
00:47:39,461 --> 00:47:41,262
- Let's add more water. - I didn't know.

1120
00:47:42,072 --> 00:47:43,632
This is a complete failure.

1121
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:46,972
So are you not going to make it?

1122
00:47:49,142 --> 00:47:50,171
What's this?

1123
00:47:51,012 --> 00:47:52,182
I don't know what to do.

1124
00:47:52,182 --> 00:47:54,882
Youngsters shouldn't be afraid to take on a challenge.

1125
00:47:54,882 --> 00:47:57,112
- Yes, Hee Won... - Do it!

1126
00:47:57,112 --> 00:47:58,112
I don't know about the taste.

1127
00:47:58,112 --> 00:48:00,021
Do as I say.

1128
00:48:01,121 --> 00:48:03,052
- Firstly, add some water. - Then?

1129
00:48:03,052 --> 00:48:04,521
Then add this.

1130
00:48:04,521 --> 00:48:06,822
Don't throw this away, but add this into the water and boil it.

1131
00:48:07,762 --> 00:48:08,831
That...

1132
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:10,632
Then it's less salty.

1133
00:48:11,862 --> 00:48:14,132
Look at how serious he is.

1134
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:17,331
I've never seen him look so confident in cooking.

1135
00:48:17,702 --> 00:48:19,142
Jin Goo, how does that sound?

1136
00:48:19,142 --> 00:48:20,242
Can I do it?

1137
00:48:20,642 --> 00:48:22,242
Of course! Have some courage!

1138
00:48:23,742 --> 00:48:25,142
Jin Goo, trust your instinct.

1139
00:48:26,541 --> 00:48:28,651
(Your instinct for cooking tteokbokki)

1140
00:48:29,351 --> 00:48:30,581
Pour it in here.

1141
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:33,452
Here.

1142
00:48:35,751 --> 00:48:37,921
(Slurp)

1143
00:48:38,822 --> 00:48:40,921
It's a bit sweet, but I think it's fine.

1144
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:42,632
Because sea urchin roe is salty,

1145
00:48:43,162 --> 00:48:44,461
I think this is just right.

1146
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:46,162
Are you done? Come here then.

1147
00:48:46,162 --> 00:48:47,302
- Okay. - Okay.

1148
00:48:48,032 --> 00:48:49,231
Look at this.

1149
00:48:49,231 --> 00:48:51,231
(Gimbap ingredients with Jeju's ingredients)

1150
00:48:51,231 --> 00:48:52,472
With this...

1151
00:48:53,871 --> 00:48:55,642
- I'm looking forward to it. - Same here.

1152
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:56,771
(Add fresh sea urchin roe they got from its origin, and it's perfect.)

1153
00:48:56,771 --> 00:48:58,311
Jin Goo, pick first.

1154
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:01,041
Cucumber, sea urchin roe, and egg.

1155
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:02,412
(It looks delicious.)

1156
00:49:02,552 --> 00:49:04,052
Cucumber, sea urchin roe, and egg.

1157
00:49:04,512 --> 00:49:05,521
(Plus sea urchin roe)

1158
00:49:06,182 --> 00:49:07,222
Cucumber...

1159
00:49:07,222 --> 00:49:08,382
(Order received)

1160
00:49:08,382 --> 00:49:09,521
and sea urchin roe?

1161
00:49:09,751 --> 00:49:11,351
I put in this much of sea urchin roe.

1162
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:13,992
(He adds a lot of sea urchin roe that Jin Goo likes.)

1163
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:17,291
(Gosh, it looks delicious!)

1164
00:49:17,461 --> 00:49:18,532
Like this.

1165
00:49:18,662 --> 00:49:19,762
Is this all?

1166
00:49:20,702 --> 00:49:24,171
(Roll it well, and Jin Goo's gimbap is complete.)

1167
00:49:25,171 --> 00:49:27,941
(Falling in, falling in)

1168
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:29,811
The sea urchin roe keeps sticking out,

1169
00:49:29,811 --> 00:49:30,842
so I can't press it tightly.

1170
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:32,682
- You get what I'm saying, right? - Yes.

1171
00:49:32,941 --> 00:49:35,351
This is actually why they put sea urchin roe...

1172
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:37,382
on top of gimbap.

1173
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:39,081
- Yes. - But we wrapped it inside.

1174
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,421
Here.

1175
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:41,851
(As if receiving a sword from a king)

1176
00:49:41,851 --> 00:49:43,251
Try eating it.

1177
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:44,722
You look as if you're receiving a sword.

1178
00:49:44,791 --> 00:49:46,291
As if he's bestowing a sword on you.

1179
00:49:46,421 --> 00:49:47,492
Try biting it.

1180
00:49:47,492 --> 00:49:52,061
(He takes a big bite of the gimbap with his choice of ingredients.)

1181
00:49:53,802 --> 00:49:56,731
(How is it, Jin Goo?)

1182
00:49:57,901 --> 00:49:59,242
(Amazing!)

1183
00:49:59,242 --> 00:50:00,472
Does it taste good?

1184
00:50:00,671 --> 00:50:01,771
Is it very good?

1185
00:50:01,771 --> 00:50:03,171
(Swallowing)

1186
00:50:03,171 --> 00:50:05,142
Did you see Hee Won swallowing his saliva?

1187
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:07,612
Is it really good?

1188
00:50:08,481 --> 00:50:09,981
The sea urchin roe is really tasty!

1189
00:50:09,981 --> 00:50:11,052
Really?

1190
00:50:13,222 --> 00:50:15,182
(He adds some sauce that he made.)

1191
00:50:15,182 --> 00:50:16,251
Try it.

1192
00:50:16,992 --> 00:50:18,092
Is it fine?

1193
00:50:18,222 --> 00:50:19,222
(Nodding fervently in agreement)

1194
00:50:19,222 --> 00:50:20,992
This? Does this taste fine?

1195
00:50:20,992 --> 00:50:22,061
Is it fine?

1196
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:25,032
See? You shouldn't give up.

1197
00:50:25,191 --> 00:50:26,601
There's no such thing as giving up.

1198
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:30,371
- I'll keep it in mind. - Yes. Don't ever give up.

1199
00:50:31,132 --> 00:50:32,142
Yes.

1200
00:50:32,142 --> 00:50:33,302
Which combination should I try?

1201
00:50:33,302 --> 00:50:34,371
(Happy concern)

1202
00:50:34,371 --> 00:50:35,541
Next, Si Wan.

1203
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:37,541
Me? I haven't decided yet.

1204
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:39,711
- Choose. - For me,

1205
00:50:39,882 --> 00:50:41,711
I choose pork belly first.

1206
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:43,211
Pork belly.

1207
00:50:43,211 --> 00:50:45,882
- One strip of pork belly. - One strip of pork belly.

1208
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,751
- And some bracken. - Bracken.

1209
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:50,822
And...

1210
00:50:51,921 --> 00:50:52,992
Bracken.

1211
00:50:52,992 --> 00:50:54,222
(He adds Jeju bracken with good flavor.)

1212
00:50:54,222 --> 00:50:55,362
- And... - And add sea urchin roe.

1213
00:50:55,362 --> 00:50:56,532
That's right.

1214
00:50:56,532 --> 00:50:58,392
(He just needs to add sea urchin roe.)

1215
00:50:58,532 --> 00:51:02,271
(He adds a lot of fresh sea urchin roe.)

1216
00:51:02,632 --> 00:51:05,202
(It looks good.)

1217
00:51:06,342 --> 00:51:08,202
The sea urchin roe is leaking out.

1218
00:51:08,202 --> 00:51:11,242
The sea urchin roe is leaking out of gimbap.

1219
00:51:13,481 --> 00:51:14,612
It upgraded.

1220
00:51:14,612 --> 00:51:16,351
(He finishes it with sprinkling some sesame seed.)

1221
00:51:16,751 --> 00:51:18,782
- Win and come back. - I will.

1222
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:20,851
Try it.

1223
00:51:20,851 --> 00:51:23,021
(He takes a big bite.)

1224
00:51:23,251 --> 00:51:25,392
(How is it?)

1225
00:51:26,092 --> 00:51:28,421
The freshness of sea urchin roe is unbelievable.

1226
00:51:28,492 --> 00:51:29,961
- Is it good? - It's really good.

1227
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:31,231
(He can't help but get amazed at the fantastic taste.)

1228
00:51:31,231 --> 00:51:32,262
Gosh.

1229
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,162
Jin Goo, let me try with the sauce.

1230
00:51:35,671 --> 00:51:37,171
Do you really like it?

1231
00:51:37,271 --> 00:51:38,472
- Bracken. - Okay.

1232
00:51:38,472 --> 00:51:39,501
(He adds a bit of Jin Goo's soy sauce for taste.)

1233
00:51:39,871 --> 00:51:40,941
That one.

1234
00:51:40,941 --> 00:51:42,912
(Taking a bite)

1235
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:45,171
(He reacts as soon as he takes a bite.)

1236
00:51:45,782 --> 00:51:46,941
I think this is pretty good.

1237
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:48,811
- Really. - Gosh.

1238
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:53,222
The flavor is enhanced.

1239
00:51:53,822 --> 00:51:55,892
The ingredients are already delicious.

1240
00:51:56,222 --> 00:51:57,722
Next, Hee Won. Choose.

1241
00:51:57,722 --> 00:51:58,762
(Next is Hee Won's gimbap.)

1242
00:51:58,762 --> 00:51:59,961
Bracken.

1243
00:52:00,322 --> 00:52:01,392
Bracken.

1244
00:52:01,862 --> 00:52:02,932
Tot.

1245
00:52:03,461 --> 00:52:04,662
And sea urchin roe.

1246
00:52:04,662 --> 00:52:07,831
(Sea urchin roe is a must!)

1247
00:52:09,972 --> 00:52:13,302
Dong Il, cut it and try one each.

1248
00:52:13,871 --> 00:52:15,811
I think this will taste good.

1249
00:52:16,371 --> 00:52:18,171
- Here. - Thank you for the food.

1250
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:19,441
Let's eat.

1251
00:52:19,441 --> 00:52:21,541
(He takes a bite deliciously.)

1252
00:52:21,541 --> 00:52:24,052
The ingredients are selected by Hee Won.

1253
00:52:24,481 --> 00:52:26,581
(Try it.)

1254
00:52:28,452 --> 00:52:31,421
The sea urchin roe holds the seaweed in place, so it's really good.

1255
00:52:31,952 --> 00:52:32,961
Yes.

1256
00:52:35,322 --> 00:52:36,662
This is good.

1257
00:52:36,662 --> 00:52:39,032
(Si Wan's honest glabella)

1258
00:52:39,662 --> 00:52:42,972
I was also very curious about...

1259
00:52:43,072 --> 00:52:44,601
Jeju's black pork belly gimbap.

1260
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:46,401
Next, bracken.

1261
00:52:47,671 --> 00:52:52,581
(He adds a lot of Jeju bracken.)

1262
00:52:54,912 --> 00:52:57,182
Gosh, the bracken is really...

1263
00:52:58,351 --> 00:53:00,151
- It's really amazing. - Then tot.

1264
00:53:01,621 --> 00:53:04,452
(He covers other ingredients with tot.)

1265
00:53:05,421 --> 00:53:08,222
With love and effort.

1266
00:53:08,222 --> 00:53:09,461
Please stick.

1267
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:11,892
(To share Dong Il's gimbap, )

1268
00:53:11,892 --> 00:53:14,501
(which consists of pork belly, egg, bracken, and tot...)

1269
00:53:16,001 --> 00:53:17,472
The end piece is mine.

1270
00:53:17,472 --> 00:53:18,702
(The end piece is mine.)

1271
00:53:19,702 --> 00:53:22,541
(Their eyes are fixed on gimbap like baby birds.)

1272
00:53:23,171 --> 00:53:25,441
- The privilege of a chef. - Why are you all staring at me?

1273
00:53:25,441 --> 00:53:26,512
The end piece.

1274
00:53:28,811 --> 00:53:29,882
Here.

1275
00:53:29,882 --> 00:53:31,552
(This is not the end.)

1276
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:33,251
- Gosh. - On it?

1277
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,851
I was just going to say that.

1278
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:37,592
I was going to ask if he can add some sea urchin roe on top.

1279
00:53:37,592 --> 00:53:40,222
He purposely made it like this so he can add the roe on top.

1280
00:53:40,722 --> 00:53:41,961
- Right? - Yes.

1281
00:53:41,961 --> 00:53:45,032
- The sea urchin roe... - The sea urchin roe...

1282
00:53:45,632 --> 00:53:48,061
I can't believe we can eat that much of sea urchin roe.

1283
00:53:48,662 --> 00:53:51,202
(Dong Il's Jeju gimbap is ready.)

1284
00:53:51,432 --> 00:53:52,771
(The visual makes him clap.)

1285
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,072
I tell you...

1286
00:53:54,671 --> 00:53:56,671
- Take one each. - You go first.

1287
00:53:56,671 --> 00:53:58,572
- I'll take the small one. - One each.

1288
00:53:58,572 --> 00:54:00,211
- That's not small. - One each.

1289
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:03,012
Jin Goo, take the big one.

1290
00:54:03,012 --> 00:54:04,782
Try it. Take it.

1291
00:54:05,112 --> 00:54:07,121
- My gosh... - It's pretty.

1292
00:54:07,322 --> 00:54:08,552
It's pretty.

1293
00:54:08,952 --> 00:54:10,552
This is going into my mouth?

1294
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:15,791
(He adds a bit of soy sauce for taste that he made.)

1295
00:54:16,932 --> 00:54:20,561
(He puts it in his mouth at once.)

1296
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:25,302
Give me one.

1297
00:54:26,202 --> 00:54:27,941
We should sell this.

1298
00:54:28,242 --> 00:54:30,271
This is really good. It's luxurious.

1299
00:54:31,371 --> 00:54:34,142
It's really good, and with the soy sauce,

1300
00:54:34,242 --> 00:54:35,441
- it tastes even better. - It's tasty.

1301
00:54:36,512 --> 00:54:38,751
This is so good. Gosh.

1302
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:41,382
- You must love sea urchin roe. - Yes.

1303
00:54:41,382 --> 00:54:44,052
Si Wan loves sea urchin roe as well!

1304
00:54:44,052 --> 00:54:46,492
Yes, I really love sea urchin roe.

1305
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:48,561
I'm going to finish this today.

1306
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:51,162
- Are you going to make another one? - No, give me a spoon.

1307
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:52,561
Why? Aren't you going to make another one?

1308
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:54,632
- No, give me a spoon. - What is he planning?

1309
00:54:54,632 --> 00:54:56,632
- Sea urchin roe bibimbap? - My gosh.

1310
00:54:56,972 --> 00:54:58,331
He's going to mix sea urchin roe with rice.

1311
00:54:58,771 --> 00:55:01,771
We can just wrap it in seaweed, and it will be fantastic.

1312
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:03,342
(Dizzy)

1313
00:55:03,612 --> 00:55:06,941
(He mixes the remaining sea urchin roe and other ingredients.)

1314
00:55:07,882 --> 00:55:09,112
My gosh, this...

1315
00:55:09,112 --> 00:55:11,151
(Adding Dong Il's touch to the food)

1316
00:55:11,682 --> 00:55:13,452
This is not adding sea urchin roe to rice.

1317
00:55:13,452 --> 00:55:14,782
This is adding rice to sea urchin roe.

1318
00:55:14,782 --> 00:55:16,892
You're really right.

1319
00:55:18,552 --> 00:55:19,862
There's just some rice in there.

1320
00:55:20,162 --> 00:55:22,492
Yes, we're eating sea urchin roe as the main dish with some rice.

1321
00:55:23,532 --> 00:55:25,662
We really ate a lot of lunch.

1322
00:55:25,662 --> 00:55:26,762
(He suddenly thought of that.)

1323
00:55:26,961 --> 00:55:29,432
- We ate tteokbokki... - What time is it?

1324
00:55:30,371 --> 00:55:31,601
Are we in France?

1325
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:34,302
We started lunch at 12pm.

1326
00:55:34,472 --> 00:55:36,811
- How long has it been? - 2 and a half hours.

1327
00:55:36,912 --> 00:55:38,142
Our lunch...

1328
00:55:38,642 --> 00:55:40,782
We eat this way, we eat that way...

1329
00:55:41,112 --> 00:55:42,882
We're always about...

1330
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:45,081
- the decoration. - the decoration.

1331
00:55:45,552 --> 00:55:47,851
Gosh, we just keep on eating!

1332
00:55:47,981 --> 00:55:52,921
(The 3rd lunch)

1333
00:55:53,322 --> 00:55:54,722
It tastes amazing.

1334
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:57,032
This is really just sea urchin roe.

1335
00:55:57,362 --> 00:55:58,632
Jin Goo.

1336
00:55:59,262 --> 00:56:00,302
(I already ate so much, so why is it still delicious?)

1337
00:56:00,302 --> 00:56:01,862
For me,

1338
00:56:03,331 --> 00:56:04,802
it tastes so light...

1339
00:56:05,331 --> 00:56:06,671
that it feels like molten cheese.

1340
00:56:06,671 --> 00:56:08,642
- That's amazing. - Yes.

1341
00:56:09,311 --> 00:56:11,512
I'm full but I keep eating. This is bad.

1342
00:56:11,742 --> 00:56:13,311
I don't even feel full now.

1343
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:16,382
(He forgets how full he is and takes another bite.)

1344
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:22,722
(Hee Won and Dong Il eat deliciously as if this is their first meal!)

1345
00:56:23,222 --> 00:56:29,231
(Si Wan and Jin Goo enjoy the food as well.)

1346
00:56:30,231 --> 00:56:31,432
Let's have some sikhye.

1347
00:56:31,432 --> 00:56:33,401
Sikhye with this is the best!

1348
00:56:34,302 --> 00:56:35,561
I want some too.

1349
00:56:36,271 --> 00:56:38,601
This sikhye is really tasty.

1350
00:56:39,001 --> 00:56:41,171
- That's enough. - We finish the meal with sikhye.

1351
00:56:41,171 --> 00:56:42,242
(He's happy that they like it.)

1352
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:46,682
This was the cherry on top.

1353
00:56:46,682 --> 00:56:48,782
- It was sea urchin roe bibimbap. - Yes.

1354
00:56:49,851 --> 00:56:51,211
- And... - Yes.

1355
00:56:52,211 --> 00:56:54,521
the car in front when we came in.

1356
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:57,351
- Yes. - It's a car for off-roading.

1357
00:56:57,351 --> 00:56:58,452
I see.

1358
00:56:58,452 --> 00:57:01,291
We can drive to these places in that car.

1359
00:57:01,892 --> 00:57:07,132
(The off-road car they saw on the way to the front yard)

1360
00:57:09,771 --> 00:57:13,802
(Is it the ocean view today?)

1361
00:57:13,802 --> 00:57:15,072
(Both!)

1362
00:57:15,072 --> 00:57:16,371
(Equivocal)

1363
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:20,811
(I missed the sea.)

1364
00:57:21,642 --> 00:57:24,251
(Wait for a while, Jin Goo. I'll show you the cool sea.)

1365
00:57:26,182 --> 00:57:27,952
Let's clean up...

1366
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:31,351
and let's ride an off-road car that we saw in movies.

1367
00:57:31,351 --> 00:57:34,061
- Jin Goo, off-road sounds so fun! - Since it's here,

1368
00:57:34,061 --> 00:57:35,461
we can ride it.

1369
00:57:35,461 --> 00:57:37,492
- Let's get ready. - I feel good.

1370
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:41,162
(While they wait for the off-road car...)

1371
00:57:42,202 --> 00:57:44,101
Hee Won, let's listen to some music.

1372
00:57:44,101 --> 00:57:46,101
There's no internet connection.

1373
00:57:46,101 --> 00:57:48,601
- Really? - There's no connection.

1374
00:57:49,671 --> 00:57:53,412
There's no signal at all!

1375
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:58,751
This is just like a virgin forest!

1376
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:02,892
There's no line, and it's separated from civilization.

1377
00:58:02,892 --> 00:58:03,992
(Today's front yard is slightly distanced from civilization.)

1378
00:58:04,892 --> 00:58:08,561
(Finding the connection with the world)

1379
00:58:08,961 --> 00:58:11,532
How can there be no signal?

1380
00:58:13,862 --> 00:58:17,302
(Si Wan is enjoying his free time to the fullest.)

1381
00:58:17,302 --> 00:58:19,771
(Smiling in complete satisfaction)

1382
00:58:23,441 --> 00:58:26,711
Hee Won, since there's no line, it's a true slow life.

1383
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,211
- Exactly. - Yes. There's no line...

1384
00:58:31,351 --> 00:58:32,952
(In the space of our own...)

1385
00:58:32,952 --> 00:58:35,822
(with no disturbance at all, )

1386
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:41,392
(they enjoy their cozy house to its fullest.)

1387
00:58:42,121 --> 00:58:44,532
(Swaying and relaxing)

1388
00:58:45,762 --> 00:58:48,001
(They fill up the time...)

1389
00:58:48,001 --> 00:58:51,572
(with the conversation they saved up till now.)

1390
00:58:53,242 --> 00:58:56,171
- Si Wan. - If it's coming now...

1391
00:58:56,441 --> 00:58:58,342
- Let's go ride an off-road car. - Yes.

1392
00:58:59,481 --> 00:59:01,012
Let's close the door!

1393
00:59:01,012 --> 00:59:02,952
- Bugs might get in. - Okay!

1394
00:59:02,952 --> 00:59:04,782
(Let's quickly close the doors!)

1395
00:59:04,782 --> 00:59:06,621
If that's the case...

1396
00:59:07,421 --> 00:59:08,751
Is that the car?

1397
00:59:09,952 --> 00:59:11,291
Is that the car?

1398
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:13,191
(Surprised!)

1399
00:59:13,392 --> 00:59:15,061
(Everyone stares at it!)

1400
00:59:15,621 --> 00:59:18,662
(To show them a new side of Jeju, )

1401
00:59:19,331 --> 00:59:23,132
(it appears intensely.)

1402
00:59:23,972 --> 00:59:27,441
(Gigantic)

1403
00:59:28,072 --> 00:59:31,142
(Its presence fills up the front yard.)

1404
00:59:32,171 --> 00:59:36,151
(Astonished)

1405
00:59:37,182 --> 00:59:39,222
(It's as big as the house!)

1406
00:59:39,222 --> 00:59:40,921
- It's so huge! - Goodness.

1407
00:59:41,651 --> 00:59:43,621
We're not filming "Mad Max", are we?

1408
00:59:43,691 --> 00:59:45,222
Who ordered off-road?

1409
00:59:45,222 --> 00:59:47,162
You brought a HMMWV.

1410
00:59:47,162 --> 00:59:48,992
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1411
00:59:48,992 --> 00:59:50,791
- Hello. - Gosh.

1412
00:59:51,262 --> 00:59:53,262
This is a HMMWV.

1413
00:59:53,262 --> 00:59:54,362
HMMWV, yes.

1414
00:59:56,401 --> 01:00:00,041
(HMMWV: Small military vehicle for military tactics...)

1415
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:03,041
(suitable for unpaved road or off-road.)

1416
01:00:03,871 --> 01:00:06,642
(Places untouched by humans)

1417
01:00:07,242 --> 01:00:10,651
(Driving through the rough virgin forest of Jeju)

1418
01:00:11,052 --> 01:00:12,151
(Screaming)

1419
01:00:12,682 --> 01:00:14,722
(Put your guard up.)

1420
01:00:15,151 --> 01:00:18,121
(Past the rough road, )

1421
01:00:18,592 --> 01:00:21,822
(you can see Oreum that fills up the east side of Jeju...)

1422
01:00:21,822 --> 01:00:24,532
(and the sea of Jeju that Jin Goo wanted to see.)

1423
01:00:25,162 --> 01:00:28,061
(The view where you can see the wide coastline at once)

1424
01:00:28,961 --> 01:00:33,541
(We'll rush to Jeju Hill Viewpoint!)

1425
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:35,771
Please get in.

1426
01:00:35,771 --> 01:00:36,941
(They finally get in.)

1427
01:00:36,941 --> 01:00:37,941
This is big.

1428
01:00:37,941 --> 01:00:41,112
- Jin Goo, let's get on. - It looks so fun.

1429
01:00:41,311 --> 01:00:43,182
- I didn't know it was this big! - This...

1430
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:46,251
I feel like I need to get up there and play the guitar.

1431
01:00:46,251 --> 01:00:48,581
- I know, right? - You know "Mad Max", don't you?

1432
01:00:48,581 --> 01:00:50,791
- In front here. - There should be some fire.

1433
01:00:50,791 --> 01:00:53,421
- Standing here. - Standing here, yes.

1434
01:00:55,392 --> 01:00:57,662
- It surprised me. - It looks fun!

1435
01:00:58,831 --> 01:01:02,001
Sir, can we see horses on the way?

1436
01:01:02,001 --> 01:01:03,572
Only if you're lucky.

1437
01:01:03,572 --> 01:01:06,001
Only if we're lucky? I see.

1438
01:01:06,302 --> 01:01:08,302
What else can we see besides horses?

1439
01:01:08,302 --> 01:01:10,171
- Roe deer. - Roe deer.

1440
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,142
- Everyone, put on your seat belt. - It's Roe Way.

1441
01:01:12,142 --> 01:01:13,211
- What? - If you don't, you might be...

1442
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,282
in serious danger.

1443
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:16,552
I think I heard something.

1444
01:01:17,012 --> 01:01:19,481
I heard something, is that right?

1445
01:01:20,981 --> 01:01:24,121
As we move, tree branches might hit on each side.

1446
01:01:24,121 --> 01:01:25,751
- Please watch out. - Okay.

1447
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:27,822
We're starting from our house.

1448
01:01:27,822 --> 01:01:29,392
(Fascinated)

1449
01:01:32,132 --> 01:01:33,202
Let's go!

1450
01:01:33,762 --> 01:01:34,831
Amazing.

1451
01:01:35,461 --> 01:01:38,901
(This was filmed in a safe environment.)

1452
01:01:39,642 --> 01:01:40,642
Let's go.

1453
01:01:41,742 --> 01:01:43,142
I hope we can meet a roe deer.

1454
01:01:43,142 --> 01:01:45,541
(It speeds up from the start.)

1455
01:01:46,642 --> 01:01:48,211
(Taking a glance)

1456
01:01:48,211 --> 01:01:51,552
There's a smile on Hee Won's face.

1457
01:01:51,552 --> 01:01:52,952
(Smiling)

1458
01:01:53,581 --> 01:01:56,521
It's so cool and nice!

1459
01:01:56,521 --> 01:01:57,722
Gosh.

1460
01:01:57,722 --> 01:02:00,021
(Bumpy)

1461
01:02:04,231 --> 01:02:08,101
(Toward the off-road hidden in Jeju that they are looking forward to)

1462
01:02:08,932 --> 01:02:11,202
(The vehicle quickly races on the hill.)

1463
01:02:11,202 --> 01:02:13,072
- My gosh, here? - Oh my goodness!

1464
01:02:15,072 --> 01:02:17,541
(Their bodies dance.)

1465
01:02:17,912 --> 01:02:19,882
We're going up here?

1466
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:21,412
(Excited)

1467
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,182
Hold on.

1468
01:02:23,481 --> 01:02:24,751
We're up here.

1469
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:26,182
(They are already on top of the hill.)

1470
01:02:27,751 --> 01:02:33,092
(He drives down the steep hill without hesitation!)

1471
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:34,791
(Screaming)

1472
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:38,061
(Clenching his fists)

1473
01:02:38,862 --> 01:02:39,901
(My goodness.)

1474
01:02:42,532 --> 01:02:45,771
There's nowhere to grab. I need something to hold on to.

1475
01:02:46,572 --> 01:02:48,242
Hold on to something.

1476
01:02:48,242 --> 01:02:49,612
(Dong Il and Hee Won prepare themselves as well.)

1477
01:02:49,612 --> 01:02:51,412
We need to grab on to something.

1478
01:02:51,941 --> 01:02:53,912
Oh, yes.

1479
01:02:54,711 --> 01:02:55,981
(Shouting)

1480
01:02:56,251 --> 01:02:57,412
(Shouting)

1481
01:02:59,851 --> 01:03:04,021
(The vehicle has become slanted.)

1482
01:03:05,722 --> 01:03:06,722
(As they go in deeper...)

1483
01:03:06,722 --> 01:03:08,061
Are you okay?

1484
01:03:08,992 --> 01:03:10,092
My goodness!

1485
01:03:10,092 --> 01:03:11,362
(Merciless shaking)

1486
01:03:11,862 --> 01:03:14,401
(Excited)

1487
01:03:15,262 --> 01:03:16,572
I love this so much!

1488
01:03:18,171 --> 01:03:20,041
This is scary!

1489
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:24,441
(Look at them.)

1490
01:03:26,811 --> 01:03:29,651
(He nervously wipes his mouth.)

1491
01:03:31,552 --> 01:03:34,421
(It welcomes them aggressively as if it has been waiting for them.)

1492
01:03:34,421 --> 01:03:36,421
Goodness, what is this?

1493
01:03:38,291 --> 01:03:40,421
- Oh my gosh! - Jin Goo, put your guard up!

1494
01:03:40,421 --> 01:03:42,691
Put your guard up.

1495
01:03:42,691 --> 01:03:45,961
This is scary. The branches are scary.

1496
01:03:46,162 --> 01:03:50,072
We need to block this. I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

1497
01:03:51,132 --> 01:03:52,132
(Laughing)

1498
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:55,171
This is pretty scary. This is scary.

1499
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:57,441
Hold on, help.

1500
01:03:57,441 --> 01:03:58,441
(Slap)

1501
01:03:58,441 --> 01:04:00,182
The branches are scary.

1502
01:04:00,182 --> 01:04:01,912
(The road is full of rods.)

1503
01:04:03,012 --> 01:04:06,081
(Everyone's soul escaped.)

1504
01:04:06,751 --> 01:04:08,782
(Gosh, I'm scared.)

1505
01:04:10,021 --> 01:04:11,751
(Slap)

1506
01:04:11,751 --> 01:04:13,461
Gosh, this is okay, right?

1507
01:04:13,461 --> 01:04:15,061
(Touch of nature)

1508
01:04:15,362 --> 01:04:17,262
Is this really okay?

1509
01:04:17,762 --> 01:04:20,632
(Taking a peek)

1510
01:04:21,461 --> 01:04:23,972
(Nice to meet you.)

1511
01:04:23,972 --> 01:04:27,271
The tree came in. Look, the tree came in.

1512
01:04:28,572 --> 01:04:30,412
The tree sat next to me.

1513
01:04:31,512 --> 01:04:32,512
What to do?

1514
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:36,481
(Even after that, )

1515
01:04:37,952 --> 01:04:39,782
(At the generous touch of Mother Nature...)

1516
01:04:39,782 --> 01:04:41,751
(that comes from all directions...)

1517
01:04:42,552 --> 01:04:45,351
(Ticklish)

1518
01:04:46,921 --> 01:04:51,432
(Once they compose themselves, )

1519
01:04:52,831 --> 01:04:54,601
(they can finally see Jeju's dense forest.)

1520
01:04:54,601 --> 01:04:55,831
My goodness.

1521
01:04:57,972 --> 01:04:59,972
It really feels like I'm overseas.

1522
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:01,642
This doesn't feel like Korea.

1523
01:05:03,142 --> 01:05:04,371
(Amazing)

1524
01:05:05,972 --> 01:05:09,512
It's amazing that there's a place like this in Korea.

1525
01:05:11,182 --> 01:05:13,521
(In this dense forest, )

1526
01:05:15,182 --> 01:05:20,992
(there are a lot of hidden beautiful views of Jeju.)

1527
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:28,001
(At the end of the rocky journey, )

1528
01:05:32,271 --> 01:05:36,842
(they finally arrive at this place!)

1529
01:05:37,711 --> 01:05:40,282
Gosh, we came all the way up here.

1530
01:05:41,081 --> 01:05:42,981
(Astonished)

1531
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:44,112
This is amazing!

1532
01:05:45,851 --> 01:05:48,052
We've arrived.

1533
01:05:50,592 --> 01:05:51,592
(Exhausted)

1534
01:05:51,592 --> 01:05:52,621
This is nice.

1535
01:05:52,621 --> 01:05:53,691
Can we walk back?

1536
01:05:55,222 --> 01:05:57,461
Why don't we walk back home later?

1537
01:05:57,992 --> 01:06:03,972
(Jeju's hidden jewel, Hill Viewpoint)

1538
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:06,501
This is no joke.

1539
01:06:10,771 --> 01:06:15,041
(At the wide and unblocked view, )

1540
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:20,182
(their eyes become wide open.)

1541
01:06:21,382 --> 01:06:24,722
There's nothing blocking the view since there are no tall buildings.

1542
01:06:25,892 --> 01:06:26,921
This is no joke.

1543
01:06:26,921 --> 01:06:28,892
(This place that captured everyone's eyes...)

1544
01:06:29,932 --> 01:06:31,262
Jeju Island is really pretty.

1545
01:06:31,262 --> 01:06:35,162
Jeju Island is such a pretty place.

1546
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:37,532
(is a special viewpoint where you can see the east of Jeju at once.)

1547
01:06:38,831 --> 01:06:39,941
This is fascinating.

1548
01:06:39,941 --> 01:06:42,572
When we first traveled here, I didn't feel any of this.

1549
01:06:42,572 --> 01:06:45,211
- Back then, we went to the west. - Yes.

1550
01:06:45,211 --> 01:06:47,541
It'll be really nice to build a house here.

1551
01:06:47,981 --> 01:06:49,441
Just that it's hard to come up here.

1552
01:06:50,081 --> 01:06:51,112
We can ride the car.

1553
01:06:51,112 --> 01:06:53,521
- Ride that car. - We can come up like this.

1554
01:06:53,521 --> 01:06:55,921
(They will be banging their heads every time they come back home.)

1555
01:06:56,081 --> 01:06:59,592
But this is definitely not somewhere you can come easily.

1556
01:07:02,322 --> 01:07:08,432
(The place where you can look down on Jeju's oceans and mountains...)

1557
01:07:08,432 --> 01:07:09,831
(in 360°.)

1558
01:07:12,302 --> 01:07:16,001
Which side is this from Mount Halla?

1559
01:07:16,271 --> 01:07:18,012
This is the middle.

1560
01:07:18,441 --> 01:07:21,081
- That's ﻿Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak. - I see!

1561
01:07:21,081 --> 01:07:23,751
- Then... - That's the east.

1562
01:07:23,751 --> 01:07:24,782
That's the east.

1563
01:07:24,782 --> 01:07:26,251
(﻿Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak in the east of Jeju...)

1564
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:29,552
Right behind it is Mount Halla. That's the west.

1565
01:07:29,552 --> 01:07:30,552
(and Mount Halla in the middle can be seen at once.)

1566
01:07:30,751 --> 01:07:32,151
(Mount Halla, Hill Viewpoint, and Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak)

1567
01:07:32,151 --> 01:07:36,592
(This view can be seen only from Hill Viewpoint.)

1568
01:07:39,092 --> 01:07:42,361
- The sea that you're looking at... - Yes.

1569
01:07:42,972 --> 01:07:45,772
is the South Sea, which is at the end of the Korean peninsula.

1570
01:07:46,171 --> 01:07:47,942
Is this the South Sea?

1571
01:07:47,942 --> 01:07:49,302
Yes, it's the South Sea.

1572
01:07:51,312 --> 01:07:53,081
(The South Sea that connects the peninsula and Jeju...)

1573
01:07:53,081 --> 01:07:54,882
(is right in front of their eyes.)

1574
01:07:54,882 --> 01:07:56,951
(Gimnyeong-ri)

1575
01:07:57,552 --> 01:07:59,921
- I see. - You're looking at...

1576
01:07:59,921 --> 01:08:04,692
a sixth of Jeju's coastline at once.

1577
01:08:04,692 --> 01:08:06,692
- From there... - A sixth?

1578
01:08:06,692 --> 01:08:07,692
to here?

1579
01:08:07,692 --> 01:08:09,762
- That's pretty wide. - If you look at this direction,

1580
01:08:10,361 --> 01:08:13,001
Do you see the rectangular peak over there?

1581
01:08:13,001 --> 01:08:14,001
- Yes! - Yes.

1582
01:08:14,001 --> 01:08:16,262
That is Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak, which is in the very east of Jeju.

1583
01:08:16,571 --> 01:08:18,602
- I see. - I told you.

1584
01:08:19,842 --> 01:08:25,472
(You can see a 6th of Jeju's coastline unfolded widely.)

1585
01:08:26,812 --> 01:08:29,652
(On top of the marvelous view, )

1586
01:08:31,382 --> 01:08:34,281
(you can enjoy Mount Halla and groups of oreum...)

1587
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:35,281
(in a panoramic view.)

1588
01:08:35,281 --> 01:08:38,552
(Utbamaegi Oreum and Albam Oreum)

1589
01:08:39,022 --> 01:08:40,892
(﻿Ujinjebi Oreum)

1590
01:08:41,361 --> 01:08:42,921
(Geomun Oreum)

1591
01:08:43,562 --> 01:08:44,562
(Amazed)

1592
01:08:46,632 --> 01:08:48,461
I've been to Jeju so many times,

1593
01:08:48,461 --> 01:08:49,602
but this is my first time...

1594
01:08:49,602 --> 01:08:50,902
- Same here. - coming to a place like this.

1595
01:08:50,902 --> 01:08:54,001
Same. I didn't know there's a place like this in Jeju Island.

1596
01:08:54,001 --> 01:08:57,272
From Seongsan Ilchulbong Peak to Jeju-si.

1597
01:08:57,272 --> 01:09:00,211
It's amazing you can see everything.

1598
01:09:00,211 --> 01:09:02,741
The whole northeast.

1599
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:06,211
I think the view here is prettier than the view from Mount Halla.

1600
01:09:06,211 --> 01:09:08,882
Exactly! There's no other place with this kind of view.

1601
01:09:09,222 --> 01:09:11,352
Mount Halla must have been...

1602
01:09:11,352 --> 01:09:14,092
very active in the past.

1603
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:17,232
Don't you remember when Mount Halla exploded?

1604
01:09:17,432 --> 01:09:18,432
- Me? - Yes.

1605
01:09:18,432 --> 01:09:20,132
Of course I remember. It was such chaos.

1606
01:09:20,432 --> 01:09:21,762
It must have been big news.

1607
01:09:22,562 --> 01:09:23,871
It was big indeed.

1608
01:09:24,071 --> 01:09:26,031
(Jin Goo...)

1609
01:09:26,331 --> 01:09:29,472
You left the house for a while, but you can't get used to it already.

1610
01:09:29,472 --> 01:09:31,842
No, he went and learned something.

1611
01:09:32,972 --> 01:09:34,882
He learned something very bad.

1612
01:09:34,882 --> 01:09:36,241
(You learned something unnecessary!)

1613
01:09:36,751 --> 01:09:39,081
(Meanwhile, Si Wan is focused on the map.)

1614
01:09:40,751 --> 01:09:43,921
This place is really cool. It's really cool.

1615
01:09:44,451 --> 01:09:46,692
- I'll take a nice picture! - Okay.

1616
01:09:46,692 --> 01:09:47,991
- Here. - He's like our guide.

1617
01:09:47,991 --> 01:09:49,321
Let's take one before Hee Won comes.

1618
01:09:49,321 --> 01:09:50,461
(Joking)

1619
01:09:50,461 --> 01:09:53,531
I'll take one. I'll take the full view.

1620
01:09:54,262 --> 01:09:56,602
Here we go. Start.

1621
01:09:56,932 --> 01:10:00,142
(Spinning)

1622
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:03,642
That quick? Is it okay?

1623
01:10:04,041 --> 01:10:06,012
You didn't even take our picture!

1624
01:10:06,012 --> 01:10:07,041
This...

1625
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:09,182
I did, look!

1626
01:10:09,182 --> 01:10:11,052
We'll look very tiny!

1627
01:10:11,052 --> 01:10:13,052
- You took the HMMWV! - Yes.

1628
01:10:13,052 --> 01:10:14,821
- It's the full view with HMMWV. - You pressed this.

1629
01:10:14,821 --> 01:10:15,821
This is nice.

1630
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:17,852
- It's nice, right? Look at this. - Yes.

1631
01:10:17,852 --> 01:10:19,762
- Good job. - I like this.

1632
01:10:19,762 --> 01:10:21,062
- It looks okay, doesn't it? - It's nice.

1633
01:10:21,062 --> 01:10:22,092
(Hee Won had a plan...)

1634
01:10:22,092 --> 01:10:24,232
(for the panorama photo.)

1635
01:10:24,692 --> 01:10:25,831
Look here.

1636
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:28,501
(It will remain in their memories for a long time.)

1637
01:10:29,232 --> 01:10:31,671
(Leaving a precious page of the journey)

1638
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:35,241
(Amazing view)

1639
01:10:35,241 --> 01:10:38,111
(The four family members' first family photo)

1640
01:10:38,911 --> 01:10:41,541
Jin Goo, let's have our guards ready.

1641
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:43,111
Yes.

1642
01:10:43,152 --> 01:10:44,382
I need to wrap myself up...

1643
01:10:44,382 --> 01:10:47,781
to block out the branches. Hee Won, you too.

1644
01:10:47,882 --> 01:10:51,222
(Hee Won wraps himself up following Dong Il.)

1645
01:10:51,421 --> 01:10:52,692
Did you put your seat belt on?

1646
01:10:53,421 --> 01:10:58,831
(Let's go back to our warm house!)

1647
01:11:01,762 --> 01:11:02,802
Oh my gosh, no!

1648
01:11:02,802 --> 01:11:04,972
- This... This... - Goodness!

1649
01:11:04,972 --> 01:11:06,031
(The road is still rough, )

1650
01:11:06,432 --> 01:11:07,671
I got used to it.

1651
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:08,802
(but they learned how to deal with it.)

1652
01:11:08,802 --> 01:11:10,111
(Clenching their fists)

1653
01:11:10,972 --> 01:11:12,642
(Blocking his face)

1654
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:16,482
(Picking up)

1655
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:18,852
You got your souvenir?

1656
01:11:18,852 --> 01:11:20,182
(He is relaxed enough to keep a souvenir!)

1657
01:11:20,182 --> 01:11:23,392
You got your souvenir.

1658
01:11:24,692 --> 01:11:26,991
(The front yard trip was more enjoyable...)

1659
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,392
Thank you for your hard work!

1660
01:11:28,392 --> 01:11:30,432
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for today.

1661
01:11:30,432 --> 01:11:31,432
(because they went together.)

1662
01:11:32,361 --> 01:11:33,402
That was fun.

1663
01:11:35,432 --> 01:11:38,031
I saw another side of Jeju Island.

1664
01:11:38,232 --> 01:11:39,232
Exactly.

1665
01:11:40,071 --> 01:11:42,772
- What should we eat for dinner? - What should we eat?

1666
01:11:42,772 --> 01:11:45,942
Dinner? Black pork. Dombe meat?

1667
01:11:45,942 --> 01:11:47,482
(Sounds good.)

1668
01:11:47,682 --> 01:11:51,581
But is dombe meat different from bossam?

1669
01:11:51,982 --> 01:11:55,921
Dombe is a Jeju dialect, which means cutting board.

1670
01:11:55,921 --> 01:11:58,022
It's called dombe meat because it's meat on a cutting board.

1671
01:11:58,451 --> 01:11:59,491
Black pork.

1672
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:02,222
(Dombe meat is cut and eaten directly from a cutting board.)

1673
01:12:02,262 --> 01:12:03,892
You boil the meat...

1674
01:12:03,892 --> 01:12:05,331
(It's a traditional dish where they share it with others for holidays.)

1675
01:12:05,331 --> 01:12:06,961
- Yes. - That's how the meat is cooked.

1676
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:08,861
- I see. - Meat on a cutting board.

1677
01:12:08,861 --> 01:12:11,472
That means that we always had dombe meat.

1678
01:12:11,772 --> 01:12:13,942
Yes, we always had dombe meat.

1679
01:12:14,902 --> 01:12:17,871
- We've always had dombe meat. - We didn't miss a day.

1680
01:12:18,111 --> 01:12:20,312
We had dombe sashimi, dombe seasoned vegetables,

1681
01:12:20,312 --> 01:12:21,611
- and dombe gimbap. - Dombe gimbap.

1682
01:12:21,611 --> 01:12:23,852
- Dombe steak. - Dombe trout sashimi.

1683
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:25,882
- Oh, right. - You even had trout sashimi?

1684
01:12:25,882 --> 01:12:28,382
(They love having food on "dombe".)

1685
01:12:28,821 --> 01:12:30,722
- Dombe everything. - Everything we had...

1686
01:12:30,722 --> 01:12:32,121
on House on Wheels was a dombe dish.

1687
01:12:32,192 --> 01:12:33,661
We always serve it on that.

1688
01:12:33,892 --> 01:12:37,531
Then let's have boiled pork with black pork.

1689
01:12:37,892 --> 01:12:38,932
- Okay. - Let's have dombe meat.

1690
01:12:38,932 --> 01:12:41,132
- We can have dombe meat. - Let's boil it.

1691
01:12:41,132 --> 01:12:42,802
- Just like boiled pork? - Using black pork.

1692
01:12:42,802 --> 01:12:43,802
(Dombe meat has a deep flavor as it's hard-boiled in broth.)

1693
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:45,871
It's bound to be good.

1694
01:12:45,972 --> 01:12:48,442
Along with dombe meat, let's have...

1695
01:12:49,371 --> 01:12:51,411
- Seafood jjamppong. - Seafood jjamppong?

1696
01:12:51,812 --> 01:12:53,382
Does anyone know how to make seafood jjamppong?

1697
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:55,642
Si Wan and I know how to make it.

1698
01:12:55,911 --> 01:12:57,812
- Then let's have that. - Jjamppong.

1699
01:12:58,312 --> 01:13:02,022
(Adding lots of fresh seafood caught in Jeju Island)

1700
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:04,152
(I got you!)

1701
01:13:04,352 --> 01:13:06,722
(Stone octopus)

1702
01:13:06,961 --> 01:13:09,491
(Mussels)

1703
01:13:09,692 --> 01:13:12,161
(Abalone)

1704
01:13:12,762 --> 01:13:14,762
(And plump red-banded lobster!)

1705
01:13:14,762 --> 01:13:16,772
(It's as good as seafood stew!)

1706
01:13:17,232 --> 01:13:19,472
(Adding lots of ingredients)

1707
01:13:19,472 --> 01:13:21,402
(Burning)

1708
01:13:21,972 --> 01:13:23,871
(Deep soup that has smoky flavor)

1709
01:13:23,871 --> 01:13:25,371
If you're making seafood jjamppong,

1710
01:13:25,371 --> 01:13:26,442
I'll have rice with it.

1711
01:13:26,442 --> 01:13:28,482
We can make it into soup without noodles.

1712
01:13:28,482 --> 01:13:29,911
- We could do that. - I'll have rice with jjamppong.

1713
01:13:29,911 --> 01:13:32,611
- Yes, let's do that. - We're having jjamppong?

1714
01:13:33,882 --> 01:13:34,882
I'm suddenly feeling hungry.

1715
01:13:34,882 --> 01:13:36,022
(Imagining it made him hungry.)

1716
01:13:36,281 --> 01:13:37,352
(Jeju Island's seafood jjamppong)

1717
01:13:37,352 --> 01:13:38,652
I'm suddenly feeling hungry.

1718
01:13:39,352 --> 01:13:41,461
- Jjamppong soup! - Jjamppong soup!

1719
01:13:41,621 --> 01:13:43,461
I can't believe we're having jjamppong.

1720
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:46,531
Let's work together to make jjamppong, Jin Goo.

1721
01:13:46,661 --> 01:13:48,062
- Let's do it. - Okay.

1722
01:13:49,402 --> 01:13:51,472
Jin Goo, the sun is setting.

1723
01:13:51,531 --> 01:13:52,772
You should move faster.

1724
01:13:53,571 --> 01:13:54,602
- Okay. - It's setting soon.

1725
01:13:54,602 --> 01:13:56,171
- The sun is setting. - Only until the sun is up.

1726
01:13:56,171 --> 01:13:57,942
You'll be treated like a guest only until the sun is up.

1727
01:13:57,942 --> 01:13:59,111
The sun is setting.

1728
01:13:59,111 --> 01:14:00,611
Jin Goo, the sun is setting.

1729
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:03,411
Let's move faster.

1730
01:14:03,751 --> 01:14:06,722
The sun sets early here because we're in the mountains.

1731
01:14:06,722 --> 01:14:07,882
(It's time to work as a member of the family.)

1732
01:14:08,052 --> 01:14:09,751
It's been quite a while since I saw the sun.

1733
01:14:09,991 --> 01:14:12,251
(Laughing)

1734
01:14:12,692 --> 01:14:16,222
(They all waited for this moment.)

1735
01:14:16,222 --> 01:14:17,991
Jin Goo, I'm so happy that you're here.

1736
01:14:20,762 --> 01:14:24,071
(Laughing)

1737
01:14:24,531 --> 01:14:27,472
I'll be your assistant.

1738
01:14:27,472 --> 01:14:28,642
Please, thank you.

1739
01:14:29,302 --> 01:14:32,812
(He washes the vegetables...)

1740
01:14:32,812 --> 01:14:34,482
(and passes them to Jin Goo.)

1741
01:14:34,482 --> 01:14:38,152
- I'll be cutting the vegetables. - Okay.

1742
01:14:38,152 --> 01:14:39,382
(Jin Goo cuts the vegetables.)

1743
01:14:39,781 --> 01:14:41,251
(Cabbage will make the soup refreshing.)

1744
01:14:41,251 --> 01:14:43,281
(Hitting)

1745
01:14:43,991 --> 01:14:47,522
(Cutting it sideways to make the broth seep in)

1746
01:14:48,121 --> 01:14:49,921
(What's this sound?)

1747
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:52,961
My, Jin Goo. You know how to use a knife.

1748
01:14:53,232 --> 01:14:55,361
(Smiling bashfully)

1749
01:14:55,531 --> 01:14:57,132
You're so good.

1750
01:14:57,132 --> 01:14:58,632
(The vegetables pile up in no time.)

1751
01:14:58,902 --> 01:15:02,071
Let's start boiling the meat, Hee Won.

1752
01:15:02,272 --> 01:15:03,342
Okay.

1753
01:15:04,342 --> 01:15:06,472
Don't we need to put in doenjang?

1754
01:15:06,472 --> 01:15:08,411
What? It doesn't look good?

1755
01:15:08,411 --> 01:15:09,982
No, don't we need to put in doenjang?

1756
01:15:09,982 --> 01:15:11,352
Take a spoon.

1757
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:14,152
- Let's have this later. - Okay.

1758
01:15:14,621 --> 01:15:15,982
- It's ready. - Okay.

1759
01:15:15,982 --> 01:15:18,152
(Once it simmers, dombe meat will be ready.)

1760
01:15:18,152 --> 01:15:19,152
(Putting on a stone to close it tightly)

1761
01:15:19,152 --> 01:15:20,291
There you go.

1762
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:23,461
(Exclaiming)

1763
01:15:24,232 --> 01:15:26,432
(The Jeju Island's seafood they'll put in jjamppong)

1764
01:15:26,432 --> 01:15:27,501
What's this?

1765
01:15:28,701 --> 01:15:29,701
It's abalone.

1766
01:15:29,701 --> 01:15:31,201
(Wild, gigantic abalone)

1767
01:15:31,201 --> 01:15:33,302
Have you ever seen such a huge abalone?

1768
01:15:34,402 --> 01:15:35,472
Look at this.

1769
01:15:35,472 --> 01:15:38,472
(It's difficult to see an abalone this big on the mainland.)

1770
01:15:39,711 --> 01:15:41,882
(Jaw-dropping)

1771
01:15:42,411 --> 01:15:43,581
What's this?

1772
01:15:43,781 --> 01:15:45,152
It's wild abalone.

1773
01:15:45,251 --> 01:15:47,121
(He can't take his eyes off of it.)

1774
01:15:47,121 --> 01:15:48,652
What kind of abalone is that big?

1775
01:15:48,652 --> 01:15:49,751
(Starting with the gigantic abalone...)

1776
01:15:49,751 --> 01:15:51,092
The abalone is...

1777
01:15:52,451 --> 01:15:54,222
This is wild mussel.

1778
01:15:54,222 --> 01:15:55,592
- These are mussels? - Yes.

1779
01:15:55,861 --> 01:15:57,092
And this is stone octopus.

1780
01:15:57,092 --> 01:15:58,461
(Huge stone octopus)

1781
01:15:58,461 --> 01:16:00,331
(Surprised)

1782
01:16:00,632 --> 01:16:01,902
- That's... - Is it okay...

1783
01:16:01,902 --> 01:16:03,432
to put that in jjamppong?

1784
01:16:03,571 --> 01:16:06,432
Wow, it's too good to put in jjamppong.

1785
01:16:06,942 --> 01:16:08,241
This is shrimp.

1786
01:16:08,342 --> 01:16:11,512
- Jin Goo, I'll clean them up fast. - Okay, clean them.

1787
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:14,342
(The jjamppong brothers became anxious.)

1788
01:16:14,342 --> 01:16:15,342
(Exclaiming)

1789
01:16:15,342 --> 01:16:16,951
Wow, this is an abalone?

1790
01:16:16,951 --> 01:16:18,312
(Awestruck)

1791
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:19,382
This is...

1792
01:16:19,512 --> 01:16:21,281
How come it's so big?

1793
01:16:21,281 --> 01:16:23,121
(It's hard to grab it in one hand.)

1794
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:24,491
The abalone is...

1795
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:28,022
(While Si Wan cleans the seafood...)

1796
01:16:29,222 --> 01:16:31,592
Calm down. You're not forgetting anything, are you?

1797
01:16:31,762 --> 01:16:32,762
Okay.

1798
01:16:33,092 --> 01:16:34,402
(Later...)

1799
01:16:34,402 --> 01:16:36,361
(Laughing)

1800
01:16:37,371 --> 01:16:39,001
Gosh, my wrist is going to snap.

1801
01:16:39,001 --> 01:16:41,171
(Jin Goo brought out a huge wok.)

1802
01:16:41,171 --> 01:16:42,671
Is it possible to heat this up?

1803
01:16:42,802 --> 01:16:44,711
I've never seen a wok this big.

1804
01:16:45,871 --> 01:16:47,241
How do I...

1805
01:16:47,512 --> 01:16:49,081
It's too big.

1806
01:16:49,081 --> 01:16:50,251
(I need to wash it clean first.)

1807
01:16:50,251 --> 01:16:51,382
It's really heavy though.

1808
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:53,052
The wok itself is heavy, right?

1809
01:16:53,882 --> 01:16:56,552
(Struggling)

1810
01:16:57,852 --> 01:16:59,192
(This is like a gym.)

1811
01:16:59,192 --> 01:17:00,661
(Grunting)

1812
01:17:00,661 --> 01:17:01,661
(Struggling)

1813
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:04,831
My gosh, this is...

1814
01:17:04,831 --> 01:17:08,031
(He's surprised by its size over and over again.)

1815
01:17:08,031 --> 01:17:10,632
(Putting it down stably)

1816
01:17:12,232 --> 01:17:13,232
(He got the seafood that he cleaned.)

1817
01:17:13,232 --> 01:17:14,942
This is unbelievable.

1818
01:17:15,871 --> 01:17:18,571
(Taking condiments)

1819
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:20,882
Jin Goo, show us how you work the wok.

1820
01:17:20,982 --> 01:17:23,012
I've never used it though. I'm in trouble.

1821
01:17:23,442 --> 01:17:26,081
(All the ingredients for jjamppong are ready.)

1822
01:17:26,512 --> 01:17:27,951
Do you think I can pull it off?

1823
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:29,421
Do you think I can use this?

1824
01:17:29,421 --> 01:17:30,451
(It's time to make Jeju Island jjamppong.)

1825
01:17:30,451 --> 01:17:32,692
Hey, Batch One. Batch One of House on Wheels.

1826
01:17:32,892 --> 01:17:34,522
You must be able to use it.

1827
01:17:34,522 --> 01:17:35,722
(It's nothing since you're experienced.)

1828
01:17:36,392 --> 01:17:39,291
(Safely filmed with the permission of the county office)

1829
01:17:39,331 --> 01:17:42,361
(Heating the wok)

1830
01:17:43,001 --> 01:17:45,602
(Putting oil on the heated wok)

1831
01:17:45,831 --> 01:17:47,371
(This is looking good.)

1832
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:48,571
You look professional.

1833
01:17:49,571 --> 01:17:50,911
Wow, we're having jjamppong.

1834
01:17:50,911 --> 01:17:51,942
(He's already excited at the smell of the oil.)

1835
01:17:52,371 --> 01:17:54,382
(All sorts of vegetables)

1836
01:17:54,382 --> 01:17:56,012
It'll look incredible.

1837
01:17:57,482 --> 01:17:59,111
It suddenly turned into a Chinese restaurant.

1838
01:17:59,111 --> 01:18:00,652
- It really did. - Right?

1839
01:18:00,652 --> 01:18:02,022
- It suddenly... - Right?

1840
01:18:02,621 --> 01:18:03,692
(Creating a whirlwind)

1841
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:05,821
You look professional cooking with the wok.

1842
01:18:06,421 --> 01:18:09,262
(Showing off his killer move)

1843
01:18:09,461 --> 01:18:13,161
(Tossing the wok like Chinese chefs)

1844
01:18:16,201 --> 01:18:17,932
(Goodness, Jin Goo...)

1845
01:18:17,932 --> 01:18:18,932
Is it working?

1846
01:18:20,442 --> 01:18:23,642
(You said this is your first time.)

1847
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:26,041
I need to use both hands because it's too heavy.

1848
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:27,241
(He's amazed at himself too.)

1849
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:30,682
I can't believe I'm having jjamppong here.

1850
01:18:31,182 --> 01:18:32,281
(Adding oyster sauce)

1851
01:18:32,281 --> 01:18:34,552
(Sizzling)

1852
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,451
(Adding red chili pepper powder)

1853
01:18:37,751 --> 01:18:40,692
(Stirring lightly)

1854
01:18:41,291 --> 01:18:43,262
(Then he fries them by tossing the wok.)

1855
01:18:43,262 --> 01:18:44,361
(Looking spicy)

1856
01:18:44,361 --> 01:18:45,361
It smells spicy.

1857
01:18:46,192 --> 01:18:47,861
(Grunting)

1858
01:18:47,861 --> 01:18:49,132
(He does his best to toss the wok.)

1859
01:18:50,062 --> 01:18:51,371
It smells like jjamppong.

1860
01:18:53,531 --> 01:18:54,541
(Adding broth that they boiled in advance)

1861
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:56,342
So this is the jjamppong broth, right?

1862
01:18:56,472 --> 01:18:57,611
- Yes. - Right?

1863
01:18:57,942 --> 01:18:59,012
(Adding huge mussels that Si Wan cleaned)

1864
01:18:59,012 --> 01:19:00,642
They all fit because the wok is huge.

1865
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:02,711
The color of the soup is like that of jjamppong.

1866
01:19:03,111 --> 01:19:04,812
(Adding red-banded lobster as well)

1867
01:19:04,812 --> 01:19:06,411
I can't believe we're having jjamppong here.

1868
01:19:07,382 --> 01:19:08,751
It's looking good.

1869
01:19:09,652 --> 01:19:11,722
Jin Goo, is it working?

1870
01:19:12,751 --> 01:19:13,821
Wow, Si Wan.

1871
01:19:14,991 --> 01:19:16,062
Is it working?

1872
01:19:16,062 --> 01:19:17,892
Si Wan, I must be skilled in making Chinese food.

1873
01:19:17,892 --> 01:19:18,961
(He's feeling ecstatic.)

1874
01:19:18,961 --> 01:19:21,361
- I must be skilled in it. - Really? Does it look good?

1875
01:19:21,562 --> 01:19:22,562
Let's see.

1876
01:19:22,562 --> 01:19:23,562
(Spicy soup with lots of seafood)

1877
01:19:23,562 --> 01:19:26,031
- How come it turned out well? - Let me see, Jin Goo.

1878
01:19:26,671 --> 01:19:28,001
What's this?

1879
01:19:29,371 --> 01:19:30,642
It looks like jjamppong.

1880
01:19:31,972 --> 01:19:33,571
The color of the soup is like that of jjamppong.

1881
01:19:33,682 --> 01:19:36,581
(High-quality jjamppong filled with fresh seafood)

1882
01:19:37,581 --> 01:19:39,182
I'm sure it'll be good.

1883
01:19:39,652 --> 01:19:40,781
It looks good.

1884
01:19:41,781 --> 01:19:43,751
Oh, right. We need to boil the noodles.

1885
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:47,692
(It's almost done, so he gives it a taste.)

1886
01:19:47,692 --> 01:19:49,861
(Excited)

1887
01:19:53,732 --> 01:19:56,831
(Let me try it again.)

1888
01:19:57,171 --> 01:19:58,331
(We can't tell what he's thinking.)

1889
01:19:58,331 --> 01:20:01,001
(Si Wan...)

1890
01:20:01,272 --> 01:20:03,371
(It's impossible for it to taste bad.)

1891
01:20:03,911 --> 01:20:07,312
(What happened to their jjamppong?)

1892
01:20:07,342 --> 01:20:08,581
- Si Wan. - Yes?

1893
01:20:08,581 --> 01:20:10,411
(What is it?)

1894
01:20:10,812 --> 01:20:13,611
I think I didn't waste all these seafood, thankfully.

1895
01:20:14,652 --> 01:20:15,982
(Of course it's good!)

1896
01:20:15,982 --> 01:20:17,991
I can tell that the soup is good.

1897
01:20:18,852 --> 01:20:22,762
(He can't help but smile.)

1898
01:20:22,961 --> 01:20:24,092
Jin Goo, you need to hold this.

1899
01:20:24,092 --> 01:20:26,192
If you drop it, you'll be in big trouble.

1900
01:20:26,831 --> 01:20:29,001
(Tasting)

1901
01:20:29,001 --> 01:20:30,161
(Impressed)

1902
01:20:30,432 --> 01:20:31,732
(Tasting it again...)

1903
01:20:31,732 --> 01:20:33,272
(and again...)

1904
01:20:33,272 --> 01:20:34,741
(and again)

1905
01:20:35,142 --> 01:20:36,342
Wow, this is insane.

1906
01:20:37,142 --> 01:20:38,312
Am I tasting it too much?

1907
01:20:38,711 --> 01:20:39,772
This will be the last one.

1908
01:20:40,581 --> 01:20:42,711
(At this rate, he might finish the whole soup.)

1909
01:20:42,911 --> 01:20:44,751
(Satisfied)

1910
01:20:45,152 --> 01:20:46,652
Don't be greedy. This is good enough.

1911
01:20:46,882 --> 01:20:48,081
This is good enough.

1912
01:20:48,581 --> 01:20:50,182
- Are you done with jjamppong? - Yes.

1913
01:20:50,321 --> 01:20:51,652
We only need to boil noodles now.

1914
01:20:51,652 --> 01:20:52,921
I think there's too little soup.

1915
01:20:52,921 --> 01:20:56,192
If we remove the mussels, we'll have enough soup.

1916
01:20:56,491 --> 01:20:57,762
It's well-seasoned.

1917
01:20:58,192 --> 01:21:00,291
I succeeded in making jjamppong.

1918
01:21:01,701 --> 01:21:04,232
(Meanwhile, the dombe meat is well-simmered.)

1919
01:21:04,602 --> 01:21:07,472
This one smells amazing too.

1920
01:21:07,472 --> 01:21:08,571
It's amazing, isn't it?

1921
01:21:09,371 --> 01:21:10,571
Look at the broth.

1922
01:21:10,611 --> 01:21:12,342
- My gosh. - I bet the broth is amazing.

1923
01:21:12,342 --> 01:21:13,442
(He's waiting with the cutting board.)

1924
01:21:14,111 --> 01:21:17,081
(All the grease is removed, and the meat looks chewy.)

1925
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:19,182
- Here. - It's a waste to throw it away.

1926
01:21:19,182 --> 01:21:21,382
No, we're going to make kimchi stew with this.

1927
01:21:21,382 --> 01:21:23,991
(The black pork broth will be used well.)

1928
01:21:24,991 --> 01:21:26,022
- Hang on. Come here. - I...

1929
01:21:26,022 --> 01:21:27,092
(Steam rising)

1930
01:21:27,722 --> 01:21:28,722
(This must be when the meat tastes the best.)

1931
01:21:28,722 --> 01:21:30,762
My gosh. This is...

1932
01:21:31,262 --> 01:21:33,132
(Tasting the tip of the meat)

1933
01:21:33,432 --> 01:21:36,602
Try it. It's totally...

1934
01:21:36,932 --> 01:21:39,402
(Chewy)

1935
01:21:39,902 --> 01:21:40,942
(Giving a piece to Si Wan who was boiling noodles)

1936
01:21:40,942 --> 01:21:42,342
Try this.

1937
01:21:44,041 --> 01:21:45,541
(Impressed)

1938
01:21:45,541 --> 01:21:47,842
It's amazing as it goes inside my mouth.

1939
01:21:48,512 --> 01:21:51,111
I only boiled it. I didn't add anything.

1940
01:21:51,111 --> 01:21:52,111
(Jin Goo has a bite too.)

1941
01:21:52,281 --> 01:21:54,052
- My goodness, Dong Il. - It's not smelly at all, right?

1942
01:21:54,052 --> 01:21:55,121
Not at all.

1943
01:21:57,451 --> 01:21:58,522
(The pork calls for applause.)

1944
01:21:58,522 --> 01:22:00,421
- This is... - Hee Won is the sensitive one.

1945
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:02,121
- Does it smell or not? - Not at all.

1946
01:22:02,121 --> 01:22:03,621
- It doesn't smell at all, does it? - It's so good.

1947
01:22:03,621 --> 01:22:04,692
It's good.

1948
01:22:05,031 --> 01:22:06,192
It's delicious.

1949
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:08,331
Today will be a feast.

1950
01:22:08,331 --> 01:22:09,932
(Seafood jjamppong and dombe meat. Isn't this too perfect?)

1951
01:22:09,932 --> 01:22:10,932
Jin Goo, it's a feast.

1952
01:22:10,932 --> 01:22:13,071
I know. I think today's dinner...

1953
01:22:13,071 --> 01:22:15,041
- It's incredible. - will be amazing.

1954
01:22:15,041 --> 01:22:16,342
Do we have it with kimchi?

1955
01:22:16,342 --> 01:22:18,241
There's kimchi for bossam.

1956
01:22:18,442 --> 01:22:20,781
(He goes to cut kimchi.)

1957
01:22:21,012 --> 01:22:23,182
Jin Goo, here. Have one more piece.

1958
01:22:23,642 --> 01:22:24,852
You have it.

1959
01:22:24,852 --> 01:22:25,882
(Smiling like a dad)

1960
01:22:26,251 --> 01:22:27,581
(He got lucky because he was standing next to Dong Il.)

1961
01:22:27,581 --> 01:22:28,921
(Expressing it with his face)

1962
01:22:28,921 --> 01:22:31,451
My gosh, this is... How is it so chewy?

1963
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:32,621
It's good, right?

1964
01:22:34,522 --> 01:22:36,392
(Dong Il saves the dombe meat at the speed of light.)

1965
01:22:36,392 --> 01:22:37,732
Gosh, that scared me.

1966
01:22:38,092 --> 01:22:39,661
(He was frightened out of his wits.)

1967
01:22:39,661 --> 01:22:41,432
Gosh, that scared me to death.

1968
01:22:41,501 --> 01:22:42,861
My heart just dropped.

1969
01:22:43,361 --> 01:22:45,432
(Si Wan is boiling noodles for jjamppong.)

1970
01:22:45,432 --> 01:22:47,272
Wow, it's amazing.

1971
01:22:47,371 --> 01:22:50,442
Today's lunch and dinner are on another level.

1972
01:22:50,442 --> 01:22:51,512
(He's having a meal on the side.)

1973
01:22:51,942 --> 01:22:53,611
- My gosh. - Look how juicy it is.

1974
01:22:53,611 --> 01:22:55,642
Isn't it incredibly juicy?

1975
01:22:55,642 --> 01:22:57,081
If you mix...

1976
01:22:57,081 --> 01:22:59,482
the doenjang from the fridge,

1977
01:22:59,482 --> 01:23:02,052
- Yes. - chopped Cheongyang chili,

1978
01:23:02,052 --> 01:23:04,991
- And? Make a wrap? - and crushed garlic...

1979
01:23:05,251 --> 01:23:06,592
If you mix them,

1980
01:23:06,852 --> 01:23:09,861
it will become an incredible sauce.

1981
01:23:10,321 --> 01:23:12,031
(In the kitchen where everyone is busy)

1982
01:23:12,031 --> 01:23:13,592
This is homemade doenjang.

1983
01:23:14,361 --> 01:23:17,102
(He takes a spot on the side...)

1984
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:20,642
(and starts chopping Cheongyang chili thin.)

1985
01:23:21,171 --> 01:23:23,201
(He doesn't measure anything and just adds them.)

1986
01:23:23,201 --> 01:23:24,272
(Adding crushed garlic)

1987
01:23:24,772 --> 01:23:25,911
(Adding homemade doenjang)

1988
01:23:26,571 --> 01:23:29,211
(I forgot the most important ingredient.)

1989
01:23:29,911 --> 01:23:32,581
- Look at kimchi. - Doesn't it look amazing?

1990
01:23:33,411 --> 01:23:34,722
Are you making ssamjang?

1991
01:23:34,722 --> 01:23:37,182
(Just mix all the ingredients, and you'll have ssamjang in no time.)

1992
01:23:37,921 --> 01:23:39,251
Is there anything I can help you with?

1993
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:41,592
I think I'm done with everything.

1994
01:23:41,762 --> 01:23:44,361
This is all I need to do also.

1995
01:23:44,892 --> 01:23:46,161
I think I'll be fine.

1996
01:23:46,161 --> 01:23:47,302
Okay.

1997
01:23:47,661 --> 01:23:49,632
- Amazing. - You did good work.

1998
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:51,272
Not at all. I didn't do anything much.

1999
01:23:51,272 --> 01:23:53,531
You cleaned all the ingredients.

2000
01:23:53,571 --> 01:23:55,802
Team Jjamppong, you should wrap up. It's all set.

2001
01:23:55,802 --> 01:23:57,071
- Okay. - Okay.

2002
01:23:57,571 --> 01:24:02,882
(The members work hard in their places to prepare dinner.)

2003
01:24:04,482 --> 01:24:07,921
(Adding noodles to the bowls)

2004
01:24:09,121 --> 01:24:11,451
(Adding seafood)

2005
01:24:11,451 --> 01:24:15,092
My gosh, look at the mussel.

2006
01:24:17,531 --> 01:24:19,661
My goodness, this is incredible.

2007
01:24:21,531 --> 01:24:23,201
Are you sure this is jjamppong?

2008
01:24:23,402 --> 01:24:25,501
- Yes. - This is jjamppong?

2009
01:24:25,632 --> 01:24:27,071
- It's jjamppong. - Wow.

2010
01:24:27,642 --> 01:24:29,671
It's like a seafood stew.

2011
01:24:29,671 --> 01:24:31,041
(And there's a stone octopus.)

2012
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:34,211
Look at them.

2013
01:24:34,482 --> 01:24:36,142
It's impossible for it to taste bad.

2014
01:24:39,352 --> 01:24:41,951
(A dinner table prepared with Jeju's specialties)

2015
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:44,991
Can I take a picture of this?

2016
01:24:44,991 --> 01:24:47,092
A picture? You're infringing copyright.

2017
01:24:47,092 --> 01:24:48,661
Okay. Take all you want.

2018
01:24:48,661 --> 01:24:50,491
Take it.

2019
01:24:50,491 --> 01:24:51,592
(I must take a photo of this.)

2020
01:24:52,491 --> 01:24:53,531
(I missed House on Wheels.)

2021
01:24:53,531 --> 01:24:55,932
(A feast of Jeju's specialties)

2022
01:24:56,262 --> 01:24:57,331
All right.

2023
01:24:57,331 --> 01:24:59,472
- Enjoy. - Thank you for the food.

2024
01:25:00,902 --> 01:25:04,571
You should open this, and...

2025
01:25:05,911 --> 01:25:07,911
- Just open it. - My goodness.

2026
01:25:08,812 --> 01:25:11,982
It's impossible to have a mussel this big in jjamppong.

2027
01:25:16,781 --> 01:25:19,022
You should taste the mussel first.

2028
01:25:20,522 --> 01:25:23,161
It fills your mouth. It's very filling.

2029
01:25:23,991 --> 01:25:25,291
It's incredible.

2030
01:25:27,331 --> 01:25:32,071
(Taking a bite of mussel as though he's having ribs)

2031
01:25:34,241 --> 01:25:36,541
(How is it?)

2032
01:25:37,671 --> 01:25:38,741
Jin Goo.

2033
01:25:42,976 --> 01:25:43,976
Jin Goo.

2034
01:25:47,146 --> 01:25:48,787
It's the best jjamppong in the world.

2035
01:25:48,787 --> 01:25:50,386
(He's serious.)

2036
01:25:50,747 --> 01:25:52,516
I'm serious. I'm not kidding.

2037
01:25:52,816 --> 01:25:55,827
I usually don't enjoy jjamppong.

2038
01:25:56,287 --> 01:25:57,657
Oh, really?

2039
01:25:58,197 --> 01:26:01,167
But the jjamppong you made is really good.

2040
01:26:01,167 --> 01:26:04,096
- My gosh. - I'm serious.

2041
01:26:04,096 --> 01:26:06,136
(He's relieved.)

2042
01:26:06,697 --> 01:26:08,566
Jin Goo is the best.

2043
01:26:08,566 --> 01:26:09,966
(And Jin Goo's hidden assistant, Si Wan)

2044
01:26:12,377 --> 01:26:16,247
I have nothing more to say. There's abalone, mussel,

2045
01:26:16,407 --> 01:26:18,747
- and stone octopus. - I know.

2046
01:26:21,686 --> 01:26:24,556
(Jin Goo takes a big bite too.)

2047
01:26:24,787 --> 01:26:27,186
(Touched)

2048
01:26:27,356 --> 01:26:30,487
(I'm so proud of myself.)

2049
01:26:30,997 --> 01:26:32,257
This jjamppong...

2050
01:26:32,257 --> 01:26:33,896
(It's incredible.)

2051
01:26:34,297 --> 01:26:35,997
The soup is amazing.

2052
01:26:35,997 --> 01:26:38,066
(Hee Won takes a big bite of the soup.)

2053
01:26:41,507 --> 01:26:42,636
(Exclaiming)

2054
01:26:44,737 --> 01:26:46,636
(He slurps in the noodles.)

2055
01:26:46,636 --> 01:26:48,306
Are you trying the noodles?

2056
01:26:49,346 --> 01:26:53,276
(Dong Il also slurps in the noodles.)

2057
01:26:54,587 --> 01:26:57,087
(Slurping)

2058
01:26:57,247 --> 01:27:00,056
(The front yard is filled with the sound of them slurping noodles.)

2059
01:27:01,526 --> 01:27:04,596
Look. I'm trying to get the noodles, but I got abalones as well.

2060
01:27:08,997 --> 01:27:11,237
There are so many abalones in jjamppong.

2061
01:27:12,297 --> 01:27:14,436
If you chew on something chewy, it's either abalone or octopus.

2062
01:27:14,436 --> 01:27:15,737
- Right. - That's right.

2063
01:27:16,837 --> 01:27:19,276
What is this thing?

2064
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:21,577
- It's red-banded lobster. - Oh, is it?

2065
01:27:22,846 --> 01:27:25,316
(Let me try it.)

2066
01:27:26,146 --> 01:27:27,146
(Exclaiming)

2067
01:27:29,617 --> 01:27:32,987
(He keeps going back for red-banded lobster.)

2068
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:35,186
(Exclaiming)

2069
01:27:36,757 --> 01:27:40,056
(He's a master of peeling the lobster shell.)

2070
01:27:40,697 --> 01:27:44,436
I love the red-banded lobster in jjamppong.

2071
01:27:44,436 --> 01:27:46,297
The red-banded lobster is...

2072
01:27:46,837 --> 01:27:49,466
Look at this. If you hold it like this and suck it,

2073
01:27:49,466 --> 01:27:51,306
- all the meat comes out. - Oh, really?

2074
01:27:51,306 --> 01:27:52,407
Yes.

2075
01:27:52,776 --> 01:27:54,207
I didn't eat it because I thought it'd be hard to peel.

2076
01:27:54,207 --> 01:27:56,877
- You're right. - The meat gets out like this.

2077
01:27:59,417 --> 01:28:00,877
(Sucking)

2078
01:28:01,386 --> 01:28:03,987
- It just comes out like that. - It comes out so smoothly.

2079
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:05,556
- Really? - Really?

2080
01:28:05,787 --> 01:28:07,056
How do I do it again?

2081
01:28:07,386 --> 01:28:08,426
Hold the tail.

2082
01:28:08,426 --> 01:28:10,526
Just suck out the meat.

2083
01:28:10,526 --> 01:28:12,056
- Like this? - Yes.

2084
01:28:12,056 --> 01:28:13,926
(Dong Il tries peeling the shell just as Hee Won told him.)

2085
01:28:14,367 --> 01:28:16,167
If you hold it too tight, the meat gets cut.

2086
01:28:16,167 --> 01:28:17,966
You need to hold it loose.

2087
01:28:18,766 --> 01:28:21,136
It's already cut on the inside.

2088
01:28:21,136 --> 01:28:22,737
Dong Il, give it another try.

2089
01:28:22,737 --> 01:28:24,476
Hee Won told me not to give up.

2090
01:28:24,976 --> 01:28:27,237
You're at the age where it's okay to give up.

2091
01:28:27,237 --> 01:28:28,747
(Laughing)

2092
01:28:28,747 --> 01:28:31,176
- See? It came out. - I know!

2093
01:28:31,176 --> 01:28:32,646
(He manages to take out the meat.)

2094
01:28:33,346 --> 01:28:35,587
Here, Hee Won. I didn't touch it.

2095
01:28:35,886 --> 01:28:37,117
I can't seem to do it.

2096
01:28:37,117 --> 01:28:38,617
- What? - It's not working.

2097
01:28:38,617 --> 01:28:41,587
Look at this. Hold it straight like this.

2098
01:28:41,726 --> 01:28:43,827
- Then... - Pull the tail.

2099
01:28:44,026 --> 01:28:46,997
- Wow, you're really good. - Hold it straight.

2100
01:28:47,827 --> 01:28:49,766
You need to straighten the tail first.

2101
01:28:50,566 --> 01:28:52,667
- Then suck the meat. - There you go.

2102

(Exclaiming)

2103
01:28:55,566 --> 01:28:57,907
Hee Won gave us a great tip.

2104
01:28:58,476 --> 01:29:00,676
I only found out accidentally.

2105
01:29:00,676 --> 01:29:02,747
This is how you have red-banded lobster.

2106
01:29:03,765 --> 01:29:06,765
(You must have rice when there's soup.)

2107
01:29:07,234 --> 01:29:09,635
(Hee Won also adds rice to the soup.)

2108
01:29:10,465 --> 01:29:12,074
I should have a bit of rice.

2109
01:29:14,005 --> 01:29:16,904
(They even enjoy rice with the soup.)

2110

(Exclaiming)

2111
01:29:22,084 --> 01:29:24,114
You should have it with rice!

2112
01:29:25,284 --> 01:29:27,614
(Baffled)

2113
01:29:27,855 --> 01:29:29,425
It's amazing with rice.

2114
01:29:29,425 --> 01:29:30,784
You must have it with rice.

2115
01:29:31,055 --> 01:29:32,824
- Here. - Thank you.

2116
01:29:32,895 --> 01:29:35,524
- Just have a bite. - Okay.

2117
01:29:35,795 --> 01:29:37,664
This is truly amazing.

2118
01:29:37,664 --> 01:29:39,895
(Si Wan has a bite of rice in jjamppong.)

2119
01:29:40,595 --> 01:29:44,065
- Oh, my. This is... - It's amazing.

2120
01:29:44,404 --> 01:29:46,704
It tastes like a seafood stew,

2121
01:29:47,305 --> 01:29:48,904
so it's really nice to have with rice.

2122
01:29:48,904 --> 01:29:51,005
- That's right. - Right, it goes well with rice.

2123
01:29:52,444 --> 01:29:55,515
You only followed the recipe, and it turned out so well.

2124
01:29:55,815 --> 01:29:59,954
I tried the soup before adding the seafood.

2125
01:29:59,954 --> 01:30:01,055
How was it?

2126
01:30:01,114 --> 01:30:03,654
There's a big difference.

2127
01:30:03,654 --> 01:30:07,024
The soup got much more flavorful after adding the seafood.

2128
01:30:07,024 --> 01:30:08,395
(The soup got more flavorful after adding the seafood.)

2129

Here's what you wanted.

2132
01:30:15,664 --> 01:30:18,605
It has gone cold, and it became chewier and tastier.

2133
01:30:18,605 --> 01:30:19,734
Look how they stick to each other.

2134
01:30:20,774 --> 01:30:22,645
(Chef Sung picks up a slice of dombe meat.)

2135
01:30:23,145 --> 01:30:26,645
Try it with doenjang.

It goes well with the dombe meat. The homemade doenjang is so good.

2142
01:30:49,334 --> 01:30:50,334
Right, it's delicious.

2143
01:30:51,605 --> 01:30:53,704
Wrap it with kimchi, Si Wan.

2144
01:30:54,234 --> 01:30:57,244
I'll eat dombe meat with kimchi.

2145

Gosh. This meat is so chewy, isn't it?

2150
01:31:19,765 --> 01:31:22,305
- Right. It's gooey. - Right, totally.

2151
01:31:23,565 --> 01:31:25,074
Why is this doenjang so delicious?

2152
01:31:25,305 --> 01:31:27,704
Jin Goo made this sauce. What ingredients are in it?

2153
01:31:27,734 --> 01:31:29,475
- A half spoon of minced garlic. - Right.

2154
01:31:29,904 --> 01:31:32,414
- I added sliced Cheongyang chili. - Yes.

(Shy)

2159
01:31:43,055 --> 01:31:45,925
This ssamjang really goes well with dombe meat.

2160
01:31:45,925 --> 01:31:48,324
It's a good combination of the two.

2161
01:31:48,324 --> 01:31:49,465
(Jin Goo's ssamjang and dombe meat are in perfect harmony.)

2162
