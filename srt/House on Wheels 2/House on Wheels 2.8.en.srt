- Look at this place.
- It's a cherry blossom tunnel.

(Laughing bashfully again)

84
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,770
You sound like a baby when you laugh.

85
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,431
Thank you.

86
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:41,101
(Who's the man who sounds like a baby when he laughs?)

(Actor Kim Byoung Cheol is coming to House on Wheels.)

96
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,910
What's your favorite food?

97
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,881
Since it's spring, I'd love to have spring vegetables.

98
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:26,381
Oh, spring vegetables? Okay, let's go pick them.

99
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:29,181

100

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,061
(As they talk with their guests on the phone, )

103
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:45,200
(they have reached the mountains that surround House on Wheels.)

104
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,371
(Exclamining)

105
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,970
I feel good about today.

106
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:53,410
(Impressed)

107
00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:57,210
(Driving past the flowers that welcome the members)

108
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,150
(Impressed)

109
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,710

(You can see the mountains, valleys, and villages at a glance.)

116
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,410
(And the view from the house...)

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,280
(is the magnificent range of Mount Jiri...)

118
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,220
(and the Cheonwangbong Peak.)

119
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,421
(Cheonwangbong Peak)

120
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:47,191
(Below the house, there's a clear valley from Mount Jiri.)

121

(Safely filmed with the permission of the camping site)

126
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,061
(His eyes go wide.)

127
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:22,131
(They turn their bodies to check out their front yard.)

128
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:25,501
This place is so pretty.

129
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:27,330
- It is, right?
- Yes.

130
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:32,811
(Today's front yard surrounded by flowers...)

131
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:37,410

132
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:43,450
(It's paradise on earth filled with the life of Mount Jiri.)

133
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,621
All right. Come this way.

134
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:50,390
This is really rare, okay?

135
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,861
(Laughing)

136
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:54,330
Apply it on me first.

137
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,400
It's only sunscreen.

138
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,231
Are you sure this is sunscreen?

139
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:01,440
You squeezed out too much. This much must be enough for you.

140
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,971
- Apply it evenly.
- Dong Il.

141
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,971
It's an expensive one, so apply as much as you can.

142
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:05,971
No, Dong Il.

143
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:07,010
This is...

144
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,940
It's okay because it's expensive.

145
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:10,381
That's not it, Dong Il.

146
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:12,550
You need to keep rubbing it for it to be absorbed.

147
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:15,381
It's almost like putting on makeup.

148
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,451
It's like a makeover.

149
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:18,451
- This is...
- Look at it.

150
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,390
Yoon A is coming today! It shouldn't be so obvious!

151
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,091
- That's not it. It's...
- This is so embarrassing!

152
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:25,491
I'm looking forward to meeting a Girls' Generation member!

153
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:26,491
This is...

154
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:28,260
I couldn't even say a thing earlier when she was on the phone...

155
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,300
because I was really nervous.

156
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,731
I think this is too much, Dong Il.

157
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:32,731
Dong Il...

158
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:34,701
It'll never get absorbed.

159
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:36,341
Is it so bad that you're laughing that hard?

160
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,770
No, you should just...

161
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:39,741
- Hold on, Dong Il.
- But it's an expensive one.

162
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:40,770
Hold on. Let me see.

163
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,940
- What's this?
- I know.

164
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:47,711
My gosh. Maybe it expired.

165
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:50,221
(Laughing)

166
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:53,121
(In the midst of chaos, )

167
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,991
(Hee Won is quietly applying the sunscreen.)

168
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:57,420
(Tapping delicately)

169
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:00,760
(Applying meticulously)

170
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:03,001
- Is it weird?
- His face turned yellow.

171
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:04,900
(Tapping)

172
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,201
Let me help you.

173
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:07,841
No, it's okay. I'll do it.

174
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:11,270
- Come here!
- No, no. I'll do it myself.

175
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,871
You're not any different. Look at him.

176
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:15,310
You look like a ghost.

177
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,611
It'll be absorbed if you keep tapping.

178
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,321
My goodness, this is crazy.

179
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:23,920
I haven't seen Byoung Cheol in a while,

180
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,621
and he'd find this hilarious.

181
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:26,621
(They applied it with all their effort but end up removing it.)

182
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:28,621
I've never applied sunscreen in my life.

183
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,430
Why did I have to apply it today?

184
00:09:33,591 --> 00:09:36,530
- It's all set.
- You only need a tiny amount.

185
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,701
Okay, got it.

186
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:41,241
Si Wan, you should prepare the rice first.

187
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:43,670
- Okay, I'll do that.
- We'll set up the table.

188
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,910
You should prepare the rice first.

189
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,841
- Okay.
- And cut some kimchi too.

190
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:48,940
Stop it already!

191
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,481
What? Let me rub it some more.

192
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:52,780
- We should hurry! Yoon A is coming.
- Okay, okay.

193
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:54,410
That's why I'm putting this on.

194
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:55,520
Is that so?

195
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:58,821
(You and I feel the same way.)

196
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:01,760
- Let's set up the tarp first.
- The tarp?

197
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,160
The sun is too strong.

198
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:06,930
(Humming)

199
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,701
(He seems especially excited today.)

200
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:13,001
(Someone is humming.)

201
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:18,040
He must be excited because...

202
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,611
- his close friend is coming.
- Is it?

203
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,751
(Is she coming safely?)

204
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:31,390
It's so pretty.

205
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:36,920
(Walking through cherry blossoms...)

206
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:40,660
(is our first guest today!)

207
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:44,670
(Exclaiming)

208
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,430
(She continues to admire the place even before reaching the place.)

209
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,440
It's so cute.

210
00:10:49,971 --> 00:10:52,571
(Brushing her hair)

211
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,611
Hello.

212
00:10:58,881 --> 00:10:59,881
(Smiling broadly)

213
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:00,881
She's here.

214
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,351
(Halting)

215
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,190
Hey, how do I look?

216
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,760
- Hello, I'm Yoon A.
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.

217
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,690
I'm Yoon A.

218
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,530
- My, let me help you. Help her.
- It's...

219
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,501
- It's okay.
- Hello.

220
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:17,260
- Hello.
- Should I get them for her?

221
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,270
Can I put them here?

222
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,501
Let me put them inside. Si Wan.

223
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:20,900
- Yoon A, you're here.
- Hi!

224
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,140
Hi, hi.

225
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,741
You greet Si Wan differently.

226
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,940
I need to welcome her more.

227
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,440
(They bump their fists.)

228
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:30,780
I'm Yoon A.

229
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,550
(Formally introducing herself.)

230
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,111
You can take off your mask.

231
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,550
(He's glad to see her.)

232
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,951
- Let's go inside first.
- Let's set this up first.

233
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:39,721
- You should look around the house.
- I'll show her around.

234
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:40,851
- Okay.
- Come in, Yoon A.

235
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:42,991
- They need to set it up.
- Okay.

236
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:44,731
(Impressed)

237
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,760
This is it.

238
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:50,060
This is it, but...

239
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:53,571
This is our living room.

240
00:11:54,331 --> 00:11:55,601
- This is...
- It's so cozy.

241
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:57,300
- Right?
- Yes, it's nice.

242
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,010
We set up a table here and did many things here.

243
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,111
(Fascinated)

244
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:06,010
Wow, look at these photos. They're so cute.

245
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,851
It's so obvious, right?

246
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:08,851
(Laughing)

247
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,390
(He's feeling guilty.)

248
00:12:11,451 --> 00:12:14,251
I'm not good at selfies either,

249
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:16,861
and I don't like taking selfies.

250
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:18,790
- It's so obvious, right?
- Look at this.

251
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,390
- It stands out, right?
- You're just...

252
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,660
- It shows how bad I am.
- So this is how it feels.

253
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:27,871
(Thanks to Yoon A, we got to know what Si Wan is bad at.)

254
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:29,841
(Amazed)

255
00:12:30,871 --> 00:12:32,741
We cook here.

256
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,611
It's so pretty.

257
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:37,711
(Impressed)

258
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,510
(She looks around the house thoroughly.)

259
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,510
It's nice.

260
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:43,721
(Looking around)

261
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,091
(She spots a mirror.)

262
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:49,390
(Checking her face out of the blue)

263
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:53,160
- Yoon A.
- Yes?

264
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,231
You're pretty already.

265
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,001
Did I look into the mirror for too long?

266
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,731
There was something on my face. Why didn't you tell me?

267
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:02,800
There was something black here.

268
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,371
Oh, really? I didn't see that side.

269
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:05,371
No, I'm just kidding.

270
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:06,510
- It's okay.
- I'll be more attentive.

271
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,540
No, I'm just kidding. I'm okay.

272
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,481
- Let me see.
- I'm totally fine.

273
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:11,650
- You look good.
- Really?

274
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,211
Yes. No, it's...

275
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:14,481
(Having fun)

276
00:13:14,481 --> 00:13:15,481
Not at all.

277
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:20,790
(Laughing)

278
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,890
- What?
- I just find it funny.

279
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,361
(Somehow, they find everything more enjoyable today.)

280
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:27,361
(Showing reaction)

281
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,800
It's very quiet here.

282
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,270
- It's like actual camping.
- Right.

283
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,540
We're out here for camping.

284
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:39,111
Have you ever gone camping?

285
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:40,140
- No, never.
- Really?

286
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,640
No, so I've been wanting to do it.

287
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,481
That's why I'm here.

288
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:45,081
(That's why I'm here on the show.)

289
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,780
You can watch the fire and zone out tonight.

290
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:50,081
- Really?
- Yes, we're making a campfire.

291
00:13:50,221 --> 00:13:51,221
- That's great!
- Right.

292
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,790
- Wow.
- Take a seat here.

293
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,221
(How will their trip with Yoon A turn out to be?)

294
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:01,430
(They're finally gathered around the table.)

295
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:04,660
(Sipping)

296
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,300
It's so good.

297
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,741
Is it your first time seeing Dong Il and Hee Won?

298
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:16,410
- It's my first time.
- Me too.

299
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,410
Is it? I see.

300
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,451
It's my first time.

301
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,520
- Oh, right. I brought some gifts.
- It's time to open the gifts.

302
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:25,390
I can't wait. Let's see what she brought.

303
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,020
This is...

304
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:30,491
This is a billboard.

305
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:32,030
(She made a billboard for House on Wheels.)

306
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,631
I made it myself.

307
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:35,461
- Wow!
- You can...

308
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,900
- You can set it on edge like this.
- Yes.

309
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,770
You can also hang it.

310
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,770
- Goodness, it's so nice.
- It's good that we can hang it.

311
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,971
This is... My handwriting is too...

312
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:46,410
I wrote "Hee" too big.

313
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,611
No problem.

314
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,381
(She prepared it for the members of House on Wheels.)

315
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:54,780
(Writing "H" of "Hee Won")

316
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,780
(Sung Dong Il, Kim Hee Won, and Im Si Wan)

317
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,690
(Yoon A's handmade standing signboard)

318
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,160
You can set it on edge on the floor.

319
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
That's right, goodness.

320
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,890
When we have a car accident...

321
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,131
Oh, right. Something like that.

322
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,131
- I heard it's popular these days.
- We put it up...

323
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:10,631
- When you go on a camping trip.
- when we have a car accident.

324
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,270
It's so pretty.

325
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:14,071
- It's nothing. Thank you.
- So pretty.

326
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,971
Have you ever gathered wild vegetables?

327
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:19,371
I bet he hasn't.

328
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:20,371
Wild vegetables?

329
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,540
I ate mugwort jeon at home the day before yesterday.

330
00:15:23,741 --> 00:15:24,780
(Surprised)

331
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,810
- It was so aromatic and tasty.
- It must have been delicious.

332
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,981
I heard there are all kinds of vegetables including fatsia shoots.

333
00:15:28,981 --> 00:15:30,180
Let's go and gather them.

334
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,190
There are cherry blossoms everywhere.

335
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,821
My gosh, they are so beautiful.

336
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:39,060
They are so beautiful.

337
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,430
The cherry blossoms are bloomed along the path. So pretty.

338
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,900
- How nice.
- Right.

339
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,971
Gosh, that cherry tree is enormous. Look at that.

340
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:48,971
- Where?
- My goodness.

341
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:50,900
(You can see the giant cherry tree in full bloom at this time of year.)

342
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,571
I can't see them.

343
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:54,371
Do you know how to discern fatsia trees?

344
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:55,841
No, I don't know.

345
00:15:56,741 --> 00:15:57,910
Is it a tree?

346
00:15:58,081 --> 00:15:59,310
- Is it a tree?
- Fatsia shoots grow from trees.

347
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,611
- Does it grow from a tree?
- Really?

348
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:04,520
I thought all vegetables come from grocery stores.

349
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,251
- I thought it's from the ground.
- No way.

350
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:07,491
- Grocery stores.
- I see.

351
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,190
- This is a fatsia tree.
- My gosh, this one?

352
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,961
- It looks like thorns.
- My gosh.

353
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:13,331
- Right.
- Like this?

354
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:15,160
You see, these are fatsia shoots.

355
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,501
- They grow from trees.
- My goodness.

356
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,800
(A bud of fatsia shoots)

357
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:24,640
(Soft buds of fatsia shoots are delicious when branched.)

358
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,371
(Amazed)

359
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:30,710
- They all sprouted at the top.
- Right.

360
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,980
Over there.

361
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,480
But there are not many though.

362
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,750
Is there only one bud for each tree?

363
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,081
- No, fatsia shoots usually grow...
- Yes.

364
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:40,190
from all the branches.

365
00:16:40,351 --> 00:16:43,660
(It tastes the best when it has grown this much.)

366
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,660
They are planted everywhere.

367
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,531
- Oh, like this.
- Yes, that's it.

368
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,660
- There are many buds on it.
- Right.

369
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:52,371
- Over there, on the top.
- I see. We can pick them.

370
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:54,200
Hey, they grow...

371
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,571
(They are sparse.)

372
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:56,640
in nature.

373
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,740
Dong Il, are we going to pick them one by one like this?

374
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,680
(Where are you, fatsia roots?)

375
00:17:05,811 --> 00:17:07,551
I think we can find trees over there.

376
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:08,781
- Let's go there.
- Right.

377
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:10,021
(Looking for fatsia roots)

378
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,750
Dong Il, there's one in full bloom.

379
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,521
I found one.

380
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,821
- Here too, goodness.
- Right.

381
00:17:17,861 --> 00:17:19,361
My gosh, that's great.

382
00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:20,660
(A clump of fatsia trees with fatsia shoots in bloom)

383
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,730
Here, over here.

384
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,460
Right, it's a fatsia shoots field.

385
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,930
- A field of fatsia shoots.
- A field of fatsia shoots.

386
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:26,331
A field of fatsia shoots.

387
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:28,131
(There's a field of fatsia shoots in our backyard.)

388
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,440
- Yoon A.
- Okay.

389
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:31,910
- There are so many.
- Over there.

390
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,410
- There.
- There it is.

391
00:17:33,571 --> 00:17:35,511
- Behind the camera staff.
- There it is.

392
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:36,511
(We gathered with permission from the owner.)

393
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,581
Oh, really?

394
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,851
- Yoon A, pick it. It's the biggest.
- My goodness.

395
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,480
It's the biggest one.

396
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:43,281
Gosh, this is so big.

397
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:45,091
- Here.
- My goodness.

398
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:46,250
There are so many.

399
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,091
(There are fatsia roots on their way.)

400
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:49,361
My gosh, look.

401
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,960
- Hey, there are so many over there.
- Here.

402
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:55,031
There's a lot.

403
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:56,301
Here it is too.

404
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,730
We picked them all.

405
00:17:57,831 --> 00:17:59,000
There are so many.

406
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,470
- It feels great to pick them.
- Right.

407
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:03,571
Yoon A, here. Over there.

408
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:06,811
- It's fun.
- Let's eat it with fatsia roots.

409
00:18:07,271 --> 00:18:08,511
Pluck it. Deeply.

410
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,611
Watch your fingers.

411
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:12,480
(From a distance)

412
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,450
(While members are excited, Dong Il...)

413
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:19,551
(is picking fatsia roots skillfully like a master.)

414
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:24,490
(Without saying a word)

415
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,361
(He already picked a handful.)

416
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:29,131
You should at least pick this much.

417
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:30,761
(The aura of the breadwinner)

418
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,900
We managed to pick fatsia roots this much.

419
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:34,970
I know, right?

420
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,341
(While members are picking spring vegetables...)

421
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:41,311
(Chuckling)

422
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,311
(A man is coming from afar with a smile.)

423
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,521
(Amongst the swaying flowers)

424
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:53,390
(He's approaching with the scent of shampoo.)

425
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,291
(The second guest of the day, Kim Byoung Cheol)

426
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,261
(Chuckles)

427
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:02,301
(Chuckles)

428
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:04,801
(Chuckles)

429
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,740
(Making a U-turn)

430
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,980
(He strides again.)

431
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,980
(Is it that way?)

432
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,750
It was there.

433
00:19:23,351 --> 00:19:25,450
(Embarrassed)

434
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,291
(Laughing)

435
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,660
(Byoung Cheol arrived at the empty house.)

436
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,361
(Is anyone...)

437
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:38,970
(here?)

438
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,900
(Flustered)

439
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,440
(Nervous laugh)

440
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
There's no one here.

441
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,940
(Pause)

442
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:51,081
(Byoung Cheol is left alone in the empty house.)

443
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:54,881
Then I should put this in first.

444
00:19:57,851 --> 00:20:00,621
(Can I go in without permission?)

445
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:03,390
(What do I do?)

446
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,490
Can I go in?

447
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:06,091
Excuse me.

448
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:09,561
(Excuse me for a while.)

449
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:11,361
(Looking around)

450
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:14,430
(He entered the house confidently.)

451
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,871
(He takes out something from his bag.)

452
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:17,970
I'll put this...

453
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,410
Oh, it opens like this.

454
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,381
(He opens the fridge in the empty house.)

455
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:29,420
(Scanning the fridge)

456
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:30,950
Here.

457
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,621
(He puts it in carefully.)

458
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:38,390
(He takes off his backpack.)

459
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:40,791
(Are you a soft chair?)

460
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,460
(Are you sturdy?)

461
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,601
(He fiddles about with the door.)

462
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:51,571
(He looks around every corner of the house.)

463
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:54,771
(He's having fun by himself.)

464
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:58,710
(Bustling)

465
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,881
(Taking a walk around the yard.)

466
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:09,390
(He enjoys House on Wheels 100 percent on his own.)

467
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:15,160
I want to see what a shepherd's purse looks like.

468
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,930
Isn't it a root vegetable?

469
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,500
(It tastes good in doenjang stew.)

470
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:24,170
(Aromatic shepherd's purse)

471
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,511
Shepherd's purse is...

472
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:26,611
(Let's find delicious shepherd's purse!)

473
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:27,871
I'll tell you this.

474
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,781
- It looks like a spade, right?
- Yes.

475
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,381
This is not a shepherd's purse.

476
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,450
- So it's not.
- Right.

477
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,650
(Real shepherd's purse is spread like leaves.)

478
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,890
It looks like leaves.

479
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,021
Spade-shaped ones are fake.

480
00:21:42,121 --> 00:21:44,091
They are gathered in one place.

481
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,490
Here it is. It looks like leaves.

482
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,361
Oh, this is a dandelion.

483
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:53,670
This must be...

484
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,041
No, it's not.

485
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,710
What is shepherd's purse?

486
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,771
(It's hard to recognize shepherd's purse.)

487
00:22:00,311 --> 00:22:02,781
Is it always this hard to find shepherd's purse?

488
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:04,440
Like finding wild ginseng?

489
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,811
- Right.
- Should we search for it?

490
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:09,351
(I heard they are spread all over the field.)

491
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,291
This one. Dong Il. I found shepherd's purse.

492
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:13,621
Where?

493
00:22:13,621 --> 00:22:14,791
This is genuine.

494
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,061
- Let me see.
- It's genuine.

495
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:17,591
This one.

496
00:22:17,621 --> 00:22:19,660
(Pounding)

497
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,890
Right, it's shepherd's purse.

498
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,101
(Genuine shepherd's purse)

499
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:23,331
- It's shepherd's purse, right?
- Yes.

500
00:22:23,331 --> 00:22:24,500
Yes! I found it.

501
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:26,430
- Shepherd's purse.
- I found one.

502
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,170
It has triangular leaves like this.

503
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,670
- I see.
- Triangular leaves like that?

504
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,410
- I'll search this area.
- This one too.

505
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,470
It's the jackpot.

506
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,611
(Excited)

507
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,240
This looks sharp too. I think it's right.

508
00:22:37,311 --> 00:22:38,611
I plucked out the soil.

509
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:40,051
This is shepherd's purse, right?

510
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:41,950
- Yes.
- I think it is.

511
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,950
You really dug deep.

512
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,190
I dug in deep like this.

513
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,321
I guess there's know-how.

514
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:52,291
I don't have any know-how. I followed a hunch.

515
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,390
(I just followed my hunch.)

516
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,761
This is mugwort.

517
00:22:55,761 --> 00:22:56,831
(He found mugwort.)

518
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,801
Mugwort. Gosh, how lucky.

519
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:01,571
(Picking aromatic mugwort)

520
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:03,500
Shepherd's purse? Mugwort?

521
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:05,071
(Struggling)

522
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,841
Why is it so deep-rooted?

523
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,740
Can't you pull it out?

524
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:10,980
She's going to show her temper.

525
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,811
My gosh!

526
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,420
This is the time to show her temper.

527
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:17,051
It's been an hour.

528
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:18,950
- Gosh!
- It's about time.

529
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:20,821
This must be delicious.

530
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:22,091
(They gathered a basketful of wild vegetables.)

531
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:23,591
We had a valuable experience.

532
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,890
(Meanwhile, Byoung Cheol is tired of being alone.)

533
00:23:27,261 --> 00:23:29,400
(Laughing)

534
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,730
Goodness, he's here.

535
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,900
Hello.

536
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:35,841
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

537
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:38,170
You look neat and tidy today.

538
00:23:38,871 --> 00:23:40,011
Thank you.

539
00:23:40,011 --> 00:23:42,210
- Say hi to each other.
- Okay.

540
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,881
- Hello.
- It's good to see you.

541
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:46,910
You made a long journey.

542
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:49,150
Yes, it took a long time.

543
00:23:49,781 --> 00:23:52,591
- It took me four hours.
- I'm sorry.

544
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:53,621
- No problem.
- Have a seat.

545
00:23:53,621 --> 00:23:54,750
I rather enjoyed it.

546
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,361
I should get something for him.

547
00:23:57,361 --> 00:23:58,490
- What?
- Coffee?

548
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,861
Grind coffee, Hee Won.

549
00:23:59,861 --> 00:24:02,730
- Coffee and some dessert?
- Coffee?

550
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,801
- No, not coffee.
- Right.

551
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:05,131
We should eat lunch now.

552
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,970
He's our guest. Don't you think we should treat him with manners?

553
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,940
- I'll grind coffee.
- Do it.

554
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,440
(A quick acceptance)

555
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,511
My gosh.

556
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:15,541
(Hee Won is going to make coffee?)

557
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,710
Byoung Cheol, the weather is quite warm now.

558
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:20,480
How do you like a chocolate cookie shake?

559
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,551
It's so simple and easy to make.

560
00:24:22,551 --> 00:24:25,051
- That sounds good.
- Shall I get it for you?

561
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:27,490
(Expectant)

562
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,091
(Si Wan came up with a new menu for guests.)

563
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:30,220
It must be delicious.

564
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,761
The weather is so good.

565
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,131
(There's ice.)

566
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:39,031
It's good that we get to eat things like this. How nice.

567
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,700
Yes?

568
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,871
(Meanwhile, outside the house)

569
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:44,101
Have a seat. My gosh, what's this?

570
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,011
That's the bag I brought.

571
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:47,440
- Oh, your bag?
- Right.

572
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:49,081
Other guests come here with gifts.

573
00:24:49,081 --> 00:24:51,611
Are you planning to bring things from here? How come it's empty?

574
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:53,950
(Empty)

575
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,581
What are you going to bring home?

576
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,821
I've already taken it out. It's in the fridge.

577
00:24:57,821 --> 00:24:59,351
Did you put it in the fridge?

578
00:25:00,121 --> 00:25:01,551
(My goodness!)

579
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:02,720
What did you bring?

580
00:25:03,091 --> 00:25:04,521
Well, I...

581
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,091
- made some cheese.
- Oh, really?

582
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,361
- My goodness.
- Cheese?

583
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:10,230
- Yes.
- Cheese?

584
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,700
Do you make cheese on your own?

585
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,101
- I learned how to make it.
- Did you ferment it?

586
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:17,640
My gosh, is this it?

587
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,640
No, this is something to garnish with it.

588
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,311
You brought a lot.

589
00:25:23,311 --> 00:25:25,180
See how bright we are.

590
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,611
When they bring a lot.

591
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,480
(Touching his ears out of embarrassment)

592
00:25:28,781 --> 00:25:30,950
That's right. His gift is...

593
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,390
I heard something a while ago.

594
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,091
Put these things down for now.

595
00:25:34,091 --> 00:25:36,821
It is the gift that matters.

596
00:25:36,821 --> 00:25:39,160
Why did you put this stuff here?

597
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:41,331
Do it somewhere secluded.

598
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,831
(Sullen)

599
00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:44,900
Please do it here, where we can see.

600
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,071
(He's nervous.)

601
00:25:48,371 --> 00:25:52,271
What? The case looks so elegant.

602
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,341
(An elegant wooden box was wrapped in a cloth.)

603
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:57,081
- That must be expensive.
- My gosh.

604
00:25:57,811 --> 00:25:58,910
What is that?

605
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:02,250
Isn't this a case for King or aristocrats?

606
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,521
Is that so?

607
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:06,950
- This is honeycomb.
- My goodness.

608
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,321
(My goodness!)

609
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:10,761
It's real honeycomb.

610
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,131
(Wild honey from Mount Jiri that goes well with cheese)

611
00:26:14,131 --> 00:26:16,400
It's real honey, goodness.

612
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:18,031
This is so...

613
00:26:18,031 --> 00:26:19,430
(Each honeycomb is filled with sweet honey.)

614
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:22,131
- I made a special request.
- Really?

615
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:24,271
- Mount Jiri is known for its honey.
- That's right.

616
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:28,311
(It's the honeycomb you eat as an ice cream topping.)

617
00:26:28,811 --> 00:26:29,940
(Amazed)

618
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,381
But this is...

619
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:33,511
Is this state right before it becomes honey?

620
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:35,980
- Well, right.
- They harvest it...

621
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,351
to extract honey from it.

622
00:26:38,351 --> 00:26:40,821
- So they harvest it to get honey?
- Right.

623
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:43,061
- But you can eat it whole.
- Right.

624
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,460
I see.

625
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,361
I've never seen it as a whole.

626
00:26:46,361 --> 00:26:48,061
- You haven't?
- No, not in real life.

627
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:51,261
I've seen it on TV, but I've never seen it like this.

628
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:54,301
I'll let you taste the edge.

629
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,470
(They're trying to taste honey.)

630
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,601
(Grinding)

631
00:26:58,601 --> 00:26:59,611
We'll have...

632
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:02,210
Hey, later. Don't do it.

633
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,740
(Raging)

634
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,351
- I'll do it.
- Don't do it.

635
00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:08,680
I'm not listening to you. I'll do it no matter what.

636
00:27:09,051 --> 00:27:10,420
You nag at someone else.

637
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,291
Are you not going to host our guests? Bring spoons.

638
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:15,051
You're going to have coffee, right? I'll make it no matter what.

639
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:18,121
(Hilarious)

640
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,031
- What did you say?
- Spoons.

641
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:23,131
Spoons and small plates for honey.

642
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:28,101
He's holding it in his arms.

643
00:27:28,101 --> 00:27:30,700
I'll make sure you guys have coffee.

644
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,970
(He's cute.)

645
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,111
- Okay.
- You should taste it first.

646
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:38,581
I've eaten it a lot before.

647
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:40,551
(Picking honeycomb)

648
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:43,121
- Can we eat it just like that?
- Yes, just like this.

649
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,321
- My goodness.
- How amazing!

650
00:27:46,521 --> 00:27:48,750
- Here, will you eat first? Yoon A?
- No, it's okay.

651
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,420
- Eat it.
- You first.

652
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,490
- I'm okay.
- You've never tried it. Here it is.

653
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,561
No, I'm fine.

654
00:27:53,561 --> 00:27:54,890
He's afraid it might be poisoned.

655
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,361
He's afraid of it? But he's the one who brought it.

656
00:27:56,361 --> 00:27:58,061
- Right.
- All right then.

657
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,071
- Try it.
- He brought it,

658
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:01,970
so he won't eat it if it was poisoned.

659
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,400
(Byoung Cheol tastes the honey to see if it was poisoned.)

660
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,841
It looks delicious. How is it?

661
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:09,341
- It's delicious.
- Right.

662
00:28:09,341 --> 00:28:11,740
- Gosh, it's so sweet.
- Is it sweet?

663
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,511
- It's so big.
- Here.

664
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:16,821
You should eat a big chunk. Don't nibble at it.

665
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:19,591
Seriously. It's not that big if you chew on it.

666
00:28:19,591 --> 00:28:23,761
(After checking the size, she swallows it.)

667
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:24,821
(Savoring)

668
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,930
Chew on it.

669
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,960
Gosh, it has a rich aroma of honey.

670
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:35,200
Right, Dong Il, since coffee tastes bitter, we should eat this.

671
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,970
Si Wan, come here.

672
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,410
(The youngest tastes honeycomb.)

673
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,811
All the honey squirts out, right?

674
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,140
It looks delicious.

675
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,341
(Staring)

676
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,551
Whom did you ask for it?

677
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:48,750
(Next honeycomb goes into Dong Il's mouth.)

678
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,321
(Now, this is my turn.)

679
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,720
(Closing up)

680
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,761
(Come on!)

681
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,361
Dong Il, what about me?

682
00:28:59,361 --> 00:29:01,061
Just make coffee.

683
00:29:01,061 --> 00:29:04,061
I want to try one first before I make coffee.

684
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,031
I should eat one too.

685
00:29:07,031 --> 00:29:10,000
You're in your 50s, too old to show greed for food.

686
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,440
I've never seen it before, I should at least taste it.

687
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:14,170
Dong Il, I'm curious about it.

688
00:29:14,371 --> 00:29:16,081
Please give me a piece.

689
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:18,011
There's acacia honey too.

690
00:29:18,011 --> 00:29:20,351
There are various kinds of honey.

691
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,351
Let me do it.

692
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:28,920
(Devouring it in one bite)

693
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,831
This is such a specialty.

694
00:29:35,561 --> 00:29:38,761
(Grinding briskly after tasting honey)

695
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:39,871
Do you like honey too?

696
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,101
Dong Il, it's so good.

697
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,041
The aroma of honey fills my mouth.

698
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:49,111
Gosh, honey squirts out all over.

699
00:29:49,111 --> 00:29:50,511
(Members had a sweet time together.)

700
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:54,250
I brought vinyl records. When we have time...

701
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,521
- Did you bring it?
- Yes.

702
00:29:57,081 --> 00:29:58,581
- So these are the ones.
- Yes.

703
00:29:58,581 --> 00:29:59,690
(Hee Won and Yoon A check on vinyl records Hee Won brought.)

704
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,150
So Byoung Cheol brought these.

705
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,061
What are all these?

706
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:06,591
There's The Beatles.

707
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,261
The Beatles and Queen.

708
00:30:10,261 --> 00:30:12,031
Queen. Let's listen to Queen.

709
00:30:12,031 --> 00:30:13,700
- Queen?
- Yes.

710
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,900
(Place the needle carefully.)

711
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,771
(Exclaiming)

712
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,581
Where does the sound come from?

713
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:26,750
From here, the front.

714
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,720
- How nice.
- There it is, on the front.

715
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:33,091
- I see.
- I forgot to boil water.

716
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:40,091
(Hee Won leaves to boil water for coffee.)

717
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:42,831
- This is...
- Shall I bring it inside?

718
00:30:42,831 --> 00:30:44,061
No, I'll do it.

719
00:30:44,061 --> 00:30:46,301
- No, give it to me.
- No, don't move. Stay there.

720
00:30:46,531 --> 00:30:49,101
- Sit down and grind it.
- Okay, I'll grind it then.

721
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,410
(Byoung Cheol is left alone unexpectedly.)

722
00:30:55,881 --> 00:31:00,881
(Focusing on coffee)

723
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:04,180
(Grinding at full speed without hesitation)

724
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,291
(Silky hair)

725
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:11,621
He's grinding in time to the music.

726
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,061
(Deeply absorbed)

727
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:23,200
(Grinding)

728
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,980
(He put all his energy into it.)

729
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,551
(Staring)

730
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,720
I'm fine. I don't mind being alone.

731
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,990
I often stay alone, so I'm okay. There's music to listen to.

732
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,301
Why don't you come inside?

733
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:56,900
Byoung Cheol, why don't you come in?

734
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,200
House tour.

735
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:00,470
You haven't looked around the house. Let me show you around.

736
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,710
Shall I take a look?

737
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,011
(Let's take a look around the house.)

738
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,811
Gosh, you gathered all these.

739
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,121
(On his way, he found fatsia shoots.)

740
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:12,321
(Scooching down)

741
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:14,791
Oh, fatsia shoots!

742
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,621
(Picking)

743
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:21,690
I smell the scent of grass.

744
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,861
- You're enjoying your alone time.
- Sure.

745
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:26,670
It must've been long since you've enjoyed your alone time.

746
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:29,071
- It's been long.
- I know.

747
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,301
Si Wan said...

748
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:32,710
- he'll show me around the house.
- Okay, come in.

749
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,811
We already showed Yoon A around the house.

750
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:37,341
- Yes.
- Just make yourself at home.

751
00:32:37,341 --> 00:32:38,881
(Make yourself at home.)

752
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,351
- Shall I?
- Yes.

753
00:32:40,351 --> 00:32:42,081
- Is the water boiling?
- I'll step in.

754
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:43,281
It's boiling now.

755
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,821
(Feeling a flutter of excitement, he enters the house.)

756
00:32:44,821 --> 00:32:46,990
Do we have coasters for drinks?

757
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,091
Coasters?

758
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:50,261
(Looking around)

759
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:52,061
Si Wan. Do you actually sleep here?

760
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:53,061
What did you say?

761
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:55,631
Where's the thing that absorbs water?

762
00:32:55,631 --> 00:32:56,900
(Feeling awkward)

763
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,200
I'll look around the house on my own.

764
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,700
Show him around the house, Hee Won.

765
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,011
Show him around?

766
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:09,311
(Then...)

767
00:33:09,581 --> 00:33:11,140
Well, this must be the bed, right?

768
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,381
Right, it's the bed. We'll sleep here later.

769
00:33:13,381 --> 00:33:14,811
- Who will be sleeping here?
- Sorry?

770
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:16,851
You get to choose one.

771
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,121
- Really?
- Yes, you can sleep comfortably.

772
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,990
- Will we all sleep here together?
- Yes.

773
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,720
We also set up a tent. We can sleep there as well.

774
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,091
Right, in a tent? If there are many people.

775
00:33:27,091 --> 00:33:29,730
And if we unfold it, it becomes wider.

776
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,900
- Yes, we unfold it when we sleep.
- This much.

777
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,100
Gosh, if I sleep over there, how can I say...

778
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,100
- Do you want to sleep over there?
- I might have a thrill.

779
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,641
No, it's safe.

780
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,111
I'll be able to see the stars if there are stars in the sky.

781
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:43,111
Right, through the window.

782
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:45,181
I'll sleep there tonight.

783
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:46,551
- Over there?
- Here?

784
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:49,250
- It's fine. I'll sleep there.
- So you'll sleep there.

785
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,790
Thank you for the tour. It's pretty.

786
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,290
(Si Wan is almost done making the chocolate cookie shake.)

787
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,991
(He puts wafers in it.)

788
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,500
- Here, use it as a straw.
- I see.

789
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,631
- Drink it with the straw?
- Right, like that.

790
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:11,301
(Drinking with a wafer as a straw)

791
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:13,971
(How is it?)

792
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,440
- It's good.
- Do you like it?

793
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,741
- Yes.
- Is it good?

794
00:34:18,241 --> 00:34:19,411
Dong Il.

795
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:22,920
(The eldest brother who was doing the dishes drinks it too.)

796
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,281
- It's delicious.
- It is, right?

797
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:28,020
(The second brother who has a sweet tooth)

798
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,790
(Savoring)

799
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:35,230
It's delicious. So good.

800
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,060
(Yoon A drinks the whole glass.)

801
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:39,971
(The new menu is a success.)

802
00:34:40,801 --> 00:34:42,741
Byoung Cheol, do you like meat?

803
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:44,500
Yes, I like pork.

804
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,870
Do you like pork?

805
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:49,881
Mount Jiri is well known for black pork.

806
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:51,980
Isn't it? Did you know?

807
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,451
It is, indeed.

808
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,411
(Exclaiming)

809
00:34:55,611 --> 00:34:58,551
(Mount Jiri)

810
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,350
(Mount Jiri is a highland clean area.)

811
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:05,060
Since Mount Jiri likes pork, and Yoon A is here,

812
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,891
we've prepared black pork.

813
00:35:08,131 --> 00:35:11,701
The black pork we had from the previous trip...

814
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:13,370
and the one here are different.

815
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,531
(A dinner is prepared for the guests from far away.)

816
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,571
(And the wild vegetables picked by us!)

817
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:25,341
(Mount Jiri offers the ingredients for today's lunch.)

818
00:35:26,111 --> 00:35:27,411
Do you want to burn the charcoal?

819
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,451
Yes, I like to try to burn it.

820
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:30,821
- Do you?
- Byoung Cheol wants to try that.

821
00:35:30,821 --> 00:35:34,221
They've never camped before.

822
00:35:34,221 --> 00:35:35,221
- For real?
- No, I haven't.

823
00:35:35,221 --> 00:35:36,560
- Yoon A has not.
- Never?

824
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,491
- No.
- I've just...

825
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:40,960
visited others' camping and slept there a couple of times.

826
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,560
- At camping places.
- Yes.

827
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,270
Then, let's get it started.

828
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,270
Okay.

829
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,701
- Here you are.
- Check these out.

830
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:54,911
(A smile with excitement)

831
00:35:56,841 --> 00:35:57,911
- What is it?
- Vegetables.

832
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,511
This is fresh.

833
00:36:00,611 --> 00:36:03,850
- The pork looks very good.
- It's got the rinds as well.

834
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:07,221
- It's black pork from Mount Jiri.
- This is very delicious.

835
00:36:07,221 --> 00:36:08,250
Should I put it here?

836
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:09,821
Do we need to wash them?

837
00:36:09,821 --> 00:36:11,460
- They're all washed.
- Is that so?

838
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,560
- It's a restaurant.
- I see.

839
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:16,330
(Safely filmed in a campground where the use of burners is granted.)

840
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:17,960
Do you burn the charcoal there?

841
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,701
Yes, we burn it here.

842
00:36:21,071 --> 00:36:22,071
I lift it up like this.

843
00:36:22,071 --> 00:36:23,301
(Lifting and placing)

844
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:27,111
(Everything is new to the camping beginner.)

845
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:29,911
- What is this?
- It helps to burn.

846
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:31,411
- I see.
- You burn this.

847
00:36:32,241 --> 00:36:33,750
It doesn't seem to be needed.

848
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,750
Let's see.

849
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,551
(It's burning.)

850
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,991
(This is cool.)

851
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,161
Dong Il, I think we need blanched fatsia shoots.

852
00:36:47,491 --> 00:36:49,500
- I'll do it.
- So will I.

853
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,000
Yoon A, let's do it together.

854
00:36:53,571 --> 00:36:56,900
(Yoon A is excited.)

855
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:59,911
(Humming)

856
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,170
It hurts.

857
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:04,580
Just pick the ones without thorns.

858
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:09,150
(Putting fatsia shoots in the water)

859
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:11,350
Use these chopsticks.

860
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,391
I should've told you this earlier.

861
00:37:13,391 --> 00:37:15,451
Then, you wouldn't have to get hurt.

862
00:37:15,551 --> 00:37:17,420
I'm okay.

863
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:21,931
Since I'm here, I'll make wild chive sauce.

864
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,100
- Okay.
- It's easy.

865
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:27,031
- Wild chive sauce.
- Wild chive sauce?

866
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,400
(Wild chive has a nice pinch of spice.)

867
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:35,571
(When it's mixed with soy sauce and various ingredients, )

868
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:39,440
(it becomes everyone's favorite.)

869
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:41,551
(Grabbing a basket of wild chive)

870
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,221
I'll quickly trim this.

871
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,721
- Have you made wild chive sauce?
- Yes.

872
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:49,761
(Organizing wild chives)

873
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,330
(Bringing a Chinese kitchen knife)

874
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:57,531
Yoon A, when you make wild chive sauce...

875
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,031
(Tough punching)

876
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,971
(Thump)

877
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:10,810
Everything is falling.

878
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,150
What's falling from the above?

879
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,181
(Chopping wild chives in good size)

880
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,750
(The first ingredient is soy sauce.)

881
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,991
(The wild chive sauce recipe is soy sauce 8, cooking wine 2,)

882
00:38:23,991 --> 00:38:25,761
(red chili pepper powder 2,)

883
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,560
(sesame seed 2, and perilla oil 2.)

884
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,060
I have to accomplish it once I take charge.

885
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,400
(Wild chive sauce is almost done.)

886
00:38:32,261 --> 00:38:35,600
(Mixing it well)

887
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:43,111
(Delicious wild chive sauce is done.)

888
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,281
- Can I do it?
- What?

889
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,011
(Fatsia shoots are blanched.)

890
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,310
Is it not hot?

891
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,980
- No. It's okay.
- Okay.

892
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:54,051
- Should I chop these?
- No.

893
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:55,051
- Not this one?
- No.

894
00:38:55,051 --> 00:38:56,821
- Okay.
- Not that one.

895
00:38:56,821 --> 00:39:01,091
(Blanching fatsia shoots is done.)

896
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:05,000
(Outside, at that time...)

897
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,600
(Staring)

898
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,870
May I...

899
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,230
- What do you want?
- hold it?

900
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,540
Why? Can you hold it?

901
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,540
Of course.

902
00:39:15,141 --> 00:39:20,011
Can you wash it this much?

903
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:22,281
I will make awesome mugwort jeon.

904
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:23,980
- Mugwort jeon?
- Yes.

905
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,980
Okay.

906
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,221
(Washing mugwort with the running water)

907
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:30,991
(Mugwort jeon ingredient is Korean pancake mix, )

908
00:39:30,991 --> 00:39:32,190
(Measuring with eyeballing)

909
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,060
(a little bit of salt, )

910
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,261
(2 eggs, )

911
00:39:36,261 --> 00:39:38,631
(and a little bit of water.)

912
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:43,071
(A handful of mugwort)

913
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,701
The smell of mugwort is...

914
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,770
(Smelling)

915
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:51,381
so awesome.

916
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:59,181
(Plenty of mugworts)

917
00:40:00,591 --> 00:40:04,391
(It looks like batter for fries with lots of mugworts.)

918
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,031
(Looks good.)

919
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:08,491
- It looks delicious.
- Doesn't it?

920
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:09,761
(It looks delicious.)

921
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,301
How would you like the thickness to be?

922
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:14,670
- Thin.
- Thin.

923
00:40:15,531 --> 00:40:17,071
As thin as possible.

924
00:40:18,141 --> 00:40:21,540
Byoung Cheol knows what he wants.

925
00:40:24,411 --> 00:40:27,911
It's not easy to make it thin with mugwort.

926
00:40:27,911 --> 00:40:28,911
I know.

927
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:31,451
I like to have a lot of mugwort in it.

928
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:33,020
Then, I'm okay with it being thick.

929
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:37,891
(Sizzle)

930
00:40:37,891 --> 00:40:38,891
It's pretty.

931
00:40:39,931 --> 00:40:42,131
The food represents the cook's heart.

932
00:40:42,361 --> 00:40:45,730
If the cook's heart isn't pretty, it doesn't come out pretty.

933
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:50,841
Let's place it in the middle when it's still hot.

934
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,670
- Oh, my gosh.
- Dong Il, it's spring.

935
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,011
(The mugwort is picked by them at the back hill.)

936
00:40:57,841 --> 00:41:02,611
(They can make and have jeon right away only on House on Wheels.)

937
00:41:03,221 --> 00:41:05,620
Come eat mugwort jeon when it's hot.

938
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,920
Cut it with scissors.

939
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,520
- Eat it. Hurry.
- Okay.

940
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,060
(Yoon A is cutting with her hands.)

941
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,891
The mugwort is freshly picked. I put a lot of mugwort in.

942
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:16,361
- I washed my hands clean.
- Thank you.

943
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,230
- I was cooking in the kitchen.
- Try it.

944
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:21,270
(Yum)

945
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,801
- Good.
- It's pretty.

946
00:41:22,801 --> 00:41:23,801
(The more to chew, the stronger the mugwort smells.)

947
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:25,540
I can smell mugwort.

948
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,571
- Can you?
- Try this.

949
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,440
(A piece of mugwort jeon for Dong Il.)

950
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,741
I'll eat it after I finish this.

951
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:36,980
I'm getting fed by a member from Girls' Generation.

952
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,321
(Dong Il puts it in his mouth.)

953
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,350
It looks very delicious.

954
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,520
The jeon is...

955
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,891
(Mugwort smells good.)

956
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:44,161
full of mugwort smell.

957
00:41:44,591 --> 00:41:47,330
(Yoon A also takes a piece.)

958
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:50,400
- Oh, good.
- Isn't it full of mugwort smell?

959
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:51,701
It's delicious.

960
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:53,600
(A spring fest with fresh-picked out of nature)

961
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,670
It's thick as I added a lot of mugwort for its smell.

962
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,770
It tastes like what we ate yesterday.

963
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,540
- Si Wan, sorry. It's a small piece.
- It's okay.

964
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,980
What's that?

965
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,080
Try this one.

966
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,250
- Isn't it delicious?
- It is delicious.

967
00:42:08,911 --> 00:42:12,321
(Yoon A takes care of everyone.)

968
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,150
- My goodness.
- Doesn't the mugwort smell good?

969
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,190
- Yes.
- Try this.

970
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,491
Gosh, Mount Jiri. It brings the spring.

971
00:42:18,491 --> 00:42:20,531
(It feels like tasting the whole Mount Jiri.)

972
00:42:21,131 --> 00:42:23,500
Why did I not like this when I was little?

973
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,500
I know.

974
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:27,270
(I feel the same way.)

975
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:29,270
- Isn't it good even without sauce?
- Yes.

976
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,270
I added just a tiny bit of salt,

977
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,611
so we can enjoy the mugwort smell.

978
00:42:33,971 --> 00:42:35,471
- It tastes good.
- It's good.

979
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:43,381
(It's hard to stop eating it.)

980
00:42:44,051 --> 00:42:45,350
(Happy)

981
00:42:46,181 --> 00:42:49,420
(Here is black pork from Mount Jiri.)

982
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:51,361
We can place it all.

983
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,131
It's big enough, so we can put them all at once.

984
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,161
(Black pork from Mount Jiri has...)

985
00:42:58,531 --> 00:43:02,071
(filled the grill pan.)

986
00:43:02,071 --> 00:43:03,471
What? Let's sprinkle it.

987
00:43:03,471 --> 00:43:04,540
(Sprinkle the salt.)

988
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,911
(A lot of salt)

989
00:43:06,911 --> 00:43:08,741
Hee Won, I think it's too much here.

990
00:43:08,741 --> 00:43:12,080
Don't worry. It'll fall off later. Trust me.

991
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,141
- Okay.
- Good.

992
00:43:13,781 --> 00:43:16,181
(Salty and smoky pork)

993
00:43:16,181 --> 00:43:17,181
It's good.

994
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,991
The grilling works well today, not burning at all.

995
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:22,750
The charcoal is not burning with big flames.

996
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,120
- I know.
- No flame.

997
00:43:24,721 --> 00:43:25,821
It looks delicious.

998
00:43:28,931 --> 00:43:31,261
It would be even better with vegetables.

999
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,400
It really looks very delicious.

1000
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:35,870
It's not burning at all.

1001
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,341
This is also delicious.

1002
00:43:38,341 --> 00:43:41,341
- Hee Won, this smells so good.
- Oh, gosh.

1003
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:43,071
(The smell of spring)

1004
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:44,381
- The smell.
- The smell of vegetables.

1005
00:43:44,681 --> 00:43:48,411
- These are wasabi leaves.
- These are angelica leaves.

1006
00:43:48,411 --> 00:43:51,080
We just place them here. Good.

1007
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,951
(Adding fatsia shoots)

1008
00:43:57,091 --> 00:44:00,091
(Here are vegetables for meat wraps...)

1009
00:44:00,091 --> 00:44:02,631
(from Mount Jiri.)

1010
00:44:02,631 --> 00:44:04,661
Dong Il, it is spring indeed.

1011
00:44:05,701 --> 00:44:08,631
- It's just...
- I want to eat it now.

1012
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,900
Me too.

1013
00:44:10,741 --> 00:44:14,071
(Here is wild chive sauce by Si Wan.)

1014
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:18,310
(For the final touch, )

1015
00:44:19,141 --> 00:44:22,411
(grilled seaweed is here.)

1016
00:44:22,781 --> 00:44:24,120
I like to take photos.

1017
00:44:24,221 --> 00:44:25,821
I wonder why you haven't yet.

1018
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,920
(Today's lunch)

1019
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:34,631
(Well-grilled black pork from Mount Jiri)

1020
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,290
(Kimchi to neutralize the greasy taste.)

1021
00:44:37,031 --> 00:44:40,531
(Wild vegetables that have the spring of Mount Jiri)

1022
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
(A full table set of black pork of Mount Jiri and wild vegetables)

1023
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,270
- It's all ready. Let's eat.
- Oh, yes.

1024
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,141
Let's eat. Come here.

1025
00:44:50,181 --> 00:44:51,281
- Let's eat.
- Thanks for the meal.

1026
00:44:51,281 --> 00:44:53,350
- Thanks for the meal.
- Thanks for the meal.

1027
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:55,011
I've wanted to eat meat.

1028
00:44:55,011 --> 00:44:56,210
I know.

1029
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,120
Lettuce and perilla leaves.

1030
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,350
- We're missing spoons.
- That's true.

1031
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,650
- Let's just wait.
- Okay.

1032
00:45:00,891 --> 00:45:01,920
Why?

1033
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:03,250
Try this one first.

1034
00:45:03,861 --> 00:45:05,690
- We picked these.
- For an appetizer.

1035
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:07,761
- These are really...
- We picked these out.

1036
00:45:07,931 --> 00:45:10,701
We picked them ourselves. The guests should have them.

1037
00:45:10,701 --> 00:45:11,730
These are really picked by us.

1038
00:45:11,801 --> 00:45:13,161
- Dip in chojang.
- After a bite,

1039
00:45:13,161 --> 00:45:14,370
I will bring spoons.

1040
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:17,701
(Fatsia shoots dipped in chojang)

1041
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,310
(Yoon A tries it.)

1042
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,611
- Here you are, Hee Won.
- Oh, my!

1043
00:45:21,611 --> 00:45:22,670
(Oh, my!)

1044
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:23,781
How is it?

1045
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:26,141
It's delicious.

1046
00:45:29,011 --> 00:45:30,321
The texture is so soft.

1047
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:31,721
(Nodding)

1048
00:45:31,721 --> 00:45:32,951
It is very soft.

1049
00:45:34,221 --> 00:45:36,551
(Let me try.)

1050
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,190
(The texture for fatsia shoot is soft.)

1051
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,361
Byoung Cheol, it smells good too.

1052
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,060
- It's delicious.
- It's soft.

1053
00:45:45,431 --> 00:45:48,931
It's a perfect seasonal food, isn't it?

1054
00:45:48,931 --> 00:45:50,971
- Perfect for spring.
- Yes.

1055
00:45:52,071 --> 00:45:54,710
It's picked by Yoon A, a member from Girls' Generation.

1056
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,741
(The fatsia shoots are picked by Yoon A from Girls' Generation.)

1057
00:45:57,341 --> 00:45:58,381
It's delicious.

1058
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,150
- Thank you.
- This tastes good too.

1059
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:03,551
(Smiling)

1060
00:46:03,821 --> 00:46:06,620
I like it with fatsia shoots.

1061
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:08,350
- Dong Il, add fatsia shoots...
- Okay.

1062
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,420
in your wrap with pork.

1063
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,060
- That's delicious.
- Yes, it is delicious.

1064
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,531
- Add fatsia shoots.
- Fatsia shoots?

1065
00:46:13,531 --> 00:46:14,631
Very delicious.

1066
00:46:14,631 --> 00:46:16,161
- Fatsia shoots and pork belly?
- Yes.

1067
00:46:16,161 --> 00:46:17,960
- It's good with pork belly.
- I see.

1068
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,801
- Eat it with this.
- Okay.

1069
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,600
I'm adding fatsia shoots.

1070
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:23,031
I'm serious.

1071
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:25,201
Did you put ssamjang in your wrap?

1072
00:46:25,301 --> 00:46:26,301
I did.

1073
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:28,341
- Adding ssamjang.
- Add ssamjang.

1074
00:46:28,611 --> 00:46:30,111
- Add enough ssamjang.
- Okay.

1075
00:46:31,111 --> 00:46:33,911
You can taste and smell the fatsia shoots.

1076
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:37,250
- Isn't it good?
- Try this.

1077
00:46:38,821 --> 00:46:40,020
- It's very delicious.
- Isn't it?

1078
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,091
(Oh, my goodness.)

1079
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,491
Eat this one. It's tastier.

1080
00:46:43,491 --> 00:46:44,690
- It's delicious.
- Yes.

1081
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,420
(Clapping over Yoon A's shoulder as it is delicious)

1082
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,661
It's almost surprising.

1083
00:46:49,031 --> 00:46:50,730
- It's so good with fatsia shoots.
- Right.

1084
00:46:50,801 --> 00:46:52,361
- Good.
- Fatsia shoots?

1085
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,400
- Fatsia shoot is the top.
- Fatsia shoot is good.

1086
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,301
Add a lot of vegetables. These are good for your health.

1087
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,170
I like fatsia shoots.

1088
00:47:00,411 --> 00:47:01,971
Add fatsia shoots...

1089
00:47:02,471 --> 00:47:03,741
and meat in your wrap and eat.

1090
00:47:03,741 --> 00:47:04,841
That's the way.

1091
00:47:04,841 --> 00:47:05,980
(The second bite)

1092
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,551
- Dong Il, it's so good.
- Fatsia shoots and pork belly.

1093
00:47:07,911 --> 00:47:08,980
Right.

1094
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,620
(The third bite)

1095
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,781
Put everything you can.

1096
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:14,520
- It's delicious.
- I mean it.

1097
00:47:14,891 --> 00:47:15,891
Thank you.

1098
00:47:15,891 --> 00:47:17,920
(Endless bites of fatsia shoots and pork belly)

1099
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,131
(My friend is eating well.)

1100
00:47:22,931 --> 00:47:23,960
(Hiccup)

1101
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:29,031
(One more bite with a spring breeze)

1102
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:31,571
(Savoring)

1103
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,770
(Glancing)

1104
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:36,471
Fatsia shoot is the number one ingredient.

1105
00:47:36,471 --> 00:47:39,141
The Girls' Generation member ate...

1106
00:47:39,141 --> 00:47:40,881
a lot of rice too.

1107
00:47:44,551 --> 00:47:46,781
She even had the biggest bowl.

1108
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,591
What are you talking about?

1109
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,790
Yoon A actually eats anything well.

1110
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:51,790
I can tell.

1111
00:47:54,031 --> 00:47:57,060
(Dong Il likes crunchy chili pepper.)

1112
00:47:58,301 --> 00:47:59,701
- Isn't it good?
- Try this.

1113
00:47:59,701 --> 00:48:00,701
(Here you are, my brother.)

1114
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:03,900
- It's good with fatsia shoots.
- Right.

1115
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,170
Isn't it?

1116
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,141
(Oh, my... It's spicy.)

1117
00:48:08,241 --> 00:48:09,411
He can't eat spicy food.

1118
00:48:09,611 --> 00:48:11,940
(Dong Il takes extra care of Hee Won who is picky.)

1119
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,080
Oh, my gosh. It's spicy.

1120
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:17,020
If I want to make him eat something spicy,

1121
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,221
I have to eat one and show him a big smile.

1122
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,620
- So spicy.
- I like fatsia shoots.

1123
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:21,620
(You know your brother very well.)

1124
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,261
Isn't this ssukgat?

1125
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,031
Ssukgat. We should add this in.

1126
00:48:27,031 --> 00:48:29,531
- Angelica leaf.
- That's angelica leaf.

1127
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,201
We should put angelica leaf in.

1128
00:48:31,301 --> 00:48:33,100
Angelica leaf is...

1129
00:48:33,131 --> 00:48:35,230
When you eat ssambap, the angelica leaf smell is...

1130
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:36,301
- Right.
- Right.

1131
00:48:36,301 --> 00:48:38,600
- I'm going to add angelica leaves.
- Good.

1132
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,170
(Eating)

1133
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:44,710
(He claps for angelica leaves.)

1134
00:48:45,511 --> 00:48:46,580
(A beautiful smile)

1135
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,710
The angelica leaf smell is quite strong.

1136
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,821
Angelica leaves and fatsia shoots are perfect together.

1137
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,391
Angelica leaves, fatsia shoots, and pork belly.

1138
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:55,391
Angelica leaves are here.

1139
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,821
(Angelica leaves, fatsia shoots, and black pork)

1140
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,620
Is it right?

1141
00:49:00,931 --> 00:49:03,560
No. Since the smell is strong,

1142
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,830
- Should I put just a little?
- put just a little.

1143
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:05,900
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1144
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:08,900
- Angelica leaves smell strong.
- Put one-third of that.

1145
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,000
This much?

1146
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:11,670
It's like a meat wrapping class.

1147
00:49:11,971 --> 00:49:14,310
- Angelica leaves.
- It's a meat wrap class.

1148
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:15,611
- That's too little.
- And this one.

1149
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:16,911
Is it too little?

1150
00:49:17,111 --> 00:49:18,980
Should I add more fatsia shoots? You mean angelica leaves?

1151
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,310
It's too strong, then.

1152
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:21,580
It's not. Just try it.

1153
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,281
- Hee Won, - They have a strong smell.

1154
00:49:23,281 --> 00:49:25,620
- let her eat in her way.
- It depends on the personal taste.

1155
00:49:26,181 --> 00:49:27,690
One should eat it in his own way.

1156
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:29,721
Then take out what I added.

1157
00:49:29,721 --> 00:49:31,120
(Hee Won is sulky.)

1158
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,020
But...

1159
00:49:33,631 --> 00:49:37,201
I will try how Hee Won recommended.

1160
00:49:37,201 --> 00:49:39,201
I love angelica leaves.

1161
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,471
Angelica leaves smell so good.

1162
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,141
Angelica leaves, fatsia shoots, and pork belly.

1163
00:49:46,201 --> 00:49:47,710
(Si Wan is trying the way Hee Won recommended.)

1164
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:50,940
(Si Wan feels spring.)

1165
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,611
It seems better with more angelica leaves.

1166
00:49:53,881 --> 00:49:54,911
Right?

1167
00:49:55,681 --> 00:49:57,951
(Angelica leaves are good.)

1168
00:49:57,951 --> 00:50:01,551
Perilla leaves, meat, fatsia shoots,

1169
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,120
(What about angelica leaves?)

1170
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,221
and angelica leaves.

1171
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:05,960
(Angelica leaves are awesome.)

1172
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,830
It goes well with meat.

1173
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,730
(Hee Won is happy.)

1174
00:50:09,931 --> 00:50:11,500
This is boiled.

1175
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,500
(Dong Il is well-taking care of his brother.)

1176
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,031
Try this with oil.

1177
00:50:14,301 --> 00:50:15,531
(Glancing)

1178
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,801
- Dong Il.
- I'll give you this one. Sit.

1179
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,741
(Yum)

1180
00:50:21,011 --> 00:50:22,770
If you express this much, it must be really delicious.

1181
00:50:23,071 --> 00:50:24,341
- Isn't it?
- Right.

1182
00:50:24,341 --> 00:50:26,511
(Byoung Cheol is happy to watch him who knows the brother's taste.)

1183
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,011
Hee Won, don't you like me? Be honest.

1184
00:50:30,011 --> 00:50:31,821
- Me? I do like you.
- Yes.

1185
00:50:32,381 --> 00:50:33,920
If I didn't like you, I wouldn't be here.

1186
00:50:36,991 --> 00:50:38,261
- I can tell.
- Right?

1187
00:50:38,261 --> 00:50:41,431
(I see that you care about each other a lot.)

1188
00:50:42,161 --> 00:50:43,861
Since it is spring...

1189
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,301
- Isn't it, Dong Il?
- Yes.

1190
00:50:46,301 --> 00:50:47,301
(The table is filled with spring vegetables.)

1191
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:49,170
We have all the seasonal vegetables.

1192
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:52,141
Eat the meat. It doesn't taste good when it gets cold.

1193
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:55,071
I'll put these here. It's first come, first served.

1194
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:56,370
It's still hot.

1195
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:59,241
This is better as it's hot. Try it.

1196
00:50:59,241 --> 00:51:00,281
(Yoon A eats with perilla leaves.)

1197
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:04,150
(A mouthful of seasonal spring vegetables)

1198
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,551
Just eat it with dried seaweed.

1199
00:51:06,451 --> 00:51:07,891
- This is very delicious.
- Here you are.

1200
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,591
The meat is so good.

1201
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:11,261
It doesn't need any sauce.

1202
00:51:13,491 --> 00:51:14,690
- It is grilled well.
- Right.

1203
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,790
- It's well seasoned too.
- Yes.

1204
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:18,801
Hee Won did a good job grilling.

1205
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,931
- He didn't burn them and did well.
- It's very delicious.

1206
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:22,031
Hee Won, you're good at cooking.

1207
00:51:22,031 --> 00:51:23,071
(Proud)

1208
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,201
- It's chewy.
- Yes.

1209
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,841
(Let's see if it's grilled well.)

1210
00:51:27,841 --> 00:51:30,810
Yoon A, this meat is for you.

1211
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,411
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1212
00:51:32,411 --> 00:51:33,611
(Yoon A gets a big piece.)

1213
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:36,710
Hee Won, this burnt one is for you.

1214
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:38,951
I like it burnt.

1215
00:51:41,821 --> 00:51:44,290
Si Wan, I'll give you a normal part.

1216
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,261
Which part? Thank you.

1217
00:51:46,261 --> 00:51:47,330
Oh, this is pretty.

1218
00:51:48,031 --> 00:51:49,761
Byoung Cheol, do you want a big one or a small one?

1219
00:51:50,431 --> 00:51:52,031
- A small one, please.
- A small one?

1220
00:51:52,031 --> 00:51:53,060
So I can put it in my mouth neatly.

1221
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,471
(So I can put it in my mouth neatly.)

1222
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,870
(Laughing)

1223
00:51:58,241 --> 00:51:59,540
Just eat.

1224
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,540
(Byoung Cheol is very neat, unexpectedly.)

1225
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:02,011
I can't do that.

1226
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,810
(In fact, Byoung Cheol has been...)

1227
00:52:06,611 --> 00:52:08,011
(very careful...)

1228
00:52:08,011 --> 00:52:10,210
(not to have chogochujang on his lips, )

1229
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:12,480
(very cautious...)

1230
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,020
(not to have the dried seaweed powders, )

1231
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,891
(and blocking his mouth...)

1232
00:52:17,891 --> 00:52:19,591
(not to have the food out.)

1233
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:23,391
(He smells the meat first.)

1234
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:31,841
(He's gentle from the bone.)

1235
00:52:32,241 --> 00:52:35,170
Byoung Cheol, you've acted a lot of strong characters,

1236
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:37,210
but you're actually very quiet.

1237
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,580
I think you two are kind of similar.

1238
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,681
Hee Won and Byoung Cheol.

1239
00:52:40,681 --> 00:52:42,881
- Hee Won and I?
- Yes.

1240
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,221
- Byoung Cheol is...
- Yes.

1241
00:52:45,881 --> 00:52:48,891
such a good person if you look into him.

1242
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,821
(That means...)

1243
00:52:50,821 --> 00:52:52,491
He seems nice.

1244
00:52:52,491 --> 00:52:54,591
(Hee Won is also a good person.)

1245
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,131
Thank you.

1246
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,431
I mean it, not as a joke.

1247
00:52:57,431 --> 00:53:00,201
- I can feel you're a good person.
- Right.

1248
00:53:00,931 --> 00:53:03,000
- I think you're right.
- Yes.

1249
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,900
You have similar characters.

1250
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,611
You have...

1251
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:09,040
Do you like dried seaweed that much?

1252
00:53:09,071 --> 00:53:10,940
Why are you hiding that dried seaweed in?

1253
00:53:11,141 --> 00:53:12,940
- Where is it?
- Right there.

1254
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,580
Just watch out for that.

1255
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,480
You don't even eat a big piece worrying about marking on your lips.

1256
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,181
Then, you have it there like a necklace.

1257
00:53:20,321 --> 00:53:21,821
I'm glad that it's not on my lips.

1258
00:53:24,091 --> 00:53:26,690
I will eat this with the sauce Si Wan made.

1259
00:53:26,690 --> 00:53:27,690
- It's good.
- What's this?

1260
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:30,730
- It's wild chive sauce.
- How do I eat wild chive sauce?

1261
00:53:31,301 --> 00:53:33,730
- You eat...
- Do we mix it with rice?

1262
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:35,670
Yes. You mix it like this.

1263
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,400
- With rice.
- Put it in the rice.

1264
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,201
(A spoon of wild chive sauce mixed with rice)

1265
00:53:39,201 --> 00:53:41,911
- With rice.
- When you eat rice, you mix it.

1266
00:53:41,911 --> 00:53:42,971
(Adding a spoon of wild chive sauce)

1267
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,040
Okay.

1268
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,181
(A bite of rice mixed with the sauce)

1269
00:53:45,281 --> 00:53:47,281
Just a little amount to mix.

1270
00:53:47,451 --> 00:53:48,750
- Yes.
- Right.

1271
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,750
- It's a little sour.
- Right.

1272
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,650
(Tasting just the wild chive sauce)

1273
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,020
(Even just the sauce alone is good.)

1274
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,150
It's delicious.

1275
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:57,790
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1276
00:53:58,321 --> 00:53:59,690
This wild chive sauce is good.

1277
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,230
- Is it?
- Yes.

1278
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,190
- Do you like the wild chive sauce?
- Yes.

1279
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,230
(The guests are satisfied.)

1280
00:54:04,431 --> 00:54:07,301
Everything Si Wan makes is delicious.

1281
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,071
- Yes, it's delicious.
- Yes.

1282
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,400
Thank you.

1283
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,440
(Happy)

1284
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,241
It's the taste of spring.

1285
00:54:13,701 --> 00:54:15,210
It's a seasonal food indeed.

1286
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,281
It's just perfect for today.

1287
00:54:17,281 --> 00:54:18,310
(The members are full with spring vegetables from Mount Jiri.)

1288
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:19,381
- I know.
- Yes.

1289
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:20,810
It would be perfect...

1290
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:22,781
if we had soda here.

1291
00:54:22,781 --> 00:54:24,750
- Like coke.
- Let's see.

1292
00:54:25,381 --> 00:54:26,420
We have I. A.

1293
00:54:27,821 --> 00:54:28,821
You mean iced tea?

1294
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:31,091
- I. A.
- I. A.

1295
00:54:31,721 --> 00:54:33,491
(Snorting)

1296
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:34,830
I. A.

1297
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,560
- I. A.
- I. A.

1298
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,730
I. A.? Do you know what that is?

1299
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,330
Don't tell him. Do you know it or not?

1300
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,600
Iced Americano. I. A.

1301
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:46,000
(Amazed)

1302
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:47,870
(Amazed)

1303
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:51,611
You're the odd one here. Everyone knows what it is.

1304
00:54:51,781 --> 00:54:53,841
- Iced...
- There's I. V. L. too.

1305
00:54:53,841 --> 00:54:55,080
What's I. V. L.?

1306
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,350
- It's another short form.
- Iced...

1307
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,290
Iced Vanilla Latte?

1308
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:02,891
- You're right.
- Gosh.

1309
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,661
(Embarrassed)

1310
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:11,201
That was so difficult.

1311
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:16,100
- Iced Vanilla...
- He just got lucky.

1312
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,170
Latte?

1313
00:55:18,071 --> 00:55:20,201
- That was super difficult.
- I know.

1314
00:55:20,201 --> 00:55:21,870
(They had a good laugh thanks to Hee Won.)

1315
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:26,411
- This is delicious.
- I brought something for dessert.

1316
00:55:26,411 --> 00:55:28,810
- What is it?
- It's a pie.

1317
00:55:29,011 --> 00:55:31,150
- My goodness!
- We need to eat the pie!

1318
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:33,480
I'm not even half full!

1319
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,891
- Some pie right now will be good.
- You can have it tomorrow.

1320
00:55:35,891 --> 00:55:37,661
This is my first meal of the day!

1321
00:55:39,391 --> 00:55:41,431
Get some forks for the pie.

1322
00:55:41,431 --> 00:55:43,361
- That's...
- Apple pie?

1323
00:55:43,361 --> 00:55:45,600
- No, this is pecan pie.
- Pecan pie.

1324
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,031
- It's pecan pie.
- Sit down.

1325
00:55:47,031 --> 00:55:49,370
- I...
- Yoon A from Girls' Generation...

1326
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:51,141
brought a pie that I like.

1327
00:55:51,141 --> 00:55:52,370
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

1328
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:56,270
Gosh, I'm unexpectedly quite modern.

1329
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:58,440
- It's not unexpected.
- We should eat it prettily.

1330
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,611
Of course.

1331
00:55:59,611 --> 00:56:01,011
- Knife.
- Yes.

1332
00:56:01,011 --> 00:56:02,051
(Full of savory and crunchy pecan)

1333
00:56:02,051 --> 00:56:03,580
My gosh, the pie...

1334
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:06,480
- I made this myself.
- It looks so delicious.

1335
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,850
- You made it yourself?
- Yes.

1336
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:09,690
- You made it yourself?
- I made it at home.

1337
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:10,920
- Really?
- Yes.

1338
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:15,690
I was bored, so I spent my time baking at home recently...

1339
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,261
watching YouTube.

1340
00:56:17,261 --> 00:56:18,830
I hope you get bored often.

1341
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:21,000
- Let us know your house address.
- So...

1342
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,201
(We have a similar taste.)

1343
00:56:22,531 --> 00:56:29,040
(Yoon A's second present she prepared for the members)

1344
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,141
(The pecan pie she baked with her heart for two hours)

1345
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:33,411
This looks really good.

1346
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:36,810
(Exactly what he likes)

1347
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,920
How can you divide it into four?

1348
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,920
- She can cut it up more.
- I'll cut it up more.

1349
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,620
You're worried that you won't get a piece.

1350
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:47,020
Act your age. Don't be so immature.

1351
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,891
You need to eat a pie with your hands, not with a fork.

1352
00:56:49,891 --> 00:56:52,161
Don't you just eat it like this? Dong Il.

1353
00:56:52,161 --> 00:56:53,931
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1354
00:56:54,201 --> 00:56:56,801
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1355
00:56:56,801 --> 00:56:59,241
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1356
00:56:59,241 --> 00:57:01,940
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food.

1357
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:04,381
It looks really good.

1358
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,451
- It will go so well with coffee!
- Right?

1359
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:10,451
(How's the taste?)

1360
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,281
I want some coffee.

1361
00:57:12,281 --> 00:57:13,920
This tastes so luxurious.

1362
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,250
- Gosh.
- The scent, right?

1363
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,290
Really?

1364
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,960
- This is really good.
- I can see it's homemade.

1365
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,690
Really good.

1366
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,560
- It's so good.
- I'm glad to hear that.

1367
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,261
Byoung Cheol, you can take big bites for this. It's fine.

1368
00:57:27,261 --> 00:57:28,400
Okay.

1369
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:32,341
(Yes, like me!)

1370
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,940
(He gently picks it up...)

1371
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:38,281
(and takes a bite gracefully.)

1372
00:57:38,281 --> 00:57:40,141
The pastry is really savory.

1373
00:57:40,141 --> 00:57:43,051
The pastry is salty.

1374
00:57:43,051 --> 00:57:45,281
- I see.
- When there's only the pastry left.

1375
00:57:45,681 --> 00:57:47,491
Yoon A, this is really tasty!

1376
00:57:47,491 --> 00:57:48,891
- Really?
- It's so good.

1377
00:57:48,891 --> 00:57:51,721
It's baked really well. Good job.

1378
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:55,091
- The pastry is really savory.
- Thank you.

1379
00:57:55,091 --> 00:57:57,261
This is so much better than the ones they sell.

1380
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,661
This is so tasty!

1381
00:57:59,661 --> 00:58:01,100
(Byoung Cheol takes another piece after he's done with the first one.)

1382
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,000
I think it will be really good to have it as breakfast.

1383
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:04,670
It tastes really neat and nice.

1384
00:58:05,741 --> 00:58:08,040
- Today's lunch...
- It's the best.

1385
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,911
It's neat, it's neat.

1386
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,451
I heard there's a lot of freshwater fish down there.

1387
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,150
The mountain stream was pretty big.

1388
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:19,750
Let's go down and... What's that?

1389
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,790
If you apply some doenjang or paste,

1390
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,551
fish gather into it.

1391
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:25,020
- I want to try it.
- Fishing?

1392
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,221
- Fish trap!
- Fish trap, right.

1393
00:58:27,261 --> 00:58:30,631
We need to put some bait in here.

1394
00:58:30,631 --> 00:58:32,261
Something like doenjang.

1395
00:58:32,431 --> 00:58:34,900
- Do fish like doenjang too?
- Yes. Put some in here.

1396
00:58:36,201 --> 00:58:38,241
- Homemade doenjang.
- But...

1397
00:58:38,341 --> 00:58:40,741
Homemade doenjang, you're right. Homemade doenjang.

1398
00:58:40,741 --> 00:58:42,111
It's really fun when you pull it up.

1399
00:58:42,111 --> 00:58:43,111
I see.

1400
00:58:43,111 --> 00:58:44,511
It sounds so fun!

1401
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,911
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1402
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:51,181
(If they walk out a bit from the house...)

1403
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,951
(Containing Mount Jiri's energy)

1404
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:58,391
(Clean and cold water flowing)

1405
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,790
Is this enough?

1406
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,960
- Gosh.
- What is this?

1407
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,931
Is it a cherry blossom field?

1408
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:06,531
(They came across a cherry blossom forest on the way to the stream.)

1409
00:59:06,531 --> 00:59:09,031
- This is so nice.
- Cool!

1410
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:12,040
It feels so different when I come in here!

1411
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:13,870
Byoung Cheol.

1412
00:59:14,511 --> 00:59:17,111
- This feels so different!
- This is so pretty!

1413
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,181
The sky's full of cherry blossoms!

1414
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,980
(The cherry blossom covers the sky.)

1415
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,980
- This is so nice.
- It's so pretty.

1416
00:59:27,281 --> 00:59:28,290
Isn't it pretty, Hee Won?

1417
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:29,721
That's his face when he's the happiest.

1418
00:59:29,721 --> 00:59:33,020
That's his face when he's happy or he's having the most fun.

1419
00:59:33,991 --> 00:59:35,730
(They enjoy the cherry blossom for a while.)

1420
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:38,431
- This is so good.
- It's so pretty.

1421
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:41,670
Cherry blossom withers quickly, right?

1422
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:43,600
Yes. It withers too quickly,

1423
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:46,500
so it leaves you with lots of regrets.

1424
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,571
(They reach the stream like that.)

1425
00:59:51,641 --> 00:59:52,781
Amazing.

1426
00:59:52,781 --> 00:59:56,250
- The water's so clear.
- The water's so clean!

1427
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,120
The water's really clear.

1428
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:00,951
I can see all the way till there.

1429
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:03,951
(Even the sound of Mount Jiri's stream is refreshing.)

1430
01:00:03,951 --> 01:00:06,891
It's really refreshing, the sound and all.

1431
01:00:06,891 --> 01:00:07,891
(Even the sound of Mount Jiri's stream is refreshing.)

1432
01:00:07,891 --> 01:00:09,560
This is so nice.

1433
01:00:09,991 --> 01:00:11,861
(Si Wan gets excited after seeing the stream...)

1434
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:13,730
(and immediately gets ready to get in.)

1435
01:00:13,931 --> 01:00:15,971
Aren't the bamboos pretty?

1436
01:00:15,971 --> 01:00:18,471
- Are those bamboos?
- Yes.

1437
01:00:18,701 --> 01:00:22,111
- You're right.
- Aren't the bamboos pretty?

1438
01:00:23,111 --> 01:00:24,281
Look.

1439
01:00:27,011 --> 01:00:29,750
Gosh, the water's so clear!

1440
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:31,650
- It's so clear.
- Gosh.

1441
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,181
Dong Il, you're supposed to place it...

1442
01:00:34,181 --> 01:00:35,690
- somewhere here, right?
- Yes.

1443
01:00:35,891 --> 01:00:37,761
(Dong Il places the fish trap.)

1444
01:00:37,761 --> 01:00:39,560
(He's ready to get in.)

1445
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,290
This is a good spot, Hee Won.

1446
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:43,730
- Here.
- It'll be cold!

1447
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:45,400
- Goodness!
- It's so cold!

1448
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,131
- Around here?
- Add doenjang...

1449
01:00:47,131 --> 01:00:49,471
- Let me check the spot.
- here.

1450
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,270
- Here?
- Yes, there.

1451
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:53,040
- Right here?
- Yes. Press it down with the stone.

1452
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,141
Okay.

1453
01:00:54,141 --> 01:00:55,141
(Once they hold it down with a stone so it doesn't drift away, it's set.)

1454
01:00:55,141 --> 01:00:56,241
Done.

1455
01:00:56,341 --> 01:00:58,011
- What about here?
- I'm good with that.

1456
01:00:58,011 --> 01:00:59,381
- Sure.
- Where?

1457
01:00:59,381 --> 01:01:00,841
There. Yes, there.

1458
01:01:00,841 --> 01:01:01,980
- Here?
- Yes.

1459
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,051
- Stone? A big one?
- Yes.

1460
01:01:04,281 --> 01:01:05,620
(Enthusiastic)

1461
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,650
Stone...

1462
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:08,350
- Is it too big? Should I take this?
- Stone.

1463
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:13,560
- Si Wan.
- Si Wan, here's the stone.

1464
01:01:14,161 --> 01:01:16,560
(He's careful not to get into the water.)

1465
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:19,730
- Here, take it!
- "Take it!"

1466
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:21,471
I put it behind you.

1467
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,440
(Doing his best)

1468
01:01:25,801 --> 01:01:27,500
- This is too big.
- Is it too big?

1469
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,071
- I'll try.
- Is it too big?

1470
01:01:29,341 --> 01:01:30,810
If that's too big...

1471
01:01:33,381 --> 01:01:35,511
(The family members are trying to help Si Wan.)

1472
01:01:35,511 --> 01:01:38,681
Byoung Cheol, this is big enough to hold it in its place.

1473
01:01:38,681 --> 01:01:41,120
- That big.
- Yes.

1474
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,491
(Thank you.)

1475
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,221
Here you go.

1476
01:01:47,221 --> 01:01:49,290
- Is it working?
- Put one here...

1477
01:01:50,431 --> 01:01:52,031
My feet are so cold!

1478
01:01:53,861 --> 01:01:55,730
Do you need help? Should I get in?

1479
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:57,330
No, it's okay.

1480
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:59,000
- I just need to do this.
- He says it's okay.

1481
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:00,770
Gosh.

1482
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:01,971
Why?

1483
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:04,980
It needs to be placed here, but...

1484
01:02:05,841 --> 01:02:07,710
- I should go hold it down for him.
- You can't do that.

1485
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,580
It needs to be spread open, Si Wan.

1486
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:12,750
- It should become like this, right?
- Yes.

1487
01:02:12,951 --> 01:02:16,891
(He gets in barefoot to help Si Wan who's doing his best.)

1488
01:02:16,891 --> 01:02:18,620
- It's okay.
- I'll hold it for you!

1489
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,920
Please just hold it here.

1490
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,730
- Where?
- I just need to fix this, right?

1491
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:25,531
- It's done!
- It's done.

1492
01:02:25,531 --> 01:02:26,900
It's set up nicely.

1493
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,631
- Is it done?
- Is the shape correct?

1494
01:02:28,631 --> 01:02:30,400
- Yes, it's done.
- It's done!

1495
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,641
It's done nicely.

1496
01:02:32,341 --> 01:02:34,741
(Fish, eat a lot of doenjang!)

1497
01:02:35,141 --> 01:02:38,141
- This is fun!
- It is.

1498
01:02:38,141 --> 01:02:40,181
I hope we can catch a lot of fish.

1499
01:02:40,741 --> 01:02:41,781
Si Wan, don't worry...

1500
01:02:41,781 --> 01:02:43,111
- and come out now.
- Okay.

1501
01:02:43,111 --> 01:02:45,321
It's so nice to dip my feet inside.

1502
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:48,690
This is so nice!

1503
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:52,020
We should play skipping stones since we're here.

1504
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,531
(Si Wan throws with all his might!)

1505
01:02:55,531 --> 01:02:56,991
(Nice.)

1506
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,000
(Shy)

1507
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,560
Byoung Cheol, you're next.

1508
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,471
(Throwing with all his might)

1509
01:03:03,471 --> 01:03:04,971
- Byoung Cheol again. Gosh.
- Amazing!

1510
01:03:04,971 --> 01:03:07,701
(Everyone's surprised at his unexpected skill.)

1511
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:09,270
(Laughing)

1512
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:10,341
Do you like it?

1513
01:03:10,611 --> 01:03:12,341
- He says he likes it.
- How many skips was that?

1514
01:03:12,341 --> 01:03:13,781
- I don't know.
- That was a lot.

1515
01:03:16,451 --> 01:03:19,181
(Dong Il, who's good at everything, is also good at skipping stones.)

1516
01:03:19,821 --> 01:03:22,690
I'll make it skip nonstop this time.

1517
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:25,391
(When everyone's into skipping stones...)

1518
01:03:25,861 --> 01:03:28,460
(Wiggling)

1519
01:03:30,091 --> 01:03:32,100
Look at her tower!

1520
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:34,600
What did you wish for?

1521
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,500
Let's make a wish for the last time.

1522
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,000
I hope everyone stays healthy!

1523
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,611
- Stay healthy.
- Yes. Health is the best.

1524
01:03:41,611 --> 01:03:43,040
- Let's go.
- Let's go back.

1525
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,841
Doesn't it feel nice coming to a stream?

1526
01:03:45,841 --> 01:03:46,881
- Right?
- Yes.

1527
01:03:46,881 --> 01:03:49,080
I think I really like this sound. Isn't it nice?

1528
01:03:50,051 --> 01:03:52,781
Coming to a stream makes you feel good.

1529
01:03:53,381 --> 01:03:56,350
(After enjoying themselves at the stream in the front yard, )

1530
01:03:56,551 --> 01:03:59,790
(the sun sets and darkness falls upon the sky.)

1531
01:03:59,991 --> 01:04:03,631
Now, we should let Yoon A do some firegazing.

1532
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:05,900
- Nice.
- Wait for a while.

1533
01:04:06,261 --> 01:04:09,230
(If Yoon A wants to do it)

1534
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,040
(Fascinated)

1535
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,611
When was your last firegazing?

1536
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:18,111
I think it was quite long ago. I can't really remember.

1537
01:04:18,111 --> 01:04:19,611
- Then it's really long ago.
- Yes.

1538
01:04:19,611 --> 01:04:20,781
- What about you?
- Same here.

1539
01:04:20,781 --> 01:04:22,181
- Really?
- Yes.

1540
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:24,620
- I see.
- I haven't been camping often.

1541
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:25,620
Really?

1542
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,420
When it's Christmas, I did something like this.

1543
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,650
I'll play a 4K video on TV...

1544
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,891
- of a fireplace. Do you know that?
- I see.

1545
01:04:31,991 --> 01:04:33,721
You can play that.

1546
01:04:34,091 --> 01:04:35,960
I'll sit in front looking at the fireplace.

1547
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,060
I watched it on YouTube as well.

1548
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,361
- Right?
- Gosh.

1549
01:04:38,361 --> 01:04:40,161
You guys have a lot in common.

1550
01:04:40,931 --> 01:04:42,571
I just watched stuff like that.

1551
01:04:42,571 --> 01:04:46,241
I don't actually have much experience in it.

1552
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:49,841
Hold on for a while. Firegazing is amazing.

1553
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,480
Gosh, isn't the fire amazing?

1554
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,480
This is so nice.

1555
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,350
(This is so nice.)

1556
01:05:07,161 --> 01:05:11,830
(A song with a good vibe cannot be missed.)

1557
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:13,330
You know this, right? Have you heard of it before?

1558
01:05:13,330 --> 01:05:16,631
- No, but it's really nice.
- No? You don't know this song?

1559
01:05:16,631 --> 01:05:19,241
This is so nice!

1560
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:22,111
- Oh, I know this song!
- Right?

1561
01:05:22,111 --> 01:05:24,040
This is a very famous song.

1562
01:05:25,681 --> 01:05:28,551
(This is such a great atmosphere.)

1563
01:05:32,051 --> 01:05:33,681
The song goes well with the fire.

1564
01:05:33,681 --> 01:05:35,650
- It really does.
- Yes.

1565
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:38,520
- This is really nice.
- It's nice.

1566
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,520
(Byoung Cheol is satisfied.)

1567
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:42,161
I wanted to firegaze like this.

1568
01:05:46,661 --> 01:05:52,940
(Their firegazing gets better with the nice song.)

1569
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:56,810
(House on Wheels Season 2)

1570
01:05:57,611 --> 01:06:01,480
Now, let's prepare dinner.

1571
01:06:01,881 --> 01:06:03,980
Let's use this fire...

1572
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:05,920
and grill the chicken with charcoal fire.

1573
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:08,591
- The chicken from the mountain.
- I see.

1574
01:06:08,591 --> 01:06:10,051
We can just put some charcoal here.

1575
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:14,261
I still can't forget that from 20 years ago in Mount Jiri.

1576
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:17,591
They raise chickens in the mountains.

1577
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:20,000
(Full of Mount Jiri's energy with clean air and water)

1578
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:21,500
(Chickens raised freely in the mountain without stress)

1579
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,201
It's really famous on Mount Jiri.

1580
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:24,900
You don't need any sauce.

1581
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,770
Just grill it with some salt on charcoal fire.

1582
01:06:28,141 --> 01:06:31,241
You really can't forget the clean taste...

1583
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:32,440
of a native chicken.

1584
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,741
(It brings out the clean taste and chewy texture of a native chicken.)

1585
01:06:33,741 --> 01:06:35,551
- No sauce at all.
- Really?

1586
01:06:35,551 --> 01:06:37,980
It's really good. I always wanted...

1587
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,951
to let you guys try it if we come here.

1588
01:06:40,951 --> 01:06:42,150
(He really wants the others to taste it.)

1589
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:43,891
Dong Il, cheonggukjang jjigae...

1590
01:06:43,891 --> 01:06:47,020
Yes, I brought it with me from home.

1591
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,431
Pickled ramp.

1592
01:06:48,431 --> 01:06:49,931
They really go well together.

1593
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:52,301
This looks so good.

1594
01:06:52,301 --> 01:06:53,301
This is art.

1595
01:06:53,931 --> 01:06:55,031
Let's get moving.

1596
01:06:55,031 --> 01:06:57,670
Then you should cook cheonggukjang jjigae.

1597
01:06:57,801 --> 01:06:58,940
- Yes.
- Cheonggukjang jjigae for you.

1598
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:01,141
- You start the charcoal fire, - Charcoal fire.

1599
01:07:01,141 --> 01:07:03,710
and Byoung Cheol and I will set up the tent.

1600
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:05,440
- Okay.
- Let's set up the tent.

1601
01:07:05,781 --> 01:07:08,210
- I want to try it too!
- Sure, let's do it together.

1602
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:10,750
I'm very experienced in setting up a tent.

1603
01:07:11,821 --> 01:07:13,881
It's not that hard.

1604
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:15,920
(It sounds fun.)

1605
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:17,920
Let's start preparing dinner.

1606
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:19,560
You're cooking cheonggukjang jjigae.

1607
01:07:20,091 --> 01:07:21,830
(He starts with cheonggukjang jjigae to boil it for a long time.)

1608
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,361
(Two big lumps)

1609
01:07:23,661 --> 01:07:26,500
(He prepares various vegetables to add into the jjigae.)

1610
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:30,000
(Is there anything I can help you with?)

1611
01:07:30,301 --> 01:07:32,270
(Applying perilla oil)

1612
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,440
(He puts in a lot of beef.)

1613
01:07:34,841 --> 01:07:36,770
(He squeezes sour kimchi...)

1614
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:39,611
(and cuts it.)

1615
01:07:39,941 --> 01:07:43,780
(Fry them in perilla oil, )

1616
01:07:44,151 --> 01:07:46,481
(and add rice water.)

1617
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:50,191
- What's that, Dong Il?
- Cheonggukjang.

1618
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:52,820
- This is cheonggukjang!
- It doesn't smell much, right?

1619
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,931
- No.
- Pass me some doenjang.

1620
01:07:55,091 --> 01:07:57,091
(Here is the homemade doenjang!)

1621
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:01,330
(He adds the doenjang for the savory taste!)

1622
01:08:01,771 --> 01:08:03,570
(It smells so savory.)

1623
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:05,040
- It's savory.
- Gosh!

1624
01:08:05,141 --> 01:08:06,471
That's why I like it.

1625
01:08:06,471 --> 01:08:08,610
It doesn't smell repulsive.

1626
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:11,311
(And today's main ingredient!)

1627
01:08:11,311 --> 01:08:12,441
(Amazed)

1628
01:08:13,941 --> 01:08:15,511
(Amazed)

1629
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:17,551
There's raw chicken here.

1630
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:18,750
(Chicken from Mount Jiri that got delivered directly)

1631
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:20,820
(Very meaty)

1632
01:08:21,151 --> 01:08:22,250
This is unbelievable.

1633
01:08:23,091 --> 01:08:24,521
(Chef Sung even prepares the chicken himself!)

1634
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:28,261
How do you prepare chicken?

1635
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:31,860
(He even prepares a chicken in House on Wheels Season 2!)

1636
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:35,070
(He skillfully cuts off the drumsticks.)

1637
01:08:35,631 --> 01:08:38,101
(The assistant chef has the plate ready.)

1638
01:08:38,401 --> 01:08:40,200
Do you need the windshield?

1639
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,200
It's fine.

1640
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:44,811
(He cooks cheonggukjang jjigae without being told to.)

1641
01:08:44,811 --> 01:08:46,110
It looks so delicious.

1642
01:08:46,641 --> 01:08:48,250
(He flips it around.)

1643
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:51,750
(He cuts off the tail neatly to get rid of the smell!)

1644
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,181
We don't eat the skin.

1645
01:08:54,181 --> 01:08:55,591
(Can't take his eyes off)

1646
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,360
(Si Wan, who was watching him carefully, )

1647
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:00,620
(takes out a knife.)

1648
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:02,761
Would you like to use this?

1649
01:09:03,231 --> 01:09:05,500
(Thank you!)

1650
01:09:06,261 --> 01:09:09,830
(He cuts it up into different parts with the knife Si Wan gave.)

1651
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:13,670
(He cuts it up into a size that's easy to eat.)

1652
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,540
(It's going smooth thanks to Si Wan.)

1653
01:09:16,841 --> 01:09:18,941
(He's done with preparing the chicken!)

1654
01:09:18,941 --> 01:09:21,851
- Now I should blanch this, right?
- Yes.

1655
01:09:22,151 --> 01:09:23,511
Fatsia shoots were really good.

1656
01:09:23,511 --> 01:09:24,511
You're right.

1657
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:25,620
I really wanted to try setting up a tent!

1658
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,221
You can finally do it.

1659
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:31,091
We'll carry the deck to you, so you should try setting it up.

1660
01:09:31,521 --> 01:09:32,521
Got it.

1661
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:36,191
You won't say that you want to sleep in a tent later, right?

1662
01:09:36,191 --> 01:09:37,790
(Yoon A, you won't say that you want to sleep in a tent later, right?)

1663
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:39,200
- Be careful of your hands.
- Okay.

1664
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:41,231
This is a deck!

1665
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
(I see.)

1666
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,670
- This is enough.
- Okay.

1667
01:09:44,771 --> 01:09:47,101
This is enough. Next is the tent.

1668
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:48,841
(Full of charisma)

1669
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:50,870
This isn't it.

1670
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:52,641
(Wait, this isn't it.)

1671
01:09:53,181 --> 01:09:55,481
Is it this? No, it's not.

1672
01:09:55,481 --> 01:09:56,651
(Byoung Cheol quietly searches for it.)

1673
01:09:57,311 --> 01:09:59,320
- Here's the tent!
- That's the tent.

1674
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,290
- It's this one.
- I see.

1675
01:10:03,221 --> 01:10:04,250
Nice.

1676
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,891
Then you need to connect the poles so they become long.

1677
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,160
I like setting up things like this.

1678
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:12,301
Really?

1679
01:10:12,301 --> 01:10:14,330
- Handling machines and stuff.
- I see.

1680
01:10:14,431 --> 01:10:16,431
(Yoon A really wanted to try setting up a tent.)

1681
01:10:16,431 --> 01:10:17,431
(Connecting the pole)

1682
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:19,271
This should be here.

1683
01:10:19,271 --> 01:10:20,601
(Focused)

1684
01:10:21,141 --> 01:10:23,441
(She connects the pole that's taller than her)

1685
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:26,240
- Are you done?
- Yes.

1686
01:10:27,311 --> 01:10:29,151
Once you're done with that...

1687
01:10:29,151 --> 01:10:30,311
(Good job.)

1688
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:32,051
How did this work again?

1689
01:10:32,881 --> 01:10:36,151
This... Where's the entrance?

1690
01:10:37,221 --> 01:10:38,960
I think it's this. Is it not?

1691
01:10:39,561 --> 01:10:41,391
You're right, that's the entrance.

1692
01:10:41,391 --> 01:10:44,231
(Yoon A seems to know better than the owner of the house.)

1693
01:10:44,431 --> 01:10:45,801
What do I do with this?

1694
01:10:45,801 --> 01:10:47,731
(He can't remember.)

1695
01:10:47,731 --> 01:10:48,771
Like this?

1696
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:53,370
Like this. The entrance should come here.

1697
01:10:54,971 --> 01:10:56,870
Something's strange.

1698
01:10:57,971 --> 01:10:59,481
Didn't you use this before?

1699
01:10:59,841 --> 01:11:03,481
Yes, but I forgot.

1700
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:07,620
- Wait, from here...
- It can happen.

1701
01:11:08,021 --> 01:11:10,521
Oh! I totally got it now.

1702
01:11:11,391 --> 01:11:13,360
- It has a hole at the end.
- Yes.

1703
01:11:13,721 --> 01:11:15,061
- Do you see the hole?
- Yes.

1704
01:11:15,761 --> 01:11:17,561
But there won't be a hole on this side.

1705
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:21,061
The hole... There's one here as well.

1706
01:11:21,061 --> 01:11:22,771
(He gets nothing correct.)

1707
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:24,801
(She bursts out laughing.)

1708
01:11:25,471 --> 01:11:26,740
Put it in here.

1709
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:27,740
(Try putting it in first.)

1710
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:30,740
- Put them in.
- All four of them?

1711
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:31,841
Yes, put each of them here.

1712
01:11:31,841 --> 01:11:32,841
(I got it.)

1713
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:35,110
Here. Now lift it up.

1714
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,780
- Are you done?
- Yes.

1715
01:11:36,881 --> 01:11:37,910
- Yes, I'm done.
- You're done, right?

1716
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:39,320
- Yes, it's all done.
- Yes.

1717
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,320
- Make it stand.
- Then make it stand.

1718
01:11:41,891 --> 01:11:45,120
After this, the hook at the end here...

1719
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,120
needs to be hooked in the pole.

1720
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,561
(I see.)

1721
01:11:48,061 --> 01:11:50,490
Pull it here...

1722
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:51,631
(Pull it tight!)

1723
01:11:51,631 --> 01:11:53,101
(My goodness.)

1724
01:11:53,131 --> 01:11:54,160
Try it.

1725
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:56,500
(Dizzy)

1726
01:11:56,801 --> 01:11:58,471
That's right. Yes.

1727
01:11:58,471 --> 01:11:59,500
(The students are quick to learn.)

1728
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:03,441
Nice! Okay.

1729
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,641
Now this side.

1730
01:12:05,641 --> 01:12:07,011
It's so fun!

1731
01:12:07,011 --> 01:12:08,811
(They are somehow progressing.)

1732
01:12:09,351 --> 01:12:11,481
- You're good!
- You're really good.

1733
01:12:11,481 --> 01:12:12,820
Here now.

1734
01:12:14,351 --> 01:12:16,091
Nice. After this...

1735
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:20,420
(Blinking)

1736
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,290
How did I do it?

1737
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:23,391
(They just need to fix it now.)

1738
01:12:23,391 --> 01:12:24,431
I'm sorry.

1739
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:28,231
With this...

1740
01:12:28,931 --> 01:12:31,401
Aren't you supposed to fix it at the hook?

1741
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:33,200
Is it this one?

1742
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,341
Is there something?

1743
01:12:34,341 --> 01:12:37,210
That's right. That...

1744
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:38,981
Do you connect it with a rope?

1745
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:40,381
No, they just did it.

1746
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:42,910
They just pulled it like this and hammered it here.

1747
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:44,910
I see. On the deck?

1748
01:12:44,981 --> 01:12:46,521
(Right on the deck?)

1749
01:12:46,521 --> 01:12:47,580
I'm certain about this.

1750
01:12:48,181 --> 01:12:49,820
(A tent peg...)

1751
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:51,920
(is always...)

1752
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:55,160
(hammered into the ground while connected by a rope.)

1753
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:58,191
(You tried it before...)

1754
01:12:58,631 --> 01:13:00,830
(He even tried it himself.)

1755
01:13:01,431 --> 01:13:02,431
- With this.
- With this.

1756
01:13:02,431 --> 01:13:04,530
They just hammered it on the wood.

1757
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:07,070
(Is it possible to hammer it on the hard deck?)

1758
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:08,740
Can this go in here?

1759
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,141
Yes, it's correct.

1760
01:13:10,141 --> 01:13:11,941
- Between here?
- Yes.

1761
01:13:12,511 --> 01:13:13,910
Can we pierce the deck?

1762
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:16,151
- It's fine.
- I see.

1763
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:18,620
Hold it for her.

1764
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:21,381
(They try to hammer a peg into the deck for the first time.)

1765
01:13:21,790 --> 01:13:24,691
(Did she succeed in piercing the deck?)

1766
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,530
(She hammers fiercely for a long time.)

1767
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,490
- It went in.
- Right?

1768
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:31,490
Yes.

1769
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,901
This...

1770
01:13:34,061 --> 01:13:35,070
What happened?

1771
01:13:35,931 --> 01:13:37,401
The gap's too wide.

1772
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:38,401
(Change of player)

1773
01:13:38,401 --> 01:13:40,000
(He hammers with his strength.)

1774
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,170
(He changes the spot on the wood instead of the gap.)

1775
01:13:43,471 --> 01:13:46,740
It went in, right? It's secure. This as well...

1776
01:13:47,141 --> 01:13:49,410
(He just hammers it in with his strength.)

1777
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:52,021
- It's in. Right?
- Yes.

1778
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:53,381
It's a bit...

1779
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:56,851
This is not perfect,

1780
01:13:56,851 --> 01:13:58,660
- but I think this should suffice.
- That's fine.

1781
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,691
It's done. It's really done.

1782
01:14:01,891 --> 01:14:04,731
Well, after this,

1783
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:07,700
you need to roll it up like this.

1784
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:10,200
- This is a bit...
- It's correct!

1785
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:15,641
(Rolling)

1786
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,910
Gosh, are you all right?

1787
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:22,011
(Oh my goodness.)

1788
01:14:22,381 --> 01:14:24,311
(Hee Won rolls on the ground.)

1789
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:26,181
(After rolling once, )

1790
01:14:26,181 --> 01:14:27,250
(he ties his shoelace.)

1791
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:29,051
(Glaring)

1792
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:30,551
That...

1793
01:14:30,551 --> 01:14:32,920
(Because of that peg!)

1794
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:35,830
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1795
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:37,231
(Laughing)

1796
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:39,500
My shoelace got stuck.

1797
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,401
(Trying to act as naturally as possible)

1798
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,030
We need to place a mat.

1799
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:46,040
(He's also acting as naturally as possible.)

1800
01:14:46,271 --> 01:14:47,301
Just open the whole thing.

1801
01:14:47,301 --> 01:14:48,341
(Focusing on his role as naturally as possible)

1802
01:14:48,341 --> 01:14:49,570
You can just open the whole thing.

1803
01:14:50,370 --> 01:14:52,011
(Staggering)

1804
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,941
(Laughing)

1805
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:56,210
Darn it.

1806
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:57,910
All right. Here.

1807
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:59,780
(They lose their strength.)

1808
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:01,221
(She bursts into laughter.)

1809
01:15:01,481 --> 01:15:04,351
(Even Byoung Cheol bursts into laughter.)

1810
01:15:04,351 --> 01:15:05,891
I'll do it like this.

1811
01:15:05,891 --> 01:15:06,960
(They all lose their composure.)

1812
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,290
I'll do it like this.

1813
01:15:08,561 --> 01:15:09,990
(I...)

1814
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:11,061
(I can't do this.)

1815
01:15:11,431 --> 01:15:13,200
It's exhausting.

1816
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,931
- We will...
- Right.

1817
01:15:15,931 --> 01:15:18,200
- spread the mat for you.
- We'll spread it for you.

1818
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,200
(Get some rest.)

1819
01:15:20,101 --> 01:15:21,971
What would I have done without you guys?

1820
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:23,110
I'd have been in big trouble.

1821
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:24,170
(He's completely exhausted.)

1822
01:15:24,841 --> 01:15:28,210
What are the three of them doing with a tent?

1823
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:29,651
(Embarrassed)

1824
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:31,450
(Cheonggukjang jjigae has been boiled for a long time.)

1825
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:34,250
It's not deeper than regular cheonggukjang jjigae.

1826
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:35,721
I like cheonggukjang jjigae.

1827
01:15:36,091 --> 01:15:38,250
- There's no space to put this.
- What is it?

1828
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,290
(Yoon A came to help them.)

1829
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,721
There's no table to put them on.

1830
01:15:40,721 --> 01:15:42,931
No, don't move. Just stay seated.

1831
01:15:43,631 --> 01:15:44,660
Stay seated.

1832
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,401
Stay seated. Here.

1833
01:15:46,601 --> 01:15:49,731
People don't like to have strong cheonggukjang jjigae.

1834
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:50,901
(Surprised)

1835
01:15:50,901 --> 01:15:52,070
- There's beef in it.
- I made it...

1836
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:53,441
to suit the palate of young people.

1837
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:56,370
- Can I try it?
- Yes. Let's have it with kimchi.

1838
01:15:57,141 --> 01:15:58,981
Yoon A, the cheonggukjang jjigae is really good.

1839
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,481
That's why I like it.

1840
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:01,881
Because it's soft.

1841
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:03,651
(Impressed)

1842
01:16:03,651 --> 01:16:05,481
- Right? It's not too stinky, right?
- It's not.

1843
01:16:06,351 --> 01:16:07,681
I used rice water to make it.

1844
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,051
You used rice water?

1845
01:16:09,051 --> 01:16:12,790
I stir-fried beef and kimchi with perilla oil.

1846
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:15,830
(Taking a bite of the soup and the ingredients)

1847
01:16:16,231 --> 01:16:18,731
(She gets a good taste of cheonggukjang jjigae.)

1848
01:16:22,431 --> 01:16:23,570
- It's so good.
- It is, right?

1849
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:24,601
Yes.

1850
01:16:24,601 --> 01:16:26,141
(Pleased)

1851
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,540
(She finishes the whole bowl.)

1852
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,110
(Exclaiming)

1853
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:32,210
- I feel better after having this.
- Really?

1854
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:33,280
It's so good.

1855
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:36,110
We're putting everything on the plate, right?

1856
01:16:36,110 --> 01:16:38,151
Yes, just put them on separate plates.

1857
01:16:38,151 --> 01:16:39,481
Just pour them into the dishes.

1858
01:16:40,881 --> 01:16:43,221
I'll cut the root, so it'll be softer.

1859
01:16:43,221 --> 01:16:45,960
- I see. Okay.
- He's really fast.

1860
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,620
He really is.

1861
01:16:48,091 --> 01:16:49,231
I can finish it in no time.

1862
01:16:49,290 --> 01:16:52,200
- Doesn't he make everything fast?
- I love it.

1863
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,301
(There are smiles all around the kitchen thanks to Yoon A.)

1864
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,801
Should I take it?

1865
01:16:55,101 --> 01:16:56,131
Okay.

1866
01:16:56,271 --> 01:16:57,801
All right. Good job.

1867
01:16:57,801 --> 01:16:59,441
(Yoon A takes the fatsia shoots that Dong Il blanched.)

1868
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:04,811
- Is that spring cabbage?
- Yes, it is.

1869
01:17:04,941 --> 01:17:08,311
I'm seasoning the leftover vegetables.

1870
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:09,780
(Si Wan was working busily as an assistant chef.)

1871
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:11,450
I'll make two plates of sesame oil dip.

1872
01:17:12,881 --> 01:17:14,521
(Walking about busily)

1873
01:17:16,551 --> 01:17:18,021
(Adding sugar)

1874
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,920
(Walking about busily again)

1875
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,530
(He comes back and adds soy sauce.)

1876
01:17:22,731 --> 01:17:26,030
(He seasoned spring cabbage while serving as an assistant chef.)

1877
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:30,170
Let's just make geotjeori out of it.

1878
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:33,200
Here. Show me your skills.

1879
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,670
I should just mix it gently.

1880
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:37,971
- It becomes less stiff.
- It does.

1881
01:17:37,971 --> 01:17:39,580
Just roughly mix it.

1882
01:17:40,141 --> 01:17:41,410
Can I try a piece?

1883
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:42,811
Yes, sure.

1884
01:17:44,551 --> 01:17:46,250
(Following Yoon A's hand)

1885
01:17:46,851 --> 01:17:48,651
(Lifting his head)

1886
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:50,591
- Did you try it?
- No.

1887
01:17:50,591 --> 01:17:51,820
(Looking bright)

1888
01:17:52,221 --> 01:17:53,460
(Exclaiming)

1889
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,790
- Do you want to try it?
- Sure.

1890
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:56,891
I think a small piece will do.

1891
01:17:56,891 --> 01:17:58,530
(Feeding it into his mouth)

1892
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,561
Should we add something more? Does it taste okay?

1893
01:18:01,561 --> 01:18:03,601
- No? Is it enough?
- It's perfect.

1894
01:18:04,301 --> 01:18:05,570
It's really nice.

1895
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:07,941
Yoon A, hold on.

1896
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:10,410
- For the finishing touch...
- What do you want to add?

1897
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:11,410
Sesame seeds.

1898
01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:13,141
(Adding sesame seeds as a finishing touch)

1899
01:18:13,881 --> 01:18:15,450
Aren't you adding too much?

1900
01:18:16,151 --> 01:18:17,181
That's enough!

1901
01:18:18,011 --> 01:18:19,750
Why did you add so much sesame seeds?

1902
01:18:20,381 --> 01:18:21,450
Seriously.

1903
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:24,151
(Si Wan learned it from Dong Il.)

1904
01:18:24,651 --> 01:18:25,920
(Roasted Mount Jiri wild chicken)

1905
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:26,990
Let's grill them now.

1906
01:18:27,221 --> 01:18:29,790
There's coarse salt and pepper, right?

1907
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:31,191
It looks amazing.

1908
01:18:31,191 --> 01:18:32,601
(It looks amazing.)

1909
01:18:33,061 --> 01:18:34,731
(They only use salt to season the roasted chicken.)

1910
01:18:34,731 --> 01:18:36,101
Like this. That's nice.

1911
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,101
(Byong Cheol adds more firewood too.)

1912
01:18:38,101 --> 01:18:39,101
That's nice. Put it here.

1913
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:42,771
We'd have been in big trouble if you didn't come.

1914
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:44,170
I know.

1915
01:18:44,971 --> 01:18:46,040
(He's exhausted from setting up the tent.)

1916
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,141
You can't wait to taste it, right?

1917
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:50,080
What's wrong? Did you get exhausted from setting up the tent?

1918
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:52,551
Dong Il, it was really exhausting.

1919
01:18:53,681 --> 01:18:55,721
I even embarrassed myself. I fell down.

1920
01:18:56,021 --> 01:18:57,221
How did you fall?

1921
01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:01,091
I tripped over a peg.

1922
01:19:01,221 --> 01:19:03,290
- The peg you nailed?
- Yes.

1923
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,860
- That's why you fell?
- Yes.

1924
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:06,131
(Poor Hee Won.)

1925
01:19:06,631 --> 01:19:08,231
(He gets more embarrassed the more he thinks about it.)

1926
01:19:08,231 --> 01:19:09,330
(Sighing)

1927
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:12,471
You said you'd teach Byoung Cheol.

1928
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:13,801
It wasn't bad, was it, Byoung Cheol?

1929
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,740
(Coughing)

1930
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:17,941
What is a slapstick comedy?

1931
01:19:18,311 --> 01:19:19,610
How can you call it a slapstick comedy?

1932
01:19:19,811 --> 01:19:20,841
(At that moment, he faces Yoon A.)

1933
01:19:20,841 --> 01:19:22,651
(Sighing)

1934
01:19:23,151 --> 01:19:24,551
Yoon A has a nice personality.

1935
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:26,721
- Why?
- She has a nice personality.

1936
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:31,551
(Impressed)

1937
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:34,460
It looks like it'll taste light. It's native chicken.

1938
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:35,530
(The roasted chicken gets cooked while glowing.)

1939
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:36,561
Look at this.

1940
01:19:36,691 --> 01:19:38,490
I peeled off all of its skin.

1941
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:39,901
- Really?
- There's only meat.

1942
01:19:39,901 --> 01:19:41,500
I didn't peel off the wings on purpose.

1943
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:44,530
I'm drooling as I'm grilling these.

1944
01:19:45,101 --> 01:19:46,971
I'm serious.

1945
01:19:46,971 --> 01:19:47,971
(He's cute.)

1946
01:19:48,471 --> 01:19:49,811
I think it'll be really light.

1947
01:19:49,811 --> 01:19:55,551
(The chicken is getting cooked until they turn golden brown.)

1948
01:19:56,811 --> 01:19:58,511
(Waiting for the chicken to be cooked)

1949
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:00,681
(Shivering)

1950
01:20:00,681 --> 01:20:01,681
Are you cold?

1951
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:04,151
I'm suddenly feeling cold because I fell.

1952
01:20:04,721 --> 01:20:06,120
(Embarrassed)

1953
01:20:06,521 --> 01:20:08,761
(Bursting into laughter)

1954
01:20:09,431 --> 01:20:12,330
(He ends up bursting into laughter.)

1955
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:15,231
You tried really hard not to laugh earlier, right?

1956
01:20:15,231 --> 01:20:17,801
- Not at all.
- No, we were really worried.

1957
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,370
(The more he thinks about it, the more embarrassed he gets.)

1958
01:20:21,370 --> 01:20:23,641
Do you usually sleep early and get up early?

1959
01:20:23,841 --> 01:20:26,080
I'm sleeping late these days.

1960
01:20:26,441 --> 01:20:28,441
I sleep at around 1 or 2am.

1961
01:20:29,811 --> 01:20:31,181
Did you say you sleep at 5am?

1962
01:20:31,311 --> 01:20:34,021
Hee Won said he sleeps at 5am. I sleep at around 3am.

1963
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:37,721
- What do you do until 5am?
- Sorry?

1964
01:20:38,290 --> 01:20:40,160
Time goes by really fast.

1965
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,191
I watch movies and stuff.

1966
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:44,290
It's like this.

1967
01:20:44,431 --> 01:20:48,601
Although you had a full day, it feels like your time alone...

1968
01:20:48,601 --> 01:20:51,070
starts at around 10pm.

1969
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:54,401
That's why although you don't do anything...

1970
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:57,311
I use my phone, read stuff on the Internet,

1971
01:20:57,311 --> 01:21:01,040
or watch a movie. However trivial it may be, I need that time.

1972
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:03,181
- Although you had fun all day.
- Right.

1973
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:05,250
That's right. Although I had fun all day,

1974
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:07,051
- when it's around 10pm...
- Even when you had fun all day.

1975
01:21:07,221 --> 01:21:09,790
you feel like you need the time to yourself.

1976
01:21:10,391 --> 01:21:12,221
That's when your day actually starts.

1977
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,221
- Although you had fun all day.
- I know. It just feels that way.

1978
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:19,801
(Dong Il is working hard to grill the chicken.)

1979
01:21:20,231 --> 01:21:21,360
(Sizzling)

1980
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,370
It's done.

1981
01:21:24,170 --> 01:21:25,330
It's well-cooked.

1982
01:21:25,471 --> 01:21:27,070
Look at this. It looks so good.

1983
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:28,101
(The chicken is well-roasted.)

1984
01:21:28,601 --> 01:21:29,740
It looks so good.

1985
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:30,740
(It makes your mouth water.)

1986
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:32,881
- The color has changed.
- It has, right?

1987
01:21:32,881 --> 01:21:33,910
Yes.

1988
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:36,910
- It looks so good.
- I know.

1989
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:38,851
It's amazing, Dong Il.

1990
01:21:39,521 --> 01:21:41,420
(Pleased)

1991
01:21:43,151 --> 01:21:44,151
It looks incredible.

1992
01:21:44,151 --> 01:21:45,450
Don't be too surprised when you taste it.

1993
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:47,790
(Moving the chicken to the plate)

1994
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:49,030
It looks so good.

1995
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,660
(A table full of dishes from Mount Jiri and roasted chicken)

1996
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:53,460
- It looks so good.
- It's amazing.

1997
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:56,431
- You need to eat it when it's hot.
- That's right.

1998
01:21:56,431 --> 01:21:58,000
(Roasted chicken smoked with oak wood charcoal)

1999
01:21:58,941 --> 01:21:59,941
Let's have this too.

2000
01:21:59,941 --> 01:22:01,000
(And deeply boiled cheonggukjang jjigae)

2001
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,271
It looks so good.

2002
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:04,410
(And fatsia shoots they picked from the back hill)

2003
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:06,481
Every dish on the table...

2004
01:22:06,681 --> 01:22:08,580
makes me feel like we've actually come to the mountains.

2005
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:12,320
We're not missing anything, right?

2006
01:22:12,403 --> 01:22:13,832
No. We can start now.

2007
01:22:13,903 --> 01:22:15,672
Let's eat.

2008
01:22:16,283 --> 01:22:17,313
Cheonggukjang jjigae.

2009
01:22:17,756 --> 01:22:18,987
Thank you for the food.

2010
01:22:20,556 --> 01:22:21,787
Have this first.

2011
01:22:22,827 --> 01:22:24,697
- Thank you.
- Eat it while it's hot.

2012
01:22:24,697 --> 01:22:25,897
(He gives the roasted chicken to his guests first.)

2013
01:22:25,897 --> 01:22:28,226
- Here. Have it.
- Thank you.

2014
01:22:28,626 --> 01:22:31,096
(Yoon A holds it with her hand.)

2015
01:22:31,867 --> 01:22:35,266
(Taking a big bite)

2016
01:22:38,207 --> 01:22:39,376
It's really good.

2017
01:22:40,306 --> 01:22:41,747
(I'm glad.)

2018
01:22:41,747 --> 01:22:42,817
It's good.

2019
01:22:44,216 --> 01:22:48,247
(Hee Won who has a palate of a kid takes a big bite too.)

2020
01:22:49,516 --> 01:22:51,657
Wow, it tastes like a rotisserie chicken.

2021
01:22:51,657 --> 01:22:52,726
Really? Try it.

2022
01:22:52,726 --> 01:22:54,126
It's really light.

2023
01:22:55,596 --> 01:22:58,796
(Let me try it.)

2024
01:23:00,897 --> 01:23:03,836
(This tastes interesting.)

2025
01:23:04,437 --> 01:23:06,766
(Satisfied)

2026
01:23:07,707 --> 01:23:08,766
(Light roasted chicken where its grease it all drained)

2027
01:23:08,766 --> 01:23:09,806
It's good.

2028
01:23:10,836 --> 01:23:11,876
It tastes like fried chicken too.

2029
01:23:12,707 --> 01:23:13,947
(Taking a big bite)

2030
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:15,277
I think you can hold it with your hand.

2031
01:23:15,876 --> 01:23:17,516
(Impressed)

2032
01:23:17,876 --> 01:23:19,086
It's really...

2033
01:23:19,187 --> 01:23:21,346
(It suits the palate of the assistant chef perfectly.)

2034
01:23:22,256 --> 01:23:24,256
(I'm glad everyone is enjoying it.)

2035
01:23:25,157 --> 01:23:28,187
(She holds the piece with her hand and bites of the meat.)

2036
01:23:29,596 --> 01:23:32,926
(Yoon A is in love with the roasted chicken.)

2037
01:23:34,296 --> 01:23:36,766
(She's even licking it off her fingers.)

2038
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:39,407
(Exclaiming)

2039
01:23:40,207 --> 01:23:42,306
I think Yoon A eats really well.

2040
01:23:42,306 --> 01:23:43,336
Right.

2041
01:23:43,707 --> 01:23:46,506
She ate really well even when we shot a drama together.

2042
01:23:46,876 --> 01:23:49,016
She wasn't picky about food either.

2043
01:23:49,016 --> 01:23:50,247
I noticed...

2044
01:23:50,247 --> 01:23:53,916
that she eats well little by little and chews a lot.

2045
01:23:53,916 --> 01:23:55,416
No, she ate a lot.

2046
01:23:55,756 --> 01:23:58,957
(Embarrassed)

2047
01:23:59,756 --> 01:24:01,357
Don't eat the dry part.

2048
01:24:01,357 --> 01:24:03,157
I want the dry part.

2049
01:24:03,357 --> 01:24:04,997
I really like the dry parts.

2050
01:24:04,997 --> 01:24:08,096
The dry part is actually really tasty.

2051
01:24:08,096 --> 01:24:09,166
(Thinking)

2052
01:24:09,166 --> 01:24:11,166
Everyone here likes the dry parts.

2053
01:24:11,166 --> 01:24:13,037
- You like the dry parts too?
- You like the dry parts too?

2054
01:24:13,037 --> 01:24:14,107
(I like the dry parts too.)

2055
01:24:14,306 --> 01:24:16,407
The dry parts are nicer, right?

2056
01:24:16,676 --> 01:24:18,237
- There's more meat too.
- Right.

2057
01:24:18,237 --> 01:24:20,447
It's hard to find people who like the dry parts.

2058
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:23,277
(I love the dry parts.)

2059
01:24:24,947 --> 01:24:26,647
It tastes like rotisserie chicken.

2060
01:24:26,647 --> 01:24:29,556
(They've all fallen for the roasted chicken.)

2061
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:32,556
- It's so good.
- I know. What's this?

2062
01:24:33,955 --> 01:24:35,766
I know. What's this?

2063
01:24:36,025 --> 01:24:38,125
- This is...
- It's Chinese artichoke.

2064
01:24:38,125 --> 01:24:39,695
They're made with various ingredients.

2065
01:24:40,035 --> 01:24:41,735
You can have chicken with these.

2066
01:24:43,566 --> 01:24:46,905
(She tries the angelica stem pickle first.)

2067
01:24:47,676 --> 01:24:49,445
It tastes like celery.

2068
01:24:50,006 --> 01:24:51,705
(Let's see.)

2069
01:24:52,046 --> 01:24:53,275
Right?

2070
01:24:53,275 --> 01:24:55,216
(They can only taste these pickles in Mount Jiri.)

2071
01:24:55,216 --> 01:24:56,915
(Exclaiming)

2072
01:24:57,445 --> 01:24:59,556
(Pleased)

2073
01:25:00,785 --> 01:25:02,785
I made this...

2074
01:25:02,926 --> 01:25:04,955
- with spring cabbage.
- It's geotjeori.

2075
01:25:04,955 --> 01:25:07,756
You can have it with the chicken.

2076
01:25:09,056 --> 01:25:10,266
Who made it?

2077
01:25:10,266 --> 01:25:13,636
This? I made it with Yoon A.

2078
01:25:13,735 --> 01:25:15,695
- Oh, really?
- That one?

2079
01:25:15,936 --> 01:25:18,966
- Si Wan did all the seasoning.
- Here.

2080
01:25:20,775 --> 01:25:22,235
It's good.

2081
01:25:23,945 --> 01:25:26,346
It's good!

2082
01:25:27,046 --> 01:25:29,016
(Let me try it.)

2083
01:25:29,445 --> 01:25:30,745
It's well-seasoned.

2084
01:25:30,745 --> 01:25:32,686
I know. Who made it?

2085
01:25:33,155 --> 01:25:34,915
(Embarrassed)

2086
01:25:35,415 --> 01:25:37,285
You never imagined you'd be able to...

2087
01:25:37,285 --> 01:25:39,085
have seasoned spring cabbage made by Yoon A, have you?

2088
01:25:39,085 --> 01:25:41,256
- No, I have never.
- Same here.

2089
01:25:41,396 --> 01:25:44,665
It's seasoned spring cabbage mixed by Yoon A.

2090
01:25:45,226 --> 01:25:48,165
(She's embarrassed by their high praise.)

2091
01:25:48,995 --> 01:25:52,606
The cheonggukjang jjigae turned out nice.

2092
01:25:53,306 --> 01:25:54,705
Isn't the cheonggukjang jjigae really nice?

2093
01:25:54,705 --> 01:25:56,575
(Taking a bite of cheonggukjang jjigae with savory aroma)

2094
01:25:58,745 --> 01:26:02,415
(Byoung Cheol slurps the jjigae too.)

2095
01:26:02,646 --> 01:26:04,346
Wow, the cheonggukjang jjigae is really nice.

2096
01:26:04,346 --> 01:26:05,745
- It is, right?
- Yes.

2097
01:26:06,085 --> 01:26:08,016
You can't say anything offensive, can you?

2098
01:26:09,726 --> 01:26:11,325
I try not to if I can.

2099
01:26:13,426 --> 01:26:15,625
(He finds Byoung Cheol's sudden confession hilarious.)

2100
01:26:16,066 --> 01:26:17,695
But I meant it.

2101
01:26:17,695 --> 01:26:19,695
- Really?
- It's good.

2102
01:26:23,035 --> 01:26:26,075
(Taking a spoonful of savory and thick soup)

2103
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:28,575
(It's perfect with rice.)

2104
01:26:28,575 --> 01:26:30,176
The cheonggukjang jjigae is good.

2105
01:26:30,176 --> 01:26:31,676
Right, it's good.

2106
01:26:33,716 --> 01:26:37,146
(They can't help but keep going back for each dish.)

2107
01:26:38,016 --> 01:26:40,686
(Pleased)

2108
01:26:42,926 --> 01:26:49,266
(They have carbonated water after finishing their meal.)

2109
01:26:50,566 --> 01:26:53,266
(That was a good meal.)

2110
01:26:58,735 --> 01:27:01,905
(They can separate the bottles easily as there are no labels.)

2111
01:27:02,506 --> 01:27:04,445
It was a good meal.

2112
01:27:04,445 --> 01:27:06,745
- It really was.
- It was.

2113
01:27:08,176 --> 01:27:09,485
It was delicious.

2114
01:27:09,485 --> 01:27:11,646
(What events await them tomorrow?)

2115
01:27:12,186 --> 01:27:14,256
It's way clearer than yesterday.

2116
01:27:14,256 --> 01:27:17,625
(The morning in Mount Jiri is always better than yesterday's.)

2117
01:27:17,785 --> 01:27:19,495
(Good morning.)

2118
01:27:19,955 --> 01:27:23,926
(They became even closer than the day before.)

2119
01:27:24,066 --> 01:27:25,426
(The members became real family now.)

2120
01:27:25,426 --> 01:27:26,596
(Their second day begins.)

2121
01:27:27,296 --> 01:27:31,506
(Driving along with the cherry blossoms of Seomjin River, )

2122
01:27:33,006 --> 01:27:35,335
(they've arrived at the green tea farm in Hadong.)

2123
01:27:35,676 --> 01:27:39,046
(They fully enjoy the fresh green tea in their front yard.)

2124
01:27:39,176 --> 01:27:44,546
(They enjoy the zip-line in the next town.)

2125
01:27:44,716 --> 01:27:48,816
(Roasted pork belly in bamboo)

2126
01:27:48,955 --> 01:27:52,186
(And the fresh oyster of Seomjin River)

2127
01:27:52,285 --> 01:27:54,356
(Exclaiming)

2128
01:27:55,226 --> 01:27:57,766
(Eyes going wide)

2129
01:27:59,025 --> 01:28:02,606
(They can't stop exclaiming at House on Wheels.)

2130
01:28:02,766 --> 01:28:07,905
(You'll come and hang out again, won't you?)
