1
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:32,005
(Today's front yard is tranquil Gyeongju.)

2
00:00:32,105 --> 00:00:33,406
(Laughing out loud)

3
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:36,105
(Laughing out loud)

4
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:38,675
(The guest with the most energy, Actress Oh Na Ra)

5
00:00:39,546 --> 00:00:42,776
(The House on Wheels is especially loud today.)

6
00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:45,616
(It must've become louder like the guest.)

7
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,386
(Not only Dong Il...)

8
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,485
(but Hee Won is also excited.)

9
00:00:50,656 --> 00:00:52,925
(Na Ra's positive energy spread to Si Wan as well.)

10
00:00:53,826 --> 00:00:56,055
(We're going to keep this energy until the end of the day!)

11
00:00:56,256 --> 00:01:00,796
(You're going to be exhausted from laughing.)

12
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:05,735
(One spring day, when flowers are in full bloom)

13
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,536
This is a trail.

14
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:13,046
When you visit the old palaces,

15
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:16,476
don't you become rather relaxed?

16
00:01:17,716 --> 00:01:20,555
(A place with beautiful views...)

17
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:23,156
(where you can't help but keep staring out the window)

18
00:01:24,955 --> 00:01:27,925
(Historic city of Gyeongju, where it's turned golden)

19
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:31,065
That's Cheomseongdae.

20
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:33,265
What?

21
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:35,565
Oh, Cheomseongdae? Right.

22
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:41,306
(The House on Wheels has arrived at Gyeongju.)

23
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:44,145
I remember coming here for a play.

24
00:01:44,406 --> 00:01:45,475
Here? In Gyeongju?

25
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:47,576
Yes, I had a play in Gyeongju.

26
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:52,785
(What kind of memories will they make in Gyeongju?)

27
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:55,115
Have you ever seen Dong Il's photo when he was young?

28
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,725
- When he was in his 20s.
- Of course not.

29
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:59,826
- You'll be totally surprised.
- Can you show me?

30
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:03,125
It was back in his heyday when he was a theater actor.

31
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,265
His heyday.

32
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:05,865
(My heyday?)

33
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:08,735
I'll look it up on the Internet.

34
00:02:08,735 --> 00:02:10,606
Yes, do that. You might find it.

35
00:02:11,535 --> 00:02:13,475
It's hard to find...

36
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:17,776
someone as good-looking as him around people of his age.

37
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:20,345
(Embarrassed)

38
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,815
Si Wan, you must see that photo.

39
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:25,746
- I should.
- You're the handsome type.

40
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,115
Not at all.

41
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:28,955
(Si Wan is like me.)

42
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,586
You'll change like him.

43
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:35,195
(Right...)

44
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:41,165
(Surprised)

45
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:42,996
He's so charismatic.

46
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:45,806
I told you. He was really handsome.

47
00:02:45,806 --> 00:02:48,676
(Dong Il used to be really charismatic.)

48
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:51,505
Wow, Dong Il. This is...

49
00:02:52,676 --> 00:02:54,475
Don't drink too much.

50
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:57,116
- He was really handsome, right?
- Wow, Dong Il.

51
00:02:57,116 --> 00:02:58,216
He was really handsome, right?

52
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:00,385
Don't drink too much.

53
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:03,486
(Laughing)

54
00:03:03,486 --> 00:03:04,625
(He's still in awe.)

55
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:05,956
My gosh, Dong Il.

56
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:08,656
Did I die or something, you punk?

57
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:12,866
Dong Il, your good looks are as good as dead.

58
00:03:12,866 --> 00:03:15,635
You can say they're as good as dead.

59
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:18,105
They're dead.

60
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:20,706
Why are you being so harsh when we're in Gyeongju?

61
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:22,875
Because Gyeongju is a historic city,

62
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,045
I had to mention your history.

63
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:27,375
He's like a prince.

64
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:28,915
(They praise Dong Il's heyday in a historic city.)

65
00:03:30,285 --> 00:03:34,056
(They naturally talk about his past as they're in a historic city.)

66
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,710
(They naturally talk about his past as they're in a historic city.)

67
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,710
Gosh, that startled me. I'm getting a call. Can you get it?

68
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,679
Hello, this is Im Si Wan, ma'am.

69
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,750
Hee Won is driving right now.

70
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:54,690
Oh, my. You caught me by surprise. Hello, Si Wan.

71
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,820
Hello.

72
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:58,789
(Who is today's guest...)

73
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:00,260
(with an uplifted voice?)

74
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,099
(She shows off her beauty even when she falls on a couch.)

75
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,099
(My goodness.)

76
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:07,539
(Even her catchphrase is cheerful and catchy.)

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,739
(Actress Oh Na Ra has come to the House on Wheels.)

78
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:13,109
(Which way to take?)

79
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:14,739
(I said to follow the path I told you!)

80
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:17,049
(Dong Il and Na Ra were in a movie called "Because I Love You".)

81
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,849
(They played a couple who fought a lot.)

82
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,590
(Na Ra played Hee Won's girlfriend in a recent movie they were in.)

83
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,559
(With excellent acting, )

84
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:35,530
(she's spending the heyday of her acting career.)

85
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:43,140
(The actress who's close with the members is today's guest.)

86
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,809
This wasn't my plan.

87
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:46,909
- What do you mean?
- Oh, really.

88
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,280
Should I hang up and call you again?

89
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,109
- Hang up. He'll call you again.
- Let's do it again.

90
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:51,349
- Call me again.
- Okay.

91
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:52,909
(Laughing)

92
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:55,419
What's this?

93
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:57,119
You got a call from Actress Oh Na Ra.

94
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:58,250
Can you get it for me?

95
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,919
(This is their first time to redo a phone call with a guest.)

96
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:01,590
Hey, Na Ra.

97
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:03,119
Hee Won, where are you?

98
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:06,489
I'm... It's...

99
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,099
Are we in Gyeongju? We're in Gyeongju.

100
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,270
Honey, it's been so long.

101
00:05:11,369 --> 00:05:12,700
I knew you'd say that.

102
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:15,739
(She can't stay coy for longer than 5 seconds.)

103
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,010
I hear you're coming to Gyeongju.

104
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:20,010
No, I'm at home right now.

105
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,780
Oh, really? I see.

106
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:25,510
Can you act naturally? My gosh.

107
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:27,820
- You didn't memorize your lines.
- "Lines"?

108
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,650
- You have that stage fright again.
- You must miss me so much.

109
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:35,090
I talked to Si Wan earlier,

110
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,059
and I found his voice really beautiful.

111
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:38,390
My gosh, thank you.

112
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:40,659
You should talk with him a lot today.

113
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,659
Yes, I will.

114
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,530
Let's do that. I'd love that.

115
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,669
You're going to talk a lot with Si Wan?

116
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,440
Yes, with Si Wan only.

117
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,270
Of course she wants to talk with him, not us.

118
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,270
Right.

119
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,179
Si Wan, don't Dong Il and Hee Won...

120
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:58,250
- give you a hard time?
- A hard time?

121
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:00,179
Don't they tell you off? They give you a lot of work, right?

122
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,880
I'm okay.

123
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,520
Your show is supposedly a relaxing show.

124
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,159
- Yes.
- I'm going to...

125
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,619
stay calm and quiet the entire time.

126
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,830
I heard Gyeongjubong is famous,

127
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,130
- That's right.
- So I'm bringing some.

128
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,229
The house price increased a lot.

129
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:18,229
Really?

130
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:21,570
You know, there are many antique houses in Gyeongju.

131
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,770
They're like 400 or 700 years old.

132
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,580
700 years? I'll be there soon. Let's talk more when I get there.

133
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,580
You have some more to talk when you talked so much already?

134
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,710
Dong Il, I haven't even begun.

135
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,619
Oh, really? My goodness. That was just a warm up.

136
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:39,719
- Anyway, drive safely.
- You've never had a guest...

137
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:40,820
as energetic as me?

138
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,429
You're the most energetic person in Korea. No one can beat you.

139
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:48,500
You're the most energetic person.

140
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,070
Can we please talk in detail later?

141
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,039
I don't want to hang up.

142
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:56,539
We've already driven past several traffic lights, and you...

143
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:00,169
Na Ra. Don't say a word when you meet us later.

144
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:03,409
That's telling her not to breathe.

145
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:06,880
Instead, we'll treat you like a princess.

146
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:08,849
Really? You?

147
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:11,320
We'll serve you food and such.

148
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,549
We'll act cute in front of you too.

149
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,460
- Will you feed me too?
- Of course we will.

150
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:20,799
I love noodles. Can you make me noodles?

151
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,659
- Yes, of course.
- Noodles? Yes, we can.

152
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:25,400
- You can?
- Of course.

153
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,770
Perfect. I'll look forward to it.

154
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,809
I'll make sure you can relax and rest with us.

155
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:33,010
Okay, see you later.

156
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,809
- All right.
- I'll see you later.

157
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:35,809
Bye.

158
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,650
She's always upbeat.

159
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:41,849
I can tell that she's very cheerful from the phone call.

160
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,190
Wait, Na Ra said she likes noodles.

161
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,960
- What can we make then?
- Shall we make jjolmyeon?

162
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,760
I want to have jjolmyeon too.

163
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,330
- Jjolmyeon?
- Jjolmyeon?

164
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,489
My mouth is watering already.

165
00:07:53,489 --> 00:07:55,500
The tteokbokki we had last time was good too.

166
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,699
- It was...
- Don't talk about that.

167
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,740
You made me hate tteokbokki.

168
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,370
I had no idea that we would...

169
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:07,140
fight over tteokbokki at our age.

170
00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:09,439
Seriously, it wasn't even a big deal.

171
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,079
No, it was good.

172
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:13,480
(He's determined to cook well today.)

173
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,049
Do we have noodles?

174
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:17,720
Is the base seasoning gochujang?

175
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,589
Oh, right. You put in sesame oil, sesame seeds,

176
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,059
and vinegar? We add vinegar too, right?

177
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,829
Why did I think we'd need vinegar?

178
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:26,059
(To keep the promise of treating his guest well, )

179
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:28,959
(Hee Won cooks in a long while.)

180
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,299
(It's hard to pretend to be bad at cooking.)

181
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,770
(Will Hee Won succeed in making a delicious noodle dish?)

182
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,140
(Driving past the downtown of Gyeongju, )

183
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,339
(the House on Wheels is heading to the outskirts.)

184
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,780
(Where is the House on Wheels headed to?)

185
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,319
(An old village slowly appears.)

186
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:52,350
Is this the place?

187
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,120
(An old village slowly appears.)

188
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,289
This must be the village. Right?

189
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:01,199
- We must be here.
- We're here.

190
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,329
Yes, we are.

191
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:05,169
- Wow, this village is interesting.
- It's fascinating.

192
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,900
- These are all houses?
- Yes, they are.

193
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,140
The village is fascinating. They're on different levels.

194
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,870
Thatched-roofed houses are here and tile-roofed houses on that side.

195
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,140
Doesn't it feel like we should put roof tiles?

196
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:17,949
(The Tile-roofed House on Wheels?)

197
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,650
Shall we put some tiles too?

198
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,480
(The tranquil scenery of the village makes them want to put tiles too.)

199
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:28,189
(The House on Wheels...)

200
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:31,089
(heads to the spot on the highest level.)

201
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:34,860
(Going up)

202
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:37,429
(Impressed)

203
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:44,069
(The scenery makes their jaws drop.)

204
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:50,980
(They drove along with the scenery to today's front yard.)

205
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,679
(Today's front yard, )

206
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:59,449
(Gyeongju Yangdong Folk Village's back hill)

207
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,260
(The thatched-roofed houses are in harmony...)

208
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,760
(with tile-roofed houses.)

209
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:07,860
(In this village, nature's beauty fills the windows.)

210
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,299
(It's a tranquil and traditional village.)

211
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,439
(The descendants who carry on the traditional culture...)

212
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:15,799
(actually live in the village.)

213
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,280
(A village where tradition is alive and well)

214
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:28,780
(You can see the scenery at a glance.)

215
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:38,289
(We're living in the back hill of Yangdong Folk Village today.)

216
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:40,530
My goodness, it's great.

217
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,230
(Safely filmed with permission from the owner and the local government.)

218
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,400
It's great indeed.

219
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,270
This place best befits the word "tranquil".

220
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,470
The house is like a time machine...

221
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,970
that has brought us into the past.

222
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,110
It's like we're the only ones who enjoy modern civilization.

223
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,809
Like we're dropped in a village of the past.

224
00:10:58,809 --> 00:10:59,850
(A place you can look down the old and friendly village)

225
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,679
- We can see it all from here.
- I know.

226
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,089
Would you like a cup of tea?

227
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,919
Let's have coffee!

228
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,360
(It's time for morning coffee while enjoying the front yard view.)

229
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:11,230
(I'll make delicious coffee.)

230
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:14,860
Dong Il, I'd like to bring a mat and have a picnic in a place like this.

231
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,959
That'll be good.

232
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:19,169
It reminds me of doing it when I was young.

233
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:21,339
I know.

234
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,039
When I was a kid, I used to fly it like this.

235
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,939
- To the sky?
- There's the thing.

236
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,439
- You fly it.
- Like a pinwheel?

237
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:29,610
Right.

238
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,150
(Bright)

239
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:34,079
Like this.

240
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,780
(Look at his face.)

241
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,789
It would go up high.

242
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,390
- You've done it, right?
- I just did it this way.

243
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,459
Not this way, like you.

244
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:48,600
Your face is no joke too.

245
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:50,100
It's not just me.

246
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,699
(They are cute.)

247
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,100
Okay.

248
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,240
(Si Wan prepares to brew coffee in the meantime.)

249
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,409
Let's grind it first, Si Wan. When they arrive,

250
00:11:57,409 --> 00:12:00,039
we'll brew it right away and serve it hot.

251
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,240
- I see, that way?
- Okay.

252
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,980
- Then I should grind it now.
- Yes, grind it.

253
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,179
I'll grind it.

254
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:05,980
- We'll grind it.
- Yes, I'll grind it.

255
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,220
- I can grind it like this.
- Grind it.

256
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,919
- I've ground it before.
- Yes.

257
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:16,020
I should pour a little amount.

258
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,059
(A relaxed manner of an experienced man)

259
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:19,159
(How cute!)

260
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,530
Goodness, you're awesome.

261
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,260
(I can do this for Na Ra.)

262
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Na Ra, when are you coming?

263
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:30,470
It's taking forever, Na Ra.

264
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,539
(They wait for Na Ra while grinding coffee.)

265
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,679
Gosh, it looks nice. It's a thatched-roof house.

266
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:38,980
Who will run toward me first?

267
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:41,919
I bet Si Wan will run toward me first.

268
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,780
(I bet Si Wan will run toward me.)

269
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,520
He'd say, "My gosh, Na Ra, what are these?"

270
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:47,559
Si Wan will come and greet me.

271
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,520
(Today's guest can't stop talking on her way.)

272
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:54,630
- You're tired, aren't you?
- No, I'm okay.

273
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,329
- There's Na Ra!
- Na Ra!

274
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:58,329
No, I'm okay.

275
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,000
(He spotted Na Ra.)

276
00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:03,770
I'm nervous.

277
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,569
(Glancing over)

278
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:09,980
- Did they see me?
- Honey, come quickly!

279
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,449
(Laughing)

280
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,780
- Dong Il!
- Welcome!

281
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,620
(It's Na Ra.)

282
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,990
(She arrives high-spiritedly.)

283
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,120
Dong Il!

284
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,360
- Hello.
- Thanks. How have you been?

285
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,020
- Hello.
- My goodness.

286
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,860
- Honey, long time no see.
- He called me honey.

287
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,030
Hi, Hee Won!

288
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,059
- Long time no see.
- It's been a while.

289
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,530
- You've been well, right?
- Yes.

290
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,770
- Nice to meet you.
- Si Wan, hello!

291
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,100
Hello.

292
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,069
(Today's guest full positive energy, Oh Na Ra)

293
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,569
You might be hungry, so we're preparing morning coffee.

294
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,610
Really?

295
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:42,640
How have you been, Hee Won?

296
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,179
Sure, I've been well.

297
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,280
- You've got more gray hair.
- What?

298
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
Why don't you dye your hair?

299
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,679
I've always had it.

300
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,480
- You've always had it?
- I just didn't dye my hair.

301
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:52,520
Why won't you dye your hair?

302
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,360
I will.

303
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,520
(Na Ra cares about Hee Won, and he seems to like the attention.)

304
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:58,360
My gosh, Si Wan! You permed your hair.

305
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,000
(Her attention suddenly moves to Si Wan.)

306
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,059
Yes.

307
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,600
How did you know?

308
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,870
Her first word is, "You permed your hair."

309
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,470
To come to House on Wheels, - Yes.

310
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,010
I've been thinking about you guys more than a boyfriend...

311
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,240
for a week.

312
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,770
- Really?
- Seriously?

313
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,039
I've seen your photos every day.

314
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,679
Did you forget our faces?

315
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:21,579
No, not because I forgot your faces. There's a reason I had to.

316
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,319
For a whole week, gosh!

317
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:24,620
(What is it?)

318
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,919
- Right?
- Yes.

319
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,819
You're saying that you've had a hard time watching our faces.

320
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,419
No, I liked it. I enjoyed it, - Really?

321
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:30,689
but do you know what the funniest part was?

322
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,860
I was looking at your faces,

323
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,159
and then when I looked Si Wan, he refreshed my eyes.

324
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,900
(Scratching)

325
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,799
It refreshed my eyes right away.

326
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:45,770
You're abandoning your favorite friend and ex-husband.

327
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,039
We can't beat youth.

328
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,079
My gosh.

329
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,079
Si Wan.

330
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:53,750
Since you're the handsome guy, introduce the house to her.

331
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,179
- I love it.
- Shall I? You want to look around?

332
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,650
- Hey, Na Ra, aren't you cold?
- Hold on.

333
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:00,120
- Your shoes.
- Na Ra, that's a room.

334
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,360
Should I take off my shoes?

335
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,990
(He steps into the house with her shoes on.)

336
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,230
- Should I take off my shoes?
- Yes.

337
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,929
- This is not outside.
- This is our house.

338
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:08,100
- It's our house.
- Is it a real house?

339
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,299
What should I wear on my feet?

340
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,400
You're not abroad.

341
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:14,740
- I'll explain it to you one by one.
- Okay.

342
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,439
- This is the second floor.
- Yes.

343
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:21,640
- It's the perfect space for a nap.
- I guess it is.

344
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,339
- My gosh, that's so adorable.
- Yes.

345
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,610
- I once took a nap...
- Yes.

346
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,150
- when it was snowing.
- Yes.

347
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,419
While I was sleeping, it began to snow.

348
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,490
So the snow piled up right here, and I watched the snow falling.

349
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:37,419
This is the sofa for our guests.

350
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:39,030
A Sofa? Does it turn into a bed?

351
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,260
This sofa can turn into a bed.

352
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:41,630
It's also soft.

353
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:43,400
- Is it?
- You can sleep here as well.

354
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:45,730
It really is soft.

355
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,799
Gosh, it feels good. So this is a living room.

356
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,100
- Yes, this is a living room.
- Right.

357
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,370
I want to own a place like this.

358
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,579
Hey, Na Ra praises in a nice way...

359
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,079
for things she's slightly fond of.

360
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,549
(That is true.)

361
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:01,679
How can I sleep here?

362
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,880
Here? When you go up,

363
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,120
- it's more spacious than you think.
- My goodness.

364
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,720
Like this? My goodness.

365
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,020
- Like this?
- Yes.

366
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,730
There's a window too.

367
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,429
- Yes, here it is.
- Right.

368
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:14,429
(There's a window here too.)

369
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,400
My gosh, it's so cozy and nice.

370
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,630
Like that.

371
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,770
(The house is full of amazement and beauty in the eyes of Na Ra.)

372
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,400
I love this spot.

373
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:24,299
I'll go down. How can I go down from here?

374
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:27,110
- Hold on. You should turn around.
- Yes.

375
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,410
- Turn around?
- Turn around.

376
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,280
- Turn around.
- Yes, turn around...

377
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,849
- and put your foot here. Right one.
- How can I?

378
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,149
- How?
- You need a skill to get down.

379
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,690
- Like this?
- No, not left foot.

380
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,950
- Stick out right foot.
- Right foot? How?

381
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:42,660
How?

382
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,220
- You should turn around completely.
- I see.

383
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,629
- Turn around. Yes.
- Completely?

384
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,260
(Like this?)

385
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:49,329
- Turn around completely. Your foot.
- Backwards like this?

386
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:51,299
Trust me and get your foot down.

387
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:52,629
- Where is it?
- Here.

388
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,470
Then give your foot to me.

389
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,069
- How can I give you my foot?
- Give it to me.

390
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:57,599
(How can I give you this foot?)

391
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,010
No, it won't work like that. Hold on a second.

392
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:01,139
(There's endless laughter inside the house.)

393
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,940
No, not like that.

394
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,119
Didn't she say she first met Si Wan today?

395
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,319
I know. She met him for the first time.

396
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,589
- We've done our best to her.
- Yes.

397
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,149
It feels like we're the ones whom she first met.

398
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,720
(They are close, yet so far.)

399
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,829
Let's give it to Na Ra first.

400
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,389
No, have a cup first, Dong Il.

401
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:22,200
No, give one to Na Ra first.

402
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,460
(They take care of Na Ra first.)

403
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,700
Hey, you.

404
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,299
- Can you hear us?
- I can hear you.

405
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,970
- Do you like it strong?
- Honestly, I can't hear you well.

406
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,369
How do you like it, strong or weak?

407
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:33,240
- I'll have it weak. Yes.
- Weak.

408
00:17:33,569 --> 00:17:35,510
- Give this to Na Ra.
- This one?

409
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,579
- This is for you.
- Is this mine?

410
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:38,780
- That's the weak one.
- Okay.

411
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,119
- Na Ra, here's your coffee.
- Yes.

412
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,420
(Admiring)

413
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,750
And here.

414
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,420
When I drink coffee here,

415
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:48,020
it feels like my home.

416
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,389
(Chuckling)

417
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:51,629
Have a seat here.

418
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,660
Dong Il.

419
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,160
Si Wan was sitting here like this.

420
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,700
- It was picturesque. My gosh.
- No way.

421
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,230
Seriously.

422
00:17:58,569 --> 00:18:00,030
Go. Go back home.

423
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,069
(Go back home!)

424
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:05,639
- This vibe. I like this vibe.
- Of course.

425
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:06,970
How do I look?

426
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:09,440
Don't I suit this place?

427
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,980
Yes, you do.

428
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:13,950
Are you taking a photo of her?

429
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,950
(Hee Won is going to take a photo of Na Ra.)

430
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,020
- Then I'll hold my coffee.
- You should hold your coffee.

431
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,889
I should take it from a distance.

432
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,950
- This looks perfect.
- Okay.

433
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:23,460
Gosh, you pose like a model.

434
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,359
(Sitting on the window)

435
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,099
(She poses stylishly.)

436
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,170
(Exclaiming)

437
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,399
(Bursts into laughter)

438
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,470
(She can't hide her excitement.)

439
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,940
- Si Wan, you too.
- Go inside.

440
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:44,280
Si Wan, take off your rubber gloves.

441
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:45,349
Oh, right.

442
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,250
(Oh, right!)

443
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,250
When did you wear those?

444
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,149
- Were you wearing it? I didn't see.
- I didn't know.

445
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:53,349
Here you go.

446
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,160
- Gosh.
- Where should I look?

447
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,859
- Anywhere.
- Look at anywhere.

448
00:18:56,859 --> 00:18:57,960
(Staring)

449
00:18:58,129 --> 00:19:00,289
He's shaking hands. Give it to me.

450
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:01,299
I'll snap you.

451
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,099
I should be in a stable posture.

452
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:07,500
(His face looks stable too.)

453
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,670
Let's talk casually.

454
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,309
- Shall we?
- Yes, we can laugh at each other.

455
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,710
(Perfect chemistry)

456
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,710
Like this.

457
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,710
(This vibe?)

458
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,809
Yes, like that.

459
00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:18,750
(Embarrassing)

460
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:21,450
- Please stop!
- Like this?

461
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:24,020
(Look at Hee Won.)

462
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:25,319
Like this.

463
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:27,190
(He suddenly becomes serious.)

464
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:28,819
- You didn't take it?
- American style.

465
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,520
Delete it.

466
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,530
(Envious)

467
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,559
- Show them.
- Is it good?

468
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,299
- It came out well.
- Show her.

469
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,329
You moved slightly.

470
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:38,030
- It looks like a model house ad.
- Oh, my!

471
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,770
I like this photo. It looks good.

472
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:42,039
This house is beautiful.

473
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,940
It's our advertisement posters.

474
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,510
(House on Wheels for sale. Call us right now.)

475
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:50,910
(Taking a sip of coffee)

476
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:53,280
- Isn't this place so nice?
- Yes.

477
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,720
- It feels like we're in the past.
- I love this place.

478
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,349
I brought Gyeongjubong...

479
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:01,020
- and Gyeongju Bread.
- Okay. Sit first.

480
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,190
- Yes, presents.
- Presents.

481
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,220
Should I give you gifts?

482
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,960
- Should I bring it all? I'll do it.
- Yes, please.

483
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,589
You go first.

484
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,500
(Exclaiming)

485
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,829
Okay, sit. Let's anticipate.

486
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:15,339
- Okay. Let's anticipate.
- Yes, I will.

487
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:17,970
- What's this called?
- It's Gyeongjubong.

488
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,379
They plant Hallabong from Jeju island in Gyeongju...

489
00:20:21,379 --> 00:20:23,579
and grow it in the environment of Gyeongju...

490
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:25,480
- to cultivate this citrus fruit.
- So this is the Gyeongjubong.

491
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,780
It's so tasty.

492
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:28,720
Is this Gyeongju's specialty?

493
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,750
Right.

494
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:31,589
- The fragrance is so strong.
- Right.

495
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:35,260
I've never tried it, but I heard they are so sweet.

496
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:38,160
- Is it sweet? Shall I peel one?
- Yes, shall we peel one?

497
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,660
(Before peeling it, )

498
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,770
(wash it thoroughly.)

499
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,170
(I'll wash it thoroughly.)

500
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,240
(Shake off water.)

501
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:57,440
I should wash the bowl too.

502
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,319
(He washes the bowl to put Gyeongjubong in.)

503
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:03,319
- I'll peel it.
- Okay, peel it.

504
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,379
(How will Gyeongjubong grown in Gyeongju taste like?)

505
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:07,049
It looks so plump.

506
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,720
- I can smell the fragrance already.
- It's so strong.

507
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,789
Really.

508
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,859
I can see the bursting pulp.

509
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,230
(Dong Il takes a bite first.)

510
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,099
Looks so delicious. Looks perfect.

511
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:20,299
- My gosh, it's sour!
- Why? What's the problem?

512
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,000
Is it sour?

513
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:25,440
(Dong Il is highly delighted by its sour taste.)

514
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,010
I heard it's delicious and sweet.

515
00:21:29,109 --> 00:21:31,349
- They said it's sweet.
- My gosh!

516
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:32,910
(After the explosion, he remains quiet.)

517
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:34,980
(Laughing)

518
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,920
Dong Il doesn't like the sour taste.

519
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
(The unexpected sweet and sour taste of vitamin C)

520
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,690
I've never seen a reaction like it.

521
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,589
I almost thought something has exploded.

522
00:21:42,089 --> 00:21:43,889
I thought there was a volcanic eruption.

523
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,230
- I seriously can't eat sour food.
- You can't eat sour food indeed.

524
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,799
- But...
- Right.

525
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,099
- It leaves a sweet aftertaste.
- Right.

526
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:53,730
It's a totally delicious fruit.

527
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,270
It's my style.

528
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,270
Is that so?

529
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,109
You like sour food, don't you?

530
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,539
(He rather enjoys the sour taste.)

531
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,750
It's good.

532
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:08,480
It's delicious.

533
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,780
It's sweet and sour.

534
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,789
- I'm salivating.
- I like this taste.

535
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,819
But it's incredibly sour and incredibly sweet.

536
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:17,460
- It has a sweet aftertaste.
- Yes, it's so sweet.

537
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,160
This is my next gift.

538
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,589
(Did Na Ra prepare another gift?)

539
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,460
- This is for you. Yes.
- Really?

540
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,660
- Yes.
- Ta-da!

541
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,970
- And the middle one is for Hee Won.
- What's that?

542
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,569
- Thank you.
- And the last one...

543
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,639
- is for our cute Si Wan.
- Yes, thank you.

544
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:34,910
(Peeping)

545
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:38,309
I think I've got a good one.

546
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:41,109
Gosh, it's a luxury product for sure.

547
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,649
What's that? What would that be?

548
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,450
Hee Won opened it first. Look at him.

549
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:49,389
(What's Na Ra's gift for him?)

550
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:50,789
- Ta-da!
- Oh, my!

551
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,789
- It's a cutting board.
- That's great.

552
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,329
This is really... What?

553
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,230
- What is it?
- There's my face on it.

554
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,770
(Is there Hee Won's face on the cutting board?)

555
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:03,700
Did you notice your face?

556
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,309
(Hee Won's face is carved on the cutting board.)

557
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,879
(Surprised)

558
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,680
(My face is here too.)

559
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,879
(Si Wan's bright and smiley face is carved on the cutting board.)

560
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:22,020
I think this has a different level from yours.

561
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,220
- I know.
- It's extra-large.

562
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:27,230
(The biggest)

563
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,399
(Staring)

564
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:31,329
Look at yours and close your mouth.

565
00:23:31,329 --> 00:23:33,829
Hee Won, it's not more expensive since it's bigger. It's the same.

566
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,770
No, I know about woods. There’s a price difference.

567
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,000
The bigger ones cost more.

568
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,970
- Look, it feels different.
- Right.

569
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,940
- Goodness.
- But it's awesome.

570
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,349
Mine is different from yours. Wait.

571
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:47,780
A mask? Is that a mask?

572
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,349
He said, "A mask?"

573
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:51,020
Why is my mouth so big?

574
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:52,349
(It's not a mask. Dong Il's mouth is especially big.)

575
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:53,649
- Dong Il always wears...
- Gosh, this is...

576
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:55,660
- a huge smile.
- I see.

577
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,720
- Wait.
- So it wasn't a mask.

578
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,589
This is cute, the car.

579
00:23:59,589 --> 00:24:01,730
- This one with wheels?
- Right.

580
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,030
This cutting board...

581
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,329
I cut it out, trimmed it, and sandpapered it.

582
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:07,500
I made it all myself.

583
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,139
I even drew the faces.

584
00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:10,170
You did?

585
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,039
That's why I've seen your faces...

586
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:14,879
- for a week.
- I see.

587
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,180
My goodness.

588
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:19,480
(Thinking about the members who will be delighted, )

589
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,720
(she put a lot of effort into it.)

590
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,990
Gosh, did you make these yourself?

591
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,089
Yes, I really made them all.

592
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:29,859
- Gosh, it's amazing.
- "From Oh Na Ra".

593
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:32,289
Gosh, it's amazing.

594
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,660
(Full of Na Ra's love for members)

595
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,700
- This wood is...
- Yes.

596
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,270
Judging from its weight, I bet it's high-quality wood.

597
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,039
Honestly, yours is 10 dollars more expensive.

598
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,069
I knew it.

599
00:24:46,639 --> 00:24:48,780
(He can't hide his joy.)

600
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,039
(He's cute.)

601
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,750
Goodness, will you change with mine?

602
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,649
I paid extra money for it.

603
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:57,920
- But in fact, this curve...
- Yes.

604
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,220
is hard to sandpaper or trim.

605
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,420
Right, Dong Il, you're precise.

606
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,460
It's curved at the edge. it's hard to sandpaper along the curve.

607
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,960
It's sanding a curved surface.

608
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,799
It's hard to sand a curve.

609
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,129
I think I've sanded it four times.

610
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,270
- I sprinkled water and dried it...
- Again and again.

611
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,369
- repeatedly.
- You should repeat it.

612
00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:17,970
And you should coat it with oil. It's not an easy task.

613
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,809
- With wood.
- It takes so much effort.

614
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,710
(Hang on.)

615
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:23,680
Do you really like them?

616
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,180
Despite my effort, your reactions...

617
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,049
- are a bit disappointing.
- No, this is really great.

618
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:29,480
Honestly, I was reluctant to give it to you guys.

619
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,690
Look at me, I'm putting it on my knees.

620
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:35,520
(Standing up)

621
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:38,059
(I like it so much!)

622
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:40,559
Dance, dance!

623
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:43,859
(He expresses his joy with his entire body.)

624
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,170
- Good. You're good.
- Are you satisfied?

625
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:50,369
(Na Ra is satisfied.)

626
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,670
Well now, let's prepare.

627
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,170
- Really?
- Let's go!

628
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,440
It's finally our first meal.

629
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,379
- Hee Won!
- Yes?

630
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,010
- Here it is.
- Okay.

631
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,819
(He wears the apron seriously than usual.)

632
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:08,589
- Hey, tie these for me.
- Okay.

633
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,829
(Determined)

634
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:16,660
(I, Kim Hee Won...)

635
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,000
(I've been waiting for today.)

636
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,940
(Last summer, he made his first dish ambitiously.)

637
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:29,180
(Soupy fish cake tteokbokki)

638
00:26:33,609 --> 00:26:37,549
(It brought lukewarm reactions.)

639
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:40,920
(Why isn't anybody eating it?)

640
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,690
(His first attempt to cook left nothing but a wound.)

641
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,559
(He returned as a chef in half a year.)

642
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:51,099
(You're in for a real treat today!)

643
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:54,030
He cooks a lot lately.

644
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,299
- Me?
- Yes.

645
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,240
You don't have to cook from now on.

646
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,470
- Really?
- Goodness.

647
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,240
(Expectant)

648
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,639
- This is...
- In my case...

649
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:06,410
All I can make is oil tteokbokki.

650
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,379
I've never had oil tteokbokki.

651
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:09,750
- You haven't?
- No.

652
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,819
I'll make it while I assist Hee Won.

653
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:14,119
(Today's lunch: Hee Won's jjolmyeon, Si Wan's oil tteokbokki)

654
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:15,389
(You guys can do well, right?)

655
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:17,660
Come here. Come.

656
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,789
Actor Oh, come here and sit.

657
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:22,629
Sit here. Yes, sit.

658
00:27:23,129 --> 00:27:25,569
- It's so good.
- It's warm.

659
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,039
I've never imagined Hee Won would cook.

660
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,599
- What?
- Big ones are too big.

661
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:32,639
Hey, which pot should I use for boiling noodles?

662
00:27:32,639 --> 00:27:35,309
For noodles? I think this is good for boiling noodles.

663
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,039
- Can I boil it here?
- I think so.

664
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,149
- This one?
- Not sure. I've never made noodles.

665
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:42,520
- But when you boil noodles...
- Can't I boil noodles here?

666
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,819
Yes, you can.

667
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:46,089
- Right. I'll just use this one.
- Okay.

668
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:48,960
Hey, isn't this the best pot for boiling noodles?

669
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:51,690
- That looks good.
- Right. We should use this.

670
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,960
Now...

671
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:56,299
Are you guys arguing over utensils?

672
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,829
But you usually boil noodles in this kind of pot.

673
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,670
- All kinds... It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter at all.

674
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,839
Please tell me it does matter.

675
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:07,539
Right. That pot boils water faster,

676
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:08,910
so it's good for boiling noodles.

677
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:12,480
But that would be the last step. Make the sauce first.

678
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,049
(Si Wan finds a bowl for him.)

679
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:16,619
- Dong Il, will this be enough?
- Yes.

680
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:19,490
Yes, that will be enough for four servings.

681
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:22,119
- Good.
- How much will you boil?

682
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:24,059
- 4 servings.
- You're going to make 4 servings?

683
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:25,160
Yes.

684
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:27,359
(Reading faces)

685
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:29,559
- Let him do it.
- Should I?

686
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:32,930
(It keeps bothering her.)

687
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,039
It's also my first time to watch them like this.

688
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:39,210
I'm just watching how they'll do.

689
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:41,240
- Can I just sit and wait, Hee Won?
- Of course.

690
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,210
- Sure thing.
- Guests never move.

691
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,039
That's our rule.

692
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,710
It's not. I've seen it.

693
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,049
What? No.

694
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,879
I've seen them doing lots of stuff.

695
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:53,490
That's because they felt sorry for doing nothing.

696
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,889
- I see.
- I don't let them work.

697
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,619
We should chop up the vegetables first.

698
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,190
Lettuce.

699
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,899
(His first step is prepping vegetables.)

700
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,030
(He takes out lettuce seriously.)

701
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,129
I'll do it. Take some rest.

702
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,200
- Si Wan, sit and take a rest.
- Yes.

703
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,910
(He's still standing by his side as if he can't trust him.)

704
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,609
The more lettuce, the better.

705
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:19,450
(He pulls out the knife...)

706
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,950
(and chops up the lettuce without hesitation.)

707
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,220
(Glancing)

708
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,049
But Hee Won, did you wash the lettuce?

709
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:29,760
- He didn't wash it.
- What?

710
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:32,359
I was hoping you would not notice.

711
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:35,129
What's the point of washing it if you've chopped it all.

712
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:37,799
Why? I'm washing it anyway.

713
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,599
- Right. You're right.
- Right.

714
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,329
- You just need to wash it.
- Right.

715
00:29:41,329 --> 00:29:43,670
(Don't get flustered.)

716
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:45,710
(Rinsing with water)

717
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:49,809
(Can't tell for sure if he's rinsing it sloppily or not.)

718
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:52,750
(I can't take my eyes off of him.)

719
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,579
This is why our guests do chores. Not because we tell them to,

720
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:57,649
but because they feel frustrated.

721
00:29:57,649 --> 00:29:59,849
We never tell them to do it.

722
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,420
They volunteer to do it.

723
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,420
(Meanwhile, Si Wan takes scallions out of the fridge.)

724
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,930
(I'll wait in line.)

725
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:09,460
Look at him. He's washing lettuce,

726
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,260
and another person is waiting in line holding scallions.

727
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:13,430
- They're in perfect harmony.
- Aren't they?

728
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,430
(An organized kitchen system in its own way)

729
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:16,240
Usually, at this moment,

730
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,839
he would say, "Si Wan, hand me scallions, I'll wash it."

731
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:21,139
He just washes his lettuce only.

732
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,780
Si Wan, pass me that. I will wash it.

733
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,680
(He has good hearing.)

734
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:30,750
I will wash the scallions.

735
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,750
(He is washing scallions.)

736
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,690
(Buzzing)

737
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,990
(What's the sound?)

738
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,930
What is it? What's this buzzing sound?

739
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,230
(The motor is especially loud today.)

740
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,069
(Buzzing)

741
00:30:50,869 --> 00:30:55,680
Dong Il, isn't it much louder today?

742
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,680
Now even the machine is loud along with the guest.

743
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:00,980
The machine must be copying our guest.

744
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,950
That's what I think. When Jung Se was here, it was quiet.

745
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,619
Since Na Ra is here, it became an Oh Na Ra motor.

746
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,990
(Buzzing Oh Na Ra)

747
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:13,389
It's time to move again.

748
00:31:13,889 --> 00:31:14,960
Another moving.

749
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,099
There's not a single day without an issue here.

750
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:19,230
- Dong Il, isn't it funny, though?
- What is?

751
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:22,369
Always something different gets broken.

752
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:25,170
Whenever a guest comes here, a different thing gets broken.

753
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,569
- For real?
- Yes.

754
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:28,740
- So, that's because of me?
- Always something gets broken.

755
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,740
(Is it really because of me?)

756
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:33,010
(Hee Won is washing with Oh Na Ra as a background.)

757
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:36,379
(He's serious.)

758
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,649
Should I wash the vegetables?

759
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:40,819
No. It's okay.

760
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,589
(Thumping)

761
00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:47,129
- There seems to be chaos.
- It must be.

762
00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:49,700
Now you know why guests volunteer to work here.

763
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,700
Yes, I do.

764
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:54,599
(He is cutting scallions.)

765
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,399
Be careful.

766
00:31:57,569 --> 00:31:59,270
How do I cut scallions small?

767
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:04,210
(Let's cut it small.)

768
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,410
(It's somewhat intriguing.)

769
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,280
Look at his hands shivering.

770
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:13,349
Aren't they shivering?

771
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,789
It's hard to pretend as if I'm not good at this.

772
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,920
(Laughing)

773
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,430
It's so hard to hide my skills.

774
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:24,099
(I'm just pretending to be clumsy.)

775
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,970
Hee Won, should I cut those?

776
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,470
(Dong Il was doing like this.)

777
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:30,639
Dong Il was doing like this.

778
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:32,139
(Rolling)

779
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,510
They're rolling away.

780
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:36,980
He was doing this.

781
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,910
(Scallions seem well chopped.)

782
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,819
- Look at him. He's good.
- He was doing like this.

783
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:46,089
He is. He must've seen that somewhere.

784
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,490
I saw Dong Il doing this.

785
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,119
Na Ra, are you hungry?

786
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,059
Yes, I am.

787
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:54,059
- Are you?
- Yes.

788
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:55,799
I would have to rush, then.

789
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:56,930
(I will try to be faster.)

790
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,299
You can actually make it pretty.

791
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:01,170
I'm pretending that I'm not good.

792
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:03,869
(He starts to make jjolmyeon sauce.)

793
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,210
What are you putting in the sauce?

794
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:07,510
- The sauce?
- Yes.

795
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,609
Various things.

796
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:11,879
- That's the correct answer.
- That's it.

797
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,450
I know too little to answer that.

798
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,420
Most sauces have various things in them.

799
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,349
Cooking channels always say "various things".

800
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,819
He's so cute.

801
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,690
(The first of the "various" is gochujang.)

802
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:27,760
(Tilting)

803
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,559
Does this seem good?

804
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:34,100
- Good?
- I don't know about jjolmyeon,

805
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:36,169
but it's better to make enough sauce.

806
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,740
We don't have to put it all in.

807
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:41,839
We can add little by little, so it doesn't get salty.

808
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:43,879
How are you going to do the ratio?

809
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,310
- I don't know.
- Is the gochujang the main base?

810
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,780
- Yes.
- Yes, it is.

811
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,120
I think you can add that some more.

812
00:33:51,649 --> 00:33:53,419
They're discussing it.

813
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:57,060
- That looks good.
- Okay.

814
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,260
He takes long since he does his best.

815
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:03,030
So, no one has complained as all were starving while waiting.

816
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,560
- I get it.
- It's his purpose.

817
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,769
(I put gochujang.)

818
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:08,499
(What else should I add?)

819
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,269
(Hesitating)

820
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,970
(Hee Won, you can do it.)

821
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,680
He thinks...

822
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:21,680
(Deep thoughts)

823
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:24,350
Don't we have crushed garlic?

824
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,350
Yes, we do.

825
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,120
- You can add that, then.
- Okay.

826
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,160
Hee Won, you were so natural just now.

827
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,160
(He naturally figured out the next ingredient.)

828
00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:36,530
(Crushed garlic)

829
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:42,470
The refrigerator must be huge.

830
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,140
Na Ra, Come here. Stay seated.

831
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,010
- Hey, get back to your seat.
- Don't hurt his ego.

832
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,640
When he made tteokbokki before,

833
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,910
I said kind of that it was not good.

834
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,180
Then, he was hurt and didn't call me for days.

835
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,089
Dong Il, you may stop talking about cooking...

836
00:34:59,689 --> 00:35:01,589
but start talking about our lives.

837
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:04,120
How much more should I know about our lives?

838
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,689
(He's cooking with his face.)

839
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:13,430
(The scissors are doing good work today as well.)

840
00:35:14,629 --> 00:35:17,399
(He is washing onions.)

841
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,040
Hee Won, do we need just one onion?

842
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,169
I think one is good.

843
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,640
(Si Wan delivers it to the busy chef.)

844
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,410
(Si Wan is very helpful.)

845
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,249
It was delicious.

846
00:35:30,249 --> 00:35:33,819
(Adding chopped scallions and crushed garlic)

847
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,660
(He is trying to mix it.)

848
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,229
(Tilting)

849
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,629
He keeps on tilting his head.

850
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,399
Isn't it hard to get the jjolmyeon sauce texture?

851
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,870
- It is. I'm still working on it.
- Okay.

852
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,399
- I'm adding sesame oil...
- Yes.

853
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:53,939
and vinegar here, - Yes.

854
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,939
so it can be creamy.

855
00:35:55,939 --> 00:35:56,939
And, what else?

856
00:35:58,439 --> 00:36:00,450
(That's...)

857
00:36:01,249 --> 00:36:02,580
Maybe an onion.

858
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,749
(He's suddenly adding an onion.)

859
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:07,419
Onions have moisture in them.

860
00:36:08,649 --> 00:36:09,990
(Yawning)

861
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,560
I get sleepy rather than excited.

862
00:36:12,459 --> 00:36:14,229
- Get some sleep.
- What?

863
00:36:14,229 --> 00:36:16,560
He will finish cooking by the time you wake up.

864
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,330
I like to watch this rare scene.

865
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,169
There won't be another time.

866
00:36:21,169 --> 00:36:23,799
(It indeed is rare cutting.)

867
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,109
(He's working hard...)

868
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,479
(doing the best for his guest.)

869
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,280
(The well-chopped onions...)

870
00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:37,519
(are added into the jjolmyeon sauce.)

871
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,620
(Get creamier.)

872
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:45,089
(He's tilting his head again.)

873
00:36:46,629 --> 00:36:48,260
Regardless of the taste...

874
00:36:48,629 --> 00:36:51,899
(Something seems missing.)

875
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:55,229
Plum syrup...

876
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,899
You should add that! I was going to say it.

877
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,970
And oligosaccharide.

878
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:02,609
(More ingredients are added with help.)

879
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:04,910
You could add a little more plum syrup.

880
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:06,580
Just leave him alone.

881
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:08,950
Otherwise, you don't get to judge his food later.

882
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,319
- I get it.
- Right.

883
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:11,879
He would say that he added because of you.

884
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:13,549
That makes so much sense.

885
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,589
We always blame others.

886
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:18,720
(That's my brother.)

887
00:37:19,629 --> 00:37:23,100
(It's still too thick to be jjolmyeon sauce.)

888
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:25,100
After this...

889
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:29,769
Oh, my goodness.

890
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:31,069
(Smelling)

891
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,640
Hee Won, you can taste a little while making.

892
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:38,510
That's not how I do it.

893
00:37:38,979 --> 00:37:40,950
- He's a genius at cooking.
- A genius cook.

894
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,479
That is very cool.

895
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:44,019
Cool guy.

896
00:37:44,549 --> 00:37:46,620
- I think it's good.
- He doesn't need to taste.

897
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,089
(While the sauce is getting ready, )

898
00:37:48,689 --> 00:37:50,919
(Si Wan is starting tteokbokki.)

899
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:54,330
(After he puts the whole bag of rice cakes, )

900
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,999
(he rinses them with water, )

901
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:03,700
(then pours out the water.)

902
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:08,640
(He even cuts scallions with scissors.)

903
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:12,979
(He cuts them vertically then horizontally.)

904
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:17,450
(It's quick and easy.)

905
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:22,419
(He can cook anything with scissors.)

906
00:38:22,419 --> 00:38:24,819
Yesterday, Si Wan said...

907
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,260
that he really wants to cook his best...

908
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,430
and serve for Oh Na Ra.

909
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,430
- For real?
- Yes.

910
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,930
He said that he really wants to do it.

911
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,269
Really? Thank you so much.

912
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:37,069
Don't expect too much, though.

913
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:41,740
(Scoops of sugar)

914
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:47,850
(The basics of cooking, various things are added.)

915
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,620
(Mixing)

916
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,490
(Once the rice cakes and sauce are mixed, it's all set.)

917
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,330
(His left hand is cleaning while the right hand is cooking.)

918
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,600
You're cleaning as you cook.

919
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,560
- That's how we do it.
- I see.

920
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,669
I really like cleaning on the way.

921
00:39:06,669 --> 00:39:08,430
- Right?
- Yes.

922
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:11,399
We always clean while we cook.

923
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:14,740
(It's time to stir fry the marinated rice cakes.)

924
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,939
(Let's put enough of the oil as it will be oily tteokbokki.)

925
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,319
(He pours marinated tteokbokki into the heated oil.)

926
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:31,390
(Si Wan is doing his best for the guest.)

927
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:34,189
I heard it gets more delicious when you stir fry for long...

928
00:39:34,729 --> 00:39:36,459
on low heat.

929
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:39,370
The sauce has been done.

930
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,100
I need noodles.

931
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:46,339
Where are the jjolmyeon noodles? There they are.

932
00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:48,040
(Finally, the main ingredient, jjolmyeon.)

933
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,609
(Jjolmyeon is in his hands.)

934
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,019
(Let me see.)

935
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,819
(This is jjolmyeon.)

936
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,689
(He's reading it like he reads newspapers.)

937
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,930
(He's even practicing.)

938
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,729
Have you read it all, throughout the package?

939
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,939
I have. What I meant to do was...

940
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:19,209
(Hee Won, what are you doing?)

941
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,640
You're not sure how many servings that is, right?

942
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,209
- Yes, you're right.
- I knew it.

943
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:25,339
- How many servings is this?
- Are they bunched together?

944
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,950
Yes, it looks like this.

945
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:29,950
(Take a look for me Dong Il.)

946
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,049
This...

947
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:33,620
This has the sauce inside already. Why are you making the sauce?

948
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,689
There's sauce inside already!

949
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,859
Big corporations are the best.

950
00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:39,459
There's spicy sauce inside already!

951
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,859
See? The squishy sauce is here.

952
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:43,700
I wanted to personally make it for you.

953
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,100
So you need to rub the noodles...

954
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,069
to separate them all because they're stuck together right now.

955
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,040
If you boil them like this, it'll become like rice cakes.

956
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,410
- Oh, really?
- Hee Won, 1 serving is around 200g.

957
00:40:53,569 --> 00:40:54,669
That sounds right.

958
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:56,740
You need to rub them together to separate them all.

959
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,780
Right. Rub them like this to separate each strand.

960
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,580
Jjolmyeon isn't easy to make.

961
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,749
Hee Won, should I separate them for you?

962
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:04,049
No, don't do it.

963
00:41:04,049 --> 00:41:05,280
(Guests aren't supposed to work.)

964
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:07,490
This is five servings, so...

965
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,720
- You can put all of it in.
- Right? Let's put it all in.

966
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,560
- Hey! Sit down!
- Really?

967
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,430
- I came to look at this.
- Okay, look at the label.

968
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,660
- This is what I want to see.
- "Look at the label."

969
00:41:16,729 --> 00:41:17,959
He said, "Look at the label."

970
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:19,999
You see the square cutting board?

971
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,470
Should I not throw this away?

972
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,499
(They are separating the strands of jjolmyeon.)

973
00:41:22,499 --> 00:41:23,569
Should I not throw this away?

974
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:25,269
(Throwing them in the pot when the water isn't even boiling?)

975
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:26,870
No, no Hee Won!

976
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,109
After separating them, put them in boiling water!

977
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:31,479
- Oh, in boiling water?
- After separating them.

978
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,310
- Yes.
- I see.

979
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,310
(Hee Won's lack of knowledge of cooking amazes Dong Il.)

980
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,549
Put them in when the water's at a boil.

981
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:36,979
Hee Won, the water needs to be boiling.

982
00:41:36,979 --> 00:41:39,080
I thought separating them might take too long.

983
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,490
- So, I was going to boil it later.
- I'll separate them for you.

984
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,519
I'll separate them. Where are the gloves?

985
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,959
- Over there.
- Where are the gloves?

986
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:48,890
(In the end, the guest helps out today as well.)

987
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,229
Turn it on.

988
00:41:50,229 --> 00:41:52,060
I'll clean this...

989
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,200
quickly.

990
00:41:55,499 --> 00:41:58,140
(Na Ra diligently separates the jjolmyeon.)

991
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,709
This cooking thing...

992
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,640
Cooking isn't easy.

993
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,209
Hee Won, it's thundering in my stomach right now...

994
00:42:05,879 --> 00:42:07,350
because I'm hungry.

995
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,580
In the end, she got up.

996
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,379
All we need is for the water to boil.

997
00:42:11,379 --> 00:42:12,819
Yes, we just need to put them in when the water is boiling.

998
00:42:13,189 --> 00:42:15,049
Anyways, that sauce...

999
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:17,260
We need to add vinegar... I forgot to add vinegar!

1000
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,560
Where do we add vinegar?

1001
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,899
- Over there?
- We need to add some to our sauce.

1002
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:27,229
I make these simple dishes...

1003
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,169
often at home.

1004
00:42:29,169 --> 00:42:30,939
(Chewing)

1005
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:33,109
I've never made oil tteokbokki at home before.

1006
00:42:33,169 --> 00:42:34,939
Oil tteokbokki is actually...

1007
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,839
(This isn't the taste Hee Won is looking for.)

1008
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,209
- Si Wan.
- Yes?

1009
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:43,280
Did I add too much vinegar?

1010
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,749
Vinegar? I don't think we should put in too much vinegar.

1011
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,089
Oh, really?

1012
00:42:48,089 --> 00:42:49,490
You need to do it while tasting it.

1013
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:52,089
- It's good.
- Is it good?

1014
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:53,229
I'm not kidding.

1015
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:54,959
It's good.

1016
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,660
(Wow)

1017
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:01,629
(Shaking his head)

1018
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,339
We need to boil the water.

1019
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:07,439
This much water is enough, right?

1020
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:10,379
I think this much will be a bit short.

1021
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,580
- I think this will be a bit tight.
- Oh, really?

1022
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,280
When they boil noodles, they use a lot of water.

1023
00:43:14,549 --> 00:43:15,680
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1024
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:18,780
You listen so well.

1025
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,189
(Hee Won isn't stubborn.)

1026
00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:23,589
This is enough, right?

1027
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:24,990
(Finally prepared the water to boil the jjolmyeon.)

1028
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,030
That's it.

1029
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,859
(The separated jjolmyeon noodles)

1030
00:43:30,229 --> 00:43:32,999
(A heap of noodles)

1031
00:43:33,229 --> 00:43:35,700
- Hee Won, the noodles are ready.
- The noodles are ready.

1032
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,100
The water just needs to boil now.

1033
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,569
Hee Won, where is the sauce you made?

1034
00:43:38,569 --> 00:43:39,740
Over here.

1035
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:41,410
- Here.
- Give it to me.

1036
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:43,109
Oh, wait. Don't touch it.

1037
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:46,149
- Okay.
- This sauce is mine.

1038
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:47,979
And that's all of ours.

1039
00:43:48,549 --> 00:43:49,749
Let me touch it a little bit. Just me.

1040
00:43:49,749 --> 00:43:51,180
- Dong Il, no.
- Just me.

1041
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,350
- No.
- I won't make it obvious.

1042
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:54,390
Help me out a little bit.

1043
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,120
Na Ra.

1044
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,319
Dong Il, what are you doing?

1045
00:43:57,689 --> 00:43:58,720
Don't touch it.

1046
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,390
That's enough.

1047
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,290
That's enough.

1048
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:03,999
(Glancing)

1049
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,030
(Tasting the sauce)

1050
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:09,669
He's smacking his lips.

1051
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,470
- No, no. It's good.
- It's good.

1052
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:12,910
- Is it good?
- It's really good.

1053
00:44:13,169 --> 00:44:14,169
- Really?
- Yes.

1054
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:15,970
I'm not joking.

1055
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,410
I'm eating the pre-made sauce.

1056
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,080
(My goodness.)

1057
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,479
The packaged sauce.

1058
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,519
If the flavor is lacking, you can add some soy sauce.

1059
00:44:25,479 --> 00:44:26,649
(Sigh)

1060
00:44:27,649 --> 00:44:29,290
You're hurting his pride.

1061
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,689
Soy sauce for soup or soy sauce for seasoning?

1062
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,459
Soy sauce for soup or soy sauce for seasoning?

1063
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,760
- Soy sauce for soup is too salty.
- It's salty already.

1064
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,100
Na Ra, slightly taste it with chopsticks.

1065
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,669
The person who's going to eat it should taste it.

1066
00:44:42,669 --> 00:44:43,769
(Na Ra eventually tastes the sauce.)

1067
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:45,700
(Hee Won is nervous.)

1068
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:47,640
- It's not bad.
- Oh, it's so salty!

1069
00:44:48,209 --> 00:44:49,209
- It's salty?
- Yes.

1070
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:51,780
If you mix it with the noodles and the vegetables, it won't be salty.

1071
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,810
Sugar!

1072
00:44:53,709 --> 00:44:55,709
- You're telling me to add sugar?
- You need to add sugar.

1073
00:44:55,709 --> 00:44:56,879
If you add sugar,

1074
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,120
it not only gets sweeter, but it heightens the flavor as well.

1075
00:45:00,649 --> 00:45:02,189
Should I add a lot of sugar?

1076
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:03,589
It's jjolmyeon.

1077
00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:04,620
Should I add a lot?

1078
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:06,990
- Done.
- That's too much.

1079
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,129
He's making dalgona now, right?

1080
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,359
I didn't make this anyways, so...

1081
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,330
See?

1082
00:45:12,399 --> 00:45:13,999
- I knew you'd be like this.
- Oh, you got me.

1083
00:45:13,999 --> 00:45:15,769
Just come over here.

1084
00:45:15,899 --> 00:45:17,740
He's going to say he didn't make it anyways.

1085
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:18,999
I'll just say one more thing.

1086
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:20,140
Add vinegar.

1087
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,269
- Vinegar?
- Yes.

1088
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:23,140
Anyways, I didn't make this, so whatever.

1089
00:45:23,979 --> 00:45:26,580
(Let's see... Vinegar...)

1090
00:45:26,749 --> 00:45:28,580
(Communicating with the vinegar)

1091
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,720
(Here)

1092
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:35,290
Taste it as you put it in.

1093
00:45:35,689 --> 00:45:38,220
(Carefully putting it in)

1094
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,629
It'll taste good now.

1095
00:45:40,689 --> 00:45:41,760
It's better now.

1096
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,560
It looks a lot more like jjolmyeon than before.

1097
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:47,970
Dong Il, I was going to make it like this from the start.

1098
00:45:48,799 --> 00:45:49,870
It's all done now.

1099
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,769
Wow, this is so interesting.

1100
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:54,769
- This is so interesting.
- You're doing well.

1101
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,839
Now that these two are doing better, it's much more comfortable for me.

1102
00:45:58,709 --> 00:45:59,810
The water's boiling!

1103
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,049
Put in the noodles.

1104
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,549
- Hee Won, you got this.
- You told me to put this all in.

1105
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,580
Put them in.

1106
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,260
(Adding the jjolmyeon into the water after an hour into cooking.)

1107
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,459
Will they all go in?

1108
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:13,990
- Generously.
- Yes, let's put them all in.

1109
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,189
Generously.

1110
00:46:17,129 --> 00:46:18,260
It looks good!

1111
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,930
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Yes.

1112
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:22,499
Throwing them in.

1113
00:46:22,499 --> 00:46:23,870
(Si Wan took out sparkling water.)

1114
00:46:23,939 --> 00:46:24,939
Do you want some sparkling water?

1115
00:46:24,939 --> 00:46:26,040
You were about to add sparkling water just now, right?

1116
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,439
- What?
- Sparkling water.

1117
00:46:27,439 --> 00:46:29,109
- Into the sauce.
- Where?

1118
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,240
- Sparkling water into the sauce.
- Really?

1119
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,310
Didn't you take it out to do that?

1120
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:33,350
I was just going to drink it.

1121
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:35,209
People usually put in Sprite.

1122
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,319
- To make it sweet.
- Drink it, and add some in.

1123
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,990
Hee Won, what do you think about adding sparkling water?

1124
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,919
I was already planning to add it in.

1125
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:45,589
(The jjolmyeon chef listens to advice quite well.)

1126
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:47,530
Street food vendors actually...

1127
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,089
- added Sprite into it.
- Yes, that's right.

1128
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:50,129
(Adding the sparkling water at the end)

1129
00:46:50,959 --> 00:46:51,959
(Watery)

1130
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:53,069
That's good.

1131
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:56,069
I think it's ruined because of adding this.

1132
00:46:56,399 --> 00:46:58,569
Since it's jjolmyeon, the sauce needs to be a bit watery.

1133
00:47:00,209 --> 00:47:03,640
(Risking everything in the sauce.)

1134
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,049
(Meanwhile, the jjolmyeon noodles are boiling.)

1135
00:47:09,549 --> 00:47:11,280
How long are you going to boil the noodles?

1136
00:47:11,419 --> 00:47:12,450
Oh, that's right.

1137
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,019
That's right. I think it might be overcooked.

1138
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:15,419
Let's see.

1139
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,519
- It's all done.
- I think it's overcooked.

1140
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:19,760
- It's all done, right?
- It's overcooked.

1141
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,990
Turn it off.

1142
00:47:21,189 --> 00:47:22,729
Wait, not that.

1143
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:24,560
- What?
- Oh, come on.

1144
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:25,999
(Eventually, Dong Il has to step in.)

1145
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:26,999
Bring that closer.

1146
00:47:27,899 --> 00:47:29,100
Over here.

1147
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:33,140
(Removing the water of the cooked noodles with a strainer.)

1148
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,169
Shake it off, and pour it in here.

1149
00:47:35,209 --> 00:47:38,140
(He's shaking so hard, his cheeks are shaking as well.)

1150
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,180
- Put it in?
- Put it in.

1151
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,180
Just pour it in.

1152
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,419
(Putting it into ice water)

1153
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:47,850
Take out the noodles and put them here.

1154
00:47:49,049 --> 00:47:50,689
If we didn't take them out, they would've been completely overcooked.

1155
00:47:50,689 --> 00:47:53,430
- Really?
- It's because of sparkling water.

1156
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:55,089
(He always blames others.)

1157
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,229
You need to squeeze it tightly.

1158
00:47:58,229 --> 00:48:00,370
- Should I squeeze it all out?
- Squeeze it, and put it in there.

1159
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:03,700
(If Sung Chef shakes off the excess moisture with his skills...)

1160
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,740
Okay! Now mix them.

1161
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,010
Okay!

1162
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,680
- Finally!
- Wow, finally!

1163
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,540
- It looks so good!
- We're finally mixing them.

1164
00:48:13,149 --> 00:48:16,049
(Scrubbing it out)

1165
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:19,120
(Let's really start mixing now.)

1166
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:24,620
(Hee Won's jjolmyeon is being mixed with his hands to be delicious.)

1167
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:28,330
(Mixing)

1168
00:48:29,799 --> 00:48:33,530
(Stretching them out so that the sauce would spread evenly)

1169
00:48:34,769 --> 00:48:38,870
(Doing his best in such an uncomfortable position)

1170
00:48:39,439 --> 00:48:41,370
(Curious)

1171
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:44,979
Oh, this restaurant serves its jjolmyeon all mixed together!

1172
00:48:45,379 --> 00:48:46,910
Oh, do they usually serve it separately?

1173
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:48,479
Don't they usually mix with the vegetables as well?

1174
00:48:48,479 --> 00:48:50,749
- Oh, that's right.
- That's okay.

1175
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,680
Bring me the vegetables.

1176
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,890
Let's put them in.

1177
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:55,450
Wait, I think it'll overflow.

1178
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:57,189
Let's not put them all in.

1179
00:48:57,189 --> 00:48:59,359
- As you put them in.
- I'll put some in, and...

1180
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,160
That's enough. Leave it there.

1181
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:03,260
Then I'll mix like this.

1182
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,799
(Hee Won's doing a good job.)

1183
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,839
- I'll do this and add them again.
- Add the vegetables again?

1184
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:10,839
(Adds a lot of vegetables because it's better with more)

1185
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:12,499
Adding them like this. That's good.

1186
00:49:12,499 --> 00:49:13,740
After adding them like this...

1187
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,740
(A heap of vegetables)

1188
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:16,609
- It looks good.
- It really looks good.

1189
00:49:16,979 --> 00:49:18,580
It would taste really good with meat.

1190
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,709
That's right.

1191
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,379
(You want to eat meat?)

1192
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,450
(Then I need to deliver.)

1193
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:27,049
Wow, this wind...

1194
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:31,490
(Dong Il prepares the meat outside right away.)

1195
00:49:34,229 --> 00:49:36,359
(Let's see...)

1196
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:38,830
(A pack of meat)

1197
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:41,399
(Two packs of meat)

1198
00:49:41,999 --> 00:49:43,999
(Safely filmed with permission from the owner and the local government.)

1199
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:48,740
(The guests get to eat whatever they want.)

1200
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:50,939
Do it like this.

1201
00:49:50,939 --> 00:49:56,280
(The jjolmyeon sincerely made by Hee Won is now complete.)

1202
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,589
- It looks good!
- Then I'm going to add sesame too.

1203
00:50:02,649 --> 00:50:05,859
(The oil tteokbokki is completed with sesame seeds.)

1204
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,530
(Become more delicious)

1205
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:13,370
(Today's lunch is finally all done.)

1206
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,240
(A street food party starts at the vintage front yard.)

1207
00:50:17,499 --> 00:50:20,540
(The jjolmyeon chef has more work left to do.)

1208
00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:25,109
(He carefully fills up the bowl with jjolmyeon.)

1209
00:50:26,709 --> 00:50:29,450
I can't believe Hee Won cooked jjolmyeon.

1210
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:32,819
- This is nothing.
- Are you giving us some?

1211
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:33,950
- Homemade food.
- Yes.

1212
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:36,890
(Sweet and sour jjolmyeon Hee Won cooked for the first time)

1213
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:39,560
- Jjolmyeon looks so good!
- Yes, it looks delicious.

1214
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:43,399
(Si Wan's secret weapon, sweet oil tteokbokki)

1215
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:46,399
(They're ready for street food party.)

1216
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,269
It looks so good.

1217
00:50:48,269 --> 00:50:49,700
- Great work, Hee Won.
- Thanks.

1218
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,799
You did great, Hee Won.

1219
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:53,370
- I didn't do much.
- Thank you for your hard work!

1220
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:54,740
Stop that.

1221
00:50:54,939 --> 00:50:57,080
- Great work for now.
- Yes.

1222
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,850
- For now. We should taste it first.
- My goodness.

1223
00:51:02,249 --> 00:51:05,249
(The key to Chef Sung's meat, margarine, makes its appearance.)

1224
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:06,689
I never tried grilling it with margarine.

1225
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,149
- It must taste really good.
- It tastes good.

1226
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:13,129
(He lightly coats the frying pan with savory margarine.)

1227
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:16,600
This smell drives you crazy.

1228
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,060
It makes you salivate.

1229
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,430
(It smells fantastic.)

1230
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,370
The scent of margarine is so strong.

1231
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,470
- I'm going to try this at home.
- Same here.

1232
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:25,740
- It makes you lose your mind.
- Exactly.

1233
00:51:26,569 --> 00:51:29,939
If you can smell it but can't eat it,

1234
00:51:29,939 --> 00:51:32,709
it can reveal your true colors.

1235
00:51:32,709 --> 00:51:35,180
(Brisket and margarine make a perfect pair.)

1236
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:42,189
This is driving me crazy.

1237
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:44,760
What time is it now? What time are we having lunch?

1238
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,160
- Just consider it as dinner.
- What time is it?

1239
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,060
This is pretty decent already!

1240
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:51,200
(The time now is 3pm.)

1241
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:56,330
(In Yangdong Folk Village where time seems to pass slowly, )

1242
00:51:57,399 --> 00:52:01,540
(they have their lunch while enjoying the spring.)

1243
00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:05,709
(How does the street food full of Hee Won and Si Wan's efforts taste?)

1244
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:09,379
I feel so empty.

1245
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,720
You cooked for such a long time and only made one dish.

1246
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:14,990
Of course you'll feel empty.

1247
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:17,390
- Exactly. I feel so empty.
- This is why...

1248
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:21,260
you can't cook without putting in all your effort.

1249
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,930
(New enlightenment)

1250
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:28,269
(Meanwhile, the brisket is cooked just right.)

1251
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:32,240
Get ready, I'll give you one.

1252
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:33,810
We should eat together.

1253
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:35,169
We can't eat this together...

1254
00:52:35,169 --> 00:52:37,180
because it's best to eat as soon as it's grilled.

1255
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:38,479
(You should eat the brisket as soon as it's grilled.)

1256
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,979
- Yes.
- Can I really eat first?

1257
00:52:40,979 --> 00:52:42,609
- Dong Il.
- Try it before it cools down.

1258
00:52:42,609 --> 00:52:43,919
Seriously.

1259
00:52:43,919 --> 00:52:46,019
You can't let the brisket cool down.

1260
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:48,720
(Just the smell alone is already amazing.)

1261
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:50,459
- Eat.
- Okay.

1262
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:52,689
- Can I try?
- Yes, eat first.

1263
00:52:52,689 --> 00:52:54,260
The guest should eat first.

1264
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:57,999
She came all the way here.

1265
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,069
(How is it? Does it taste good?)

1266
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,410
(She's lost for words because it's so good.)

1267
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:08,640
Is it good?

1268
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,680
- It's good, isn't it?
- It's seriously good.

1269
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,979
- Right?
- Yes.

1270
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,979
The smell's driving me crazy.

1271
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:18,979
Gosh, jjolmyeon and brisket!

1272
00:53:19,249 --> 00:53:21,649
- I'll do it.
- It tastes so good!

1273
00:53:21,749 --> 00:53:23,089
It's a success!

1274
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:25,589
This is nothing.

1275
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:27,589
(This is it.)

1276
00:53:27,859 --> 00:53:28,959
(Si Wan is also lost for words and just claps with his chopsticks.)

1277
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:31,299
Really? Come here.

1278
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,799
(The jjolmyeon chef who went through a lot takes his first bite now.)

1279
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:37,600
- Hey, Hee Won!
- Yes?

1280
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,410
Don't just eat jjolmyeon! I'll give you some.

1281
00:53:41,069 --> 00:53:43,580
I just wanted to find out how jjolmyeon tastes like.

1282
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:45,439
You can't eat it alone, come here.

1283
00:53:45,439 --> 00:53:46,709
You can't eat it.

1284
00:53:46,709 --> 00:53:48,510
Why not?

1285
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,019
Hee Won.

1286
00:53:51,149 --> 00:53:52,649
If we do this,

1287
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:55,350
the winner is margarine and brisket in the end!

1288
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:59,290
(Nothing can beat brisket.)

1289
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:04,229
(With the brisket that amplifies the taste of jjolmyeon)

1290
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,229
Gosh, this is so delicious.

1291
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,769
- It's good, right?
- It's good.

1292
00:54:10,299 --> 00:54:12,370
I'm not kidding, this is so good.

1293
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:14,069
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

1294
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,080
That...

1295
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:24,280
(Happily slurping)

1296
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,019
It's seasoned really well.

1297
00:54:30,589 --> 00:54:32,419
It's not me who did it.

1298
00:54:32,419 --> 00:54:34,060
- Yes, Na Ra did everything.
- I did just now.

1299
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:35,390
Her recipe.

1300
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:37,030
Should we just say I did everything?

1301
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,030
Sure.

1302
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:39,859
Should we just say I did everything?

1303
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:41,830
- Since it's cooked successfully.
- Okay.

1304
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:44,169
If it tastes bad, I'll blame it on others.

1305
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,769
But since it's cooked well, I'll say I did everything.

1306
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:49,669
Here, eat it before it cools down.

1307
00:54:49,669 --> 00:54:51,740
(Dong Il takes care of the others first.)

1308
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,609
Eat it as soon as I give it to you.

1309
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:57,649
(Dong Il's busy feeding others that he himself didn't eat at all.)

1310
00:54:57,879 --> 00:55:00,319
- Dong Il, I'll do it now.
- It's okay, I'll do it.

1311
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,089
I'll eat myself. Eat up, Si Wan.

1312
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,189
Eat first.

1313
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,859
(I should at least give him this.)

1314
00:55:09,129 --> 00:55:12,030
(He picks up a piece of tteokbokki.)

1315
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,030
Here.

1316
00:55:14,169 --> 00:55:15,769
You eat first.

1317
00:55:15,769 --> 00:55:16,970
Have this.

1318
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:22,370
(Na Ra follows him and takes a bite of tteokbokki.)

1319
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:24,580
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1320
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,709
- Oil tteokbokki is great.
- Yes.

1321
00:55:26,879 --> 00:55:28,149
Tteokbokki tastes amazing too.

1322
00:55:28,149 --> 00:55:29,450
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1323
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,350
Tteokbokki tastes good. I just tried it.

1324
00:55:31,419 --> 00:55:34,049
(Let me see.)

1325
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,459
You're good!

1326
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,319
Tteokbokki tastes good!

1327
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:41,160
- Is it good?
- Si Wan's good at cooking.

1328
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,660
The seasoning's perfect too.

1329
00:55:43,729 --> 00:55:46,499
I should eat more jjolmyeon.

1330
00:55:46,499 --> 00:55:49,030
- Eat a lot.
- It's no joke!

1331
00:55:50,299 --> 00:55:53,069
- It's good.
- Hee Won, jjolmyeon's good.

1332
00:55:53,069 --> 00:55:56,269
Grilling brisket with margarine was a brilliant move.

1333
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,439
- Exactly.
- Yes.

1334
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,010
I'll really cook this at home.

1335
00:56:00,479 --> 00:56:02,310
I'll cook jjolmyeon at home.

1336
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:05,479
(I'll make sure to cook jjolmyeon too!)

1337
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:06,850
It tastes good.

1338
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:08,749
This jjolmyeon is amazing.

1339
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:11,859
I didn't know I like jjolmyeon.

1340
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:13,890
(How cute)

1341
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:16,660
- You only found out now?
- Yes. I like jjolmyeon.

1342
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,959
(He discovered his preference thanks to Hee Won.)

1343
00:56:20,399 --> 00:56:22,569
(Proud)

1344
00:56:23,169 --> 00:56:25,569
Now you should eat. I'll grill.

1345
00:56:25,569 --> 00:56:27,040
Come here, I'll grill.

1346
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,339
- No, I'll do it.
- No, let me do it.

1347
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,339
Just eat.

1348
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,040
I'll grill.

1349
00:56:34,879 --> 00:56:38,819
(Dong Il finally takes a bite.)

1350
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:42,490
- It's really tasty, right?
- Yes, it's good.

1351
00:56:42,919 --> 00:56:44,589
It's really tasty.

1352
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:47,589
Tteokbokki's cooked really well too.

1353
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,629
This tastes really luxurious.

1354
00:56:54,629 --> 00:56:57,439
This is royal court tteokbokki, right?

1355
00:56:58,299 --> 00:56:59,540
It's luxurious.

1356
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:00,970
Royal court tteokbokki?

1357
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:02,609
Royal court food is luxurious.

1358
00:57:02,609 --> 00:57:04,339
- With soy sauce base.
- Really?

1359
00:57:04,439 --> 00:57:06,979
- And we're in Gyeongju.
- You're right.

1360
00:57:06,979 --> 00:57:09,479
- Royal court, yes.
- It's royal court style.

1361
00:57:09,479 --> 00:57:11,319
That's why I purposely cooked this.

1362
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,390
I'm just simply saying stuff because it tastes good.

1363
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:17,919
But I'm serious.

1364
00:57:18,359 --> 00:57:20,430
It really tastes luxurious.

1365
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:21,760
Gosh, thank you...

1366
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,060
- for your observation.
- It tastes luxurious.

1367
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,370
(He gives one to Hee Won who's grilling brisket.)

1368
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:29,030
(Thank you.)

1369
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,740
Jjolmyeon, tteokbokki,

1370
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,140
(She tries brisket, jjolmyeon, and tteokbokki at once.)

1371
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:35,169
and brisket together.

1372
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,879
(She tastes the combination of three food at once.)

1373
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,280
(Explosion of textures)

1374
00:57:46,649 --> 00:57:48,419
- Take vegetables...
- Yes.

1375
00:57:48,419 --> 00:57:51,089
- and noodles together. Like this?
- Yes.

1376
00:57:51,089 --> 00:57:52,790
- That's right.
- It really tastes good, try it.

1377
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,160
You're eating so well.

1378
00:57:58,830 --> 00:57:59,999
It's good, isn't it?

1379
00:57:59,999 --> 00:58:02,569
They unexpectedly go well together.

1380
00:58:02,569 --> 00:58:04,839
I personally like tteokbokki the most.

1381
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:06,540
- Is it that good?
- Everything tastes good.

1382
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,339
For me, tteokbokki is the best.

1383
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,540
It's easy to just grill brisket with margarine.

1384
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,950
But you need to really cook this.

1385
00:58:14,149 --> 00:58:17,680
Right, I can't choose between this and jjolmyeon.

1386
00:58:18,379 --> 00:58:20,790
I think I was out of my mind for a second.

1387
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:22,919
- Really.
- Goodness.

1388
00:58:23,089 --> 00:58:25,459
I can't choose.

1389
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:27,959
This is perfect.

1390
00:58:28,859 --> 00:58:31,160
It was really salty just now when I only tried the sauce.

1391
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,600
- It was.
- How did it become like this?

1392
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,830
- I added something later.
- What did you add?

1393
00:58:34,899 --> 00:58:36,600
- He added something?
- What did you add?

1394
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,769
- What?
- I see!

1395
00:58:37,769 --> 00:58:40,140
Was adding sparkling water a stroke of genius?

1396
00:58:40,709 --> 00:58:41,910
No.

1397
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:44,680
I can't tell you.

1398
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,180
You're right.

1399
00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:48,609
- It's a business secret.
- That's right.

1400
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:49,780
He can't tell you.

1401
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,580
It's really delicious.

1402
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,280
I'm so happy.

1403
00:58:53,379 --> 00:58:54,519
- Really?
- Yes.

1404
00:58:54,519 --> 00:58:56,120
That's what we wanted.

1405
00:58:57,689 --> 00:59:01,359
(After having their perfect lunch)

1406
00:59:02,359 --> 00:59:05,499
We even have music. LP record.

1407
00:59:05,499 --> 00:59:07,629
Then let's listen to music.

1408
00:59:07,629 --> 00:59:09,269
- Should I play one?
- Yes, let's listen.

1409
00:59:09,269 --> 00:59:11,200
I can wash the dishes gracefully.

1410
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,740
What should I listen to?

1411
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:26,280
(Singing)

1412
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:28,819
(Getting excited)

1413
00:59:29,419 --> 00:59:33,189
(The first verse already makes them dance.)

1414
00:59:40,899 --> 00:59:44,169
(Something's strange.)

1415
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,870
- Didn't it lag?
- It's slowed down.

1416
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:47,169
- Did it slow down?
- I think it's the battery.

1417
00:59:47,169 --> 00:59:48,410
It slowed down.

1418
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,280
(Should I spin it faster?)

1419
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,620
It's correct.

1420
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:59,850
(It sounds funnier when I speed it up.)

1421
00:59:59,979 --> 01:00:01,089
It's correct!

1422
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:04,760
(Is it?)

1423
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,120
It's correct.

1424
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,060
(Listening)

1425
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,359
- It's slowing down.
- Yes, it's slowing down.

1426
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,930
This is what happens when I speed it up.

1427
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:18,669
(Broken)

1428
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:21,810
(I actually like this!)

1429
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:22,870
Dong Il! Suddenly...

1430
01:00:23,209 --> 01:00:24,979
(Burst out laughing)

1431
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,810
(Dancing king)

1432
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,780
(That's the way!)

1433
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:34,419
(Dong Il, I like this beat.)

1434
01:00:36,019 --> 01:00:39,260
Wash the dishes faster! That's it!

1435
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:42,390
(Like this, Na Ra?)

1436
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,299
Here, take this.

1437
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:48,700
(The energy fills up House on Wheels with Na Ra's lead.)

1438
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,640
I'm so excited!

1439
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,470
(Dancing)

1440
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:57,609
(Moonwalk)

1441
01:00:57,609 --> 01:00:58,680
Amazing!

1442
01:01:00,109 --> 01:01:03,310
(Flashy steps)

1443
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,649
(Oh Na Ra is so energetic.)

1444
01:01:04,649 --> 01:01:05,680
This is so fun!

1445
01:01:07,189 --> 01:01:08,189
(Shouting)

1446
01:01:08,189 --> 01:01:09,189
(Shouting)

1447
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:10,720
- This is so fun!
- My gosh.

1448
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,319
I didn't know you'd get this hyped up.

1449
01:01:12,459 --> 01:01:15,260
As expected of Na Ra. She has so many endorphins.

1450
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,459
(Na Ra alone changes the whole house.)

1451
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:19,729
Dong Il, a nice song is playing.

1452
01:01:19,729 --> 01:01:21,799
- This?
- Please increase the volume, DJ.

1453
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,100
(Both the sunlight and the song are good.)

1454
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,169
It's not windy.

1455
01:01:27,569 --> 01:01:29,040
This is so nice.

1456
01:01:30,169 --> 01:01:32,040
Hee Won, thank you for inviting me.

1457
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,749
- Pardon?
- Thanks for inviting me.

1458
01:01:33,749 --> 01:01:35,950
Thank you for coming.

1459
01:01:36,049 --> 01:01:37,879
- My gosh.
- I'm serious.

1460
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:42,720
I'm not joking. Thank you so much for coming all the way here.

1461
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,160
(It's nothing.)

1462
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:47,060
How many hours did it take to come here?

1463
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:51,359
- About 4 and a half hours?
- My goodness.

1464
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:52,959
I took some rests in between, so it's fine.

1465
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,629
I told you I feel sorry.

1466
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,399
- Feeling thankful comes first.
- Exactly.

1467
01:01:57,399 --> 01:01:58,439
And what comes next is feeling sorry.

1468
01:01:58,439 --> 01:02:01,140
Not at all. What's there to be sorry about?

1469
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,439
We all came here together.

1470
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:04,109
- What?
- We came here together!

1471
01:02:04,109 --> 01:02:06,910
Still. You can relax here,

1472
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:09,180
but is it really necessary to come all the way here to rest?

1473
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:12,450
(Laughing)

1474
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:15,890
You can just go to Dream Forest in Seoul.

1475
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:17,959
(That's just how grateful he is.)

1476
01:02:17,959 --> 01:02:20,530
- Dream Forest.
- There're a lot of trees there too.

1477
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:22,189
You didn't have to come all the way here.

1478
01:02:23,129 --> 01:02:26,729
But doesn't it feel really nice here?

1479
01:02:26,729 --> 01:02:29,229
With thatched-roofed houses and all.

1480
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,870
People living here...

1481
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:34,640
won't think it's relaxing, right?

1482
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,510
- Look in front.
- Right?

1483
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:41,649
(But just by turning her head slightly, )

1484
01:02:43,209 --> 01:02:46,850
(she can see picturesque mountains, )

1485
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:52,060
(cozy thatched-roofed houses, and windy countryside roads.)

1486
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:56,260
(Gentle wind...)

1487
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:59,499
(and shyly approaching spring can be seen too.)

1488
01:03:00,499 --> 01:03:04,799
(The picturesque view pours into your heart.)

1489
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,240
(How is this not relaxing?)

1490
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,680
(She wants to see it as close as she can.)

1491
01:03:23,319 --> 01:03:28,089
(She wants to take the view as it is and bring it back home.)

1492
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,030
Even though you came a long way,

1493
01:03:33,799 --> 01:03:36,499
- it's worth coming here, right?
- Yes, it's really nice.

1494
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,299
That's how traveling is.

1495
01:03:38,299 --> 01:03:39,299
You're right.

1496
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:41,209
- Si Wan.
- Yes.

1497
01:03:41,209 --> 01:03:43,510
Once you're done with the dishes, - Yes.

1498
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,209
there's a present waiting for you.

1499
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:49,479
- For me?
- Yes.

1500
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,220
- Hee Won...
- Yes.

1501
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:55,019
Hee Won got you a present.

1502
01:03:55,649 --> 01:03:57,260
Hee Won, you got a present for me?

1503
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:00,459
It's regret and remorse from the previous trip.

1504
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:03,229
Regret... Is this a goodbye present?

1505
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,830
Do you want to say farewell already?

1506
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:09,200
No, but regret. A goodbye present?

1507
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:14,069
Then... Hee Won, come here.

1508
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:17,109
What are you doing?

1509
01:04:17,109 --> 01:04:18,280
- What is it?
- Nothing.

1510
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,910
(Two guy's suspicious exit)

1511
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,049
Don't bring out a surprise cake for me or something.

1512
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,180
No cake?

1513
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,189
No. It's cringy, don't do it.

1514
01:04:29,189 --> 01:04:31,890
I think you should put back the cake.

1515
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:34,290
Si Wan, close your eyes!

1516
01:04:34,859 --> 01:04:36,490
- Move over there!
- Move over there.

1517
01:04:36,859 --> 01:04:37,930
We told him to close his eyes and move.

1518
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:39,030
Over where?

1519
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:40,060
Just stay there.

1520
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,629
(Wandering)

1521
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:43,700
Come this way.

1522
01:04:44,499 --> 01:04:45,540
What's this?

1523
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,470
- Here, sit down.
- Sit here.

1524
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:48,839
That's the armrest.

1525
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:52,010
- It'll poke you.
- There.

1526
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:54,910
Open your eyes on the count of three.

1527
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:57,649
- Okay.
- 3, 2, 1!

1528
01:04:58,049 --> 01:05:00,220
- Here you go!
- My goodness!

1529
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:01,220
For me too?

1530
01:05:01,419 --> 01:05:04,160
(They're drones for Si Wan and Na Ra.)

1531
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,089
- It's for you.
- What is this?

1532
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:09,530
- What's this? A drone!
- A drone.

1533
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:10,660
It's a drone.

1534
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:14,899
(It happened on Pohang trip.)

1535
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:20,769
(Hee Won showed great interest in Si Wan's drone.)

1536
01:05:21,769 --> 01:05:25,479
(In the end, he tries it himself.)

1537
01:05:25,479 --> 01:05:27,609
- It's going up.
- It's going up now.

1538
01:05:27,609 --> 01:05:28,879
(I'm going up.)

1539
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:32,080
It's up!

1540
01:05:33,419 --> 01:05:36,019
(It went up...)

1541
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:38,120
(too high.)

1542
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:41,760
(It flew far away like that.)

1543
01:05:43,229 --> 01:05:48,729
(That's how Hee Won lost Si Wan's drone.)

1544
01:05:49,729 --> 01:05:51,439
It uses USB.

1545
01:05:51,799 --> 01:05:54,769
After losing the drone,

1546
01:05:54,839 --> 01:05:56,740
do you know what I kept thinking of?

1547
01:05:56,839 --> 01:05:58,879
I didn't even give it a name.

1548
01:05:58,939 --> 01:06:02,280
It was gone before I could even name it.

1549
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:03,810
Others would think you made a life-threatening mistake.

1550
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:04,850
Stop holding your hands like that.

1551
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:05,850
It's okay.

1552
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:08,450
(Joking)

1553
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:11,120
- You should give it a name first.
- Yes, name it.

1554
01:06:11,459 --> 01:06:12,519
Then...

1555
01:06:12,519 --> 01:06:13,760
(What should I name it?)

1556
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:16,030
Gwidol? Let's go with Gwidol.

1557
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,600
- Gwidol.
- Gwidol.

1558
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,359
So that it comes back home safely.

1559
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,299
- Gwidol.
- Yes, so you won't lose it.

1560
01:06:21,299 --> 01:06:23,030
- Then is this Gwisoon?
- That's Gwisoon.

1561
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:25,040
- Really? Gwisoon?
- Yes, call their names.

1562
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:26,470
- Gwidol.
- Gwisoon!

1563
01:06:27,269 --> 01:06:29,069
This is my first time playing with something like this.

1564
01:06:29,269 --> 01:06:30,740
I don't know what to do because this...

1565
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:31,879
is the first time getting such a present.

1566
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:37,310
(Twinkling)

1567
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:40,990
But don't think of it as a present yet.

1568
01:06:41,089 --> 01:06:43,149
Then? Do we need to work with this?

1569
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,459
It might disappear soon.

1570
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:47,660
(Speaking from experience)

1571
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,689
Try to move it first.

1572
01:06:49,689 --> 01:06:50,930
Just try flying it.

1573
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:53,600
I don't know what to do. I've never tried something like this before.

1574
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,600
Nobody here knows.

1575
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,299
Just try it.

1576
01:06:56,299 --> 01:06:57,439
How? What?

1577
01:06:57,439 --> 01:06:58,839
- With this.
- This?

1578
01:06:58,839 --> 01:06:59,839
Just keep playing around.

1579
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:02,310
Just play around? Oh my goodness!

1580
01:07:03,439 --> 01:07:06,680
Then hold on, let's leave it first.

1581
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:09,410
Can you press both of them down?

1582
01:07:10,549 --> 01:07:12,549
- Gosh!
- It's working! It's working.

1583
01:07:12,919 --> 01:07:15,749
(Spinning)

1584
01:07:16,149 --> 01:07:18,760
- It's spinning.
- What do I do next?

1585
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,560
- Make it fly.
- How? Like this?

1586
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:23,530
(It's staying still again.)

1587
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:27,229
Why is it not flying? It's all in the handbook.

1588
01:07:27,229 --> 01:07:28,530
It stopped!

1589
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:30,799
(Let me pass by.)

1590
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:33,799
(Gosh!)

1591
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:34,810
(It's flying away again!)

1592
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,109
- My gosh.
- What should I do?

1593
01:07:36,109 --> 01:07:37,979
- It's flying away again!
- What should I do?

1594
01:07:37,979 --> 01:07:39,410
- Na Ra!
- Where are you going?

1595
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:42,109
- Make it come down first!
- Come down!

1596
01:07:42,109 --> 01:07:44,979
- It can't fly too far away again.
- Come here!

1597
01:07:45,219 --> 01:07:47,149
- It's coming!
- That's right!

1598
01:07:47,149 --> 01:07:48,349
- It's here.
- Come here!

1599
01:07:48,349 --> 01:07:50,349
- Okay, I got the hang of it!
- You did it!

1600
01:07:50,349 --> 01:07:51,590
- I got the hang of it!
- Don't fly!

1601
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:53,620
- Try again.
- Don't fly. Good.

1602
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:55,859
- I got it! Okay.
- Okay.

1603
01:07:57,330 --> 01:08:00,030
Na Ra got the hang of it. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1604
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:01,929
What a good girl!

1605
01:08:01,929 --> 01:08:03,599
Look at that, my goodness.

1606
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,040
How can you come to me? I got it!

1607
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,740
(Her excitement explodes.)

1608
01:08:08,309 --> 01:08:09,969
Na Ra, yours is so fast!

1609
01:08:09,969 --> 01:08:12,280
Hold on, can it come back?

1610
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:14,149
It can come back.

1611
01:08:14,149 --> 01:08:15,149
(Amazing!)

1612
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:18,349
- You're so good.
- It can't fly too high.

1613
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,179
Why are you so good at it?

1614
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:21,990
- I don't know, I can just do it.
- Why're you so good?

1615
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:23,389
"I don't know, I can just do it"?

1616
01:08:24,189 --> 01:08:25,559
I found my talent!

1617
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:27,590
- Gosh!
- You're so good at flying a drone.

1618
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:28,830
She's so good.

1619
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:30,729
It's flying so well!

1620
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,830
But how can it come down?

1621
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:34,729
(Their mouths fall open.)

1622
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:36,870
It's coming down!

1623
01:08:37,469 --> 01:08:39,099
It's coming down. Try to land it.

1624
01:08:40,099 --> 01:08:41,910
Na Ra, try to land it on the table!

1625
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:44,009
- I can't do that!
- Here!

1626
01:08:44,009 --> 01:08:45,780
- Don't ask for something difficult!
- No, try it!

1627
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:47,479
Where did it go?

1628
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:52,550
Come here! Not there, here.

1629
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:53,849
That's right!

1630
01:08:53,849 --> 01:08:55,149
(Free spirit)

1631
01:08:55,149 --> 01:08:58,120
No, not there. Come here!

1632
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,259
Come here. The other way!

1633
01:09:00,859 --> 01:09:04,090
- That's right, come here.
- My gosh.

1634
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,030
- That's right.
- Does it have voice recognition?

1635
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:07,870
- No, come here.
- Voice recognition.

1636
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:09,929
- Come here. Gwisoon!
- Voice.

1637
01:09:09,929 --> 01:09:12,370
Not there. No.

1638
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:15,340
- My goodness.
- Na Ra!

1639
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:20,139
(Gwisoon got stuck in a tree!)

1640
01:09:20,639 --> 01:09:23,280
(It feels like he lost his country.)

1641
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:27,519
Can we take it out?

1642
01:09:27,519 --> 01:09:28,819
Once it's stuck, you can't get it back.

1643
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:32,819
(Gwisoon's short yet flashy flight)

1644
01:09:32,819 --> 01:09:34,019
You can take it out.

1645
01:09:34,019 --> 01:09:35,929
- Is it stuck?
- It's stuck!

1646
01:09:35,929 --> 01:09:37,130
- My gosh.
- What to do?

1647
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:39,099
- You were too confident.
- It's stuck.

1648
01:09:39,229 --> 01:09:40,630
That's right, fly.

1649
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:42,530
- That's it! Yes!
- It came out!

1650
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:43,530
You saw that?

1651
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,939
(What is happening?)

1652
01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:51,710
(With unbelievable drone control, Gwisoon escapes by herself!)

1653
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:53,139
- You saw that?
- Who on earth is she?

1654
01:09:53,139 --> 01:09:54,139
(Puzzled)

1655
01:09:54,139 --> 01:09:55,809
You're too fast. That's right.

1656
01:09:55,809 --> 01:09:57,750
- How did you even do it?
- Come down now.

1657
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,420
Try landing it here.

1658
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,250
Where did it go? How did I do it?

1659
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,790
It's flying pretty far away.

1660
01:10:09,389 --> 01:10:13,630
(Gwisoon's flying further and further away.)

1661
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:15,899
It's going too far.

1662
01:10:15,969 --> 01:10:17,469
How can I make it come back?

1663
01:10:17,769 --> 01:10:19,240
See? You can't fly it well either.

1664
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:20,399
- Where is it?
- Over there.

1665
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:21,740
- It's gone.
- It's over there.

1666
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,139
How should I make it come back?

1667
01:10:23,139 --> 01:10:24,910
- You should...
- Gwisoon, come back!

1668
01:10:25,139 --> 01:10:26,939
Make it go up. Do that first.

1669
01:10:26,939 --> 01:10:28,009
Where did it go?

1670
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:30,880
- It's over there. It disappeared.
- On top of the tile-roofed house.

1671
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,479
Did it fall?

1672
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,819
It fell because it went too far.

1673
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:37,090
- Make it fly again.
- Isn't it that one?

1674
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:38,389
- Go closer and make it fly.
- That's not Gwisoon.

1675
01:10:38,389 --> 01:10:41,090
- Whose is that?
- No, that's not Gwisoon.

1676
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:42,859
- That's not ours?
- No, it's not.

1677
01:10:43,359 --> 01:10:44,500
No!

1678
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:49,130
(Is it finally...)

1679
01:10:49,769 --> 01:10:52,439
(my turn?)

1680
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,639
Is it my turn?

1681
01:10:54,639 --> 01:10:56,240
(Gwidol is ready to fly.)

1682
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:01,880
(He's going to show his flying skill as a drone lover.)

1683
01:11:04,179 --> 01:11:06,880
(Gwidol takes off.)

1684
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:08,620
(Look over here.)

1685
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:09,689
Gwisoon!

1686
01:11:09,689 --> 01:11:11,059
Look, Hee Won is flying it.

1687
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,120
(What? What did I do?)

1688
01:11:15,429 --> 01:11:17,429
- Gwidol takes off.
- You're so good!

1689
01:11:17,429 --> 01:11:18,899
(Gwidol's excellent performance starts now.)

1690
01:11:19,929 --> 01:11:21,229
No, don't go into the woods.

1691
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:23,670
- No, no!
- Hey, Hee Won!

1692
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:25,139
- Hey, hey!
- No!

1693
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:26,439
(Hey, Hee Won!)

1694
01:11:26,439 --> 01:11:27,769
- Hey, hey!
- No!

1695
01:11:28,469 --> 01:11:29,939
- Hey, hey!
- No!

1696
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:31,609
My goodness.

1697
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:32,880
(It ended its flight.)

1698
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,380
(My goodness.)

1699
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:39,219
(He's despondent.)

1700
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:41,719
(Gwidol ends its flight within 1 minute.)

1701
01:11:41,719 --> 01:11:43,649
Si Wan, how do we get it out of the tree?

1702
01:11:43,649 --> 01:11:45,259
It can't even fly up.

1703
01:11:45,519 --> 01:11:47,019
Si Wan's got stuck in a tree?

1704
01:11:47,019 --> 01:11:48,189
Yes, it's on top of a tree.

1705
01:11:48,189 --> 01:11:50,830
(Gwisoon fell on the ground, and Gwidol is up in the sky.)

1706
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,899
Somebody pay attention to Si Wan.

1707
01:11:52,899 --> 01:11:54,229
Si Wan.

1708
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:56,370
(Both drones failed to fly as soon as they took off.)

1709
01:11:56,899 --> 01:12:00,000
(All of my gifts are gone.)

1710
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:05,309
(It's even hard to make them fail on purpose.)

1711
01:12:06,809 --> 01:12:08,109
Si Wan, did you get it out?

1712
01:12:08,179 --> 01:12:11,719
No, it's struggling to make its way out.

1713
01:12:11,819 --> 01:12:13,120
It's struggling.

1714
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,689
It's stuck on the edge.

1715
01:12:15,689 --> 01:12:17,019
(Help me.)

1716
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:19,660
- Do you know where Gwisoon is?
- Gwisoon...

1717
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:22,090
- Where did Gwisoon go?
- It fell in the village over there.

1718
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:23,990
Can you see the antenna over there?

1719
01:12:24,359 --> 01:12:27,229
Yours fell in an alley or something.

1720
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:29,729
- Hee Won, let's go find it.
- There?

1721
01:12:29,729 --> 01:12:30,800
- Yes.
- Okay, let's go.

1722
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,500
Let's go. I want to go and find it.

1723
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,939
How do we get there?

1724
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:35,969
We should go around that way.

1725
01:12:35,969 --> 01:12:37,910
- Come with me.
- Okay, we should go that way.

1726
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:39,780
Let's go, Hee Won. We'll be back.

1727
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:41,479
Gwisoon.

1728
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:43,550
I'll be right there.

1729
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,250
(Gwisoon Rescue Team sets off.)

1730
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,759
It's a relief that we didn't lose it when it's dark.

1731
01:12:55,859 --> 01:12:57,800
- I know.
- It's a relief, right?

1732
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:58,859
(She's the positive type.)

1733
01:12:59,929 --> 01:13:02,399
It feels like a living thing. I want to find it fast.

1734
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:04,500
We might not be able to find it.

1735
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,139
No, we have to.

1736
01:13:06,139 --> 01:13:07,599
Otherwise, we'll have to say goodbye when we just met.

1737
01:13:07,969 --> 01:13:09,870
I told you we shouldn't call it a gift too soon.

1738
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:10,910
(Foreteller Hee Won)

1739
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:11,939
We can only call it a gift when we find it.

1740
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:14,649
- We'll find it.
- What?

1741
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:15,809
We'll find it.

1742
01:13:15,809 --> 01:13:16,880
(I'll make sure to find it back.)

1743
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:21,219
Thanks to Gwisoon, I get a tour around the village.

1744
01:13:21,349 --> 01:13:22,349
I know.

1745
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:24,960
Its wings must be caught by the branches.

1746
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:25,990
Right.

1747
01:13:26,219 --> 01:13:28,090
How did it get stuck like that?

1748
01:13:29,729 --> 01:13:31,530
Dong Il, I'm going to try throwing this.

1749
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,660
To the drone.

(Practicing)

1752
01:13:40,439 --> 01:13:42,240
(It got stuck too.)

1753
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:45,040
Why does everything get stuck in a tree?

1754
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,009
It's higher than it looks.

1755
01:13:47,009 --> 01:13:48,550
Throwing a branch wouldn't help.

1756
01:13:49,479 --> 01:13:51,319
I should keep trying.

1757
01:13:51,319 --> 01:13:54,590
I lost it after a minute into its flight.

1758
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:57,319
(Flying)

1759
01:13:57,319 --> 01:13:58,519
It's not that easy.

1760
01:14:01,189 --> 01:14:02,429
(Get set, )

1761
01:14:02,429 --> 01:14:04,030
(go.)

1762
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:05,700
(Exclaiming)

(Dong Il succeeded in hitting it.)

1764
01:14:10,069 --> 01:14:11,740
- Don't you think it'll work?
- I think so.

1765
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:13,170
- It was a hit.
- Give that to me.

1766
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:14,200
That was an effective hit.

1767
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,410
(Dong Il gets competitive.)

1768
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:17,170
- Give it.
- That was an effective hit.

1769

(Stretching)

1770

(I'll make sure to get you out.)

1771
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,750
Throw it calmly just like this.

1772
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:30,050
(No, that's not even close.)

1773
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,160
That was close.

1774
01:14:31,859 --> 01:14:34,389
(He's too immersed in it.)

1775
01:14:34,389 --> 01:14:35,429
Darn it.

1776
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,160
That'd never reach the drone.

1777
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:44,229
(This won't do.)

1778

1780

Si Wan, come here.

1781
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:52,479
Grab the end of it.

1782
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:54,080
(He's very into rescuing Gwidol.)

1783
01:14:54,979 --> 01:14:56,609
We'll try it a couple of times, - Okay.

1784
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:58,519
but let's quit it if it doesn't work.

1785
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:01,019
- Okay.
- We can't do it when it gets dark.

1786
01:15:01,219 --> 01:15:02,550
I guess I can't...

1787
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:04,189
(I guess I'm not meant to have a drone.)

1788
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:06,059
- I hope this works.
- Me too.

1789
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,689
(Determined)

1790
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:12,059
(Go!)

1791
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,500
- It's hooked.
- Hold on.

1792
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:20,069
(He manages to hook the rope on the branches.)

1793

(He's very close to rescuing it.)

1794
01:15:26,109 --> 01:15:29,250
(It's a tense moment.)

1795

1801
01:15:49,429 --> 01:15:51,340
Okay, go and get it.

1802

Wow, Dong Il.

1811

- It's here?
- No, it's not that.

1812

(Actually, Gwisoon is right in front of them.)

1813
01:16:23,899 --> 01:16:25,639
It feels like...

1814
01:16:25,639 --> 01:16:27,069
- It's here?
- I think so.

1815

I can feel it.

1816

(I'm getting the feel of it.)

1817

You look like a dowser.

That's not it. You can feel it moving.

1819

Let me feel it too.

1820
01:16:37,109 --> 01:16:38,319
Hold on.

1821
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:40,880
(I'm getting it.)

1822
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,219
(I'm getting the feel of it.)

1823

(Surprised)

1824
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:47,120
It's here.

- Oh, gosh.
- We found it.

It's not wet.

1830
01:16:57,599 --> 01:17:00,769
- Gwisoon!
- It dropped upside down.

1831
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,240
- That's why it didn't work.
- And we kept trying to fly it.

1832
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:04,370
I know.

1833
01:17:05,009 --> 01:17:06,109
Gwisoon!

1834
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:07,910
Let's go. Hurry.

1835
01:17:08,649 --> 01:17:09,679
Let me touch it.

01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:14,319
(They manage to rescue Gwisoon as well.)

1837
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:17,719
You rescued Gwidol!

1838
01:17:17,719 --> 01:17:18,719
Yes.

1839
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,819
(They return in glory.)

1840
01:17:20,259 --> 01:17:21,259
Gwisoon is back.

1841
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:22,830
We found it.

1842
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,500
- Thank you.
- How do you fly it?

1843
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:28,700
So it's important to give it a name.

1844
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,170
Right? It came back.

1845
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:31,870
Gwidol is back too.

1846
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:33,899
- Let them meet each other.
- "It's nice to see you."

(A dramatic reunion of Gwidol and Gwisoon)

1848
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:37,609
- How did you get it out of a tree?
- What?

1849
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:40,210
- How did you get it out of a tree?
- I blew on it, and it just fell.

1850
01:17:41,009 --> 01:17:42,679
My lungs are incredibly strong.

1851
01:17:42,679 --> 01:17:44,950
We always need to use our heads.

1852
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:46,319
Dong Il...

1853
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:47,550
Did he hit the tree with his head?

1854
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:51,790
- He hit it like this, and...
- He hit it with his head?

1855
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:53,189
The tree fell. It's not there anymore.

1856
01:17:53,859 --> 01:17:56,759
(It's true that Dong Il used his head.)

1857
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,160
Anyway, it's my first time to receive a drone as a gift.

1858
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:02,670
- Use it carefully.
- It was so much fun.

1859
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:04,300
Should I fly it near the Han River? Where should I fly it?

1860
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,340
(Gwisoon and Gwidol, stay with us for as long as you can.)

1861
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:06,800
It's amazing that we found it.

1862
01:18:06,969 --> 01:18:08,109
I know.

1863
01:18:09,509 --> 01:18:12,309
I heard from the residents of the village...

1864
01:18:12,309 --> 01:18:15,380
that there's a small store that sells delicious stuff.

1865
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:17,250
Like snacks.

1866
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:18,420
Is that where you have your fortune read?

1867
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:20,420
Fortune? No.

1868
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:21,620
It's a small store.

1869
01:18:21,889 --> 01:18:22,920
What's that?

1870
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:24,490
It's a small store where all sorts of things are sold.

1871
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:25,859
A small store in a village.

1872
01:18:28,334 --> 01:18:29,643
Are we having ice cream there?

1873
01:18:29,643 --> 01:18:30,943
Okay, let's go to the store then.

1874
01:18:33,044 --> 01:18:35,344
Spring is here already.

1875
01:18:35,344 --> 01:18:38,313
(The flowers are in full bloom as it's spring now, )

1876
01:18:38,313 --> 01:18:41,513
(and the sparrows chirp joyfully.)

1877
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:45,424
It's the store we saw on our way here.

1878
01:18:45,424 --> 01:18:46,924
(The members head out to get groceries for dinner.)

1879
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:50,063
Isn't the village quite odd?

1880
01:18:50,693 --> 01:18:53,664
Thatched-roofed houses and tile-roofed houses co-exist.

1881
01:18:54,334 --> 01:18:56,304
It's very unique, isn't it?

1882
01:18:56,304 --> 01:18:57,363
Right.

1883
01:18:57,433 --> 01:18:59,704
Do all the people of this village live there?

1884
01:19:00,174 --> 01:19:02,874
I'm not sure. I also wanted to see how the houses look like inside.

1885
01:19:03,174 --> 01:19:04,374
(There are tranquil tile-roofed houses as well.)

1886
01:19:04,374 --> 01:19:05,643
I wanted to see...

1887
01:19:07,214 --> 01:19:08,813
if they actually live there.

1888
01:19:09,313 --> 01:19:12,353
The village is so beautiful, every alley of it.

1889
01:19:12,483 --> 01:19:14,683
A bullfrog! Look, there's a bullfrog.

1890
01:19:14,983 --> 01:19:16,023
A bullfrog.

1891
01:19:16,023 --> 01:19:17,424
- Where? A bullfrog?
- Over there.

1892
01:19:17,454 --> 01:19:18,954
- Over there.
- Oh, I see it.

1893
01:19:18,954 --> 01:19:20,393
That's not a bullfrog.

1894
01:19:20,393 --> 01:19:21,823
- Is it a regular frog?
- Is it a toad?

1895
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:23,464
- It's huge.
- My, it's so gross.

1896
01:19:23,464 --> 01:19:25,294
- Look! It's moving.
- My goodness.

1897
01:19:25,294 --> 01:19:27,693
- Wow.
- Isn't that a bullfrog?

1898
01:19:27,693 --> 01:19:30,464
- There's a baby on its back.
- Where?

1899
01:19:30,464 --> 01:19:33,534
Its baby is on its back.

1900
01:19:33,534 --> 01:19:34,834
You have bad eyesight, don't you?

1901
01:19:34,933 --> 01:19:36,903
No, there's a baby on its back.

1902
01:19:36,903 --> 01:19:39,613
- The baby is on its mother's back.
- I don't see a baby.

1903
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:42,384
- It's hanging on its mother's back.
- Is it really hanging there?

1904
01:19:42,683 --> 01:19:44,643
Oh, my. You can see that?

1905
01:19:45,384 --> 01:19:46,384
- They're mating.
- They're mating?

1906
01:19:46,384 --> 01:19:47,813
It's not a baby, it's its lover.

1907
01:19:47,813 --> 01:19:49,954
- They're mating?
- Yes.

1908
01:19:49,954 --> 01:19:52,954
Okay, then. We're sorry. You can get back to it.

1909
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,594
You can get back to it.

1910
01:19:54,994 --> 01:19:56,924
My, we saw something fun.

1911
01:19:57,223 --> 01:19:58,693
- There are frogs there.
- There are frogs there too.

1912
01:19:58,693 --> 01:19:59,763
There are frogs everywhere.

1913
01:19:59,763 --> 01:20:01,294
What? That one's on top of another one too.

1914
01:20:01,294 --> 01:20:02,403
But it got pushed away.

1915
01:20:02,403 --> 01:20:06,403
So it's a mating season for frogs.

1916
01:20:08,473 --> 01:20:09,844
Why aren't they coming?

1917
01:20:10,943 --> 01:20:13,244
Oh, my. Are they fighting?

1918
01:20:13,473 --> 01:20:14,844
- Are they fighting?
- Look at them!

1919
01:20:14,844 --> 01:20:17,313
- Look at them! Oh, my!
- My gosh!

1920
01:20:17,483 --> 01:20:18,554
- They're fighting!
- They're really fighting.

1921
01:20:18,554 --> 01:20:20,313
Oh, my. Will it be eaten by the other?

1922
01:20:20,714 --> 01:20:22,153
Or are they mating?

1923
01:20:22,153 --> 01:20:24,084
(Are they mating?)

1924
01:20:24,084 --> 01:20:25,994
They mate that violently?

1925
01:20:25,994 --> 01:20:28,523
He's not the one for you. You should break up with him.

1926
01:20:28,664 --> 01:20:29,893
It won't work.

1927
01:20:30,294 --> 01:20:31,994
They mate so aggressively?

1928
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:33,294
He's not the one for you.

1929
01:20:33,294 --> 01:20:35,433
- They shouldn't see each other.
- I mean...

1930
01:20:36,363 --> 01:20:40,233
They look like friends that have known each other for 10 years.

1931
01:20:40,903 --> 01:20:43,744
- They've been friends for 10 years.
- I know.

1932
01:20:44,044 --> 01:20:45,914
- Look at that.
- What is it?

1933
01:20:45,914 --> 01:20:47,973
- It's an oak tree.
- You're right!

1934
01:20:47,973 --> 01:20:50,483
I didn't know it was there.

1935
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:52,914
I thought it was something else.

1936
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:55,823
(Somewhat bitter, amicable)

1937
01:20:57,754 --> 01:20:59,794
The store is tiny.

1938
01:21:01,393 --> 01:21:06,063
(They arrived at the store in no time.)

1939
01:21:07,433 --> 01:21:11,134
(As one of the oldest places of the village, )

1940
01:21:11,263 --> 01:21:14,334
(it remained at the entrance of the village for 121 years.)

1941
01:21:14,334 --> 01:21:15,844
What are they selling today?

1942
01:21:17,403 --> 01:21:20,914
Rice taffy, grain syrup, sikhye, sujeonggwa...

1943
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:23,214
They have everything.

1944
01:21:23,214 --> 01:21:25,653
(They have everything you're looking for.)

1945
01:21:25,754 --> 01:21:27,853
Popsicles, freezies.

1946
01:21:27,853 --> 01:21:29,584
They used the old terms.

1947
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:31,353
Right. Popsicles, freezies.

1948
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:34,124
What's this place? It's so cute!

1949
01:21:34,124 --> 01:21:36,464
- It really is.
- This must be the small store.

1950
01:21:36,464 --> 01:21:39,164
- Hello.
- Hello.

1951
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:40,664
My goodness.

1952
01:21:40,664 --> 01:21:42,704
Did you make it yourself?

1953
01:21:43,504 --> 01:21:45,004
Let's have cold sikhye.

1954
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:47,903
- I'm having a bottle of it.
- I want sikhye too.

1955
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,544
Okay, you can take them.

1956
01:21:49,804 --> 01:21:52,113
You can have this. It melted.

1957
01:21:52,113 --> 01:21:54,374
Dong Il, you have it. I like the slushy type.

1958
01:21:54,374 --> 01:21:56,714
- No, it's okay.
- Your teeth will ache.

1959
01:21:56,714 --> 01:21:58,784
No, I'm not that old!

1960
01:21:59,653 --> 01:22:00,813
You can have that.

1961
01:22:00,813 --> 01:22:02,254
I'll put that in a bag for you.

1962
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:05,393
How much are the taffies?

1963
01:22:05,393 --> 01:22:07,594
- It's 5 dollars a bag.
- I'll have this.

1964
01:22:07,594 --> 01:22:08,723
- You're having it?
- It's a gift for you.

1965
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:10,594
- You're giving it to me?
- Of course.

1966
01:22:10,594 --> 01:22:11,863
- You don't want it?
- Get her two bags.

1967
01:22:12,433 --> 01:22:14,893
- Okay, take 2 bags.
- Get her 2 bags.

1968
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:18,304
Do your parents like grain syrup?

1969
01:22:18,304 --> 01:22:19,334
Grain syrup?

1970
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:21,374
I'll take this as well.

1971
01:22:21,374 --> 01:22:23,943
Okay, I'll put it in.

1972
01:22:23,943 --> 01:22:24,943
(Dong Il gets a gift for her parents too.)

1973
01:22:25,143 --> 01:22:27,613
- I want to ask you something.
- Sure.

1974
01:22:27,613 --> 01:22:31,044
What's the exact name of this village?

1975
01:22:31,384 --> 01:22:32,653
- Yangdong Folk Village.
- Yangdong Folk Village?

1976
01:22:32,653 --> 01:22:35,013
It means a village where wise noblemen...

1977
01:22:35,013 --> 01:22:36,983
- who serve the king live.
- Wise noblemen? I see.

1978
01:22:36,983 --> 01:22:39,954
Out of the entire city, this village alone...

1979
01:22:39,954 --> 01:22:43,994
produced the half of noblemen who passed the royal exam.

1980
01:22:43,994 --> 01:22:45,994
- The royal exam?
- That's right.

1981
01:22:45,994 --> 01:22:48,964
This village must be in a good location.

1982
01:22:49,204 --> 01:22:52,504
(So it's a village with a long history.)

1983
01:22:52,603 --> 01:22:54,304
There are thatched-roofed houses here.

1984
01:22:54,874 --> 01:22:57,044
Do people live there?

1985
01:22:57,044 --> 01:22:58,973
- Yes, they're all occupied.
- All of them?

1986
01:22:58,973 --> 01:23:02,914
Yes, the people of this village inherited their houses...

1987
01:23:02,914 --> 01:23:05,353
from their ancestors and are living in there.

1988
01:23:05,853 --> 01:23:08,584
So the descendants...

1989
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:11,254
are actually living in all of those houses.

1990
01:23:11,254 --> 01:23:15,893
It's thanks to the sacrifice of the people of this village...

1991
01:23:15,964 --> 01:23:18,594
that a village like this and the houses can be maintained.

1992
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:20,634
- I see.
- Wow, it's incredible.

1993
01:23:20,634 --> 01:23:22,903
You're such a good talker.

1994
01:23:23,903 --> 01:23:26,933
So the smoke coming out of the chimney...

1995
01:23:26,933 --> 01:23:28,573
- is from their furnace?
- That's right.

1996
01:23:28,573 --> 01:23:30,304
- They cook with a furnace?
- Yes.

1997
01:23:30,403 --> 01:23:33,214
I thought there would be empty houses.

1998
01:23:33,214 --> 01:23:35,244
So people actually live in there.

1999
01:23:36,313 --> 01:23:41,483
(It's their determination to maintain the village.)

2000
01:23:42,983 --> 01:23:49,223
(Thanks to them, the 500 years of history is preserved.)

2001
01:23:49,263 --> 01:23:50,594
That house...

2002
01:23:50,594 --> 01:23:54,193
was bestowed upon them by King Jungjong.

2003
01:23:54,393 --> 01:23:56,433
By King Jungjong?

2004
01:23:56,704 --> 01:24:01,304
(The village looks different now that they heard about its history.)

2005
01:24:01,304 --> 01:24:05,103
I think I remember some of them.

2006
01:24:05,103 --> 01:24:06,143
How?

2007
01:24:06,773 --> 01:24:08,473
I think I lived in that house before.

2008
01:24:08,473 --> 01:24:10,183
- In your past life?
- Yes.

2009
01:24:10,183 --> 01:24:13,513
There's a toilet on the left side, and a furnace on the other side.

2010
01:24:13,513 --> 01:24:15,424
I can remember some of it.

2011
01:24:15,523 --> 01:24:18,084
(He's so funny.)

2012
01:24:18,084 --> 01:24:20,153
My gosh. Thank you so much.

2013
01:24:20,153 --> 01:24:22,763
Thank you for your kind explanation. Stay healthy, ma'am.

2014
01:24:22,763 --> 01:24:24,863
- Bye.
- Thank you. Thank you, Dong Il.

2015
01:24:24,863 --> 01:24:26,294
- Thank you for the gift.
- Stay healthy.

2016
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:27,464
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

2017
01:24:27,464 --> 01:24:29,733
- Bye.
- Have a safe trip.

2018
01:24:29,733 --> 01:24:31,363
Thank you.

2019
01:24:32,162 --> 01:24:35,949
We're having water parsley pork belly for dinner, right?

2020
01:24:35,974 --> 01:24:36,607
- Yes.
- Yes.

2021
01:24:36,701 --> 01:24:38,731
This place must be famous for its water parsley.

2022
01:24:38,972 --> 01:24:41,102
Gosh, really?

2023
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:44,071
There's a water parsley farm near here.

2024
01:24:44,111 --> 01:24:46,142
Let's visit it since it's close by.

2025
01:24:47,611 --> 01:24:51,512
(Water parsley, the best ingredient of Yangdong Folk Village)

2026
01:24:52,512 --> 01:24:56,991
(They're grown with Gyeongju's clean groundwater.)

2027
01:24:58,022 --> 01:25:01,491
(Its scent is strong, and it's very crunchy.)

2028
01:25:02,762 --> 01:25:04,361
(Add water parsley...)

2029
01:25:04,361 --> 01:25:09,002
(to the well-grilled pork belly.)

2030
01:25:11,002 --> 01:25:15,941
(It's the perfect ingredient to have with pork belly.)

2031
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:19,781
(Golden brown)

2032
01:25:20,441 --> 01:25:25,012
(Shall we go get some water parsley?)

2033
01:25:25,312 --> 01:25:26,781
Hello!

2034
01:25:26,922 --> 01:25:28,951
- Hello.
- Hello.

2035
01:25:29,252 --> 01:25:32,621
- My goodness, welcome!
- It's nice to meet you.

2036
01:25:32,722 --> 01:25:34,161
Hello!

2037
01:25:36,462 --> 01:25:38,062
You must be really close to them.

2038
01:25:38,491 --> 01:25:39,962
Yes, I'm very close to them.

2039
01:25:39,962 --> 01:25:41,701
- You even waved.
- You know them, don't you?

2040
01:25:41,701 --> 01:25:44,132
- Yes, I do. I'm very close.
- I knew it.

2041
01:25:45,002 --> 01:25:46,871
It's my first time seeing a water parsley farm.

2042
01:25:46,871 --> 01:25:48,002
I've only seen it at supermarkets.

2043
01:25:48,002 --> 01:25:49,672
- Is that so?
- Yes.

2044
01:25:49,812 --> 01:25:52,882
Don't they usually grow in water?

2045
01:25:53,312 --> 01:25:54,812
It's water parsley that grows in the ground.

2046
01:25:54,812 --> 01:25:56,111
Oh, I see.

2047
01:25:56,111 --> 01:25:58,852
We first grow it in water, then we plant it in the ground.

2048
01:25:58,852 --> 01:26:00,451
- I see.
- That's how we grow it.

2049
01:26:00,451 --> 01:26:01,451
(So this is water parsley grown in the ground.)

2050
01:26:02,151 --> 01:26:04,651
(The farm owner picks the fresh water parsley for them.)

2051
01:26:04,651 --> 01:26:06,462
- So that's how you pick it?
- Oh, my.

2052
01:26:06,462 --> 01:26:08,762
We don't need that much.

2053
01:26:08,762 --> 01:26:10,731
- We only need a little.
- Yes, just enough for one meal.

2054
01:26:10,731 --> 01:26:13,632
We'll take it and clean it ourselves.

2055
01:26:13,632 --> 01:26:15,661
- Okay. That's good.
- All right.

2056
01:26:15,661 --> 01:26:17,571
- It looks good.
- Thank you.

2057
01:26:17,571 --> 01:26:20,941
You might come back for more because it's so good.

2058
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:22,541
(Laughing)

2059
01:26:22,541 --> 01:26:24,342
I think that's more than enough.

2060
01:26:24,342 --> 01:26:26,241
I'll come running if we need more later.

2061
01:26:27,382 --> 01:26:29,382
- Thank you for this.
- Thank you.

2062
01:26:29,382 --> 01:26:31,012
- Thank you for this.
- Bye.

2063
01:26:31,012 --> 01:26:32,651
