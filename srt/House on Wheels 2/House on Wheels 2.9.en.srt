1
00:00:28,664 --> 00:00:30,865
(Mount Jiri's morning is clearer than yesterday.)

2
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:32,234
(Hi.)

3
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:34,774
(The members have become closer than yesterday.)

4
00:00:35,004 --> 00:00:37,274
(The second day where they became real family begins.)

5
00:00:37,444 --> 00:00:39,674
(Driving along with the cherry blossoms of Seomjin River,)

6
00:00:41,214 --> 00:00:44,345
(they've arrived at the green tea field in Hadong.)

7
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:46,755
(The fresh front yard...)

8
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:52,325
(and the zip-line in the next town where they can see Dadohae.)

9
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:57,123
(They have the greatest looking dishes for dinner.)

10
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:59,024
(Exclaiming)

11
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:01,634
(Eyes going wide)

12
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,935
(They can't stop exclaiming the whole day.)

13
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:09,475
(What events await them today?)

14
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:17,343
(They spent a relaxing day in Mount Jiri.)

15
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:20,084
The sound of the stream and burning wood is really nice, right?

16
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:23,883
(Safely filmed in a campground where the use of burners is granted.)

17
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,384
Byoung Cheol, was there anything you weren't happy with today?

18
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:28,753
- No, not at all.
- Right?

19
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:30,024
I love it here.

20
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:31,893
When I heard you two were coming...

21
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:34,134
You know how you have the opposite images,

22
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,764
Byoung Cheol and Yoon A.

23
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,863
I was worried if the five of us would get along well.

24
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:43,973
But unexpectedly, we all got along really well.

25
00:01:43,974 --> 00:01:45,144
(They had a great day where they got along with each other well.)

26
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:48,075
Because Byoung Cheol doesn't talk much,

27
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:50,445
he gets along with anyone most of the time.

28
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:53,185
(The hidden hero of their chemistry today)

29
00:01:53,484 --> 00:01:55,385
We'll make some great memories tomorrow.

30
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:58,654
You know what we're doing tomorrow, right?

31
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:00,393
- Zipline?
- Zipline, Yes.

32
00:02:00,394 --> 00:02:03,364
It has the longest course in Korea.

33
00:02:04,764 --> 00:02:08,394
(On the way to their second front yard tomorrow,)

34
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:12,234
(Dong Il has prepared a special gift for them.)

35
00:02:13,405 --> 00:02:15,634
(It's where you can see Dadohae at once...)

36
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,745
(and enjoy the thrills while dashing through the wind.)

37
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:24,215
(I love it.)

38
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:29,555
(The longest course in Asia, the zipline of Mount Geumo)

39
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:31,854
Zipline is really fun.

40
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:33,123
All right.

41
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:35,693
The fire is dying out now. Let's go to bed.

42
00:02:35,694 --> 00:02:37,264
(They go to bed for now.)

43
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:39,224
We don't wake you up early.

44
00:02:39,294 --> 00:02:41,765
Don't wake anyone if you get up early. Leave them to sleep.

45
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:44,633
- And go to the bathroom quietly.
- Okay.

46
00:02:44,634 --> 00:02:46,034
All right. You can go in now.

47
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:51,604
(Si Wan is busy making the bed for the guests.)

48
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:53,774
- Who's sleeping upstairs?
- Who's sleeping upstairs?

49
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:55,314
I'll be sleeping up there.

50
00:02:55,515 --> 00:02:57,043
- And?
- I'll be sleeping here.

51
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,343
- Really?
- Yoon A is sleeping on the floor?

52
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:00,354
(Si Wan's bed, Yoon A's bed, Byoung Cheol's bed)

53
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:03,314
I think I'll step on her on my way to the bathroom.

54
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:05,484
- No, you won't.
- No way.

55
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,395
If you do, I'll get up.

56
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,194
Of course you will.

57
00:03:09,324 --> 00:03:10,723
I'll remove the pillows.

58
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:15,835
- Oh, no. Oh, my!
- Hey, hey!

59
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:19,104
What's wrong with him? I can't sleep here.

60
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:20,234
- Get out.
- I didn't mean it.

61
00:03:20,235 --> 00:03:23,443
- What's wrong with this man?
- I didn't mean it.

62
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:25,443
- This won't do.
- He can't think straight.

63
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:27,373
I didn't want to step on your blanket.

64
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,843
This won't do.

65
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:31,084
- I didn't want to step on it.
- She said this won't do.

66
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,843
You shouldn't meet him too often. Call us instead.

67
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:34,754
I don't meet him that often.

68
00:03:36,414 --> 00:03:37,954
- Are you okay?
- Good night then.

69
00:03:37,955 --> 00:03:40,424
- Sleep tight.
- Good work, today.

70
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:42,525
- I'll shut the doors for you.
- Thank you.

71
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,335
(Dong Il and Hee Won go to the tent after taking care of them.)

72
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:50,064
Oh, my!

73
00:03:51,435 --> 00:03:52,633
Yoon A did all this.

74
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:54,074
- Yoon A did?
- Yes.

75
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:57,705
My goodness. She made amazing bedding for us.

76
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:01,214
I'm so glad to have met you through this show.

77
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:02,774
- I know. Me too.
- It's good to see you both.

78
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,184
Right. I'm really glad.

79
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:05,883
- And we're sleeping in one room.
- It's really sudden.

80
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:09,185
- It's such an honor.
- All of a sudden.

81
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:13,353
You can speak casually to us anytime you want to.

82
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,024
Yes, please do that.

83
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:16,924
Okay, then. I'll do that from tomorrow.

84
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,594
- From tomorrow?
- Yes.

85
00:04:19,265 --> 00:04:20,293
Good night.

86
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,794
(They promise to be more comfortable with each other tomorrow.)

87
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,351
(With birds chirping, the morning has arrived.)

88
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:36,895
(The members of House on Wheels...)

89
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:39,295
(are still deep asleep.)

90
00:04:40,266 --> 00:04:42,164
(Si Wan doesn't even budge and sleeps quietly.)

91
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:44,235
(Sleeping quietly)

92
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:52,845
(Even when she tosses and turns, she's beautiful.)

93
00:04:53,985 --> 00:04:57,516
(Byoung Cheol tosses and turns a lot more than others.)

94
00:04:58,516 --> 00:05:01,655
(It's comfortable to sleep with my legs crossed.)

95
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,456
(Meanwhile, in the tent...)

96
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:09,366
(He gets up all of a sudden.)

97
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,996
(Dong Il got up first.)

98
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:18,136
(Crawling out)

99
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:23,616
(Are they still asleep?)

100
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:32,516
(Enjoying the view of the front yard while everyone's asleep)

101
00:05:33,655 --> 00:05:34,686
(Hello.)

102
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:40,595
(The green mountain view that stretches endlessly)

103
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:45,696
(And a clear valley where freshwater flows)

104
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:49,405
(The morning with a clear view of Mount Jiri)

105
00:05:51,376 --> 00:05:55,076
(The front yard is as beautiful as ever today as well.)

106
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:57,946
(Peeping)

107
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:01,246
(They're still sleeping?)

108
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:06,585
(It seems like they're never going to wake up.)

109
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:10,855
(Getting up abruptly)

110
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:13,965
(It's cold.)

111
00:06:15,665 --> 00:06:18,696
(He closes the door tight and gets back to sleep.)

112
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:23,165
(I'm so bored, but no one's getting up.)

113
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:29,045
(He brings a firewood box.)

114
00:06:29,746 --> 00:06:33,516
(Rattling)

115
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:39,116
(He prepares a fire for firegazing alone.)

116
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,424
(After setting all the chairs,)

117
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:47,396
(he finally sits down.)

118
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:50,965
(This is nice.)

119
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:56,806
(He's up already?)

120
00:06:57,905 --> 00:07:00,746
(Clacking)

121
00:07:01,576 --> 00:07:03,646
(Good morning.)

122
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:05,446
Did you sleep well?

123
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:07,985
Yes. Why did you get up so early?

124
00:07:08,116 --> 00:07:10,085
I wake up early now that I'm old.

125
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:12,616
(Laughing)

126
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:17,696
(Half-asleep)

127
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:22,795
(Hee Won got up to the noise from outside.)

128
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:26,095
(Si Wan is up already.)

129
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:30,436
(Hee Won sits in front of the fire too.)

130
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:34,844
This is warm and nice.

131
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:36,146
(Safely filmed in a campground where the use of burners is granted.)

132
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:39,475
The house owners get up early.

133
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:41,745
- Sorry?
- The house owners get up early.

134
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:43,585
(The house owners got up early.)

135
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:47,025
(Meanwhile, in the house...)

136
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,525
(Blinking)

137
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:53,826
(Getting up abruptly)

138
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:57,736
(They're all up early.)

139
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:02,304
(She ties her hair neatly...)

140
00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:04,606
(and checks herself in the mirror.)

141
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:09,904
Yoon A is up.

142
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:12,175
(Yoon A is here.)

143
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:13,616
Yoon A, did you sleep well?

144
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:14,746
(Nodding)

145
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:16,986
Come sit here. It's warm.

146
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:18,586
Aren't you tired?

147
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:21,955
Yoon A is beautiful even in the morning.

148
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:25,025
(Embarrassed)

149
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:28,695
Firegazing is nicer in the morning.

150
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:33,495
It's nice to look around and gaze at the fire in the morning.

151
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:34,506
(She's getting absorbed into the morning firegazing.)

152
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:36,136
Look at his face.

153
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:37,606
(I'm sleepy.)

154
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,106
Byoung Cheol is sleeping long. Maybe it's because he's introverted.

155
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:44,815
He needs to get up so I can ask him to make coffee.

156
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,015
I think Byoung Cheol is up.

157
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:50,285
- He is?
- I think so.

158
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:55,256
(Byoung Cheol climbs down carefully.)

159
00:08:55,955 --> 00:09:00,466
(Being careful)

160
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:05,636
(He got tired from climbing down.)

161
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:09,665
Did you sleep well?

162
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,106
Hi.

163
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:14,505
- Really?
- I said hi.

164
00:09:14,506 --> 00:09:15,976
(Hi!)

165
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:20,414
(Byoung Cheol kept his promise to talk casually to his juniors.)

166
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:21,415
Good morning, Byoung Cheol.

167
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,086
- I slept really well.
- That's good.

168
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:27,655
(Shy)

169
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:30,995
Now that you've gone casual with me,

170
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:32,356
you should try it with Yoon A.

171
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:36,495
Yoon A, Byoung Cheol has something to say to you.

172
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:38,635
- What is it? What?
- What does he have to say?

173
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:40,095
- He has something to say.
- I do?

174
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:41,105
Yes.

175
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:43,165
- What is it?
- I slept well. Did you sleep well?

176
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:46,075
(I slept well too.)

177
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:48,075
Are you all speaking casually to each other now?

178
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:49,905
- Yes.
- Even Yoon A and Si Wan?

179
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:51,846
Please speak comfortably to me.

180
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:54,785
(Sure.)

181
00:09:55,086 --> 00:09:56,314
Let's drink something.

182
00:09:56,315 --> 00:09:57,315
(Now that Byoung Cheol is up, let's drink something.)

183
00:09:57,415 --> 00:10:00,256
(He took out the coffee dripper that You Jung gave them.)

184
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,455
(Dripping)

185
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:08,096
(He gazes at the dripping coffee instead of the fire.)

186
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,495
- Is there any movie you like?
- Me?

187
00:10:11,496 --> 00:10:13,665
The movie you think we all should watch.

188
00:10:13,766 --> 00:10:16,065
- There is one.
- What is it?

189
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,975
- It's called "The Conversation".
- "The Conversation"?

190
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:20,545
It's a movie by Francis Ford Coppola.

191
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:23,705
Gene Hackman stars in it.

192
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:27,245
You kind of resemble him.

193
00:10:27,246 --> 00:10:29,645
- He's way more charismatic than me.
- That's not true.

194
00:10:29,646 --> 00:10:31,516
- He's way taller too.
- I'd choose you over him.

195
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:34,126
(Thumbs-up)

196
00:10:34,325 --> 00:10:36,356
I like you too, Dong Il.

197
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:38,396
This is how you become when you get old.

198
00:10:39,496 --> 00:10:42,825
I've always liked movies like "The World Without a Mother".

199
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:46,266
I've always preferred family movies over action movies.

200
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:48,606
Those everyday stories between family members.

201
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:50,704
Something like "3000 Leagues in Search of Mother"?

202
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:52,435
Yes, something like that. I'm serious.

203
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:55,476
Movies like "A Dog of Flanders". I cried a lot when I watched it.

204
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:57,615
I bawled my eyes out...

205
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:59,915
toward the end during the church scene.

206
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:02,445
I did a play of "A Dog of Flanders".

207
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:03,954
My role was the dog.

208
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,155
Of course you had to. You're perfect for it.

209
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:08,054
I played the lead role.

210
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:09,924
Of course. Thank goodness...

211
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:12,695
you didn't have to pull the cart.

212
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:16,695
(Sticking his head out)

213
00:11:17,096 --> 00:11:18,294
Thank you.

214
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:19,966
(Here's the coffee you ordered.)

215
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:22,805
(Sipping)

216
00:11:23,565 --> 00:11:24,935
(Impressed)

217
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:30,716
(A cup of warm coffee that begins their day)

218
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:32,674
It'd be really nice...

219
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:35,115
to have tteokguk for breakfast in the mornings like this.

220
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:36,116
(Exclaiming)

221
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:37,586
Make it for us, Dong Il.

222
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:38,885
- Tteokguk?
- Yes.

223
00:11:38,886 --> 00:11:39,886
Tteokguk?

224
00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:42,756
Should I make it for you guys?

225
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:45,825
- Do you know how to make it?
- Yes.

226
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:47,325
- Really?
- Really?

227
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:50,424
Great. Let's have tteokguk for a light breakfast.

228
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:51,694
(He agrees.)

229
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:53,235
We decide on the menu on the spot.

230
00:11:53,236 --> 00:11:54,236
(I'd like that.)

231
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,005
- That's great.
- I'll go and make it for you.

232
00:11:57,006 --> 00:11:58,006
(I'll make it in no time.)

233
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:01,675
I wish my daughter grows up to be like Yoon A.

234
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,715
I wish my son grows up to be like Si Wan.

235
00:12:04,716 --> 00:12:06,245
(Nodding)

236
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:09,184
I don't think I'd want my son to grow up to be like you guys.

237
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:10,445
(Sure, sure.)

238
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,486
I'm sure I'm not the right role model.

239
00:12:13,685 --> 00:12:16,126
I think Hee Won is not bad.

240
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,495
- Him?
- Yes.

241
00:12:17,496 --> 00:12:18,996
That makes my dad Dong Il?

242
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:21,065
(Screaming)

243
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,496
(Laughing)

244
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:29,506
(Yoon A begins making tteokguk.)

245
00:12:31,506 --> 00:12:32,935
Adding lots of meat.

246
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:36,405
(Sizzling)

247
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:41,815
(Next, she cracks eggs.)

248
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:44,955
(Skillfully separating egg yolks from whites)

249
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:49,285
The heat is too high.

250
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:54,866
- Could you turn down the heat?
- The heat? Hold on.

251
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:58,496
- Are you making egg garnish?
- Yes.

252
00:13:01,935 --> 00:13:04,976
(She finishes making egg garnish easily.)

253
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:07,345
There's less yellow dust today.

254
00:13:07,346 --> 00:13:09,175
The sky cleared up, right?

255
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:12,544
It's gotten much better than yesterday.

256
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:14,585
- Look. Look over there.
- The sky is clearer.

257
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,245
I can see it! I can see the Cheonwangbong Peak!

258
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:20,015
Right. You can see the sun.

259
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:21,025
(Exclaiming)

260
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:24,755
(It's the highest peak of Mount Jiri...)

261
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:26,655
(and the second-highest peak in Korea.)

262
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:30,694
(They couldn't see it yesterday due to the bad weather.)

263
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:33,465
The sun is right there.

264
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:34,905
Si Wan, Yoon A!

265
00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:37,476
We can see the Cheonwangbong Peak clearly now.

266
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:38,675
Really?

267
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:42,075
- Oh, he's right. Look.
- Let me see.

268
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:43,774
The view is clear now.

269
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:44,775
(I want to see it too.)

270
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:45,775
You can see it, right?

271
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,985
- Why couldn't we see it yesterday?
- I saw it.

272
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:50,016
(They can see it clearly now.)

273
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:54,125
We should've seen the Cheonwangbong Peak yesterday.

274
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,225
I know, the weather should've been nice like today.

275
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:58,925
The sun is right above the Cheonwangbong Peak.

276
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,965
- Right?
- It's like the view...

277
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,195
- from Mount Everest.
- Is that so?

278
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:06,665
That's what we wanted to see yesterday.

279
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:09,265
- It's way clearer than yesterday.
- Right.

280
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,365
We couldn't see anything yesterday.

281
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:11,534
I can see the peak in detail.

282
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:14,375
It was foggy up here until yesterday.

283
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:16,605
I can see every tree on the Cheonwangbong Peak.

284
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:20,215
You can see four big trees on the right.

285
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:21,315
(Laughing)

286
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,815
- You can see that? Four trees?
- Can't you see them?

287
00:14:24,185 --> 00:14:25,314
Yes, I can.

288
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:26,555
- Right.
- Yes.

289
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:28,256
How high is the peak?

290
00:14:28,925 --> 00:14:33,294
Isn't it about 1,400m or 1,700m?

291
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:35,824
1,400m or 1,500m? Or 1,450m?

292
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:37,164
I'll look it up quickly.

293
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:39,236
You need to be seen as someone who knows everything.

294
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:42,235
I think it's around 1,700m high.

295
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:44,065
From 1,700m to 2,000m.

296
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,835
- Or 1,900m?
- Yes, it's 1,915m.

297
00:14:46,836 --> 00:14:50,075
- See? I was right.
- It's 1,915m high.

298
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:52,746
From what I know,

299
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:55,045
the Cheonwangbong Peak is 1,915m high.

300
00:14:55,246 --> 00:14:58,554
You are very precise.

301
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:01,086
Including the memorial stone,

302
00:15:01,185 --> 00:15:04,396
it's around 1,958m.

303
00:15:04,856 --> 00:15:07,524
- The memorial stone?
- Maybe 1,957m. The stone.

304
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:10,024
Are you saying the stone is 35m tall?

305
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:13,865
Come on. It's about 3m tall.

306
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:17,034
It's about 3m or 2m tall.

307
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:20,274
Anyway, the Cheonwangbong Peak is 1,915m high.

308
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:21,945
(He's sure of this.)

309
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:24,815
Gosh, he knows everything.

310
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:26,615
I lied about my age.

311
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:27,885
I was actually born in 1938.

312
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,586
(Laughing)

313
00:15:30,216 --> 00:15:31,856
- Is it going well?
- Yes.

314
00:15:31,955 --> 00:15:34,256
Yoon A is really fast.

315
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:35,924
Are you almost done?

316
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,555
- Yes, it's almost done.
- She's really fast.

317
00:15:37,655 --> 00:15:40,424
- For dumplings...
- Dumplings? We have dumplings?

318
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:41,596
Yes, bring them.

319
00:15:41,996 --> 00:15:44,896
(These are the dumplings they'll have with tteokguk.)

320
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:46,496
(Pouring)

321
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:50,205
(A good posture)

322
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:54,476
(Frying in a flashy manner)

323
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:56,976
(It looks delicious.)

324
00:15:57,175 --> 00:15:58,615
- Here, Byoung Cheol.
- Yes.

325
00:15:58,616 --> 00:15:59,675
Try this one.

326
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:00,915
Okay.

327
00:16:01,016 --> 00:16:02,746
Gosh, so hot. Give me chopsticks.

328
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:05,716
Gosh, it's so hot because of the oil.

329
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:06,814
So hot.

330
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:08,055
(How come you grabbed it with your hand?)

331
00:16:08,655 --> 00:16:10,025
- Thank you.
- Seriously.

332
00:16:10,325 --> 00:16:11,425
Byoung Cheol.

333
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:12,825
(A dumpling is delivered with chopsticks.)

334
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:14,126
- Thank you.
- Try it.

335
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:17,366
(Blowing)

336
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,835
Hey, give this to her.

337
00:16:19,836 --> 00:16:20,865
(He takes a bite of a freshly fried dumpling)

338
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:22,605
- I'll give it to her.
- It's for Yoon A.

339
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,735
- I'll go.
- Okay.

340
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:24,875
(Savoring)

341
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:27,546
- Is it okay?
- It's delicious, but...

342
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,674
- the inside is a bit cold.
- Is it cold?

343
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:34,245
(Failed)

344
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:36,086
I did it on purpose.

345
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:37,346
(If Dong Il says so...)

346
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:39,386
- An iron hand in a velvet glove.
- That's right.

347
00:16:39,616 --> 00:16:40,685
Is it too cold?

348
00:16:41,286 --> 00:16:43,526
The cold part takes up about...

349
00:16:43,786 --> 00:16:45,056
30 percent of the dumpling.

350
00:16:45,695 --> 00:16:46,856
- Is that so?
- Yes.

351
00:16:47,155 --> 00:16:49,296
(Upset)

352
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:51,664
We can put lightly fried dumplings in tteokguk.

353
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:53,195
- We can do that.
- Right.

354
00:16:54,465 --> 00:16:56,465
- We'll use all of these.
- Yes.

355
00:16:57,576 --> 00:17:02,245
(Adding rice cake into the soup)

356
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,975
- I poured rice cake in it just now.
- Yes.

357
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:06,675
You can bring it out.

358
00:17:07,046 --> 00:17:09,115
- Thank you. Sorry.
- No problem.

359
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:10,245
Hey.

360
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:11,815
(Eat some dumplings while cooking.)

361
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:14,455
Here's the dumpling. Yoon A, try this dumpling.

362
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:17,385
It's hot.

363
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:19,955
(Taking a bite carefully)

364
00:17:20,925 --> 00:17:21,964
Is it good?

365
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:22,965
(Exclaiming)

366
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:24,665
- Is it good?
- It's perfect.

367
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,366
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

368
00:17:26,396 --> 00:17:28,265
But he added too much oil.

369
00:17:30,665 --> 00:17:33,435
- The oil is dripping.
- Gosh, seriously.

370
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:36,205
(Here's a pot delivery!)

371
00:17:37,076 --> 00:17:39,576
Okay, good. It'll be done in no time.

372
00:17:41,346 --> 00:17:43,915
(Let me take a look at it.)

373
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:47,856
(Steamy)

374
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:51,825
- It's done. Come and ladle it.
- Okay.

375
00:17:51,826 --> 00:17:52,895
Okay.

376
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:54,126
Hand me the bowl.

377
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:59,695
Yoon A of Girls' Generation made this tteokguk.

378
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:02,965
(Please enjoy!)

379
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:05,734
Dong Il, Yoon A also made egg garnish.

380
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:06,835
(Impressed)

381
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,046
I've only heard of Zidane, the soccer player.

382
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:12,675
(Turning frosty)

383
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:14,945
You should understand him.

384
00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:16,715
Okay.

385
00:18:16,715 --> 00:18:17,715
(A forced laugh)

386
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:20,415
(Embarrassed)

387
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:21,724
Here.

388
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,326
(Decorating with egg garnish)

389
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:26,195
How pretty!

390
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:29,126
Thanks.

391
00:18:29,665 --> 00:18:30,826
And...

392
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:35,435
(Add fried dumplings as a finishing touch)

393
00:18:37,265 --> 00:18:38,474
What a tasty meal for a breakfast.

394
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:39,876
(House on Wheels is known for its visual)

395
00:18:41,346 --> 00:18:43,504
(A warm breakfast of tteokguk and fried dumplings is ready.)

396
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:44,744
- Is it ready?
- Yes.

397
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:46,244
- It's done.
- Thank you for the food.

398
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:47,515
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

399
00:18:47,786 --> 00:18:48,816
- Let's dig in.
- Thank you for the meal.

400
00:18:49,445 --> 00:18:53,886
(A large mouthful)

401
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:55,754
Is it a little bland?

402
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:57,955
It can't be tasteless.

403
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:01,665
(Exclaiming)

404
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:03,765
- It's good.
- Yoon A, it's delicious.

405
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:05,195
It's delicious.

406
00:19:05,235 --> 00:19:06,494
Gosh, I...

407
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:08,365
I'll make this for breakfast later.

408
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:09,404
(Yoon A takes a bite after a hard cooking.)

409
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:10,735
(Savoring)

410
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:16,475
(Si Wan's shoulder rises when food is delicious.)

411
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:21,315
It's so delicious.

412
00:19:21,316 --> 00:19:22,485
(It's good!)

413
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:24,886
I can't believe we can see Cheonwangbong Peak from here.

414
00:19:25,185 --> 00:19:27,725
Gosh, the view of Cheonwangbong Peak and tteokguk. Isn't this amazing?

415
00:19:30,655 --> 00:19:32,355
(Against the beautiful cherry blossom background,)

416
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:33,425
It's so delicious.

417
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,395
Tteokguk is a good choice for breakfast.

418
00:19:35,396 --> 00:19:36,625
(they eat tteokguk as they take in the view of Cheonwangbong Peak.)

419
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:37,695
How nice!

420
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:42,265
It's our first time to eat such a hearty and warm meal...

421
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:46,005
early in the morning. Thanks to Yoon A.

422
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:47,376
It's pretty decent.

423
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:49,346
Pretty decent.

424
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:50,974
- Pretty decent?
- He thinks it's pretty decent.

425
00:19:50,975 --> 00:19:52,375
(Yoon A couldn't recognize his accent.)

426
00:19:52,376 --> 00:19:53,575
You didn't understand it?

427
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:55,185
- It's pretty decent.
- Where are you from?

428
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,685
I'm from Seoul.

429
00:19:57,955 --> 00:19:59,455
- It's Seoul, but...
- Where in Seoul?

430
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:01,425
- Sorry?
- You're being inquisitive again.

431
00:20:01,955 --> 00:20:03,654
Dong Il, I'm from Seoul too.

432
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:06,095
Gosh. When Byoung Cheol said he's from Seoul yesterday,

433
00:20:06,096 --> 00:20:07,494
you didn't ask or say anything.

434
00:20:07,495 --> 00:20:09,194
I didn't hear him. Are you from Seoul?

435
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:11,025
- Yes.
- Where in Seoul?

436
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:12,434
- I'm from Seodaemun-gu.
- Seodaemun-gu.

437
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:13,994
Goodness, you're a gentleman.

438
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:15,264
(A delayed reaction)

439
00:20:15,265 --> 00:20:18,776
My grandparents are from Yeongju.

440
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:20,805
- Right, you said that.
- As I grew up,

441
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:22,145
I heard a lot of the Gyeongsang Province dialect.

442
00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:23,175
(She's familiar with the Gyeongsang Province dialect.)

443
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:24,745
My dad...

444
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:26,646
is from Hwanghae Province.

445
00:20:26,715 --> 00:20:28,546
- I see. He's from North Korea.
- Yes.

446
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:32,255
He became an orphan during the Korean War.

447
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,755
- Your dad was...
- During the January–Fourth Retreat,

448
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:39,455
he missed the train.

449
00:20:39,995 --> 00:20:41,126
His whole family?

450
00:20:41,465 --> 00:20:42,866
That's what I heard from Dad.

451
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:45,265
I was even on a TV show that looks for dispersed families.

452
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:46,395
(Hee Won was on TV to find his dispersed family?)

453
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:48,264
- There was that program in KBS.
- Yes, quite a long time ago.

454
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:49,464
- My gosh, seriously?
- I went with my mom.

455
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:50,536
How old were you at that time?

456
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:52,704
I guess I was ten years old.

457
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:54,646
- You were 10 years old?
- Anyway...

458
00:20:55,405 --> 00:20:56,546
We couldn't find them.

459
00:20:57,546 --> 00:20:58,914
(Sad)

460
00:20:58,915 --> 00:21:00,646
But I had to hold a panel.

461
00:21:01,215 --> 00:21:03,515
It was incredibly hot, but they told me to hold it.

462
00:21:04,286 --> 00:21:05,355
You were only 10 years old.

463
00:21:05,356 --> 00:21:07,485
It was so tiring, but my dad told me to hold it.

464
00:21:08,485 --> 00:21:10,856
He came to Seoul after he turned 20.

465
00:21:11,155 --> 00:21:12,526
Your dad came to Seoul.

466
00:21:13,026 --> 00:21:16,026
He made his first address when he came to Seoul.

467
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:19,636
So he registered my birth in Myeongdong.

468
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:25,135
I'm from Myeongdong. That's my place of birth.

469
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:26,435
So it was Myeongdong.

470
00:21:27,276 --> 00:21:29,904
That's where my dad settled in.

471
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:31,046
(Kim Hee Won, Born in Myeongdong)

472
00:21:35,116 --> 00:21:37,985
We can tell how delicious this is from the leftovers.

473
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:42,955
I'd like to express how I feel about Yoon A.

474
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,055
I did the dishes while eating.

475
00:21:45,056 --> 00:21:46,254
(Surprised)

476
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:47,994
- Thank you.
- Gosh, you emptied your bowl.

477
00:21:47,995 --> 00:21:49,264
There's not even a dried laver flake.

478
00:21:49,265 --> 00:21:50,265
(It's almost a new bowl.)

479
00:21:51,796 --> 00:21:53,066
There's nothing left.

480
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:54,866
(Groaning)

481
00:21:55,036 --> 00:21:58,576
(Laughing)

482
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,505
There are only scallions left. It's hard to finish.

483
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:06,876
You can stop eating now.

484
00:22:07,316 --> 00:22:08,485
- Can I?
- Sure.

485
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,714
- Hey.
- That's enough. Oh, you ate it all.

486
00:22:10,715 --> 00:22:12,185
This is all I can give to you.

487
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:15,424
I can't keep my promise anymore.

488
00:22:15,425 --> 00:22:17,255
(Thank you, Hee Won.)

489
00:22:17,655 --> 00:22:19,626
Hey, we're done now. We should work out.

490
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:22,026
- Let's clean up and go to see fish.
- Okay.

491
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:23,764
- Okay.
- Okay.

492
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:24,995
(That sounds nice.)

493
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:27,066
The air is definitely clearer than yesterday.

494
00:22:27,136 --> 00:22:28,464
- I know.
- Right, the air is so clear.

495
00:22:28,465 --> 00:22:29,565
(The air became clear in the front yard.)

496
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:30,765
I can't wait to see it.

497
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:32,535
- We can see the clouds today.
- Right.

498
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:34,675
(Flutter of excitement fills their way to see the fish trap.)

499
00:22:34,945 --> 00:22:39,146
Why am I in a flutter when it's nothing special? Right?

500
00:22:39,745 --> 00:22:40,816
Will there be any fish caught?

501
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:43,685
Am I shivering from cold or excitement?

502
00:22:45,255 --> 00:22:46,514
- It was around here, right?
- Yes.

503
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:47,925
- I think it was around here.
- Do you see anything?

504
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:50,825
- There it is.
- It's there.

505
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:52,255
- Here.
- Here it is.

506
00:22:52,596 --> 00:22:53,954
Oh, it hasn't been swept away.

507
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,366
(Is that the right one?)

508
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,365
(Fish traps have been waiting for the members the whole night.)

509
00:22:58,366 --> 00:23:00,665
(Fish me out! Me too!)

510
00:23:01,235 --> 00:23:03,735
(Will there be some fish in it?)

511
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:09,175
(How many fish will there be?)

512
00:23:09,445 --> 00:23:10,475
Pull it out.

513
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:14,546
(Empty)

514
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:16,245
(There's not even a trace of fish in the fish trap.)

515
00:23:16,246 --> 00:23:17,685
I told you there won't be any.

516
00:23:20,155 --> 00:23:21,856
I guess there's no need to check on it.

517
00:23:21,955 --> 00:23:23,355
Right, just fish it out.

518
00:23:23,356 --> 00:23:24,625
- Don't go into the water.
- Right.

519
00:23:24,626 --> 00:23:26,525
Just fish it out.

520
00:23:26,526 --> 00:23:28,396
(I'll fish it out then.)

521
00:23:29,465 --> 00:23:31,065
- There's nothing, right?
- Nothing.

522
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:32,135
- Gosh.
- Let's go now.

523
00:23:32,136 --> 00:23:35,265
- There's no suspense about it.
- Let's call it a day.

524
00:23:35,465 --> 00:23:38,075
(Giggling)

525
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:39,575
It's the same.

526
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:41,204
- There's nothing.
- Let's go.

527
00:23:41,205 --> 00:23:42,245
Let's go.

528
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:43,974
(Shocked)

529
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:45,215
Let's go.

530
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:47,945
It's all right.

531
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:52,185
How come we haven't caught one?

532
00:23:52,856 --> 00:23:55,855
Are there any fish here?

533
00:23:55,856 --> 00:23:56,954
(Playing at 30x speed)

534
00:23:56,955 --> 00:24:00,995
(Astonishingly, there was none.)

535
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:05,336
(They leave the front yard with the view of Mount Jiri.)

536
00:24:07,396 --> 00:24:08,464
Let's go.

537
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:12,174
(House on Wheels is heading to a new front yard.)

538
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:13,175
I'm excited.

539
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:16,776
(Expectant)

540
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:20,646
(They're all excited to set off.)

541
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:23,885
(What will be today's new front yard...)

542
00:24:23,886 --> 00:24:25,355
There are so many beautiful places in Korea.

543
00:24:25,356 --> 00:24:27,886
(where they will make memories together?)

544
00:24:30,155 --> 00:24:36,796
(Hadong, South Gyeongsang Province)

545
00:24:37,326 --> 00:24:40,866
(Surrounded by Seomjin River)

546
00:24:41,265 --> 00:24:44,435
(South Sea spreads widely from below.)

547
00:24:45,106 --> 00:24:47,535
(It is beautifully embroidered...)

548
00:24:47,536 --> 00:24:50,606
(along the hillsides of Mount Jiri.)

549
00:24:51,475 --> 00:24:54,376
(Greenish wild green tea fields)

550
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:57,545
(There are lots of fresh foods...)

551
00:24:57,546 --> 00:25:00,055
(from Seomjin River.)

552
00:25:00,056 --> 00:25:02,184
(Mitten crab)

553
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:04,896
(Densely lamellated oyster)

554
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:09,126
(Today's front yard is Hadong.)

555
00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:12,194
(On the way to our new front yard,)

556
00:25:12,195 --> 00:25:13,234
(there's a gift from Dong Il.)

557
00:25:13,235 --> 00:25:16,106
- We'll make fond memories.
- My gosh.

558
00:25:16,705 --> 00:25:18,004
It sounds fun.

559
00:25:18,005 --> 00:25:19,904
(Last front yard, Mount Geumo zipline)

560
00:25:19,905 --> 00:25:21,235
I'm so excited.

561
00:25:22,505 --> 00:25:25,616
(As they drove in a flutter...)

562
00:25:26,546 --> 00:25:29,346
- I think we arrived.
- We're here.

563
00:25:31,116 --> 00:25:33,855
Now it feels like we're on a trip.

564
00:25:33,856 --> 00:25:34,886
I know, right?

565
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:36,526
Hurray!

566
00:25:37,755 --> 00:25:40,755
(The way to enjoy Hadong to its fullest)

567
00:25:42,526 --> 00:25:43,694
(Enjoying the thrill of sliding through the wind)

568
00:25:43,695 --> 00:25:45,066
Aren't you going too fast?

569
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:50,205
(Taking in the view of blue South Sea)

570
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:54,535
It's the longest zipline in Korea.

571
00:25:54,536 --> 00:25:57,046
(It's 3,186m in total, the longest in Asia.)

572
00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:59,545
- We might see Hee Won cry again.
- Are you talking about me?

573
00:25:59,546 --> 00:26:01,485
(They're going to have a memorable experience just as paragliding.)

574
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:03,085
Can you ride it, Hee Won?

575
00:26:03,086 --> 00:26:04,615
Of course, I can.

576
00:26:04,616 --> 00:26:06,386
(Of course, I can.)

577
00:26:06,485 --> 00:26:07,615
Hello.

578
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,184
(Safely filmed according to the COVID safety regulations.)

579
00:26:09,185 --> 00:26:10,685
Sanitize your hands.

580
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,754
Do we have to weigh ourselves?

581
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:14,964
(Checking weight for a safe ride)

582
00:26:14,965 --> 00:26:16,224
Large.

583
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:18,896
- I see. It shows your size.
- Right, approximately.

584
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,365
Wear it as you wear a backpack.

585
00:26:21,366 --> 00:26:23,264
It's yellow and black.

586
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:24,705
(Wearing safety equipment like a backpack)

587
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:27,375
(Looks determined)

588
00:26:27,376 --> 00:26:28,445
We have to go up by car.

589
00:26:28,905 --> 00:26:30,975
Will it take about 20 minutes by car?

590
00:26:31,245 --> 00:26:32,745
20 minutes from now?

591
00:26:32,975 --> 00:26:34,475
Shall I set off?

592
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:35,646
Yes.

593
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:38,754
It'll be such a good memory.

594
00:26:38,755 --> 00:26:40,285
It's so fun to ride a zipline.

595
00:26:40,286 --> 00:26:41,826
Gosh, I'm excited.

596
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:46,155
It'll also make me feel like I'm flying.

597
00:26:47,556 --> 00:26:48,924
Have you ever done paragliding before?

598
00:26:48,925 --> 00:26:50,125
No, I haven't.

599
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:51,735
You must try it.

600
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:55,536
- But you cried.
- Right, it was worth it.

601
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:59,305
I want to go paragliding.

602
00:26:59,306 --> 00:27:01,646
Paragliding is mind-blowing.

603
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:04,204
Hee Won will have one more thing to brag about now.

604
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,376
"You guys should ride a zipline."

605
00:27:06,475 --> 00:27:09,185
(Hee Won has gained another experience.)

606
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:11,484
We're going up.

607
00:27:11,485 --> 00:27:13,954
(Meanwhile, the car is heading to the summit of Mount Geumo.)

608
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:15,286
I'm nervous too.

609
00:27:15,455 --> 00:27:17,425
I think it'll be a bit scary.

610
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:19,595
(Riding a zipline seems scary.)

611
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,096
But I think it'll be fun.

612
00:27:21,195 --> 00:27:23,425
We'll feel cool as we go down on it.

613
00:27:23,896 --> 00:27:26,566
Byoung Cheol will have the brightest look on his face.

614
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:28,636
(Will I?)

615
00:27:29,336 --> 00:27:30,366
(Like this.)

616
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:32,336
(Chuckling)

617
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:38,646
(He's going to be extremely happy.)

618
00:27:39,076 --> 00:27:41,646
(I can't wait to get there.)

619
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:46,885
- Gosh, it's high.
- Look, we came up so high.

620
00:27:46,886 --> 00:27:48,654
It's good to be up this high.

621
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:50,325
- My gosh.
- We came up high already.

622
00:27:50,326 --> 00:27:52,355
How high is it here?

623
00:27:52,356 --> 00:27:56,425
It's 849m at the summit.

624
00:27:56,765 --> 00:27:58,235
It's so high.

625
00:27:59,366 --> 00:28:01,465
Right, it feels like we're going up endlessly.

626
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:04,606
It feels higher than 800m.

627
00:28:04,735 --> 00:28:08,075
- Gosh, this is...
- My goodness.

628
00:28:08,076 --> 00:28:09,974
(The road goes round in a tight curve as they go up.)

629
00:28:09,975 --> 00:28:12,646
Gosh, it's a good thing that we ate our breakfast early.

630
00:28:14,816 --> 00:28:15,984
(Swaying)

631
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,116
This is more thrilling than the zipline.

632
00:28:18,586 --> 00:28:19,985
(Glancing)

633
00:28:20,286 --> 00:28:22,086
(It is high indeed.)

634
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:26,526
(Grabbing with both hands)

635
00:28:27,755 --> 00:28:29,995
(Closing eyes at the dizzy height)

636
00:28:30,695 --> 00:28:33,896
(The car goes up as if there's no end.)

637
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:36,636
Oh, dear.

638
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:41,474
Oh, dear. I'm scared.

639
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:43,175
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

640
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:45,375
It's too high.

641
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:46,474
(They arrived at the summit of Mount Geumo at an altitude of 849m.)

642
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,115
(Boarding area for the zipline)

643
00:28:48,116 --> 00:28:49,586
Can you ride it, Hee Won?

644
00:28:49,915 --> 00:28:52,455
Now that I'm here, I'm getting nervous.

645
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:54,816
(Laughing)

646
00:28:54,955 --> 00:28:57,055
It would've been hard for you to come all the way here.

647
00:28:57,056 --> 00:28:58,995
- It was fun.
- Right.

648
00:28:59,425 --> 00:29:02,896
Gosh, how could they build this place here?

649
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:04,895
(Exclaiming)

650
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:08,036
- Goodness, it's so magnificent.
- It's so beautiful.

651
00:29:08,306 --> 00:29:10,636
(They're all gaping at...)

652
00:29:11,205 --> 00:29:13,135
(the beautiful scenery of Mount Geumo...)

653
00:29:13,136 --> 00:29:16,376
(that spreads beneath them.)

654
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:20,244
(And over the Mount Geumo,)

655
00:29:20,245 --> 00:29:24,316
(you can admire the view of blue South Sea.)

656
00:29:26,185 --> 00:29:29,625
(You can enjoy the cool winds...)

657
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:34,495
(and the magnificent scenery of Hadong at the same time.)

658
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:39,434
(We've arrived at the summit of Mount Geumo.)

659
00:29:39,435 --> 00:29:40,795
It feels like we're above the sky.

660
00:29:40,796 --> 00:29:43,505
- Like floating on clouds.
- Right.

661
00:29:45,175 --> 00:29:46,435
How nice.

662
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:49,974
We're going to take this to go down.

663
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:52,776
(After admiring the scenery, they noticed the zipline.)

664
00:29:53,215 --> 00:29:54,575
You'll ride in pairs.

665
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:56,115
- I see.
- One person has to ride alone.

666
00:29:56,116 --> 00:29:58,185
The bravest person can ride alone.

667
00:29:59,485 --> 00:30:01,586
I'll ride it alone then.

668
00:30:02,155 --> 00:30:05,355
So you think you're the bravest of us all?

669
00:30:05,356 --> 00:30:07,195
(That's not what I meant.)

670
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,895
Instead, I'll go last.

671
00:30:09,896 --> 00:30:13,165
I'll decide between the car and the zipline later.

672
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,435
(Byoung Cheol, goodness.)

673
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:18,005
- You two will go first.
- Okay.

674
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:20,306
(Extremely nervous)

675
00:30:21,235 --> 00:30:23,475
(It's quite high. Are we going to be okay?)

676
00:30:24,705 --> 00:30:26,576
- Are we going to ride it now?
- Yes.

677
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,645
- Please step on it.
- Okay.

678
00:30:28,646 --> 00:30:30,786
(Si Wan and Yoon A are getting ready to take the zipline.)

679
00:30:30,886 --> 00:30:33,316
(Distant)

680
00:30:33,856 --> 00:30:34,954
(She can't help but laugh at the dizzy height.)

681
00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:36,885
- Are you okay, Si Wan?
- Hold the line lightly.

682
00:30:36,886 --> 00:30:39,026
- I don't feel anything yet.
- Yes.

683
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:42,225
But if it's too fast...

684
00:30:42,326 --> 00:30:43,895
Now please sit down slowly.

685
00:30:43,896 --> 00:30:47,796
How about the one who makes a sound...

686
00:30:47,995 --> 00:30:49,335
buys something delicious?

687
00:30:49,336 --> 00:30:50,904
- So we shouldn't make a sound.
- Right.

688
00:30:50,905 --> 00:30:52,905
- Okay, without a sound.
- Yes.

689
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:55,575
- We're not going to make a sound?
- Lean back comfortably.

690
00:30:55,576 --> 00:30:56,805
(Laughing)

691
00:30:56,806 --> 00:30:58,646
Get ready. Ready!

692
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:00,776
(With a thud)

693
00:31:00,915 --> 00:31:03,285
- Ready!
- What's this? My goodness.

694
00:31:03,286 --> 00:31:05,086
- You made a sound.
- Already?

695
00:31:05,386 --> 00:31:06,754
(Si Wan already made a sound.)

696
00:31:06,755 --> 00:31:08,214
- He made a sound.
- That was level one.

697
00:31:08,215 --> 00:31:09,526
He's out.

698
00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:11,525
- Yoon A, I was startled.
- I won't make any sound.

699
00:31:11,526 --> 00:31:12,555
(Embarrassed)

700
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:14,155
I won't make any sound.

701
00:31:15,366 --> 00:31:17,596
My gosh, I thought it would start abruptly.

702
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,565
(A deep breath)

703
00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:24,865
- Let's go.
- Are we going? Okay.

704
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:27,004
Enjoy the cool wind.

705
00:31:27,005 --> 00:31:28,204
(Extremely nervous)

706
00:31:28,205 --> 00:31:31,645
- She's covering her mouth.
- In 3, 2, 1.

707
00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:33,146
Go!

708
00:31:34,015 --> 00:31:35,816
(Si Wan and Yoon A go first.)

709
00:31:37,586 --> 00:31:40,115
(Sliding down along the hillside)

710
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:41,924
Gosh, this is so fun!

711
00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:43,356
Go!

712
00:31:43,755 --> 00:31:46,255
(Exclaiming)

713
00:31:46,396 --> 00:31:47,755
Go!

714
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,836
Gosh, this is so fun!

715
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:56,434
Gosh, this is so fun!

716
00:31:56,435 --> 00:31:58,036
She said it's so fun.

717
00:31:59,005 --> 00:32:01,405
(Highly excited)

718
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:03,945
It's too fast.

719
00:32:04,606 --> 00:32:07,014
- Yoon A!
- My gosh, amazing!

720
00:32:07,015 --> 00:32:08,546
(Remarkable speed)

721
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:13,514
- Gosh, this is too fast.
- My goodness.

722
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,254
(Flying the sky in the zipline)

723
00:32:15,255 --> 00:32:18,896
(Feeling the cool air with the whole body)

724
00:32:19,925 --> 00:32:23,366
(Turning around because of the high speed)

725
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:26,935
(She holds the helmet in case it will be blown away.)

726
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:34,075
(Feeling at ease on the zipline,)

727
00:32:34,076 --> 00:32:38,646
(it feels like they're flying in the sky.)

728
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:44,015
(Exclaiming)

729
00:32:45,886 --> 00:32:48,485
(Bursts into laughter)

730
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:52,695
My goodness. This is amazing.

731
00:32:53,995 --> 00:32:56,565
(The cool wind and the speed...)

732
00:32:56,566 --> 00:33:00,066
(refresh their hearts.)

733
00:33:01,136 --> 00:33:03,405
(Exclaiming in excitement)

734
00:33:05,636 --> 00:33:09,175
(It's so cool.)

735
00:33:09,705 --> 00:33:10,904
(Chuckling)

736
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,015
It's exciting.

737
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:17,685
- It's so exciting.
- I can't help screaming. It's fun.

738
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,154
(Their first flight was a success.)

739
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:23,224
- Please hold the line.
- Should I hold the line?

740
00:33:23,225 --> 00:33:24,825
- Yes.
- Watch your head.

741
00:33:24,826 --> 00:33:26,825
- Okay.
- Thank you.

742
00:33:26,826 --> 00:33:28,194
My legs are trembling.

743
00:33:28,195 --> 00:33:30,565
- I screamed because it was so fun.
- Wasn't it fun?

744
00:33:30,566 --> 00:33:31,725
I know.

745
00:33:31,896 --> 00:33:33,795
- My body was fluttering.
- I know, right?

746
00:33:33,796 --> 00:33:35,304
- Didn't you spin?
- Right. I saw you spinning too.

747
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,465
Right?

748
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:38,804
So I speeded up like this.

749
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:39,876
(Chattering on like kids)

750
00:33:40,106 --> 00:33:42,876
- It's exciting. It's really fast.
- It was so fun.

751
00:33:43,546 --> 00:33:45,675
(Meanwhile, older brothers are...)

752
00:33:45,676 --> 00:33:49,245
I think one of us will pass out.

753
00:33:49,345 --> 00:33:50,586
- Why?
- Out of fright.

754
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:53,014
(Depressed)

755
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:55,954
- Okay, let's go.
- Yes.

756
00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:58,385
You and I have been together for over 100 years.

757
00:33:58,555 --> 00:34:00,696
It's our first time in 100 years.

758
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:03,995
(Go down safely.)

759
00:34:04,696 --> 00:34:06,764
- Should I go here?
- Yes. Go up a step, please.

760
00:34:06,765 --> 00:34:09,135
- My legs are already shaking.
- Please stand still.

761
00:34:09,906 --> 00:34:12,035
(Dong Il gets nervous too.)

762
00:34:12,836 --> 00:34:15,135
(Is Hee Won okay?)

763
00:34:15,506 --> 00:34:18,244
- How can I do this?
- You can turn to the side.

764
00:34:18,245 --> 00:34:19,875
- Like this?
- Yes, to the side.

765
00:34:19,876 --> 00:34:21,575
- I see. Like this?
- That's right.

766
00:34:22,946 --> 00:34:25,515
Look, he's already nervous.

767
00:34:25,615 --> 00:34:27,055
(Touching)

768
00:34:27,156 --> 00:34:29,985
- Is it safe?
- It's very safe.

769
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:32,055
(Don't worry too much.)

770
00:34:32,396 --> 00:34:34,126
Are you ready to go now?

771
00:34:34,225 --> 00:34:35,256
Yes.

772
00:34:35,396 --> 00:34:36,695
Are you ready to go now?

773
00:34:36,696 --> 00:34:38,126
- Yes.
- Yes.

774
00:34:38,796 --> 00:34:40,735
- Stretch your legs.
- Oh, really?

775
00:34:40,736 --> 00:34:42,935
Yes. 3, 2, 1.

776
00:34:43,205 --> 00:34:44,435
Go!

777
00:34:46,106 --> 00:34:48,406
(Descending into the distant forest)

778
00:34:49,006 --> 00:34:50,276
Go!

779
00:34:52,415 --> 00:34:53,415
(Exclaiming)

780
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:55,845
(Exclaiming in excitement)

781
00:34:56,646 --> 00:34:57,845
(Excited)

782
00:35:00,285 --> 00:35:03,655
(Letting out a loud roar)

783
00:35:03,656 --> 00:35:05,285
Great!

784
00:35:07,156 --> 00:35:12,236
(They slide over the mountain.)

785
00:35:15,035 --> 00:35:16,634
- Great!
- My goodness.

786
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:18,566
(Excited)

787
00:35:19,106 --> 00:35:21,336
(Screaming)

788
00:35:21,435 --> 00:35:23,345
(His jacket is inflated with the wind.)

789
00:35:24,006 --> 00:35:25,075
They started.

790
00:35:26,146 --> 00:35:27,546
Oh, there they are.

791
00:35:28,816 --> 00:35:31,515
(Welcome!)

792
00:35:32,086 --> 00:35:34,055
Hee Won!

793
00:35:35,086 --> 00:35:36,785
(Calling out Hee Won while holding his helmet)

794
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,994
(Closing his eyes tight)

795
00:35:38,995 --> 00:35:40,756
(The speed is too high for him to open his eyes.)

796
00:35:41,495 --> 00:35:44,465
(As you slide down along the hillside,)

797
00:35:44,466 --> 00:35:49,305
(it feels like you're running in the sky.)

798
00:35:51,336 --> 00:35:53,276
(Exciting!)

799
00:35:53,575 --> 00:35:55,035
(Laughing)

800
00:35:55,705 --> 00:35:58,406
(It's impressive all the way down.)

801
00:36:01,276 --> 00:36:02,284
(Satisfied)

802
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,646
Amazing.

803
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,316
Dong Il, it's really fun.

804
00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:11,125
- So good.
- Let's get going.

805
00:36:11,126 --> 00:36:12,926
This is so cool.

806
00:36:14,095 --> 00:36:15,195
Let's go.

807
00:36:15,196 --> 00:36:17,126
- He looks like he's swimming.
- Oh, my gosh.

808
00:36:17,526 --> 00:36:18,864
Let's get going.

809
00:36:18,865 --> 00:36:20,796
(Sliding through the wind, Dong Il has safely arrived.)

810
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:24,066
(Hee Won also landed safely.)

811
00:36:25,506 --> 00:36:27,506
Dong Il, this is so much fun.

812
00:36:28,776 --> 00:36:29,844
- It's cool.
- Isn't it fun?

813
00:36:29,845 --> 00:36:31,074
- Isn't it thrilling?
- Yes.

814
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:32,216
- So fun.
- It was fun.

815
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:36,215
- This is very fun.
- He was late.

816
00:36:36,216 --> 00:36:38,585
I kept my legs stretched out.

817
00:36:38,586 --> 00:36:40,784
- Did you do that?
- This is extremely fun.

818
00:36:40,785 --> 00:36:41,856
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

819
00:36:42,256 --> 00:36:44,825
I was wondering when you two screamed.

820
00:36:45,156 --> 00:36:47,256
- I screamed as it's so fun.
- I know.

821
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:48,994
(Laughing)

822
00:36:48,995 --> 00:36:51,795
Okay. Shall we go to the car now?

823
00:36:51,796 --> 00:36:53,296
(Shall we go to the car and not ride this?)

824
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:57,705
(He must be more nervous alone.)

825
00:36:59,106 --> 00:37:00,336
It's 1, 2, 3.

826
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,775
(Thud)

827
00:37:01,776 --> 00:37:03,245
(Laughing)

828
00:37:04,446 --> 00:37:06,845
Have fun and release your stress.

829
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:07,974
I will. Thank you.

830
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,816
It's 3, 2, 1.

831
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:13,385
Say, "hooray."

832
00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:15,656
Hooray!

833
00:37:16,426 --> 00:37:17,526
(Laughing)

834
00:37:19,325 --> 00:37:22,595
(Byoung Cheol slides down relaxed, unlike others.)

835
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:26,896
(Good)

836
00:37:27,535 --> 00:37:29,466
- Isn't Byoung Cheol coming?
- Is Byoung Cheol coming?

837
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:31,105
Where is he coming from?

838
00:37:31,106 --> 00:37:32,534
- Goodness.
- Right there.

839
00:37:32,535 --> 00:37:33,804
- Which side is it?
- He's coming over there.

840
00:37:33,805 --> 00:37:35,975
Isn't he really fast, though?

841
00:37:36,075 --> 00:37:37,304
- It's the left.
- Is he coming?

842
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:39,275
- Over there, on the right.
- He's there.

843
00:37:39,276 --> 00:37:40,575
- The black dot.
- On the left lane.

844
00:37:41,716 --> 00:37:44,285
(Byoung Cheol is sliding alone.)

845
00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:47,515
(It's nice sunshine.)

846
00:37:48,415 --> 00:37:51,126
(Although the speed is very high,)

847
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:53,155
(he looks over here,)

848
00:37:53,156 --> 00:37:54,196
(there,)

849
00:37:54,296 --> 00:37:56,495
(and up,)

850
00:37:56,995 --> 00:37:58,865
(Byoung Cheol is enjoying the moments.)

851
00:37:59,836 --> 00:38:02,035
He looks very comfortable.

852
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:04,035
He's just lying straight there.

853
00:38:05,676 --> 00:38:06,775
Please hold the line.

854
00:38:06,776 --> 00:38:07,776
(He's stretched out straight.)

855
00:38:07,975 --> 00:38:08,975
It will be bumpy.

856
00:38:09,975 --> 00:38:11,006
Welcome.

857
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:12,414
Hello.

858
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,575
(Hello, everyone.)

859
00:38:13,716 --> 00:38:15,146
- Well done.
- How was it?

860
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:16,684
It was fun.

861
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:18,585
- Isn't it?
- Yes. It feels cool too.

862
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:20,554
- It was easy.
- Don't you feel fresh?

863
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:22,555
- Yes.
- That's amazing.

864
00:38:23,356 --> 00:38:25,756
It's time to move. Let's go.

865
00:38:26,156 --> 00:38:27,655
This one is long.

866
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:29,494
It is very long.

867
00:38:29,495 --> 00:38:30,724
It is long.

868
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,295
(The longest course to enjoy the scenery of the archipelago)

869
00:38:32,296 --> 00:38:34,035
- Shall we go first?
- Okay. Let's go first.

870
00:38:34,435 --> 00:38:36,066
(Dong Il and Hee Won ride it first.)

871
00:38:36,506 --> 00:38:38,034
Now, I feel...

872
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:40,705
comfortable to come up here.

873
00:38:42,135 --> 00:38:43,745
(Bump)

874
00:38:44,446 --> 00:38:45,945
I said, "Let's fixate it."

875
00:38:45,946 --> 00:38:47,344
Please hold the line.

876
00:38:47,345 --> 00:38:50,085
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

877
00:38:50,086 --> 00:38:52,985
- It's the longest course. Go!
- Yes.

878
00:38:52,986 --> 00:38:54,555
(Dong Il departs the longest course after getting prepared.)

879
00:38:54,756 --> 00:38:56,986
Hee Won!

880
00:38:57,086 --> 00:38:58,086
Go!

881
00:38:59,455 --> 00:39:01,725
(Dong Il departs comfortably shouting the brother's name.)

882
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:04,094
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hee Won!

883
00:39:04,095 --> 00:39:05,196
(Oh, my gosh! Goodness.)

884
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:07,566
(Laughing)

885
00:39:07,836 --> 00:39:09,204
Hee Won!

886
00:39:09,205 --> 00:39:12,066
(They are excited.)

887
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:16,106
I find it relaxing.

888
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,244
Now I feel comfortable.

889
00:39:19,245 --> 00:39:21,745
(It's comfortable as the speed is lower than the previous.)

890
00:39:24,216 --> 00:39:29,586
(They are enjoying the spring breeze.)

891
00:39:33,725 --> 00:39:37,224
(With the two arms wide open,)

892
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:41,566
(they are enjoying the silence of the mountain.)

893
00:39:42,765 --> 00:39:45,105
(Over Mount Geumo,)

894
00:39:45,106 --> 00:39:48,075
(the South Sea starts to appear.)

895
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:50,446
Hee Won, the view is so great.

896
00:39:50,776 --> 00:39:52,345
(My goodness)

897
00:39:53,845 --> 00:39:56,486
(Oh, my...)

898
00:39:59,785 --> 00:40:04,884
(Blue ocean is spread below the feet.)

899
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:08,756
(The islands are like gems.)

900
00:40:10,865 --> 00:40:15,664
(As if they have promised,)

901
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:19,135
(both are looking at the scenery silently.)

902
00:40:21,575 --> 00:40:23,546
Dong Il, it's so nice here.

903
00:40:26,646 --> 00:40:28,744
(Yoon A is also sliding...)

904
00:40:28,745 --> 00:40:31,086
(with the breeze.)

905
00:40:31,685 --> 00:40:35,014
(My gosh)

906
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,185
It's beautiful.

907
00:40:36,955 --> 00:40:40,895
(The greenery of the mountain...)

908
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,164
Oh, my gosh. It's so beautiful.

909
00:40:43,165 --> 00:40:45,426
(and the sky blue ocean make the magnificent scenery.)

910
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:49,606
(Staring)

911
00:40:51,305 --> 00:40:53,675
(The beautiful scenery...)

912
00:40:53,676 --> 00:40:57,575
(before the eyes draws all the attention.)

913
00:40:59,316 --> 00:41:00,574
(Byoung Cheol, on the other hand, slides down relaxed.)

914
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:03,085
It's Hallyeohaesang National Marine Park.

915
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:06,655
A number of islands are located in the ocean.

916
00:41:06,656 --> 00:41:07,955
(Official reporter of House on Wheels?)

917
00:41:08,486 --> 00:41:10,425
As I look down there,

918
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,926
right next to the ocean,

919
00:41:12,156 --> 00:41:14,995
fields and paddies are located.

920
00:41:16,026 --> 00:41:17,395
Hallyeosudo looks...

921
00:41:17,396 --> 00:41:20,735
like an Ink wash painting,

922
00:41:20,736 --> 00:41:22,905
and it's very beautiful.

923
00:41:22,906 --> 00:41:24,135
(He doesn't lose his elegance in 800m above.)

924
00:41:24,506 --> 00:41:26,506
(It's already close to the destination.)

925
00:41:26,805 --> 00:41:28,405
(Before letting it go,)

926
00:41:28,406 --> 00:41:31,906
(let's take commemorative photos.)

927
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:35,445
(While sliding down excitedly,)

928
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:36,845
(Dong Il takes poses.)

929
00:41:37,816 --> 00:41:40,055
(Its title is, "I hug Hadong into my arms.")

930
00:41:40,685 --> 00:41:41,856
(Hee Won also takes his poses.)

931
00:41:42,885 --> 00:41:45,896
(The title is, "Zipline is a must. It's so good.")

932
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:48,756
(Laughing)

933
00:41:50,225 --> 00:41:51,594
Hello.

934
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:52,665
(Yoon A is too shy to take poses.)

935
00:41:53,435 --> 00:41:55,336
"House on Wheels."

936
00:41:56,435 --> 00:41:57,864
(She makes House on Wheels with her two arms together.)

937
00:41:57,865 --> 00:42:01,175
Did you recognize it? It's House on Wheels.

938
00:42:01,176 --> 00:42:02,475
(Did you recognize my House on Wheels?)

939
00:42:02,805 --> 00:42:04,906
- Did you do that on your way?
- Yes.

940
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,646
(This is how Si Wan poses.)

941
00:42:10,046 --> 00:42:11,215
Did they take photos of me?

942
00:42:11,216 --> 00:42:12,216
(Its title is, "Fell into the beauty of Hadong.")

943
00:42:13,856 --> 00:42:15,486
(Byoung Cheol comes in a modest pose.)

944
00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:19,224
It's so cute. Did you see the photo of him?

945
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:21,796
You're not supposed to be that cute in photos.

946
00:42:22,055 --> 00:42:23,224
Would I look cute indeed?

947
00:42:23,225 --> 00:42:24,525
You are cute.

948
00:42:24,526 --> 00:42:25,796
- Would I look cute?
- You're cute.

949
00:42:26,095 --> 00:42:28,395
I enjoyed it thanks to you.

950
00:42:28,396 --> 00:42:29,605
I had so much fun.

951
00:42:29,606 --> 00:42:32,506
This was the best of this trip. It was fun.

952
00:42:33,906 --> 00:42:36,406
(This will be a precious memory for a long time.)

953
00:42:37,046 --> 00:42:40,345
It was a memorable trip, wasn't it?

954
00:42:40,546 --> 00:42:43,015
- Hadong's zipwire.
- Wire.

955
00:42:43,586 --> 00:42:48,156
(The members are on a new journey to the next front yard.)

956
00:42:48,656 --> 00:42:50,325
- I had fun, really.
- Zipwire.

957
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:52,526
(This time, they go deep into Hadong.)

958
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:55,926
(They drive along the Seomjin riverside.)

959
00:42:56,265 --> 00:42:58,566
(Expectant)

960
00:43:01,935 --> 00:43:04,135
Is the river on the left Seomjin River?

961
00:43:04,236 --> 00:43:06,875
- Look at that.
- Oh, my gosh. That is...

962
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,975
- It's very beautiful.
- It's cool.

963
00:43:09,606 --> 00:43:12,375
- Seomjin River road.
- It's beautiful.

964
00:43:12,376 --> 00:43:13,376
(It's today's fellow traveler to guide the members to the yard.)

965
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,815
The water is...

966
00:43:15,816 --> 00:43:17,185
(Seomjin River, the cleanest water in Korea.)

967
00:43:18,385 --> 00:43:20,855
(Its water even cleans out people's minds.)

968
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:22,856
Byoung Cheol, look how clean the water is.

969
00:43:23,486 --> 00:43:25,825
I can see through the bottom.

970
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:29,126
Jeolla Province and Gyeongsang Province are...

971
00:43:29,296 --> 00:43:31,925
divided by the Seomjin River line.

972
00:43:31,926 --> 00:43:33,896
(Amazed)

973
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:37,164
Between Jeolla Province and Gyeongsang Province, right?

974
00:43:37,165 --> 00:43:38,205
(South Jeolla Province, South Gyeongsang Province, Seomjin River,)

975
00:43:38,435 --> 00:43:40,836
- It's amazing.
- It is, indeed.

976
00:43:41,236 --> 00:43:43,776
(Seomjin River)

977
00:43:44,745 --> 00:43:46,975
(I can't stop looking at it.)

978
00:43:47,615 --> 00:43:51,086
(Route 19, along the Seomjin riverside)

979
00:43:51,946 --> 00:43:54,455
- It's also beautiful here.
- Right.

980
00:43:55,685 --> 00:43:57,284
Look at the tall trees.

981
00:43:57,285 --> 00:43:58,285
(A woody pine forest)

982
00:43:58,986 --> 00:44:00,094
(A sandy beach with various living things)

983
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,396
This is cool.

984
00:44:02,566 --> 00:44:03,795
It's sandy here.

985
00:44:03,796 --> 00:44:05,896
(Unspoiled clean nature)

986
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:07,396
(Byoung Cheol can't take his eye off of it.)

987
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:08,435
It's amazing.

988
00:44:09,365 --> 00:44:11,565
Dong Il, isn't this beautiful too?

989
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:14,405
Dong Il, the land here must be fertile, right?

990
00:44:14,406 --> 00:44:15,875
It must be very fertile.

991
00:44:15,876 --> 00:44:17,245
(Fields in Pyeongsa-ri are green with the water from Seomjin River.)

992
00:44:19,415 --> 00:44:20,844
It's really beautiful.

993
00:44:20,845 --> 00:44:21,945
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes.

994
00:44:21,946 --> 00:44:23,046
It's so beautiful.

995
00:44:23,685 --> 00:44:25,785
Why haven't I known this place before?

996
00:44:26,055 --> 00:44:27,685
There are many beautiful places in Korea.

997
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:31,684
Korea is a beautiful country.

998
00:44:31,685 --> 00:44:34,495
(Seomjin River, our treasure, is more beautiful in person.)

999
00:44:37,126 --> 00:44:38,665
What is that?

1000
00:44:39,865 --> 00:44:41,736
(Magnificent scenery is not done yet?)

1001
00:44:41,966 --> 00:44:43,966
Look over there.

1002
00:44:44,066 --> 00:44:45,465
My gosh. Look at that.

1003
00:44:45,466 --> 00:44:48,276
I prepared cherry blossoms for you.

1004
00:44:48,376 --> 00:44:51,046
- There are so many.
- On both sides. Look at that!

1005
00:44:51,446 --> 00:44:52,446
(My goodness)

1006
00:44:53,345 --> 00:44:55,375
(The highlight of Route 19)

1007
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:56,845
Cherry blossoms start from here.

1008
00:44:57,816 --> 00:44:59,816
(What is up here?)

1009
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:01,954
(The cherry trees are filled on both sides of our house.)

1010
00:45:01,955 --> 00:45:04,824
- This is wonderful.
- It's pretty.

1011
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:06,856
(The roads are painted in pink in spring.)

1012
00:45:08,296 --> 00:45:10,896
(It's the most beautiful road in this season in Korea.)

1013
00:45:12,595 --> 00:45:13,994
It's beautiful.

1014
00:45:13,995 --> 00:45:15,535
(It's so beautiful.)

1015
00:45:15,836 --> 00:45:17,506
What should I do?

1016
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:23,345
(House on Wheels is joining this endless pink wave.)

1017
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,376
It almost looks like it's snowing.

1018
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:29,785
It looks like snow, snowflakes.

1019
00:45:31,015 --> 00:45:32,885
(Cherry blossoms flutter like snow.)

1020
00:45:33,455 --> 00:45:36,125
I'm enjoying cherry blossoms to the fullest.

1021
00:45:36,126 --> 00:45:37,426
That sounds right.

1022
00:45:38,285 --> 00:45:42,825
(It's irresistible beautiful scenery.)

1023
00:45:44,066 --> 00:45:46,595
(So amazing)

1024
00:45:47,665 --> 00:45:51,805
(Welcome to the cherry blossom kingdom in Hadong.)

1025
00:45:52,705 --> 00:45:55,835
(It's time to meet today's front yard.)

1026
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,805
There's a traditional market in Hadong.

1027
00:45:58,946 --> 00:46:01,216
It's one of the top markets in Korea.

1028
00:46:01,475 --> 00:46:02,946
What's the market?

1029
00:46:03,146 --> 00:46:04,646
- It's Hwagae Market.
- Hwagae Market.

1030
00:46:04,816 --> 00:46:05,844
- Hwagae Market.
- Jeolla and Gyeongsang Province.

1031
00:46:05,845 --> 00:46:06,914
(Jeolla and Gyeongsang Province...)

1032
00:46:06,915 --> 00:46:07,985
Do you mean that Hwagae Market?

1033
00:46:07,986 --> 00:46:09,184
- Yes.
- The song title, "Hwagae Market"

1034
00:46:09,185 --> 00:46:10,725
(Was that Hwagae Market here?)

1035
00:46:10,856 --> 00:46:13,195
Byoung Cheol and I will take a taxi...

1036
00:46:13,196 --> 00:46:15,255
after we buy...

1037
00:46:15,256 --> 00:46:17,365
some delicious things to eat.

1038
00:46:17,595 --> 00:46:20,095
- Isn't it known for marsh clam?
- It's known for it.

1039
00:46:20,165 --> 00:46:21,566
Marsh clam soup would...

1040
00:46:22,135 --> 00:46:23,736
I think the food in Namhae is delicious.

1041
00:46:23,836 --> 00:46:26,006
The land is good in Namhae.

1042
00:46:28,575 --> 00:46:30,204
Is this the market?

1043
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:31,646
It's nice.

1044
00:46:31,776 --> 00:46:32,844
We will go grocery shopping.

1045
00:46:32,845 --> 00:46:34,045
- Have a nice shopping trip.
- Okay.

1046
00:46:34,046 --> 00:46:35,146
Have a nice one.

1047
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,315
The reflection of the sunlight is beautiful.

1048
00:46:37,316 --> 00:46:39,355
(It's perfect weather to go to a traditional market.)

1049
00:46:39,356 --> 00:46:40,385
(Hwagae market)

1050
00:46:40,486 --> 00:46:41,585
Hwagae market.

1051
00:46:41,586 --> 00:46:44,055
(Welcome)

1052
00:46:45,526 --> 00:46:46,995
Have you been to this Hadong market?

1053
00:46:47,796 --> 00:46:49,125
- It's my first time.
- For real?

1054
00:46:49,126 --> 00:46:50,225
Yes.

1055
00:46:50,365 --> 00:46:52,625
- Isn't it cozy like the old days?
- Yes.

1056
00:46:52,626 --> 00:46:57,506
(Hwagae market, full of coziness)

1057
00:46:57,935 --> 00:47:00,876
There are so many things to eat.

1058
00:47:01,836 --> 00:47:02,875
That one? I see.

1059
00:47:02,876 --> 00:47:04,105
(Various vegetables from Mount Jiri)

1060
00:47:04,106 --> 00:47:05,845
It's so great here.

1061
00:47:06,345 --> 00:47:09,074
(It's full of fresh seafood...)

1062
00:47:09,075 --> 00:47:11,586
(from the clean Seomjin River.)

1063
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,784
(Here's what caught Dong Il's eyes.)

1064
00:47:12,785 --> 00:47:14,115
What are the fries?

1065
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,725
- It's fried sweetfish.
- Sweetfish!

1066
00:47:17,385 --> 00:47:19,185
Sweetfish is bigger than I thought.

1067
00:47:20,095 --> 00:47:21,926
Sweetfish lives only in the cleanest water.

1068
00:47:22,495 --> 00:47:24,525
It smells like watermelon.

1069
00:47:24,526 --> 00:47:26,495
(The sweetfish smells like watermelon.)

1070
00:47:26,765 --> 00:47:29,295
If there is trimmed marsh clam...

1071
00:47:29,296 --> 00:47:30,534
- Marsh clam?
- Yes.

1072
00:47:30,535 --> 00:47:32,335
Marsh clam. Have you had marsh clam soup?

1073
00:47:32,336 --> 00:47:33,336
I have.

1074
00:47:33,337 --> 00:47:34,434
- Isn't the soup so good?
- Yes.

1075
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:35,735
With chopped chives in.

1076
00:47:35,736 --> 00:47:37,376
(It's a specialty of Seomjin River, chewy marsh clam.)

1077
00:47:37,946 --> 00:47:40,716
(Once it's boiled, it becomes savory marsh clam soup.)

1078
00:47:41,015 --> 00:47:45,546
(If it's mixed with spicy seasoning, it is spicy raw marsh clam salad.)

1079
00:47:47,385 --> 00:47:48,414
(My goodness)

1080
00:47:48,415 --> 00:47:49,626
Look at that.

1081
00:47:50,486 --> 00:47:51,625
It's a densely lamellated oyster.

1082
00:47:51,626 --> 00:47:52,725
Look how big it is.

1083
00:47:53,356 --> 00:47:54,554
It is big.

1084
00:47:54,555 --> 00:47:56,664
(It's too big to hold with one hand.)

1085
00:47:56,665 --> 00:48:00,264
It's called densely lamellated oyster...

1086
00:48:00,265 --> 00:48:01,495
because we eat them in the cherry blossom season.

1087
00:48:02,135 --> 00:48:03,664
- Because people eat when it blooms.
- Yes.

1088
00:48:03,665 --> 00:48:06,605
It doesn't smell fishy and it's tasty.

1089
00:48:06,606 --> 00:48:08,405
- I see.
- Do we eat the whole thing?

1090
00:48:08,406 --> 00:48:09,506
Sure.

1091
00:48:10,406 --> 00:48:11,446
It's huge.

1092
00:48:12,406 --> 00:48:14,875
(The specialty of Seomjin River)

1093
00:48:14,876 --> 00:48:17,245
(Densely lamellated oyster)

1094
00:48:17,515 --> 00:48:19,986
(It's 5 times bigger than regular oysters.)

1095
00:48:20,285 --> 00:48:23,325
(The milky clam only available in spring)

1096
00:48:24,586 --> 00:48:27,595
(It's even tastier when it's grilled.)

1097
00:48:27,756 --> 00:48:29,255
It's already appetizing.

1098
00:48:29,256 --> 00:48:31,296
(Me too)

1099
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:33,594
- My gosh.
- Thank you.

1100
00:48:33,595 --> 00:48:34,765
(Today's plentiful dinner with marsh clams and oysters)

1101
00:48:35,296 --> 00:48:37,204
Traditional markets are...

1102
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,505
more vibrant.

1103
00:48:38,506 --> 00:48:40,906
I agree. It's full of energy.

1104
00:48:42,176 --> 00:48:44,205
It's very vibrant, so I don't know...

1105
00:48:44,376 --> 00:48:45,844
- how to handle it.
- Right.

1106
00:48:45,845 --> 00:48:46,974
You're right.

1107
00:48:46,975 --> 00:48:48,844
(A calm place right in time)

1108
00:48:48,845 --> 00:48:50,115
What is this?

1109
00:48:50,885 --> 00:48:52,215
- Is it a forge?
- Yes.

1110
00:48:52,216 --> 00:48:54,115
(A forge in Hwagae market.)

1111
00:48:54,356 --> 00:48:55,885
Don't you love that sound?

1112
00:48:56,185 --> 00:48:57,455
I do.

1113
00:48:57,626 --> 00:48:59,955
It's the first time hearing it in person.

1114
00:49:01,426 --> 00:49:06,336
(This forge makes knives in a traditional way.)

1115
00:49:06,836 --> 00:49:09,804
(This is a freshly made knife in Hwagae market.)

1116
00:49:09,805 --> 00:49:12,006
Do you have a kitchen knife that's made here?

1117
00:49:14,336 --> 00:49:16,545
(Dong Il is looking for a new knife to use in House on Wheels.)

1118
00:49:16,546 --> 00:49:18,475
The knives we have are dull.

1119
00:49:18,946 --> 00:49:20,115
This looks good.

1120
00:49:20,376 --> 00:49:21,945
Do you need a knife at home?

1121
00:49:21,946 --> 00:49:23,046
I'm okay.

1122
00:49:25,015 --> 00:49:26,514
This looks inexpensive.

1123
00:49:26,515 --> 00:49:28,914
- That's a cheap one.
- It's a different one, I see.

1124
00:49:28,915 --> 00:49:30,126
(While the two are enjoying Hwagae market,)

1125
00:49:31,486 --> 00:49:33,955
(the three are driving towards the front yard.)

1126
00:49:34,955 --> 00:49:36,125
How long does it take?

1127
00:49:36,126 --> 00:49:37,865
About 10 to 15 minutes.

1128
00:49:38,926 --> 00:49:39,965
It's close.

1129
00:49:39,966 --> 00:49:41,034
(The front yard is not far from Hwagae market.)

1130
00:49:41,035 --> 00:49:45,105
This is the place with great mountains and clean water.

1131
00:49:45,106 --> 00:49:46,305
The place in that expression.

1132
00:49:46,475 --> 00:49:47,836
This seems to be the right place.

1133
00:49:48,176 --> 00:49:49,176
This is so nice.

1134
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:55,276
(House on Wheels goes deeper into the mountains.)

1135
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:58,545
(It's passing the cherry blossoms...)

1136
00:49:58,546 --> 00:50:00,716
(and getting close to the mountain.)

1137
00:50:02,285 --> 00:50:03,685
We must be going upward over there.

1138
00:50:04,685 --> 00:50:05,756
This place...

1139
00:50:06,156 --> 00:50:07,954
It's so nice here.

1140
00:50:07,955 --> 00:50:09,664
(Peekaboo of green tea fields, a specialty of Hadong)

1141
00:50:09,665 --> 00:50:11,026
Is it green tea?

1142
00:50:11,066 --> 00:50:12,426
Yes, it's green tea.

1143
00:50:14,265 --> 00:50:16,435
Oh, my goodness.

1144
00:50:18,805 --> 00:50:19,975
Oh, my...

1145
00:50:21,836 --> 00:50:23,906
The road here is very steep.

1146
00:50:24,776 --> 00:50:27,276
(Dizzy)

1147
00:50:27,876 --> 00:50:31,146
(Upward along the slope)

1148
00:50:31,285 --> 00:50:32,485
(Goodness.)

1149
00:50:32,486 --> 00:50:34,514
(My gosh.)

1150
00:50:34,515 --> 00:50:35,515
(Oh, my...)

1151
00:50:35,716 --> 00:50:39,325
(It's almost like climbing.)

1152
00:50:40,396 --> 00:50:42,555
(Shaking)

1153
00:50:42,626 --> 00:50:45,526
(Sliding)

1154
00:50:46,495 --> 00:50:50,205
(Driving the narrow and rapid slop...)

1155
00:50:52,265 --> 00:50:55,405
(and passing green tea fields,)

1156
00:50:55,406 --> 00:50:58,075
(when it's close to the mountain peak,)

1157
00:50:58,245 --> 00:51:00,114
It's beautiful no matter where I park here.

1158
00:51:00,115 --> 00:51:02,575
(today's front yard appears.)

1159
00:51:04,185 --> 00:51:08,114
(Today's front yard, Hadong millenary green tea field)

1160
00:51:08,115 --> 00:51:12,486
(Today's front yard, Hadong millenary green tea field)

1161
00:51:14,055 --> 00:51:18,396
(Fresh green tea fields spread in the front yard)

1162
00:51:19,595 --> 00:51:23,535
(With a thousand year of history,)

1163
00:51:24,506 --> 00:51:26,235
(Hadong green tea field is...)

1164
00:51:26,236 --> 00:51:28,975
(home of wild tea.)

1165
00:51:30,075 --> 00:51:33,915
(Different from other regions, it's formed in the wild.)

1166
00:51:35,776 --> 00:51:41,455
(The tea leaves are grown with the gift of nature.)

1167
00:51:43,955 --> 00:51:47,796
(It's full of freshness.)

1168
00:51:49,725 --> 00:51:53,566
(The green tea field offers a nice walk environment.)

1169
00:51:54,396 --> 00:51:59,705
(There is a gazebo for the tea ceremony.)

1170
00:52:02,435 --> 00:52:07,514
(Today, we live in Hadong millenary green tea field.)

1171
00:52:07,515 --> 00:52:08,776
- It's so nice.
- It's nice.

1172
00:52:09,745 --> 00:52:11,485
- It's perfect.
- Good.

1173
00:52:11,486 --> 00:52:12,546
(Satisfied)

1174
00:52:12,845 --> 00:52:13,954
Oh, my gosh.

1175
00:52:13,955 --> 00:52:15,615
(Proud)

1176
00:52:17,626 --> 00:52:19,554
- Does it look good?
- Yes. What do you think?

1177
00:52:19,555 --> 00:52:21,256
Hee Won, come here and look.

1178
00:52:21,856 --> 00:52:23,225
Isn't it perfect here?

1179
00:52:24,296 --> 00:52:25,966
We have shade here.

1180
00:52:26,225 --> 00:52:28,264
- I see.
- Look. If we sit here,

1181
00:52:28,265 --> 00:52:30,335
we can enjoy the beautiful scenery.

1182
00:52:30,336 --> 00:52:31,664
- It's good.
- Isn't it?

1183
00:52:31,665 --> 00:52:32,935
- It is. It's good.
- Yes.

1184
00:52:33,506 --> 00:52:36,406
(Green tea field for a 1,000 year)

1185
00:52:38,046 --> 00:52:44,285
(House on Wheels surrounded by green tea fields)

1186
00:52:46,086 --> 00:52:49,385
(A perfect front yard with the blue sky)

1187
00:52:49,885 --> 00:52:51,355
It seems good. Perfect.

1188
00:52:51,356 --> 00:52:54,325
(It's nice.)

1189
00:52:54,526 --> 00:52:57,224
The wild tea trees grow...

1190
00:52:57,225 --> 00:53:00,094
only about up to human height.

1191
00:53:00,095 --> 00:53:01,265
Is that so?

1192
00:53:01,696 --> 00:53:02,966
It's here.

1193
00:53:02,995 --> 00:53:04,466
My gosh.

1194
00:53:05,736 --> 00:53:06,934
- My gosh.
- Hey.

1195
00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:08,336
Today's guest is here.

1196
00:53:09,276 --> 00:53:11,106
(Laughing)

1197
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:13,875
- I will help you.
- You'll be surprised.

1198
00:53:13,876 --> 00:53:14,946
Look.

1199
00:53:15,515 --> 00:53:16,816
You bought a lot.

1200
00:53:17,446 --> 00:53:19,645
These are for Yoon A.

1201
00:53:19,646 --> 00:53:20,915
(My gosh!)

1202
00:53:21,216 --> 00:53:24,586
I'll show you something special.

1203
00:53:24,685 --> 00:53:25,755
Okay.

1204
00:53:25,756 --> 00:53:27,196
(Expectant)

1205
00:53:27,696 --> 00:53:29,325
You bought a lot.

1206
00:53:29,796 --> 00:53:30,966
- Fried sweetfish.
- What?

1207
00:53:31,765 --> 00:53:33,235
(My goodness!)

1208
00:53:33,236 --> 00:53:34,236
- It's very...
- My gosh!

1209
00:53:34,535 --> 00:53:35,795
Is this sweetfish?

1210
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,665
(It looks delicious.)

1211
00:53:37,935 --> 00:53:39,935
It's sweetfish with a watermelon smell.

1212
00:53:40,236 --> 00:53:41,974
Have some now when it's warm. It's not delicious once it gets cold.

1213
00:53:41,975 --> 00:53:43,275
- Sweetfish?
- Sweetfish.

1214
00:53:43,276 --> 00:53:44,645
Look. Touch it. Isn't it warm?

1215
00:53:44,646 --> 00:53:45,646
(Staring)

1216
00:53:46,205 --> 00:53:47,445
- Goodness!
- You have to eat when it's warm.

1217
00:53:47,446 --> 00:53:48,475
And...

1218
00:53:49,475 --> 00:53:50,486
It's millet pancake.

1219
00:53:51,115 --> 00:53:52,546
It's very warm.

1220
00:53:53,115 --> 00:53:54,415
(Interested)

1221
00:53:54,615 --> 00:53:55,685
(Good)

1222
00:53:56,486 --> 00:53:59,994
The red bean pieces are big, like the old days.

1223
00:53:59,995 --> 00:54:01,426
- The whole red bean.
- Whole red bean.

1224
00:54:01,955 --> 00:54:05,225
This is an authentic mugwort rice cake.

1225
00:54:05,595 --> 00:54:06,665
That looks yummy.

1226
00:54:07,236 --> 00:54:09,595
Do you still need to eat dinner?

1227
00:54:10,966 --> 00:54:12,264
(These are snacks.)

1228
00:54:12,265 --> 00:54:13,475
Have some when it's warm.

1229
00:54:14,435 --> 00:54:16,035
We need to eat before it gets cold. Try it.

1230
00:54:18,345 --> 00:54:19,445
(Yoon A takes a bite first.)

1231
00:54:19,446 --> 00:54:21,415
They fried the whole sweetfish,

1232
00:54:21,975 --> 00:54:23,816
but I asked them to cut in halves as they were too big.

1233
00:54:23,986 --> 00:54:26,415
They did it for us. I haven't tried it, though.

1234
00:54:26,685 --> 00:54:27,856
I bought this too.

1235
00:54:28,086 --> 00:54:30,225
(Crunchy)

1236
00:54:30,285 --> 00:54:31,656
(It's delicious.)

1237
00:54:33,256 --> 00:54:36,055
(It's good.)

1238
00:54:36,396 --> 00:54:37,425
(It's a snack time altogether like a family.)

1239
00:54:37,426 --> 00:54:39,696
The meat comes out like this.

1240
00:54:40,535 --> 00:54:41,836
Eat this part.

1241
00:54:42,135 --> 00:54:43,305
- Take a look.
- Okay.

1242
00:54:43,506 --> 00:54:46,265
(Hee Won who drove takes a bite.)

1243
00:54:46,466 --> 00:54:47,835
Dong Il, it's delicious.

1244
00:54:47,836 --> 00:54:50,146
(Si Wan also rushes to take a bite.)

1245
00:54:50,805 --> 00:54:52,345
We don't care about table manners.

1246
00:54:53,515 --> 00:54:54,645
(After a bite,)

1247
00:54:54,646 --> 00:54:57,646
(Byoung Cheol enjoys the scenery.)

1248
00:54:59,915 --> 00:55:02,614
(A snack time in the painting-like front yard.)

1249
00:55:02,615 --> 00:55:03,926
I recommend this one.

1250
00:55:04,126 --> 00:55:06,925
It's with whole red beans. You have to eat when it's warm.

1251
00:55:06,926 --> 00:55:07,995
This is so good.

1252
00:55:08,325 --> 00:55:09,756
Have some, seriously.

1253
00:55:12,566 --> 00:55:13,796
Have some. It's so good.

1254
00:55:14,435 --> 00:55:15,994
Eat the center where there are most red beans.

1255
00:55:15,995 --> 00:55:17,406
Okay. I will.

1256
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:19,534
(Savoring)

1257
00:55:19,535 --> 00:55:20,606
Isn't it so good?

1258
00:55:22,475 --> 00:55:23,546
(Byoung Cheol crumples his shoes.)

1259
00:55:24,146 --> 00:55:26,646
(Smiling)

1260
00:55:26,745 --> 00:55:30,946
(He takes a bite with a baby smile.)

1261
00:55:32,216 --> 00:55:33,356
It tastes like carp bread.

1262
00:55:33,515 --> 00:55:34,885
- Carp bread!
- That's right.

1263
00:55:37,356 --> 00:55:39,185
Hold it. Hold the left side.

1264
00:55:39,325 --> 00:55:40,626
- Where? Here?
- Yes.

1265
00:55:41,156 --> 00:55:42,295
Eat it.

1266
00:55:42,296 --> 00:55:43,296
(Eating)

1267
00:55:43,825 --> 00:55:45,466
(It's good.)

1268
00:55:46,896 --> 00:55:50,466
(Dong Il takes a bite too.)

1269
00:55:53,066 --> 00:55:55,175
(While everyone is laughing happily...)

1270
00:55:55,176 --> 00:55:58,305
- It's not even your family's?
- Why is he acting all poor?

1271
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:02,046
(Poor)

1272
00:56:03,146 --> 00:56:08,086
(Lonely gourmet)

1273
00:56:09,756 --> 00:56:11,225
(He's so funny.)

1274
00:56:11,486 --> 00:56:12,626
I like this one.

1275
00:56:12,825 --> 00:56:14,395
There were a lot of millet pancake restaurants,

1276
00:56:14,396 --> 00:56:15,755
but only this place had people queued up.

1277
00:56:15,756 --> 00:56:17,224
- I see.
- Really.

1278
00:56:17,225 --> 00:56:18,626
I can see why.

1279
00:56:20,365 --> 00:56:23,566
Bean powder mugwort rice cake. It's like jelly.

1280
00:56:27,535 --> 00:56:29,276
(Delicious)

1281
00:56:30,646 --> 00:56:33,815
Gosh, this is so soft on the inside. Fluffy, right?

1282
00:56:33,816 --> 00:56:35,215
- It's really good.
- Yes.

1283
00:56:35,216 --> 00:56:36,845
(Fluffy)

1284
00:56:38,316 --> 00:56:41,716
(Byoung Cheol takes a bite too.)

1285
00:56:42,455 --> 00:56:44,526
(It's delicious.)

1286
00:56:45,455 --> 00:56:46,586
This is really good.

1287
00:56:47,426 --> 00:56:49,426
- It's sooft.
- Pardon?

1288
00:56:49,856 --> 00:56:51,095
Soft.

1289
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:55,296
Your pronunciation is weird because of the rice cake.

1290
00:56:55,595 --> 00:56:56,805
"Sooft".

1291
00:56:57,336 --> 00:56:58,665
Even my pronunciation is soft.

1292
00:57:00,035 --> 00:57:02,105
- The mugwort rice cake is the best!
- Yes.

1293
00:57:02,106 --> 00:57:04,845
- It's so soft!
- The mugwort rice cake is nice.

1294
00:57:05,205 --> 00:57:06,945
I got a surprise for you.

1295
00:57:06,946 --> 00:57:08,276
Don't eat this.

1296
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:10,244
Here, look.

1297
00:57:10,245 --> 00:57:11,486
(What is it this time?)

1298
00:57:12,316 --> 00:57:13,385
What oyster?

1299
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,555
- Densely lamellated oyster.
- Densely lamellated oyster.

1300
00:57:16,115 --> 00:57:17,856
It's freshwater oyster this big.

1301
00:57:17,986 --> 00:57:19,724
- Densely lamellated oyster?
- When the cherry blossom blooms,

1302
00:57:19,725 --> 00:57:22,825
- you eat this together.
- It's oyster,

1303
00:57:23,426 --> 00:57:24,895
- but from freshwater.
- Here.

1304
00:57:24,896 --> 00:57:27,696
- Oyster?
- Yes. Densely lamellated oyster.

1305
00:57:27,836 --> 00:57:29,595
- Look at the size.
- Gosh!

1306
00:57:30,066 --> 00:57:32,535
This is freshwater oyster.

1307
00:57:34,376 --> 00:57:36,474
(Amazing)

1308
00:57:36,475 --> 00:57:38,676
It's almost like a stone.

1309
00:57:38,946 --> 00:57:40,245
Do you like this, Yoon A?

1310
00:57:42,075 --> 00:57:43,176
Yes.

1311
00:57:44,316 --> 00:57:46,485
That was pretty slow.

1312
00:57:46,486 --> 00:57:47,815
- I like it.
- The reaction was slow.

1313
00:57:47,816 --> 00:57:49,284
- I like it.
- This is my first time...

1314
00:57:49,285 --> 00:57:50,324
- seeing a freshwater oyster.
- Me too.

1315
00:57:50,325 --> 00:57:51,585
- Really?
- Yes.

1316
00:57:51,586 --> 00:57:53,426
Now is the season.

1317
00:57:53,626 --> 00:57:54,855
When you come here,

1318
00:57:54,856 --> 00:57:56,864
everything's new, so you might get flustered.

1319
00:57:56,865 --> 00:57:57,926
This...

1320
00:57:58,896 --> 00:58:01,265
(It's too soon to get flustered!)

1321
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:04,365
(Today's seasonal meal gifted by Seomjin River)

1322
00:58:05,006 --> 00:58:07,805
(The flower that blooms in Seomjin River, densely lamellated oyster)

1323
00:58:08,035 --> 00:58:11,046
(Marsh clams which are small but full of nutrition)

1324
00:58:12,245 --> 00:58:15,046
(Densely lamellated oyster bigger than a fist...)

1325
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,385
(can be cooked directly on charcoal fire...)

1326
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:22,055
(as barbecue.)

1327
00:58:22,955 --> 00:58:25,385
(Marsh clams with bouncy flesh...)

1328
00:58:25,885 --> 00:58:28,725
(can be boiled till the white soup comes out...)

1329
00:58:29,526 --> 00:58:32,526
(and become refreshing marsh clam soup.)

1330
00:58:33,296 --> 00:58:35,966
(And yesterday's front yard)

1331
00:58:36,236 --> 00:58:38,635
(Bamboos that spread densely across the mountain stream...)

1332
00:58:39,406 --> 00:58:42,506
(will meet Mount Jiri's black pork from yesterday...)

1333
00:58:43,446 --> 00:58:45,705
(to form bamboo black pork with green tea scent.)

1334
00:58:46,345 --> 00:58:47,415
(Amazing)

1335
00:58:48,915 --> 00:58:50,515
(Expectant)

1336
00:58:51,285 --> 00:58:54,156
(Look forward to the generous amount of Hadong's seasonal buffet.)

1337
00:58:54,415 --> 00:58:55,955
- Byoung Cheol!
- Yes!

1338
00:58:56,216 --> 00:58:58,725
I prepared something especially for you and Yoon A.

1339
00:58:59,185 --> 00:59:00,696
- Yes!
- Come here.

1340
00:59:01,595 --> 00:59:03,895
(What is it?)

1341
00:59:03,896 --> 00:59:06,196
- Just leave it, we'll do it.
- Okay.

1342
00:59:06,396 --> 00:59:08,365
- You guys are our guests.
- Yes.

1343
00:59:08,665 --> 00:59:11,565
We prepared a special space for you two.

1344
00:59:11,566 --> 00:59:12,566
Yes.

1345
00:59:12,567 --> 00:59:16,204
We're going to put black pork in bamboo...

1346
00:59:16,205 --> 00:59:18,005
- and boil it.
- Yes.

1347
00:59:18,006 --> 00:59:20,775
Then we're going to pick some new shoots...

1348
00:59:20,776 --> 00:59:22,075
and put it in there...

1349
00:59:22,216 --> 00:59:24,015
together with the pork.

1350
00:59:24,086 --> 00:59:26,784
Then the green tea scent permeates into the pork which tastes great.

1351
00:59:26,785 --> 00:59:28,155
- Yes.
- Pick some shoots...

1352
00:59:28,156 --> 00:59:29,156
and enjoy the place.

1353
00:59:29,157 --> 00:59:30,856
- Okay.
- Travel safe.

1354
00:59:31,185 --> 00:59:32,355
Don't become too close with each other.

1355
00:59:32,356 --> 00:59:34,196
Of course. Social distancing.

1356
00:59:35,756 --> 00:59:36,756
(Yoon A and Byoung Cheol head to the picturesque green tea field.)

1357
00:59:36,757 --> 00:59:38,825
On the hill,

1358
00:59:39,365 --> 00:59:41,466
- there's a green tea field.
- A green tea field. Gosh.

1359
00:59:41,736 --> 00:59:43,365
Have you been to a green tea field before?

1360
00:59:43,635 --> 00:59:46,534
I've been to one near Mount Jiri.

1361
00:59:46,535 --> 00:59:48,506
- Near Mount Jiri?
- Yes.

1362
00:59:49,606 --> 00:59:51,375
It's so pretty!

1363
00:59:51,376 --> 00:59:54,176
(Let's get down to business and pluck some leaves!)

1364
00:59:55,716 --> 00:59:57,045
Tea leaves...

1365
00:59:57,046 --> 01:00:00,216
How do I know which are new shoots?

1366
01:00:01,455 --> 01:00:04,426
(Something small and shiny like this is new shoot.)

1367
01:00:05,785 --> 01:00:08,995
(High-class tea Oujeon is brewed using new shoots like this.)

1368
01:00:10,095 --> 01:00:13,896
(Made with new shoots that grew up first in early spring,)

1369
01:00:14,836 --> 01:00:18,665
(Oujeon tea is known for its soft and gentle taste.)

1370
01:00:19,135 --> 01:00:21,035
- I see.
- It's here.

1371
01:00:21,106 --> 01:00:22,975
- These must be new shoots.
- Amazing.

1372
01:00:23,075 --> 01:00:25,676
You're right.

1373
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,074
- They...
- About this big?

1374
01:00:28,075 --> 01:00:30,646
You're so good at picking them.

1375
01:00:31,845 --> 01:00:38,785
(The guests search for new shoots here and there with effort.)

1376
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,465
It feels like I'm already brewing tea.

1377
01:00:44,466 --> 01:00:45,494
You're right.

1378
01:00:45,495 --> 01:00:46,566
(Their hearts feel refreshed as they pick the shoots themselves.)

1379
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:51,635
(A gift-like time provided by the front yard)

1380
01:00:52,966 --> 01:00:55,035
We need to start with charcoal fire. That's the urgent one.

1381
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:56,305
(On the other hand, the family starts preparing for dinner.)

1382
01:00:57,146 --> 01:00:58,876
We should hurry up because we don't have time.

1383
01:00:59,506 --> 01:01:00,945
Once the sun sets...

1384
01:01:00,946 --> 01:01:02,915
(The sun is already setting behind the mountain.)

1385
01:01:04,385 --> 01:01:08,285
(Safely filmed with the permission of the landowner)

1386
01:01:09,156 --> 01:01:12,356
(He hurriedly puts charcoal on fire to cook dinner quickly.)

1387
01:01:12,785 --> 01:01:16,156
(He makes faint charcoal fire for bamboo black pork.)

1388
01:01:16,656 --> 01:01:20,566
(Meanwhile, the assistant chef checks the kitchen first.)

1389
01:01:21,865 --> 01:01:24,164
(What does he have his eyes on?)

1390
01:01:24,165 --> 01:01:26,605
I should wash it now.

1391
01:01:26,606 --> 01:01:27,635
(The knife they bought at the forge in Hwagae market)

1392
01:01:28,006 --> 01:01:31,676
(The assistant chef's task is to wash the chef's knife beforehand.)

1393
01:01:32,546 --> 01:01:34,415
Gosh, the knife is so cool.

1394
01:01:35,046 --> 01:01:37,216
(The chef's knife is put on hold.)

1395
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:40,656
(Chef Sung finally makes his way into the kitchen.)

1396
01:01:41,385 --> 01:01:43,015
You should hurry up, or the sun will set.

1397
01:01:43,216 --> 01:01:45,526
(What is the first ingredient to prepare?)

1398
01:01:46,055 --> 01:01:47,224
(Mount Jiri's black pork belly)

1399
01:01:47,225 --> 01:01:49,626
Gosh, where is the knife we bought?

1400
01:01:50,126 --> 01:01:51,925
I already washed it.

1401
01:01:51,926 --> 01:01:54,635
- Good, as expected of Si Wan.
- It's here.

1402
01:01:55,435 --> 01:01:57,804
(It gets cut so easily.)

1403
01:01:57,805 --> 01:01:59,835
Korean knives are the best.

1404
01:01:59,836 --> 01:02:01,705
- It's so sharp.
- Gosh.

1405
01:02:02,075 --> 01:02:04,975
(Thick)

1406
01:02:05,705 --> 01:02:08,676
(For thick meat, you must score it.)

1407
01:02:12,415 --> 01:02:13,485
(He thoroughly scores them so the green leaf scent is permeated well.)

1408
01:02:13,486 --> 01:02:14,755
Gosh, the scores.

1409
01:02:14,756 --> 01:02:16,685
(He thoroughly scores them so the green leaf scent is permeated well.)

1410
01:02:17,586 --> 01:02:20,626
(He measures the size against the bamboo.)

1411
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:24,466
(He cuts them to match the size.)

1412
01:02:25,396 --> 01:02:28,066
(He cuts them up into big chunks.)

1413
01:02:28,296 --> 01:02:30,935
(Amazing...)

1414
01:02:31,406 --> 01:02:35,506
Hee Won's guarding right beside me.

1415
01:02:35,876 --> 01:02:37,075
It's reassuring.

1416
01:02:37,506 --> 01:02:39,705
This is what family is, isn't it?

1417
01:02:40,075 --> 01:02:41,176
Of course, Dong Il.

1418
01:02:42,745 --> 01:02:44,586
- You can do it. Should I peel them?
- This...

1419
01:02:45,086 --> 01:02:46,646
- Cut off the tips.
- Okay.

1420
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:51,126
(Hee Won's task is to prepare garlic to put into the bamboo.)

1421
01:02:52,156 --> 01:02:54,756
(Focused tips of his lips)

1422
01:02:55,455 --> 01:02:58,325
(Meanwhile, the main chef...)

1423
01:02:58,665 --> 01:03:01,836
(is massaging the black pork with salt.)

1424
01:03:02,396 --> 01:03:05,106
(He pours salt on the cutting board.)

1425
01:03:05,836 --> 01:03:09,435
(He turns the meat around and coats the outside with salt.)

1426
01:03:09,776 --> 01:03:12,046
(Grinding)

1427
01:03:12,376 --> 01:03:15,475
(He grinds pepper onto the cutting board as well.)

1428
01:03:15,676 --> 01:03:17,915
(Knocking)

1429
01:03:19,285 --> 01:03:21,756
(He starts preparing for bamboo black pork in earnest.)

1430
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:25,385
I should wrap one with chives,

1431
01:03:25,756 --> 01:03:27,755
and wrap another one with water parsley.

1432
01:03:27,756 --> 01:03:29,156
(2. Black pork with water parsley)

1433
01:03:29,426 --> 01:03:32,725
(Hee Won is done with preparing the garlic.)

1434
01:03:33,296 --> 01:03:35,796
(The garlic Hee Won prepared)

1435
01:03:36,336 --> 01:03:39,966
(Once he pushes it in deeply,)

1436
01:03:40,305 --> 01:03:43,805
(bamboo black pork is ready to go.)

1437
01:03:44,245 --> 01:03:46,205
It will be so amazing that you'll be at a loss for words.

1438
01:03:46,876 --> 01:03:48,745
(Swallowing)

1439
01:03:50,345 --> 01:03:52,184
(The guests come back after plucking tea leaves.)

1440
01:03:52,185 --> 01:03:54,284
It's so familiar.

1441
01:03:54,285 --> 01:03:55,856
You must've had a good time.

1442
01:03:56,915 --> 01:03:58,526
We had a good time indeed.

1443
01:03:59,656 --> 01:04:03,196
(He washes the tea leaves from the front yard cleanly...)

1444
01:04:03,356 --> 01:04:06,926
(and gently puts them on the black pork so the scent can get on it.)

1445
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:09,396
I put them in.

1446
01:04:10,296 --> 01:04:14,336
- Then wrap it with the foil.
- Yes.

1447
01:04:14,705 --> 01:04:16,205
Use three pieces of aluminum foil.

1448
01:04:16,376 --> 01:04:18,275
3? 1, 2, 3 layers?

1449
01:04:18,276 --> 01:04:19,344
Yes, three layers.

1450
01:04:19,345 --> 01:04:21,945
Square shape, 3 to 4 pieces.

1451
01:04:21,946 --> 01:04:24,986
Cover it in layers and wrap it with wire.

1452
01:04:27,015 --> 01:04:28,885
(Halt)

1453
01:04:30,185 --> 01:04:32,385
(Well...)

1454
01:04:33,796 --> 01:04:36,626
(He enters with an important task.)

1455
01:04:40,365 --> 01:04:41,566
Hee Won. You're okay, right?

1456
01:04:42,396 --> 01:04:43,804
(Sickly)

1457
01:04:43,805 --> 01:04:45,735
You got an important task.

1458
01:04:45,736 --> 01:04:47,375
- Pardon?
- You got an important task.

1459
01:04:47,376 --> 01:04:50,845
Exactly. You know what will happen if this gets punctured, right?

1460
01:04:51,006 --> 01:04:52,045
I know.

1461
01:04:52,046 --> 01:04:54,876
(The most important task is given to Hee Won.)

1462
01:04:55,345 --> 01:04:58,046
(Very careful)

1463
01:04:59,385 --> 01:05:01,184
I can fold it like this, right?

1464
01:05:01,185 --> 01:05:02,385
Yes.

1465
01:05:02,856 --> 01:05:04,986
It will be fine even if it's a bit thick, right?

1466
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:07,995
Must the shiny part face outside?

1467
01:05:08,156 --> 01:05:10,525
This side is shinier than this side.

1468
01:05:10,526 --> 01:05:12,295
Is it like this?

1469
01:05:12,296 --> 01:05:13,724
It's fine, it doesn't matter.

1470
01:05:13,725 --> 01:05:15,495
- It doesn't matter?
- No.

1471
01:05:15,665 --> 01:05:18,534
(He carefully folds it neatly.)

1472
01:05:18,535 --> 01:05:19,865
Fold it like this.

1473
01:05:21,205 --> 01:05:22,406
Okay!

1474
01:05:23,876 --> 01:05:26,244
(Next, he prepares wires to tie the bamboo.)

1475
01:05:26,245 --> 01:05:28,475
(Sniff)

1476
01:05:29,575 --> 01:05:32,885
(Surprisingly, this is 10 times the original speed.)

1477
01:05:33,216 --> 01:05:36,486
(What is another menu he's preparing?)

1478
01:05:36,615 --> 01:05:38,455
Marsh clam that Byoung Cheol likes!

1479
01:05:39,055 --> 01:05:40,355
Let's just go ahead with it.

1480
01:05:40,356 --> 01:05:41,495
(Smiling with his eyes)

1481
01:05:41,555 --> 01:05:43,296
There's a lot of marsh clam.

1482
01:05:44,495 --> 01:05:45,795
This is no joke.

1483
01:05:45,796 --> 01:05:47,126
(Full of bouncy marsh clams)

1484
01:05:47,466 --> 01:05:50,135
(I'm so excited.)

1485
01:05:50,336 --> 01:05:52,635
- There's a lot.
- There's a lot. Really a lot.

1486
01:05:52,736 --> 01:05:55,006
(The assistant chef in charge of preparing ingredients...)

1487
01:05:55,435 --> 01:05:58,446
(cuts chives to put into marsh clam soup.)

1488
01:05:58,946 --> 01:06:01,716
(Marsh clam soup is ready to go as well.)

1489
01:06:02,046 --> 01:06:06,015
This is rice, this is marsh clam...

1490
01:06:06,586 --> 01:06:07,915
Everything's ready, right?

1491
01:06:09,156 --> 01:06:11,926
(Not yet, Dong Il.)

1492
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,195
Just two rounds of wire will be enough, right?

1493
01:06:14,196 --> 01:06:15,825
Yes, as long as it doesn't come off.

1494
01:06:17,126 --> 01:06:18,325
I'm worried that it might.

1495
01:06:20,365 --> 01:06:22,135
I've never been so nervous before.

1496
01:06:23,095 --> 01:06:26,066
I must make sure there is absolutely no gap in between.

1497
01:06:27,575 --> 01:06:29,305
Absolutely no gap.

1498
01:06:30,106 --> 01:06:31,776
(Holding it in place with his feet)

1499
01:06:32,276 --> 01:06:34,716
(He uses both his hands and feet.)

1500
01:06:35,146 --> 01:06:36,716
(You guys are almost done, right?)

1501
01:06:36,915 --> 01:06:39,614
- You guys are almost done, right?
- Yes.

1502
01:06:39,615 --> 01:06:40,915
- Almost done, right?
- Yes.

1503
01:06:41,986 --> 01:06:42,986
No.

1504
01:06:43,685 --> 01:06:45,856
Which way... This way.

1505
01:06:46,555 --> 01:06:48,196
- I'll hold it here.
- And you...

1506
01:06:48,626 --> 01:06:49,626
(He blocks the opening thoroughly.)

1507
01:06:49,627 --> 01:06:52,395
There's no way it will leak out if it's this tight.

1508
01:06:52,396 --> 01:06:54,034
(Don't worry, I'll protect the meat juice.)

1509
01:06:54,035 --> 01:06:55,566
This is more than enough.

1510
01:06:55,865 --> 01:06:58,305
Are you constructing a building?

1511
01:06:59,665 --> 01:07:02,605
Dong Il, this will never come off.

1512
01:07:02,606 --> 01:07:04,345
That's more than enough.

1513
01:07:04,676 --> 01:07:07,376
(No, I can't stop here.)

1514
01:07:07,615 --> 01:07:10,075
He has a callus on his hands.

1515
01:07:10,475 --> 01:07:11,914
This is nothing.

1516
01:07:11,915 --> 01:07:13,146
Gosh, this...

1517
01:07:13,955 --> 01:07:15,256
My goodness.

1518
01:07:15,816 --> 01:07:17,555
(He's really amazing.)

1519
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,356
Have you been to a green tea field before?

1520
01:07:19,825 --> 01:07:22,696
- Yes, I've been to one before.
- I see.

1521
01:07:22,926 --> 01:07:25,565
- But this is my first time...
- Like a staircase.

1522
01:07:25,566 --> 01:07:26,566
- coming to one this steep.
- Staircase.

1523
01:07:26,567 --> 01:07:28,335
- On the top, there's a gazebo.
- Gazebo.

1524
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:30,195
From there, the view is really nice.

1525
01:07:30,196 --> 01:07:31,205
Is that so?

1526
01:07:31,406 --> 01:07:34,275
Hee Won, hurry up. He says the summerhouse view is good.

1527
01:07:34,276 --> 01:07:35,304
It's really good.

1528
01:07:35,305 --> 01:07:37,445
Let's put the bamboo inside...

1529
01:07:37,446 --> 01:07:39,175
and go up there to see.

1530
01:07:40,146 --> 01:07:42,014
I don't think one round is enough.

1531
01:07:42,015 --> 01:07:43,116
(He can't hear Dong Il.)

1532
01:07:43,475 --> 01:07:46,345
One round is enough. It's enough.

1533
01:07:46,685 --> 01:07:48,755
Hold this side...

1534
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,185
and pull it tight. No, pull it once more.

1535
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:54,755
Pull that side. Yes. Turn it.

1536
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:56,724
- Gosh.
- This is...

1537
01:07:56,725 --> 01:07:58,165
Gosh, this is...

1538
01:07:58,166 --> 01:07:59,825
I'll cut it.

1539
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,335
This is almost like a pressure cooker.

1540
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:05,265
It's done.

1541
01:08:06,566 --> 01:08:08,606
(Groaning)

1542
01:08:09,236 --> 01:08:11,276
(He used up all his energy on covering the bamboo.)

1543
01:08:11,706 --> 01:08:14,075
What is he even making that he's doing that?

1544
01:08:14,076 --> 01:08:17,415
I finished so many tasks already and am chilling around.

1545
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:19,044
(Groaning)

1546
01:08:19,045 --> 01:08:22,585
Dong Il, high-quality products cannot be simply made.

1547
01:08:23,385 --> 01:08:24,526
But you did do really well.

1548
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:25,655
- What?
- You really did well.

1549
01:08:25,656 --> 01:08:27,456
High-quality products cannot be simply made.

1550
01:08:28,156 --> 01:08:29,896
I should put them in now.

1551
01:08:31,866 --> 01:08:35,196
(The bamboo goes right into the charcoal fire.)

1552
01:08:35,996 --> 01:08:37,964
How long did we cook last time?

1553
01:08:37,965 --> 01:08:39,105
Quite long.

1554
01:08:39,106 --> 01:08:41,174
Right? It needs to boil,

1555
01:08:41,175 --> 01:08:44,045
and it has to be cooked on the inside.

1556
01:08:44,475 --> 01:08:48,875
(The rest of the bamboos get into the charcoal fire as well.)

1557
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:53,845
(While the bamboos Hee Won put in so much effort get cooked...)

1558
01:08:54,515 --> 01:08:56,485
Did you put cheese in dried persimmon?

1559
01:08:56,486 --> 01:08:57,884
- Right! Should I do that?
- Should we do that now?

1560
01:08:57,885 --> 01:08:58,986
- Yes.
- Okay.

1561
01:08:59,526 --> 01:09:01,455
Actually, I eat this every day.

1562
01:09:01,456 --> 01:09:02,555
Really?

1563
01:09:02,896 --> 01:09:06,495
My mom always prepared this as a dessert.

1564
01:09:06,496 --> 01:09:07,795
- Really?
- Yes.

1565
01:09:08,465 --> 01:09:10,295
(I should step up again.)

1566
01:09:11,066 --> 01:09:13,435
My gosh, amazing!

1567
01:09:13,906 --> 01:09:17,675
(What is the first ingredient of Hee Won's dessert?)

1568
01:09:19,545 --> 01:09:22,875
(Yesterday, as soon as Byoung Cheol arrived at the empty house,)

1569
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:26,116
(he took it out from his bag...)

1570
01:09:26,585 --> 01:09:29,385
(and put it carefully in the fridge.)

1571
01:09:30,286 --> 01:09:32,254
(Byoung Cheol's housewarming gift, homemade ricotta cheese)

1572
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:33,656
(A picture taken by Byoung Cheol himself)

1573
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:36,356
How did you make the cheese?

1574
01:09:36,996 --> 01:09:39,665
I've never seen someone make cheese at home before.

1575
01:09:39,666 --> 01:09:41,465
I also only learned it a week ago.

1576
01:09:42,736 --> 01:09:43,794
Really?

1577
01:09:43,795 --> 01:09:45,304
I searched it up on the Internet.

1578
01:09:45,305 --> 01:09:46,305
(Homemade cheese Byoung Cheol made for House on Wheels...)

1579
01:09:46,706 --> 01:09:49,935
(and dried persimmon from Hwagae market)

1580
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:56,375
(They will make sweet and salty dried persimmon cheese roll.)

1581
01:09:56,816 --> 01:10:00,215
I saw this every day. Can you put it here?

1582
01:10:01,715 --> 01:10:03,786
You need to put in cheese here.

1583
01:10:05,185 --> 01:10:07,795
(Yoon A puts Byoung Cheol's cheese in dried persimmon.)

1584
01:10:08,225 --> 01:10:11,625
(She rolls the dried persimmon.)

1585
01:10:12,196 --> 01:10:14,236
Then you need to...

1586
01:10:15,366 --> 01:10:18,004
cut it like this.

1587
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,666
(The point of dried persimmon cheese roll is the pretty cross-section.)

1588
01:10:20,875 --> 01:10:21,875
(Fascinated)

1589
01:10:21,876 --> 01:10:23,475
This is stunning.

1590
01:10:24,576 --> 01:10:28,316
(Put them on the plate nicely, and dried persimmon cheese roll's done.)

1591
01:10:28,545 --> 01:10:32,116
Byoung Cheol made delicious cheese.

1592
01:10:35,715 --> 01:10:36,715
(Byoung Cheol is stretching.)

1593
01:10:36,716 --> 01:10:38,584
I need to stretch my back.

1594
01:10:38,585 --> 01:10:40,225
Just lie down.

1595
01:10:40,896 --> 01:10:44,526
(I'm tired.)

1596
01:10:45,166 --> 01:10:48,236
(Today was a busy day where he rode a zipline and went shopping.)

1597
01:10:48,566 --> 01:10:50,835
(How does Byoung Cheol stretch to relax his tired body?)

1598
01:10:51,236 --> 01:10:53,265
(Stretching his legs)

1599
01:10:53,505 --> 01:10:55,005
(Stretch)

1600
01:10:55,276 --> 01:10:57,004
Gosh, you're so flexible.

1601
01:10:57,005 --> 01:10:58,005
(Laughing)

1602
01:10:58,406 --> 01:10:59,746
Can you do a split?

1603
01:10:59,946 --> 01:11:03,116
(Meanwhile, Dong Il stays in front of the fire.)

1604
01:11:04,015 --> 01:11:06,085
(Is it done now?)

1605
01:11:06,585 --> 01:11:07,615
(The bamboo with green tea scent is steaming.)

1606
01:11:07,616 --> 01:11:08,885
Give me chopsticks.

1607
01:11:09,856 --> 01:11:11,054
Gosh, this...

1608
01:11:11,055 --> 01:11:13,085
(Half expectant, half worried)

1609
01:11:13,685 --> 01:11:16,826
(He pokes in to see if the inside is cooked.)

1610
01:11:17,055 --> 01:11:19,496
(Let me see...)

1611
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:21,135
So hot!

1612
01:11:22,896 --> 01:11:24,935
I think it's successful!

1613
01:11:25,106 --> 01:11:26,304
- That?
- Yes.

1614
01:11:26,305 --> 01:11:28,275
(Bamboo black pork with green tea leaves will be revealed soon!)

1615
01:11:28,276 --> 01:11:30,946
I succeeded again.

1616
01:11:32,345 --> 01:11:34,916
Pass me a pincer to cut off the wires.

1617
01:11:36,246 --> 01:11:37,816
I'm so curious about the meat.

1618
01:11:38,885 --> 01:11:41,085
The meat is the most important.

1619
01:11:42,585 --> 01:11:44,184
This is the most important.

1620
01:11:44,185 --> 01:11:46,185
- We're holding an opening ceremony.
- This is making me nervous.

1621
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:49,496
(In the tense atmosphere, he finally opens it.)

1622
01:11:49,795 --> 01:11:52,026
(Staring)

1623
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:53,395
What's that?

1624
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:54,594
Oh, this?

1625
01:11:54,595 --> 01:11:56,464
This is meat.

1626
01:11:56,465 --> 01:11:57,964
(Laughing)

1627
01:11:57,965 --> 01:12:00,606
I put the meat in the bamboo.

1628
01:12:00,765 --> 01:12:02,736
You used wires for that.

1629
01:12:02,975 --> 01:12:05,975
Yes, I asked someone who works with wires for 30 years for help.

1630
01:12:06,375 --> 01:12:10,276
- He wraps bamboo as a profession.
- I see.

1631
01:12:10,616 --> 01:12:12,345
- This is so funny.
- Here.

1632
01:12:13,286 --> 01:12:16,456
He's so doubtful, why did he wrap so many wires?

1633
01:12:17,486 --> 01:12:20,025
- Let's check the meat.
- I think the meat's cooked nicely.

1634
01:12:20,026 --> 01:12:21,254
- Really?
- Yes.

1635
01:12:21,255 --> 01:12:22,255
(He opens the bamboo black pork with water parsley.)

1636
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:27,465
(Come out.)

1637
01:12:29,896 --> 01:12:33,804
It's cooked, it's cooked! It's cooked, Byoung Cheol!

1638
01:12:33,805 --> 01:12:35,905
- Yes.
- It's cooked!

1639
01:12:35,906 --> 01:12:37,475
(Deeply moved)

1640
01:12:37,975 --> 01:12:39,505
Gosh, this is perfect.

1641
01:12:40,375 --> 01:12:41,514
- This will be really tasty.
- Yes.

1642
01:12:41,515 --> 01:12:43,245
(Bamboo black pork with gentle green tea scent)

1643
01:12:43,246 --> 01:12:44,646
It's boiled pork.

1644
01:12:45,286 --> 01:12:48,616
(He opens the black pork with chives as well.)

1645
01:12:51,255 --> 01:12:54,696
Because the bamboo is burnt, it's stuck to the meat.

1646
01:12:54,925 --> 01:12:57,996
(He puts down the tool and uses his hands this time.)

1647
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:04,066
He pulls it out with his hands...

1648
01:13:05,066 --> 01:13:06,965
and dismantles it for us.

1649
01:13:07,635 --> 01:13:08,635
He dismantles.

1650
01:13:10,406 --> 01:13:13,375
(How will the black pork with chives look like?)

1651
01:13:14,005 --> 01:13:15,675
(Amazed)

1652
01:13:17,576 --> 01:13:19,215
(Humming)

1653
01:13:21,385 --> 01:13:24,554
(Moist and juicy bamboo black pork)

1654
01:13:24,555 --> 01:13:27,656
The chives... Look at this.

1655
01:13:28,026 --> 01:13:31,295
(Well-cooked chives)

1656
01:13:31,765 --> 01:13:33,265
(Fascinating)

1657
01:13:33,765 --> 01:13:35,595
(Really astonished)

1658
01:13:37,866 --> 01:13:38,906
Should I cut it thickly?

1659
01:13:40,536 --> 01:13:41,536
Yes.

1660
01:13:41,536 --> 01:13:42,536
What about Byoung Cheol?

1661
01:13:42,537 --> 01:13:43,634
- Slightly Thick?
- Yes.

1662
01:13:43,635 --> 01:13:45,575
- Slightly thick.
- Slightly thick.

1663
01:13:45,576 --> 01:13:48,416
(He cuts the meat as per the guests' preference.)

1664
01:13:48,776 --> 01:13:49,974
- Gosh, the scent!
- Goodness!

1665
01:13:49,975 --> 01:13:51,085
(Amazing!)

1666
01:13:51,685 --> 01:13:53,585
(Oh my goodness.)

1667
01:13:53,746 --> 01:13:55,485
- It's cooked.
- Gosh.

1668
01:13:55,486 --> 01:13:56,916
I thought it would be red inside.

1669
01:13:57,255 --> 01:13:58,884
This will cook.

1670
01:13:58,885 --> 01:14:01,725
(Contrary to their worries, the pork is well-cooked till the inside.)

1671
01:14:02,356 --> 01:14:03,995
It looks so good.

1672
01:14:03,996 --> 01:14:05,525
- It's really tasty.
- My gosh.

1673
01:14:05,526 --> 01:14:06,665
This is seriously tasty.

1674
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:08,665
Let's eat while it's still warm.

1675
01:14:08,666 --> 01:14:11,835
(Youngest Yoon A takes a bite first.)

1676
01:14:12,265 --> 01:14:15,205
Careful. It's really juicy.

1677
01:14:15,206 --> 01:14:16,536
It looks so good.

1678
01:14:18,845 --> 01:14:20,845
(This... This is...)

1679
01:14:20,946 --> 01:14:22,245
You can talk and eat slowly.

1680
01:14:22,246 --> 01:14:25,185
(How good is it that you're acting like this?)

1681
01:14:26,416 --> 01:14:28,385
It's so delicious. Seriously!

1682
01:14:28,816 --> 01:14:29,916
(Amazing!)

1683
01:14:30,156 --> 01:14:32,124
- Is it that good?
- Yes. Really!

1684
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:33,155
- Really?
- Yes!

1685
01:14:33,156 --> 01:14:36,254
Move back. Now, Byoung Cheol!

1686
01:14:36,255 --> 01:14:37,655
(Next, Byoung Cheol takes a bite.)

1687
01:14:37,656 --> 01:14:38,666
- Try it.
- Is it good?

1688
01:14:39,425 --> 01:14:41,065
It's seasoned really well.

1689
01:14:41,066 --> 01:14:42,934
I seasoned it a bit.

1690
01:14:42,935 --> 01:14:44,935
- I can taste garlic as well.
- It's delicious.

1691
01:14:45,736 --> 01:14:47,435
(Is that it?)

1692
01:14:47,805 --> 01:14:48,835
(Gasp)

1693
01:14:50,206 --> 01:14:51,305
(Amazing!)

1694
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:54,276
(That's the taste.)

1695
01:14:57,045 --> 01:14:58,045
(Shy)

1696
01:14:58,046 --> 01:14:59,384
We should eat this while it's warm.

1697
01:14:59,385 --> 01:15:00,845
It's really tasty.

1698
01:15:01,185 --> 01:15:04,015
This is that.

1699
01:15:05,486 --> 01:15:06,655
This is water parsley.

1700
01:15:06,656 --> 01:15:08,755
(His eyes become wide open.)

1701
01:15:10,526 --> 01:15:13,125
This is unbelievable. It's so good.

1702
01:15:16,196 --> 01:15:19,166
What kind of flavor is this? This is insane!

1703
01:15:20,335 --> 01:15:21,805
Try this. It's water parsley.

1704
01:15:22,675 --> 01:15:23,935
Can you taste water parsley?

1705
01:15:25,946 --> 01:15:27,746
(Simply nodding)

1706
01:15:31,685 --> 01:15:32,685
(Intense humming)

1707
01:15:32,885 --> 01:15:33,885
- Right?
- Gosh!

1708
01:15:34,515 --> 01:15:36,986
(It's really delicious.)

1709
01:15:38,856 --> 01:15:40,156
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

1710
01:15:42,656 --> 01:15:44,725
- Is that all?
- Yes.

1711
01:15:46,265 --> 01:15:47,625
I want to live like him too.

1712
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,135
You could be like him.

1713
01:15:49,366 --> 01:15:50,695
Not making expressions like this.

1714
01:15:50,696 --> 01:15:52,666
- It's tender, yet chewy.
- Right.

1715
01:15:53,765 --> 01:15:56,406
- It's very firm too.
- Yes, it's tender, yet chewy.

1716
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:57,735
This has chives.

1717
01:15:57,736 --> 01:15:59,305
(Next is black pork with chives.)

1718
01:16:00,045 --> 01:16:01,975
We should've put angelica leaves in there.

1719
01:16:04,215 --> 01:16:05,616
And fatsia shoots.

1720
01:16:05,715 --> 01:16:06,785
Yes, we should have.

1721
01:16:06,786 --> 01:16:08,956
(We should've included my cheese too.)

1722
01:16:09,685 --> 01:16:11,286
This is a different cut.

1723
01:16:11,826 --> 01:16:13,856
- It's very juicy inside.
- There are chives in it?

1724
01:16:14,055 --> 01:16:15,696
Yes, it has chives.

1725
01:16:19,496 --> 01:16:20,794
It's juicy, right?

1726
01:16:20,795 --> 01:16:21,795
(Curious)

1727
01:16:22,335 --> 01:16:23,794
(This is it.)

1728
01:16:23,795 --> 01:16:25,505
(This is the one.)

1729
01:16:25,866 --> 01:16:27,205
It's different from the other one.

1730
01:16:27,206 --> 01:16:28,706
Right? Of course it's different.

1731
01:16:29,305 --> 01:16:32,044
- It tastes more smoked.
- It does?

1732
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,706
- This tastes more smoked?
- I'll step aside.

1733
01:16:34,446 --> 01:16:35,544
Is it that good?

1734
01:16:35,545 --> 01:16:36,645
- It's good.
- It's really good.

1735
01:16:36,646 --> 01:16:37,646
- Is it good?
- How is it?

1736
01:16:38,885 --> 01:16:40,445
- It tastes like...
- Does it taste different?

1737
01:16:40,446 --> 01:16:42,754
- It tastes like it's smoked.
- So I guess...

1738
01:16:42,755 --> 01:16:44,456
- it tastes different.
- It tastes like it's smoked.

1739
01:16:44,885 --> 01:16:47,325
(He feeds the members after feeding the guests.)

1740
01:16:47,326 --> 01:16:48,396
Here.

1741
01:16:48,555 --> 01:16:50,125
It's really good.

1742
01:16:50,225 --> 01:16:51,625
Take the whole thing. There's a little piece here.

1743
01:16:52,965 --> 01:16:55,594
(He fixes his gaze at the pork.)

1744
01:16:55,595 --> 01:16:56,635
How is it?

1745
01:16:57,396 --> 01:16:58,465
It tastes different!

1746
01:16:59,135 --> 01:17:00,365
- It tastes different, right?
- Yes.

1747
01:17:00,366 --> 01:17:03,175
I can smell the chives.

1748
01:17:04,746 --> 01:17:07,246
(Gulping)

1749
01:17:07,746 --> 01:17:08,874
Let's get ready to eat now.

1750
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:10,345
(He got playful.)

1751
01:17:10,816 --> 01:17:13,116
(Sulking)

1752
01:17:13,486 --> 01:17:14,714
(He gives a piece to Hee Won who worked hard.)

1753
01:17:14,715 --> 01:17:16,316
It tastes different from the previous one.

1754
01:17:17,215 --> 01:17:18,526
It tastes like smoked pork.

1755
01:17:21,356 --> 01:17:22,856
It does taste like smoked pork.

1756
01:17:23,425 --> 01:17:25,365
- It's good.
- It's really good.

1757
01:17:25,366 --> 01:17:26,465
(The bamboo black pork even makes Hee Won excited.)

1758
01:17:26,896 --> 01:17:29,135
I'll grill the densely lamellated oyster now.

1759
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:31,634
Just one shell takes up the whole space.

1760
01:17:31,635 --> 01:17:33,005
(The size of the lamellated oyster is huge.)

1761
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:34,365
I don't think it'll work.

1762
01:17:34,366 --> 01:17:35,535
No.

1763
01:17:35,536 --> 01:17:37,536
Could you not make that noise?

1764
01:17:37,875 --> 01:17:39,474
Why would you make that sound when we're cooking?

1765
01:17:39,475 --> 01:17:41,246
I'll try not to make the sound.

1766
01:17:41,715 --> 01:17:43,915
Pass me the chicken towel.

1767
01:17:43,916 --> 01:17:45,884
- Pass me the chicken towel.
- "Chicken towel"?

1768
01:17:45,885 --> 01:17:48,415
- I meant paper towel. I'm sorry.
- It's paper towel.

1769
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:49,616
I can't pronounce the words well...

1770
01:17:49,986 --> 01:17:52,355
- with Yoon A next to me.
- He asked for a chicken towel.

1771
01:17:52,356 --> 01:17:54,624
Yoon A, it's how we're always like.

1772
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:57,054
I'm so jealous. I love it here.

1773
01:17:57,055 --> 01:17:59,066
This is... Look at this, Yoon A. It's marsh clam soup.

1774
01:18:00,696 --> 01:18:01,765
Smell it.

1775
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:04,865
It smells refreshing. There are chives in it too.

1776
01:18:04,866 --> 01:18:06,635
- Gosh, it smells like the ocean.
- We'll add some pepper too.

1777
01:18:06,835 --> 01:18:08,374
It's not from the ocean. It's from fresh water.

1778
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:09,834
Goodness, it smells like fresh water.

1779
01:18:09,835 --> 01:18:11,776
(Changing her stance instantly)

1780
01:18:12,175 --> 01:18:14,505
You can suddenly smell the ocean?

1781
01:18:14,776 --> 01:18:16,145
But he said they're not from the ocean.

1782
01:18:16,146 --> 01:18:17,175
(Moving the marsh clam soup to the table)

1783
01:18:17,715 --> 01:18:19,715
It smells like fresh water.

1784
01:18:19,845 --> 01:18:20,915
(The densely lamellated oyster is starting to get cooked.)

1785
01:18:20,916 --> 01:18:22,116
Look at it steaming.

1786
01:18:23,755 --> 01:18:25,786
(Opening the well-cooked oyster)

1787
01:18:26,125 --> 01:18:27,255
(Exclaiming)

1788
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:29,625
(Their jaws drop.)

1789
01:18:31,125 --> 01:18:33,465
(Golden brown)

1790
01:18:34,396 --> 01:18:38,705
(The meat of densely lamellated oyster...)

1791
01:18:38,706 --> 01:18:42,805
(that's as big as a fist)

1792
01:18:44,706 --> 01:18:47,276
(Just two pieces of the oyster fill the entire dish.)

1793
01:18:47,975 --> 01:18:52,146
(It's too big, so he cuts them into small pieces.)

1794
01:18:52,345 --> 01:18:54,655
- Gosh, it's hot! It's so hot.
- Be careful.

1795
01:18:54,656 --> 01:18:55,715
Gosh, it's hot.

1796
01:18:56,385 --> 01:18:57,515
There. Let's go.

1797
01:18:57,885 --> 01:19:01,156
(How will the dinner filled with Hadong's seasonal dishes be?)

1798
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:02,695
It looks so good.

1799
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,094
(It's time to enjoy the feast.)

1800
01:19:04,095 --> 01:19:05,566
It's the best dinner we've ever had.

1801
01:19:06,666 --> 01:19:08,264
(I need to take a photo of this.)

1802
01:19:08,265 --> 01:19:09,435
Let's try it.

1803
01:19:09,595 --> 01:19:11,666
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1804
01:19:11,906 --> 01:19:13,105
Try them.

1805
01:19:13,106 --> 01:19:14,106
(A table filled with Moun Jiri's local specialties)

1806
01:19:14,435 --> 01:19:16,005
Hurry up and try them.

1807
01:19:16,175 --> 01:19:17,435
It won't be as good if it gets cold.

1808
01:19:17,536 --> 01:19:19,975
Go ahead and eat. Eat the pork first.

1809
01:19:20,206 --> 01:19:21,206
Try it.

1810
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:23,544
Byoung Cheol, hurry up and eat.

1811
01:19:23,545 --> 01:19:25,916
(Yoon A tries the piece of pork.)

1812
01:19:25,946 --> 01:19:27,584
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1813
01:19:27,585 --> 01:19:28,655
It's good.

1814
01:19:28,656 --> 01:19:29,855
It's well-seasoned.

1815
01:19:29,856 --> 01:19:31,356
(Byoung Cheol smells the food first.)

1816
01:19:31,555 --> 01:19:32,956
- Right?
- It's so good.

1817
01:19:35,156 --> 01:19:37,325
(They put in lots of effort into the bamboo black pork.)

1818
01:19:37,326 --> 01:19:38,326
It's good.

1819
01:19:39,425 --> 01:19:40,565
The meat is so good.

1820
01:19:40,566 --> 01:19:41,736
- Is it?
- Yes.

1821
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:43,834
(Sniffing)

1822
01:19:43,835 --> 01:19:45,005
It smells so good.

1823
01:19:45,666 --> 01:19:47,405
(It smells really nice, right?)

1824
01:19:47,406 --> 01:19:48,475
Carry it around to smell it.

1825
01:19:48,505 --> 01:19:50,275
- Try this.
- It smells so good.

1826
01:19:50,276 --> 01:19:52,405
(The scent of bamboo and green tea sipped into the meat.)

1827
01:19:52,406 --> 01:19:53,406
It's good.

1828
01:19:53,776 --> 01:19:55,014
It's really surprising.

1829
01:19:55,015 --> 01:19:56,715
(He's touched.)

1830
01:19:56,845 --> 01:19:59,045
- The meat is so good.
- Right.

1831
01:20:00,786 --> 01:20:03,254
(The black pork is soft and tender.)

1832
01:20:03,255 --> 01:20:05,125
- Goodness.
- It's really good.

1833
01:20:05,685 --> 01:20:08,896
The meat smells amazing. It's really good.

1834
01:20:09,326 --> 01:20:10,956
- The pork is...
- Also...

1835
01:20:11,725 --> 01:20:13,095
(Getting up)

1836
01:20:13,866 --> 01:20:16,066
This is grilled garlic. Try this.

1837
01:20:16,965 --> 01:20:18,206
(Having a piece of garlic)

1838
01:20:18,866 --> 01:20:20,165
(Garlic, bamboo, and green tea add more flavor to the pork.)

1839
01:20:20,166 --> 01:20:22,335
The garlic isn't strong at all.

1840
01:20:23,475 --> 01:20:25,446
It doesn't smell like garlic at all.

1841
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:26,946
(Exclaiming)

1842
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:28,515
It doesn't smell like one, right?

1843
01:20:28,746 --> 01:20:29,975
It tastes like a potato.

1844
01:20:31,715 --> 01:20:33,684
- Hee Won, - It's so good.

1845
01:20:33,685 --> 01:20:35,884
it doesn't smell like garlic at all.

1846
01:20:35,885 --> 01:20:37,416
It has its scent. Try it.

1847
01:20:38,885 --> 01:20:40,225
(Exclaiming)

1848
01:20:44,326 --> 01:20:46,196
(Glancing)

1849
01:20:46,326 --> 01:20:48,066
Why would you study my face when it's good?

1850
01:20:48,536 --> 01:20:50,365
- Hey.
- It smells like garlic a little.

1851
01:20:50,366 --> 01:20:51,464
(I'm being honest.)

1852
01:20:51,465 --> 01:20:53,236
(It does?)

1853
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:59,246
I need to stir it like this. Clams are piled up at the bottom.

1854
01:21:00,576 --> 01:21:01,674
Add some pepper.

1855
01:21:01,675 --> 01:21:03,514
(Adding pepper...)

1856
01:21:03,515 --> 01:21:05,715
(and chives with much effort)

1857
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:08,555
(He's busy.)

1858
01:21:08,856 --> 01:21:10,815
There's a line of customers, so eat it up fast and leave.

1859
01:21:10,816 --> 01:21:11,885
Okay, okay.

1860
01:21:11,956 --> 01:21:13,624
We need our customers to eat fast.

1861
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:14,684
(Dong Il's marsh clam soup restaurant is doing really well.)

1862
01:21:14,685 --> 01:21:15,956
You're busy all alone.

1863
01:21:16,456 --> 01:21:17,495
My son is here to help though.

1864
01:21:17,496 --> 01:21:19,995
- Oh, he's your son?
- Yes, he came to help me.

1865
01:21:19,996 --> 01:21:22,295
What are you saying, sir? When are you going to pay me?

1866
01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:24,196
You punk. That's not a thing to say to your father.

1867
01:21:24,906 --> 01:21:25,906
How dare you.

1868
01:21:26,606 --> 01:21:29,475
(While the members are putting on a skit...)

1869
01:21:30,076 --> 01:21:33,305
- Here. Yoon A, you have it first.
- Thank you.

1870
01:21:33,576 --> 01:21:35,044
When are you going to pay me?

1871
01:21:35,045 --> 01:21:36,845
(Let me try it.)

1872
01:21:37,545 --> 01:21:38,915
(Exclaiming)

1873
01:21:38,916 --> 01:21:40,044
Here. Let's try it.

1874
01:21:40,045 --> 01:21:42,486
(Si Wan slurps in the marsh clam soup.)

1875
01:21:43,156 --> 01:21:44,714
(Impressed)

1876
01:21:44,715 --> 01:21:45,856
It's so good.

1877
01:21:46,185 --> 01:21:48,055
(The owner slurps in the soup too.)

1878
01:21:48,425 --> 01:21:50,255
The soup is so good.

1879
01:21:50,326 --> 01:21:51,396
It's good.

1880
01:21:52,526 --> 01:21:53,665
It's really refreshing.

1881
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:54,725
(The marsh clam soup is neat and refreshing.)

1882
01:21:54,866 --> 01:21:56,195
(He takes a piece of marsh clam...)

1883
01:21:56,196 --> 01:21:57,666
(and tries it.)

1884
01:21:58,036 --> 01:21:59,434
The marsh clam...

1885
01:21:59,435 --> 01:22:01,106
tastes like rockfish.

1886
01:22:01,906 --> 01:22:03,776
It's crunchy.

1887
01:22:04,206 --> 01:22:07,245
- It's really chewy too.
- Right.

1888
01:22:07,246 --> 01:22:08,316
That's how marsh clam tastes.

1889
01:22:09,515 --> 01:22:11,884
(Byoung Cheol carefully takes a bite of the soup.)

1890
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:14,315
- There's so much in it.
- I think you spilled it on me.

1891
01:22:14,316 --> 01:22:16,715
(This is so good.)

1892
01:22:17,616 --> 01:22:20,656
(He drinks the soup from the bowl.)

1893
01:22:21,385 --> 01:22:22,396
(Exclaiming)

1894
01:22:22,795 --> 01:22:24,055
(Having another sip)

1895
01:22:26,425 --> 01:22:27,625
(Having another sip)

1896
01:22:30,366 --> 01:22:34,606
(He's gulping down the soup.)

1897
01:22:35,106 --> 01:22:36,335
(Having another sip)

1898
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:41,044
We should give the whole pot to Byoung Cheol.

1899
01:22:41,045 --> 01:22:42,076
He loves marsh clam.

1900
01:22:42,116 --> 01:22:44,015
(I love marsh clam.)

1901
01:22:44,276 --> 01:22:45,485
Byoung Cheol, eat a lot.

1902
01:22:45,486 --> 01:22:47,116
Okay. Thank you.

1903
01:22:47,515 --> 01:22:49,885
(Have a lot, Byoung Cheol.)

1904
01:22:50,316 --> 01:22:51,525
It's so warm and nice.

1905
01:22:51,526 --> 01:22:55,196
(He's totally in love with marsh clam.)

1906
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,839
This is grilled oyster.

1907
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,908
- Try the grilled oyster.
- It looks good.

1908
01:22:59,909 --> 01:23:01,079
It looks so good.

1909
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:03,448
My, it looks so good.

1910
01:23:03,449 --> 01:23:04,849
We should try the grilled oyster.

1911
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:06,520
Try this. Dip it in chogochujang.

1912
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:08,658
(Dipping the well-grilled oyster...)

1913
01:23:08,659 --> 01:23:10,890
(in chogochujang)

1914
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:13,630
(Having a big bite)

1915
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,730
Si Wan, it's good, right?

1916
01:23:16,829 --> 01:23:18,028
(Thumbs-up)

1917
01:23:18,029 --> 01:23:19,699
It's the best.

1918
01:23:20,999 --> 01:23:23,039
- Is it okay?
- Yes, it's nice.

1919
01:23:24,869 --> 01:23:27,369
(He takes another bite because it's so good.)

1920
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,879
It's really chewy.

1921
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,038
(The oyster is tender and sweet.)

1922
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:32,980
- We don't need to season it, right?
- No.

1923
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:36,318
It's seasoned well enough.

1924
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:37,319
(It's savory even if you don't dip it in chogochujang.)

1925
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,350
It's good.

1926
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:42,989
(It's really good.)

1927
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,159
(You can't skip on rice when you have all these side dishes.)

1928
01:23:46,359 --> 01:23:48,090
(Exclaiming)

1929
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:49,760
(Gulping)

1930
01:23:49,761 --> 01:23:51,059
It looks really good.

1931
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:53,569
(They made rice with multiple grains today.)

1932
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,100
It's different from other rice.

1933
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,409
- I know. It's nutritious rice.
- It is.

1934
01:23:59,709 --> 01:24:01,068
It has all the healthy grains.

1935
01:24:01,069 --> 01:24:02,778
- Yes, it has everything.
- It's nutritious rice.

1936
01:24:02,779 --> 01:24:04,640
- It's nutritious rice.
- It looks good.

1937
01:24:05,449 --> 01:24:07,109
(Blowing)

1938
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,590
(Amazed)

1939
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:14,190
It's really good.

1940
01:24:14,289 --> 01:24:16,020
It's a little dry.

1941
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:19,029
I love it.

1942
01:24:20,029 --> 01:24:21,159
Do you want to add margarine to it?

1943
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:22,800
That sounds nice!

1944
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:26,100
Dong Il loves margarine.

1945
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:29,770
I used to live next to an American army base when I was young.

1946
01:24:30,369 --> 01:24:33,140
If you mix margarine and soy sauce with rice, it's incredible.

1947
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:35,379
- It's better than anything.
- You need to add margarine...

1948
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,180
- when the rice is hot.
- Here, here. I'm sorry.

1949
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:39,708
(The margarine lover came back at lightning speed.)

1950
01:24:39,709 --> 01:24:41,279
- You need to add it when it's warm.
- Right.

1951
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:44,549
Here, add some.

1952
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:45,550
(Add the margarine.)

1953
01:24:45,749 --> 01:24:47,818
Margarine goes well with pretty much everything.

1954
01:24:47,819 --> 01:24:48,920
(Adding a spoonful of margarine)

1955
01:24:49,159 --> 01:24:50,618
(He's adding that much?)

1956
01:24:50,619 --> 01:24:53,560
Are you frying the rice? Are you going to fry it?

1957
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:55,760
- You can add this much.
- Add the soy sauce.

1958
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:59,300
That's enough. You need to add only a little.

1959
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:01,868
Look at the margarine melting.

1960
01:25:01,869 --> 01:25:04,198
- It melts in no time.
- It really does.

1961
01:25:04,199 --> 01:25:06,439
- Of course.
- It's because I brought it fast.

1962
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,470
(But there's still a lot of margarine.)

1963
01:25:07,739 --> 01:25:11,278
You can just leave out a chunk if it doesn't melt.

1964
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:13,609
(Laughing)

1965
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,318
(He takes a bite as he's worried about its taste.)

1966
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:17,350
(Amazed)

1967
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:20,920
This is it.

1968
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:23,359
You can leave out the chunk.

1969
01:25:23,789 --> 01:25:25,890
(He returns the margarine he took.)

1970
01:25:26,459 --> 01:25:29,230
He took out some margarine, and it's this big.

1971
01:25:29,699 --> 01:25:31,659
(I told you. You added too much.)

1972
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:34,229
It tastes too greasy already.

1973
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:35,600
(He's regretting it.)

1974
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,038
Let's have it with margarine.

1975
01:25:40,039 --> 01:25:41,840
(Nodding)

1976
01:25:42,609 --> 01:25:46,079
(The savory scent of margarine is added to the chewy rice.)

1977
01:25:46,149 --> 01:25:47,649
This is incredible, Dong Il.

1978
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:51,049
Let's have the pork on top of this.

1979
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:52,520
(The delicious rice stimulates their appetite again.)

1980
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:55,050
(Having a big bite)

1981
01:25:55,319 --> 01:25:56,788
- This is really good.
- I know.

1982
01:25:56,789 --> 01:25:58,219
It's so good.

1983
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:59,488
(The top-quality side dishes taste even better with rice.)

1984
01:25:59,489 --> 01:26:01,359
If you're enjoying this much, that means it's really good.

1985
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,699
The food combination is really funny though.

1986
01:26:04,829 --> 01:26:08,170
We're having marsh clams with bamboo black pork.

1987
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:10,698
We basically traveled from the top of the mountain...

1988
01:26:10,699 --> 01:26:11,770
to the deep water.

1989
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:13,969
From the top of the mountain.

1990
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:16,579
(A gourmet tour that ranges over the mountains and rivers)

1991
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:19,309
The dishes are perfect for spring.

1992
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:21,350
Right, they're perfect for spring.

1993
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:23,920
(She's happy.)

1994
01:26:24,248 --> 01:26:27,019
I ate so well that I feel like the trip was therapeutic.

1995
01:26:27,218 --> 01:26:28,949
I enjoyed visiting the places too.

1996
01:26:29,548 --> 01:26:30,717
Thank you so much.

1997
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:31,957
(Thank you for making all these dishes.)

1998
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:35,787
- Seriously. It's so good.
- It's not over yet.

1999
01:26:35,788 --> 01:26:36,988
We have to eat the dried persimmons.

2000
01:26:36,989 --> 01:26:40,798
- There's still more? We ate a lot.
- There's a lot more to eat.

2001
01:26:41,428 --> 01:26:42,928
Why are you thanking us already?

2002
01:26:43,328 --> 01:26:45,098
Thank you for everything you did up until now.

2003
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:46,768
I'll thank you more later.

2004
01:26:46,769 --> 01:26:48,239
- Of course.
- Okay.

2005
01:26:48,439 --> 01:26:51,208
I thought you were leaving without eating the dried persimmons.

2006
01:26:51,569 --> 01:26:54,838
(Of course I should have it.)

2007
01:26:56,949 --> 01:27:00,417
(Having the dried persimmon roll with cheese...)

2008
01:27:00,418 --> 01:27:03,819
(with sujeonggwa that helps with digestion)

2009
01:27:04,689 --> 01:27:07,359
(Working hard)

2010
01:27:07,718 --> 01:27:11,029
(Adding pine nuts as a decoration)

2011
01:27:11,328 --> 01:27:13,399
I should make one more thing.

2012
01:27:14,428 --> 01:27:17,797
(Kneeling...)

2013
01:27:17,798 --> 01:27:21,168
(like a lady)

2014
01:27:21,538 --> 01:27:22,667
(Adding a spoon of ricotta cheese)

2015
01:27:22,668 --> 01:27:24,268
(Adding another spoon)

2016
01:27:24,269 --> 01:27:27,239
(Adding three spoons in total)

2017
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,609
(Focusing)

2018
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:35,319
(Pouring a bowl of sweet honey)

2019
01:27:36,649 --> 01:27:37,819
(It's done!)

2020
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:39,659
(Getting a tissue)

2021
01:27:41,288 --> 01:27:44,428
(He wipes it clean for the finishing touch.)

2022
01:27:44,529 --> 01:27:47,298
(Meticulous)

2023
01:27:49,069 --> 01:27:52,997
(A special dessert prepared by the guests)

2024
01:27:52,998 --> 01:27:54,837
- It looks good. There's honey...
- It feels like a cafe.

2025
01:27:54,838 --> 01:27:56,739
and cheese too. Goodness.

2026
01:27:57,008 --> 01:27:59,537
(With sweet and salty honey and cheese,)

2027
01:27:59,538 --> 01:28:01,278
Byoung Cheol. Goodness.

2028
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:02,909
(they're having rolled dried persimmons in sujeonggwa.)

2029
01:28:02,949 --> 01:28:05,718
The white thing here is ricotta cheese.

2030
01:28:05,878 --> 01:28:08,717
And I added a bit of honey...

2031
01:28:08,718 --> 01:28:10,889
that I brought yesterday.

2032
01:28:11,189 --> 01:28:15,327
When you have a bite, you'll be able to taste...

2033
01:28:15,328 --> 01:28:18,088
the sweet and salty cheese. I added some nuts too.

2034
01:28:18,659 --> 01:28:20,498
You can have it like this.

2035
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:24,269
(Graceful)

2036
01:28:24,498 --> 01:28:26,099
(It looks good.)

2037
01:28:26,168 --> 01:28:27,998
It's savory and sweet.

2038
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:30,867
It's salty too. There are many flavors.

2039
01:28:30,868 --> 01:28:31,909
(Even his description is graceful.)

2040
01:28:32,208 --> 01:28:33,739
That's what tteokbokki tastes like.

2041
01:28:34,508 --> 01:28:35,508
(Laughing)

2042
01:28:35,509 --> 01:28:37,608
Savory, sweet, and salty?

2043
01:28:37,609 --> 01:28:38,779
It's salty too.

2044
01:28:39,618 --> 01:28:40,849
This is amazing.

2045
01:28:42,389 --> 01:28:45,588
(Yoon A also has a bite of the cheese gracefully.)

2046
01:28:45,989 --> 01:28:48,958
(How does the honey cheese Byoung Cheol made taste?)

2047
01:28:49,128 --> 01:28:50,757
(Impressed)

2048
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:52,059
It's good.

2049
01:28:53,128 --> 01:28:55,668
Wow, this is a really good dessert.

2050
01:28:55,729 --> 01:28:57,297
I know.

2051
01:28:57,298 --> 01:28:58,428
(It's delicious.)

2052
01:28:58,998 --> 01:29:01,238
- It's really soft.
- It's soft, right?

2053
01:29:01,239 --> 01:29:02,609
It's really good.

2054
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:04,639
Thank you.

2055
01:29:05,639 --> 01:29:07,908
It tastes like an expensive dessert.

2056
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:09,008
Right.

2057
01:29:10,409 --> 01:29:11,448
It's really good.

2058
01:29:11,449 --> 01:29:12,848
(Having sweet dried persimmon roll...)

2059
01:29:12,849 --> 01:29:15,689
(with salty cheese)

2060
01:29:16,449 --> 01:29:17,787
(They pleasantly end their meal with a delicious dessert.)

2061
01:29:17,788 --> 01:29:18,958
It's good.

2062
01:29:22,029 --> 01:29:23,328
I'll hold it.

2063
01:29:24,128 --> 01:29:26,559
(Looking friendly)

2064
01:29:26,758 --> 01:29:28,828
(Smile.)

2065
01:29:28,998 --> 01:29:31,569
1, 2, 3.

2066
01:29:31,868 --> 01:29:34,337
I had so much fun thanks to Si Wan.

2067
01:29:34,338 --> 01:29:36,408
My goodness. Not at all.

2068
01:29:36,409 --> 01:29:37,439
(They made another great memory at Mount Jiri.)

2069
01:29:38,409 --> 01:29:42,248
(House on Wheels is on Jeju Island.)

2070
01:29:43,149 --> 01:29:45,207
(The 10th front yard of House on Wheels...)

2071
01:29:45,208 --> 01:29:46,479
(is surrounded by woods.)

2072
01:29:46,649 --> 01:29:49,319
(He's finally here.)

2073
01:29:49,418 --> 01:29:52,659
(It's really good to see him.)

2074
01:29:52,788 --> 01:29:55,489
(The original youngest member, Yeo Jin Goo)

2075
01:29:55,859 --> 01:29:58,328
(He grinds coffee beans after a long while.)

2076
01:29:58,489 --> 01:30:01,128
(He sets up a tarp after a long while too.)

2077
01:30:01,298 --> 01:30:04,798
(The four of them enjoy off-roading.)

2078
01:30:04,828 --> 01:30:08,167
(Jin Goo, keep your guard up.)

2079
01:30:08,168 --> 01:30:10,939
(Shaking)

2080
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:13,678
(Grunting)

2081
01:30:13,838 --> 01:30:17,008
(Jin Goo is still a good cook.)

2082
01:30:17,949 --> 01:30:20,849
(Slurping)

2083
01:30:21,019 --> 01:30:22,519
(It's the best ramyeon in the world.)

2084
01:30:22,618 --> 01:30:24,649
(I'm so happy today.)

2085
01:30:24,989 --> 01:30:26,688
(The complete members of House on Wheels...)

2086
01:30:26,689 --> 01:30:29,059
(will have another enjoyable trip next week.)
