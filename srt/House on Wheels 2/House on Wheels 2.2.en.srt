1
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:32,447
(To our house surrounded by fir trees deep in the mountains,)

2
00:00:33,218 --> 00:00:36,048
(a friendly guest has visited.)

3
00:00:37,457 --> 00:00:40,527
(The heartwarming guest who will melt the frozen House on Wheels)

4
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:43,997
(Actor Kim Dong Wook)

5
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:45,428
Dong Il, have a strawberry.

6
00:00:45,428 --> 00:00:47,168
(He even feeds Dong Il a strawberry.)

7
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:50,937
(He doesn't forget to give the gloves to Hee Won.)

8
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:54,738
(He's good with housework too.)

9
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:57,207
(And he smiles all the time.)

10
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:02,577
(A gift-like day that is as warm as the falling snow...)

11
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:06,918
(begins now.)

12
00:01:09,448 --> 00:01:12,918
(A new day...)

13
00:01:12,918 --> 00:01:16,827
(at Pyeongchang has begun.)

14
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:23,397
(The morning in Pyeongchang is as cold as the night before.)

15
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:27,907
(Did the members greet their first winter morning well?)

16
00:01:29,508 --> 00:01:32,478
(The members are huddled around the blanket.)

17
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:35,747
(Melting his frozen feet)

18
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:37,818
What's the current temperature?

19
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:40,148
Wow, it's only minus 12°C.

20
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:41,788
- Minus 12°C? - Minus 12°C?

21
00:01:41,788 --> 00:01:43,318
Gosh.

22
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:45,418
This is too much.

23
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,088
Dong Il, I'm hungry.

24
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:50,928
You are? Then we should have breakfast.

25
00:01:51,127 --> 00:01:53,327
- Minus 12°C? - Where are you going?

26
00:01:53,327 --> 00:01:55,198
I'll go boil the broth first.

27
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:56,967
- It must be all frozen. - Right.

28
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:59,237
It'll melt soon once I heat it up.

29
00:02:00,368 --> 00:02:04,877
(Will the dried pollack broth they made last night be okay?)

30
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:10,777
(Safely filmed with the permission of a landowner)

31
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:14,648
My gosh, it turned into dongchimi.

32
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:17,558
It's all frozen.

33
00:02:17,558 --> 00:02:19,588
(Thin ice formed on its surface overnight.)

34
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:23,058
(The dried pollack broth they made last night...)

35
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:26,668
(fought against the severe cold all alone...)

36
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:29,168
(Trembling)

37
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:32,938
(and transformed into cold broth.)

38
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:38,307
(Moving it carefully)

39
00:02:39,538 --> 00:02:41,978
- Shall I make some tea? - That sounds lovely.

40
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:44,318
- Can I make you some coffee? - I'd love that.

41
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:48,087
We're divided into coffee lovers and milk tea lovers.

42
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:49,987
(In the meantime, Doo Na and Si Wan prepare some tea and coffee.)

43
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:55,557
I should take a rest this morning.

44
00:02:55,788 --> 00:02:56,797
(No, you can't.)

45
00:02:56,797 --> 00:02:57,897
(Startled)

46
00:02:57,998 --> 00:03:00,198
- No, you can't. You need to... - Why not?

47
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:01,797
teach me how to grind coffee beans.

48
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:03,028
- Coffee? - Yes.

49
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:04,668
- Grinding coffee beans? - Yes.

50
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:05,698
I'm also not good at it.

51
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:09,207
Jin Goo did not teach you before he left.

52
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:12,077
This? Well, I didn't know he'd have to teach me stuff.

53
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:15,177
Maybe I set it too low.

54
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:19,218
(Pouring the coffee beans into the grinder)

55
00:03:19,218 --> 00:03:23,017
So when the beans are ground, it comes out here, right?

56
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:25,318
Then I'm using that to brew coffee?

57
00:03:25,718 --> 00:03:27,327
Right. After grinding them,

58
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:30,498
you'll need to pour water.

59
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,468
(I think that'll work.)

60
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:36,528
(Interested)

61
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:37,737
(Grinding)

62
00:03:38,998 --> 00:03:40,267
Here it is.

63
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:42,337
(Doo Na is preparing to make milk tea.)

64
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:44,478
Oh, no. Why isn't water coming out?

65
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:47,378
(Did the pipe freeze and burst when the winter is almost over?)

66
00:03:47,748 --> 00:03:49,878
We're out of water!

67
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:54,218
Water...

68
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:56,818
I need water.

69
00:03:56,818 --> 00:03:59,318
(Doo Na looks for water in the fridge.)

70
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:01,728
This is completely frozen.

71
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:03,758
- Did you freeze them on purpose? - Let me see.

72
00:04:05,057 --> 00:04:06,198
(Why did the water in the fridge freeze?)

73
00:04:06,198 --> 00:04:07,427
Why did it freeze?

74
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:11,198
(What's going on?)

75
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:14,637
Oh, here it is. Let me increase the temperature.

76
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:18,577
(There's ice in the bottle.)

77
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:21,878
(While the water for tea boils...)

78
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:24,077
I'll do all the manual work.

79
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:26,248
- I'll do the manual work. - No, I'll do it.

80
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:29,748
(Cozy)

81
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:33,887
(This is nice.)

82
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:38,658
(Listening to Hee Won...)

83
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:42,028
(grinding coffee,)

84
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:49,038
(they've forgotten the cold...)

85
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:56,877
(and become drowsy as it's warm inside.)

86
00:04:58,377 --> 00:05:03,187
Are there people who enjoy camping in the winter when it's this cold?

87
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:04,888
Of course. There are so many.

88
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:08,158
Many women go camping alone too.

89
00:05:09,127 --> 00:05:13,197
I can't even imagine as I've only lived in the city.

90
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:17,497
But I want to try it since I'm here. Have you ever tried it?

91
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:20,468
- It's my first time. - Me too.

92
00:05:20,468 --> 00:05:22,038
(It's his first time too.)

93
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:24,107
I've never gone camping in this cold.

94
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:29,848
I go to a hotel when the boiler at home breaks.

95
00:05:29,848 --> 00:05:31,117
(It's currently minus 12°C.)

96
00:05:32,578 --> 00:05:34,447
You're talking nonsense.

97
00:05:35,247 --> 00:05:37,117
(Laughing)

98
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:41,588
I need some of the dried pollack broth.

99
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:43,187
I'll go get it.

100
00:05:44,098 --> 00:05:47,898
(Hee Won heads outside as soon as Dong Il says he needs something.)

101
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:49,728
(Here it goes.)

102
00:05:50,898 --> 00:05:52,867
(Si Wan is finally ready to brew some coffee.)

103
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:55,468
I think I'm all set to brew some coffee.

104
00:05:57,737 --> 00:06:01,507
When Jin Goo brewed it, it foamed up.

105
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,018
(I hope it'll be delicious.)

106
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:05,377
Coffee bread...

107
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:07,687
- Si Wan. - Yes?

108
00:06:07,687 --> 00:06:09,348
Si Wan, hold this for me.

109
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:12,357
(Hurrying off)

110
00:06:12,557 --> 00:06:14,127
Si Wan, hold this for me.

111
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:16,487
(As soon as he turned his back, the filter gets torn.)

112
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:19,828
(A high-resolution version)

113
00:06:19,828 --> 00:06:22,398
- It's not hot. Is it? - No, it's not hot.

114
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:23,638
(He has no idea what happened.)

115
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:25,867
- It's really cold, right? - It's really cold.

116
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,038
It's minus 12°C right now.

117
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,607
Dong Il, that's all the broth I could get.

118
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:31,208
- Really? - Yes.

119
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,807
(Did it brew well?)

120
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:38,047
- Hee Won, I'm in trouble. - What's wrong?

121
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:41,648
- It's not working? Why? - It even got torn.

122
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:46,218
(What on earth happened?)

123
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:48,658
- What's wrong with this? - It got torn.

124
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:50,057
It got torn.

125
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:51,797
The coffee grounds fell into the kettle.

126
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:53,398
Because the filter got torn.

127
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:54,697
Goodness.

128
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:55,768
(Disappointed)

129
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:58,968
There shouldn't be a hole in the filter.

130
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:01,208
Of course not.

131
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:03,038
What happened to this?

132
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:07,778
I need to look up how to grind coffee beans.

133
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,778
No, the way I ground them is correct.

134
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:13,218
You just grind them like that. Maybe the filter is defective.

135
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:16,987
Or did we place the filter in the wrong way?

136
00:07:17,588 --> 00:07:19,317
Maybe we should fold it once.

137
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:24,098
I think the bottom part needs to be sharp. Maybe not.

138
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:27,968
Then I need to grind the beans again?

139
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:30,937
(Never-ending grinding)

140
00:07:30,937 --> 00:07:33,168
(Grinding)

141
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:36,902
Then I need to grind the beans again?

142
00:07:38,212 --> 00:07:40,042
(Never-ending grinding)

143
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,112
(Grinding)

144
00:07:42,612 --> 00:07:44,112
Doo Na, what is this?

145
00:07:44,552 --> 00:07:48,081
It's tea. I'm going to make milk tea out of it.

146
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:49,251
- Then I... - Do you want one?

147
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:50,691
Okay, I'll have milk tea too.

148
00:07:51,191 --> 00:07:52,992
I want it the way you usually have it.

149
00:07:52,992 --> 00:07:55,562
- No, it'll be too sweet for you. - Oh, really?

150
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,031
- I usually add lots of sugar. - Oh, really?

151
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:01,761
- Then don't put sugar in mine. - Okay.

152
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:04,131
I just love sugar so much.

153
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:06,232
- You mean sugar? - Yes.

154
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:08,041
(When water starts to boil...)

155
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,072
Bring it to a boil.

156
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:11,871
(Singing)

157
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:13,612
(Put the Earl Grey tea into the pot.)

158
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:15,682
(Swirling)

159
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:18,582
(When the tea is brewed,)

160
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:23,952
(add some milk to soften the bitter taste of the tea.)

161
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:26,021
Cinnamon.

162
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:27,761
(Add cinnamon sticks for more fragrance.)

163
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:30,531
This is Si Wan's tea without sugar.

164
00:08:31,492 --> 00:08:33,592
(This is for Si Wan.)

165

(This is nice.)

170
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:56,952
For mine, I'm going to add sugar.

171
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:59,391

It feels like I'm traveling around the world.

189

(Grunting)

191
00:09:54,712 --> 00:09:56,511

(Boiling)

208

The grandma made this with all her heart.

209
00:10:58,171 --> 00:10:59,972
It's tofu. Right, Hee Won?

210
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:00,982
Of course.

211
00:11:01,082 --> 00:11:03,182
You made this yourself, ma'am?

212
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:06,182
- Yes, I made it at home. - She made it herself.

221
00:11:36,411 --> 00:11:38,452
Where's the oil we bought yesterday?

222
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:40,151
That oil...

223
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:41,621
- Sansho oil? - Right. Sansho oil.

224

Hey, this sansho...

226
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:52,332
- What was it? - Sansho oil?

227
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:53,992
- Right. Sansho oil. - Sansho oil.

228
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:56,062
My goodness. It's quite aromatic.

229
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,332
(How is it special?)

230
00:11:58,332 --> 00:11:59,801
- I like the smell of it. - We should open the window.

231

238

- I like the smell of sansho oil. - Yes.

239
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:25,891
Hold on a second. Goodness.

240
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:28,102
- The aroma is very exotic. - Right.

241
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:30,771
The color of tofu is changed, isn't it?

242
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:32,832
It looks green.

243
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:35,371
(Greased with sansho oil, tofu turned yellow-green.)

244

249
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:54,192
Are you done with the sesame seeds?

250
00:12:54,362 --> 00:12:55,921
No, not yet. I need it for other dishes.

- Right. - The sound of frying pancakes...

267
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:42,401
and all these.

268
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,511
And the sunlight pours in.

269

- It feels like a national holiday. - Gosh.

270
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:48,582
You seem to know a lot.

271
00:13:49,112 --> 00:13:51,781
- You haven't smelt sansho oil? - No, I haven't. What's it like?

272
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:52,852
It's very unusual.

273
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:54,521
Sansho oil?

274
00:13:55,082 --> 00:13:58,251

- My mom told me this. - About what?

290
00:14:26,251 --> 00:14:28,021
She said a man with no talent has good fortune.

291
00:14:28,222 --> 00:14:29,281
Of course.

292
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,021

310
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:27,842
We don't care about the taste.

311
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:28,911

Thank you.

00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:10,722
It leaves a bitter aftertaste.

328
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:12,722
(It has a bitter aftertaste.)

329
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:13,822
The aftertaste...

330
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:15,092
(Expected reaction)

331
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:16,822
(I'm joking.)

332
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:18,092
The coffee tastes...

333
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:22,562
- It looks delicious. - Hold on. It's almost done.

334
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:25,832
I guess it's infused well...

335
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:28,571
- if it has a conscience. - What? The soup?

336
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,372
- The broth. Yes. - Of course.

337
00:16:30,372 --> 00:16:31,912
Potatoes should be more...

338
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:34,611
It'd be great if the potatoes are well cooked.

339
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:36,412
At this moment, have a cup of coffee.

340
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,251
Thank you. Hold it for me.

341
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:40,452
(They are on good terms.)

342
00:16:40,452 --> 00:16:43,182
I thought it was perfect timing...

343
00:16:43,182 --> 00:16:44,591
for caffeine.

344
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:48,061
(Lastly, he seasons the soup with soy sauce.)

345
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:50,892
(To wrap up, he sprinkles sesame seeds.)

346
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:53,331
Set the table there.

347
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:55,331
- Sorry? Yes. - The table.

348
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:58,902
(They quickly organize stuff at the thought of having breakfast.)

349
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:02,101
(Groaning)

350
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:03,902
I'll scoop Korean thistle rice.

351
00:17:05,142 --> 00:17:07,642
Great. I'm having Korean thistle rice at last.

352
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,452
I've completely forgotten...

353
00:17:11,712 --> 00:17:13,111
- about Korean thistle rice. - Yes.

354
00:17:13,412 --> 00:17:14,452
Like this.

355
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:15,722
(Last night)

356
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:16,952
We don't have that.

357
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,222
(Si Wan cooked Korean thistle rice with his delicate hands.)

358
00:17:18,222 --> 00:17:19,452
With this amount of water.

359
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:20,452
It's done.

360
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:24,122
(How did it turn out?)

361
00:17:24,122 --> 00:17:25,232
Okay.

362
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:29,301
Goodness. The rice is colored now.

363
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:30,861
- Is it? - Yes.

364
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:34,672
You won't be able to forget this.

365
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:35,742
(Korean thistle rice of Gangwon Province)

366
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:39,541
I didn't add beaten eggs because it will make the soup thick.

367
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:40,872
- Yes. - Okay.

368
00:17:42,982 --> 00:17:45,152
Please give me a lot of dried pollack.

369
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:46,712
- Yes. - A lot of dried pollack.

370
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:48,452
Okay.

371
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:52,751
The soup looks great.

372
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:55,091
Thank you so much.

373
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:57,521
It must be delicious.

374
00:17:58,061 --> 00:17:59,132
Well, first...

375
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:01,261
- Let's eat. - Yes.

376
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:03,962
Thank you for the meal. My gosh!

377

(Homely and aromatic Korean thistle rice)

381
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:20,382
(Full of Gangwon Province's fragrance)

382

383
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:24,722
Thank you for the food.

384
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:26,351
Thank you so much for the food.

385
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:27,622
- I'll try it. - Okay.

386
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,222
- Use this to scoop it. - Okay.

387
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:32,192
- Right. We need that... - What's that?

388
00:18:32,432 --> 00:18:33,732
Use this to scoop it.

389
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:35,261
So this is the Korean thistle rice.

390
00:18:35,261 --> 00:18:37,202
(Add Dong Il's sauce to Korean thistle rice.)

391
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:38,732
With the scissors...

(Mixing)

393
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:43,071
If it's long... If you don't cut it into pieces,

394
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,271
it's hard to chew.

395
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:47,172
Korean thistle is tough.

396
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:49,041
(Savoring)

397
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:50,682

It's delicious. Dried pollack hangover soup.

400
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:03,392
Do you like the broth?

401
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,932
- Isn't it rich? - It's so rich.

402
00:19:05,031 --> 00:19:06,162
It eases my stomach.

403
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:08,861
It's so delicious.

- Doo Na, I didn't drink last night, - Yes.

406
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:17,001
but it sobers me up.

407
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:18,041
(Opening his eyes wide)

408
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:20,511

00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:22,011
(Dried pollack soup has become richer after boiling for long.)

410
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:24,341
Use this to scoop it.

411
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:25,882
So this is the Korean thistle rice.

412
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:26,912
(Their hands are busy because of all the delicacies.)

413
00:19:28,652 --> 00:19:29,751

The broth is good.

418
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:39,432
The bracken is really good. It tastes like meat.

419
00:19:39,561 --> 00:19:41,162
Right. Bracken is delicious.

420
00:19:41,162 --> 00:19:43,031
(Let me try it.)

421
00:19:43,402 --> 00:19:44,972
(Amazed)

422
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:47,001
These vegetables are so delicious.

423
00:19:47,472 --> 00:19:48,942
This is good as well. Chwinamul.

424
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:50,041
- Is it good? - Yes, it's delicious.

425
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:53,142

This... I fried it in sansho oil.

429
00:19:58,382 --> 00:20:00,482
- What is sansho? - It's sansho.

430
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:03,051
When we eat loach soup, there's the powder.

431
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:06,021
This is the oil made from it.

432
00:20:06,892 --> 00:20:09,162
Take one. Yes, put it on rice.

433
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:10,821
(Taking a bite)

434
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,432
Yes, with rice.

435
00:20:13,132 --> 00:20:15,001
- The taste is exotic. - Right.

436
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:16,561
It reminds me of living abroad.

437

(Hee Won eats a big piece with rice.)

438

Let me do it for you.

This is no joke.

443
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,982
- Thank you. - The sansho oil makes it different.

444
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:35,652
(Exclaiming in admiration)

445
00:20:35,882 --> 00:20:37,622
- Yes, it lingers in your mouth. - Sansho oil.

446
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:40,492
- It feels different, right? - I can feel the difference.

447
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:41,692
This is how it tastes.

448
00:20:42,162 --> 00:20:43,422
This is how sansho tastes like.

449
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:44,462
(Fragrance of mint spreads inside your mouth.)

450
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:48,132
(Chef Sung scoops it...)

451
00:20:48,132 --> 00:20:49,732
(and takes a bite.)

(Savoring)

453
00:20:53,702 --> 00:20:54,742
That's right.

454
00:20:57,601 --> 00:20:58,771
It's delicious.

455
00:21:00,412 --> 00:21:02,242
Should I bring that sauce, Doo Na?

456
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:03,482
- What? - What?

457
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:04,781
- Dried pollack sikhae? - Right.

458
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:06,551
Sikhae? Should I bring sikhae?

459
00:21:07,311 --> 00:21:10,521
It goes well with tofu,

460
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:13,051
so I'm heating up tofu now.

461
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,392
I'm heating it up.

462
00:21:15,662 --> 00:21:19,531
When I'm at home, I eat boiled tofu too.

463
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:21,192
- Instead of rice. - Eat tofu when you're on a diet.

464
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:22,402
It's the best.

465

(Dried pollack sikhae)

466
00:21:28,402 --> 00:21:31,742
Here's tofu. It's delicious when you wrap it with ripe kimchi.

467
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:34,341
Let's eat.

(Taking a bite while it's still hot)

471
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:43,952
It's delicious.

472
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:45,192
(Taking a bite while it's still hot)

473
00:21:46,992 --> 00:21:49,261
Gosh. Tofu is so delicious.

474
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:50,392
It is, right?

475
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:52,492
So with tofu...

476
00:21:52,492 --> 00:21:53,962
(Bland tofu with dried pollack sikhae as sauce)

477
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:55,132
It's good.

478
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:57,501

- Right? - Yes.

480

I'm overeating in the morning.

481
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:03,771
You'd better overeat in the morning.

482
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:06,912
My goodness. Thank you for the food.

483
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:09,182
Thank you so much for the food.

484
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:13,351
(After the generous breakfast, the bright morning sunlight shines.)

485
00:22:13,551 --> 00:22:15,882
- Gosh. The sun is... - My goodness.

486
00:22:16,722 --> 00:22:18,492
How amazing is the sunlight!

487
00:22:19,152 --> 00:22:20,622
We've never opened it yet, right?

488
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:23,462
- No, we haven't opened it. - Goodness. This sunlight is...

489
00:22:24,222 --> 00:22:25,561
This is...

490
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:26,932
(The warm morning sunlight makes them open their windows wide.)

491

(Amazed)

492
00:22:29,662 --> 00:22:31,132
This is openness.

493
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:34,872
My dear. How good is the sunlight!

494
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,341
(Si Wan suddenly goes up to the 2nd floor.)

495
00:22:40,672 --> 00:22:42,041
Where are you going?

496
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,781
He's lying there again.

497
00:22:44,882 --> 00:22:46,851
- My goodness! - Enjoying the open view from there?

498
00:22:46,851 --> 00:22:48,982
- Of course. - My gosh. He is...

499
00:22:48,982 --> 00:22:51,392
I want to be as closer to the sky as possible.

500
00:22:52,422 --> 00:22:54,422
In that inconvenient manner?

501
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:55,821
You can't even stretch your legs.

502
00:22:57,662 --> 00:22:58,992
How inconvenient is that?

503
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:00,992
I should bend my knees to get a clear view of the sky.

504
00:23:02,031 --> 00:23:03,932
(He's a youth.)

505
00:23:04,601 --> 00:23:08,601
(Dong Il makes a call somewhere.)

506
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:12,011
Our next guest is Dong Wook. Kim Dong Wook.

507
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:13,271
- Actor Kim Dong Wook. - Hello?

508
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:14,712
- Hello? - Dong Wook, it's Dong Il.

509
00:23:14,712 --> 00:23:16,341
- His voice is so good. - Are you almost here?

510
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:18,081
Yes, Dong Il. This is Dong Wook.

511
00:23:18,081 --> 00:23:19,751
Yes, I've arrived already.

512
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:20,851
There's a call.

513
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:23,251
Hello?

514
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:25,152
Yes, Dong Il. This is Dong Wook.

515
00:23:25,152 --> 00:23:27,392
Yes, I've already arrived.

516
00:23:27,392 --> 00:23:29,861
I'm on my way there now.

517
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:31,162
- Is that so? - Right.

518
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:32,662
- Yes. - Then you'll be here soon.

519
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,361
Yes. I'm almost there. I'll be right there.

520
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:37,801
Okay. We'll be waiting for you.

521
00:23:37,861 --> 00:23:39,632
Yes. I'm almost there. I'll get there soon.

522
00:23:39,632 --> 00:23:42,202
- Okay. - Suddenly...

523
00:23:42,372 --> 00:23:45,172
My gosh. It's time for Doo Na to leave.

524
00:23:45,172 --> 00:23:47,571
- I feel somewhat sad. - It's sunny when you are leaving.

525
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:49,242
- What's with it? Seriously. - Gosh.

526
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:50,882
- Like you're glad that I'm leaving. - Really.

527
00:23:50,882 --> 00:23:52,652
Hee Won won't get up.

528
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:54,781
- Again, he is... - Sit down. Have a seat.

529
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:56,482
- He's about to cry. - Please don't go.

530
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:59,222
It's because I feel sorry to see her go.

531
00:23:59,652 --> 00:24:01,722
Hey, isn't he Dong Wook? He's carrying something.

532
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:02,892
It must be Dong Wook.

533
00:24:02,922 --> 00:24:04,761
- It's him, right? - I'll go there to greet him.

534
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:07,031
I can recognize his walk. It is Dong Wook, right?

535
00:24:07,132 --> 00:24:12,301
(Whistling)

536
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:13,872
This place is so good.

537
00:24:13,872 --> 00:24:15,041
(Walking leisurely)

538
00:24:15,841 --> 00:24:17,501
- Hello. - Hello.

539
00:24:18,742 --> 00:24:19,912
It's been a while.

540
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:22,281
- It's been a long time. - Yes.

541
00:24:22,912 --> 00:24:24,611
- How have you been? - Good. You changed your hair.

542
00:24:24,611 --> 00:24:26,682
- Hey, Dong Wook! - Hello. Dong Il.

543
00:24:28,622 --> 00:24:29,922
(Hugging with joy)

544
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:31,751
- How have you been? - Good.

545
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:32,821
It's been a while.

546
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:37,561
(Dong Il and Dong Wook filmed "Take Off" together.)

547
00:24:39,732 --> 00:24:42,561
(Since then, they've been known each other for over 13 years.)

548
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:45,501
(With his talented acting,)

549
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:50,571
(he has become 1 of the actors guaranteeing 10 million viewers.)

550
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:54,672
(With charismatic acting, he won the Grand Award in Drama Awards.)

551
00:24:54,882 --> 00:24:56,742
(Actor Kim Dong Wook)

552
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:58,982
- Hey, Dong Wook! - Hello. Dong Il.

553
00:25:00,712 --> 00:25:02,122
(Hugging tightly)

554
00:25:02,122 --> 00:25:03,722
- How have you been? - Great.

555
00:25:03,722 --> 00:25:04,781
It's been a while.

556
00:25:04,781 --> 00:25:06,122
Hello.

557
00:25:06,122 --> 00:25:07,152
(Bowing)

558
00:25:07,152 --> 00:25:08,892
- Right. Say hello to her. - It's nice to meet you.

559
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:13,361
- I'm Doo Na. - You've never worked together?

560
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:15,202
- No, we haven't met. - No, we haven't.

561
00:25:15,202 --> 00:25:18,372
- Is it the first time personally? - Yes.

562
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,942
(Staring from far behind)

563
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:25,811
(Glancing)

564
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,511
(Hesitant)

565
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:33,912
(Walking on eggshells)

566
00:25:33,912 --> 00:25:35,281
Nice to meet you.

567
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:39,692
(Smiling)

568
00:25:42,091 --> 00:25:44,561
(Sitting sheepishly)

569
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:46,192
Right. Did you know that?

570
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:50,462
He has a scuba diving instructor certificate.

571
00:25:50,462 --> 00:25:51,972
Gosh. That's incredible.

572
00:25:51,972 --> 00:25:55,271
Right. Once he gets into the water, he stays there for a few days.

573
00:25:55,271 --> 00:25:57,242
(Bursts into laughter)

574
00:25:57,601 --> 00:26:00,341
There is this...

575
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:03,382
- silent and stunned state. - Yes.

576
00:26:03,382 --> 00:26:05,412
It feels like you're confined and suppressed by water.

577
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,311
- I actually love that feeling. - Really?

578
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:08,482
Yes.

579
00:26:08,521 --> 00:26:09,952
When I go deep underwater,

580
00:26:10,122 --> 00:26:14,152
I like the echoing sound so much.

581
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:15,992
You can't go diving in this season?

582
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:18,061
- They scuba dive in winter too, - Yes.

583
00:26:18,122 --> 00:26:20,192
- but I don’t like the cold. - It must be too cold.

584
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:22,462
That's a serious problem. Do you hate the cold?

585
00:26:23,402 --> 00:26:25,872
(Clearing his throat)

586
00:26:25,872 --> 00:26:27,132
What should he do?

587
00:26:27,472 --> 00:26:29,242
(Thinking)

588
00:26:29,601 --> 00:26:31,811
- Your clothes seem too light. - He should stay inside.

589
00:26:31,811 --> 00:26:33,742
- Right. Your clothes... - I'm dressed in layers.

590
00:26:33,742 --> 00:26:36,382
- No, no. I'll give you one. - Dressing in layers is not enough.

591
00:26:36,642 --> 00:26:39,152
- He's scared of the cold. - You're getting cold feet.

592
00:26:39,152 --> 00:26:40,851
- Look at his face. - I'm wearing summer shoes.

593
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:43,652
My gosh! You chose the wrong ones. What are you going to do?

594
00:26:43,982 --> 00:26:45,492
- It's my bad. - My gosh.

595
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:46,952
I haven't thought about it.

596
00:26:46,952 --> 00:26:49,122
(Worried)

597
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:53,291
Well. Now our top-class actor should leave here.

598
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:55,301
- I had a really fun time. - Yes.

599
00:26:55,702 --> 00:26:57,402
I know you want to leave as soon as possible.

600
00:26:57,402 --> 00:26:58,771
(Laughing)

601
00:26:58,872 --> 00:27:01,432
Actually, I'm a big fan of Dong Wook,

602
00:27:01,432 --> 00:27:03,041
- Really? - so I... Yes. Of course.

603
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,501
I want to work with him...

604
00:27:05,912 --> 00:27:07,672
- sometime. - Please be in touch.

605
00:27:07,771 --> 00:27:10,611
How can I? I'm not in a position to call you.

606
00:27:11,682 --> 00:27:15,422
So I was wondering if I could stay longer...

607
00:27:15,622 --> 00:27:16,982
- before I go. - Yes.

608
00:27:16,982 --> 00:27:19,321
I can keep asking questions to her so that she can't leave.

609
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:21,251
No. Wait. Hold on a second.

610
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:24,492
(Cracks up)

611
00:27:24,692 --> 00:27:26,091
Let's let her go now. Let her go.

612
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:29,662
- Thank you so much. - Let's let her go.

613
00:27:29,902 --> 00:27:33,531
- There's a Polaroid camera inside. - Polaroid?

614
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:36,001
- Ta-da! Polaroid. - Right.

615
00:27:43,212 --> 00:27:44,442
How can I turn it on?

616
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:46,751
- If you press it, the cover will... - No, I mean...

617
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:48,922
Is there a power button inside?

618
00:27:48,922 --> 00:27:49,952
(Pops up)

619
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:51,482
The power...

620
00:27:54,392 --> 00:27:55,662
So that's how you do it.

621
00:27:55,662 --> 00:27:56,922
(Surprised)

622
00:27:56,922 --> 00:27:58,632
Dong Il, this is a selfie,

623
00:27:58,632 --> 00:28:02,101
- so we should gather like this. - Do we need to gather?

624
00:28:02,101 --> 00:28:03,162
Hee Won has long arms.

625
00:28:03,162 --> 00:28:04,732
You should take it. Take off your gloves.

626
00:28:04,732 --> 00:28:05,831
He wouldn't budge.

627
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:07,202
(Okay.)

628
00:28:07,202 --> 00:28:10,041
He looks like that actor in "Home Alone".

629
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,011
1, 2, 3.

630
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:13,541
(Hee Won who has long arms takes a photo.)

631
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:17,311
(One more memory is piled up in House on Wheels.)

632
00:28:17,712 --> 00:28:19,051
I hope to see you all again.

633
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:21,581
- Goodbye. Have a good time. - Take care.

634
00:28:21,581 --> 00:28:24,382
- You went through a lot. - No, you had a hard time.

635
00:28:24,382 --> 00:28:27,622
No, you should have come on warmer days. Seriously.

636
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,992
- I feel sorry about it. - No, it was fun.

637
00:28:29,992 --> 00:28:31,622
It was cold, and it was our first time.

638
00:28:31,892 --> 00:28:33,331
- Let's get inside. - Okay.

639
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:34,932
- Dong Wook, come here. - It's okay.

640
00:28:34,932 --> 00:28:37,801
- It's too windy. Come in here. - Hold on. This one...

641
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:41,331
She left her bag. It's her bag.

642
00:28:41,432 --> 00:28:43,472
- Hey, bring your bag! - Doo Na!

643
00:28:43,672 --> 00:28:45,541
You should bring your luggage.

644
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:48,242
Top-class actor! Why are you in such a hurry?

645
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:51,341
- You didn't bring your bag. - It's a bummer.

646
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:54,412
She could have come back.

647
00:28:54,982 --> 00:28:56,281
I see. Was this your plan?

648
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:58,281
She could have come back. Why did you...

649
00:28:59,392 --> 00:29:02,492
(Goodbye.)

650
00:29:03,162 --> 00:29:04,561
I'll hold it for you.

651
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:05,932
(Reliable)

652
00:29:06,232 --> 00:29:08,402
- You've done really hard. - No problem.

653
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:10,232
- It was so cold. - Next time...

654
00:29:10,402 --> 00:29:11,462
Come in here.

655
00:29:11,462 --> 00:29:15,801
(Dong Wook enters the house.)

656
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:20,041
Gosh. The house is much bigger.

657
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:21,882
- Yes, it is. It's bigger. - Right.

658
00:29:22,142 --> 00:29:24,311
Dong Wook, we have a heater there.

659
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:26,581
We also have electric floor heating.

660
00:29:26,652 --> 00:29:29,422
- Oh, dear. This is great. - It's warm in here.

661
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:32,722
- It's good. - There's a heater.

662
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:34,422
Hey.

663
00:29:34,422 --> 00:29:35,622
(Looking around)

664
00:29:35,622 --> 00:29:36,861
- Si Wan. - Yes?

665
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:38,632
Go and get a blanket.

666
00:29:38,632 --> 00:29:40,432
- A blanket? Okay. - Yes.

667
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:44,831
I used to be a big fan of Hee Won.

668
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:46,702
- Really? He's so good. - Yes.

669
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,672
He comes to my place often to have a meal.

670
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,101
- I see. - He just comes by casually.

671
00:29:50,101 --> 00:29:51,242
"Dong Il, what's up?"

672
00:29:52,372 --> 00:29:54,472
"I'll go to eat." When he finishes his meal,

673
00:29:54,942 --> 00:29:56,011
he says, "Dong Il, I'll get going."

674
00:30:01,922 --> 00:30:03,821
(At that time, Hee Won comes back to the house...)

675
00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:05,122
(after seeing Doo Na off.)

676
00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:09,162
My gosh. Look how tired you are. So you went to see her off.

677
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:12,291
You look like you have fought in a battle.

678
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:13,531
- Well. - Did she go well?

679
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:14,831
- Did you see her go? - Yes.

680
00:30:15,662 --> 00:30:17,761
Aren't my eyes a little puffy?

681
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:20,331
- Are you saying you cried? - Of course I didn't.

682
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:21,632
(Laughing)

683
00:30:21,841 --> 00:30:24,271
- Puffy eyes? Hey. - Aren't they a little swollen?

684
00:30:24,702 --> 00:30:25,972
Take a nap.

685
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:28,212
Dong Il, would you like me to open it?

686
00:30:28,212 --> 00:30:30,581
- Right. Dong Wook brought gifts. - Gifts?

687
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:33,652
- One for each. - My goodness.

688
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:34,781
What's this?

689
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:36,281
- Explain it first. - This is...

690
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:38,751
- Since you are camping... - Right.

691
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:41,422
Thank you. It looks great.

692
00:30:41,492 --> 00:30:43,291
This is terrific.

693
00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:46,361
This one is... You can pour hot water into it.

694
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:47,732
I see. Right.

695
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:49,601
- Oh, man! I needed this. - Gosh.

696
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:52,132
(Exclaiming with joy)

697
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:54,432
- When you work on something... - Yes, when there's something hot...

698
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:57,202
- For a barbeque. - Yes, I need this for a barbeque.

699
00:30:57,202 --> 00:30:59,372
- They are gloves. - The size is perfect for me.

700
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:01,412
- Gosh. I like these. - Yes.

701
00:31:01,412 --> 00:31:03,712
- To protect your hands from heat. - These gloves are so good.

702
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:06,412
Also, when you cook or when you hold hot pots.

703
00:31:06,412 --> 00:31:09,422
It looks like he's going to hurt someone with the gloves on.

704
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:11,222
Bring him an iron pipe.

705
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:14,051
His image is... Look at that.

706
00:31:15,192 --> 00:31:17,722
(Laughing)

707
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:20,291
Let's see. Coffee... Good. Give him some coffee.

708
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,402
(Let's serve our guest some coffee.)

709
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:28,071
(Be delicious.)

710
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:35,111
(A beginner, but doing the best)

711
00:31:35,412 --> 00:31:38,011
You make coffee with hand drip.

712
00:31:38,011 --> 00:31:39,511
Yes, we do.

713
00:31:39,751 --> 00:31:42,781
I'm trying since we have the setup. I've never done it before.

714
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:51,162
(He's happy to serve the coffee.)

715
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:54,031
Would you like your coffee light of dark?

716
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,801
- I actually don't drink coffee. - You don't?

717
00:31:59,632 --> 00:32:02,501
- Really? - I am just curious...

718
00:32:02,942 --> 00:32:05,001
- I like to just give it a try. - Give him a little.

719
00:32:05,942 --> 00:32:07,712
- You don't drink coffee? - No, I don't.

720
00:32:07,712 --> 00:32:09,611
That's the same as me. I told you.

721
00:32:11,982 --> 00:32:13,452
Do you drink tea?

722
00:32:13,452 --> 00:32:17,021
- Something like tea? - Yes, I do drink tea. See?

723
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:18,952
(I knew we were the same.)

724
00:32:19,321 --> 00:32:20,351
What about alcohol?

725
00:32:20,652 --> 00:32:22,591
- I do... - Do you drink a lot?

726
00:32:22,922 --> 00:32:24,662
- I love alcohol. - He does love it.

727
00:32:25,692 --> 00:32:28,462
(This isn't the same then.)

728
00:32:29,061 --> 00:32:30,101
Where do you live?

729
00:32:30,432 --> 00:32:32,531
I live in Geumho-dong.

730
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:33,672
Geumho-dong?

731
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:35,271
(Geumho-dong is...)

732
00:32:35,271 --> 00:32:36,571
It's close to my place.

733
00:32:37,942 --> 00:32:39,011
I live in Jeongneung.

734
00:32:39,011 --> 00:32:40,172
(It's 30-minute driving.)

735
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:41,172
(Laughing)

736
00:32:42,081 --> 00:32:43,482
It's kind of too close.

737
00:32:43,682 --> 00:32:45,952
(It's too close.)

738
00:32:46,152 --> 00:32:48,152
- It is close. - Yes.

739
00:32:48,251 --> 00:32:51,122
In that manner, my place is close to Jeju Island.

740
00:32:51,222 --> 00:32:52,251
It's an hour away.

741
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:54,751
- I mean it's really close. - Isn't it?

742
00:32:54,751 --> 00:32:57,162
It's really close. It doesn't take long.

743
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:58,321
Jeongneung.

744
00:32:58,422 --> 00:33:01,561
You're trying so hard to bond.

745
00:33:01,861 --> 00:33:03,301
Plan for some gathering.

746
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,402
Many actors live in that area.

747
00:33:06,432 --> 00:33:08,902
You know like in the old countryside...

748
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:10,142
- I know. - Thank you.

749
00:33:10,642 --> 00:33:12,172
- Have some. - I'm okay.

750
00:33:12,172 --> 00:33:14,672
- You know those supermarkets there. - You don't drink coffee, right?

751
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:16,982
You know the supermarkets in the countryside.

752
00:33:16,982 --> 00:33:18,382
(After looking around...)

753
00:33:18,382 --> 00:33:22,821
(He is finally tasting some sips.)

754
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:26,892
This coffee is tasty.

755
00:33:29,521 --> 00:33:32,131
(I'm glad.)

756
00:33:32,531 --> 00:33:33,792
Let's eat some strawberries.

757
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:36,562
I was about to get you some.

758
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:40,332
It feels like hosting at home.

759
00:33:41,332 --> 00:33:45,372
(A diligent youngest handling it all)

760
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:47,872
Can I help you?

761
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:49,011
No. I am okay.

762
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:51,841
We never put guests to work. We really don't

763
00:33:52,252 --> 00:33:53,651
We don't make them do anything.

764
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:56,051
I've been told not to make guests work.

765
00:33:56,682 --> 00:33:59,921
You're here to just see us and rest.

766
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:01,352
You don't have to do anything.

767
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:06,961
(Si Wan is preparing strawberries.)

768
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:11,401
(Full of delicious strawberries)

769
00:34:11,602 --> 00:34:15,602
It's nice that Si Wan is washing the strawberries for us.

770
00:34:15,602 --> 00:34:17,571
(Good job, our youngest boy.)

771
00:34:17,872 --> 00:34:19,571
Look at Si Wan...

772
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:22,881
washing strawberries under the nice sunshine.

773
00:34:23,011 --> 00:34:24,011
(Yawning)

774
00:34:25,812 --> 00:34:27,981
Pay attention. I was complimenting Si Wan.

775
00:34:28,682 --> 00:34:30,682
- Don't interrupt. - Not that...

776
00:34:30,682 --> 00:34:33,952
You compliment him every time I yawn,

777
00:34:34,522 --> 00:34:35,691
not any other time.

778
00:34:35,821 --> 00:34:38,591
(Laughing)

779
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:40,792
For Dong Wook... What time is it?

780
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:43,961
It's over noon now.

781
00:34:44,062 --> 00:34:48,332
Is it already? Then, for Dong Wook, I should...

782
00:34:48,801 --> 00:34:50,772
You drink your coffee here.

783
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:53,511
I will make your lunch.

784
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:54,511
(Time to cook for our guest)

785
00:34:55,272 --> 00:34:59,051
(Dong Il is preparing lunch.)

786
00:34:59,412 --> 00:35:02,981
(While Dong Il is cooking...)

787
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:05,122
Then, let's have strawberries first.

788
00:35:05,122 --> 00:35:06,191
That's a good idea.

789
00:35:07,492 --> 00:35:09,162
- Have some strawberries. - Thank you.

790
00:35:09,162 --> 00:35:11,122
(Let's eat strawberries.)

791
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:16,432
(With a strawberry...)

792
00:35:16,432 --> 00:35:17,432
Here you are.

793
00:35:17,432 --> 00:35:21,472
(The first strawberry for the oldest)

794
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:26,441
(Si Wan was going to do that.)

795
00:35:26,872 --> 00:35:29,011
(Looking a bit sad)

796
00:35:29,412 --> 00:35:32,082
(Stray fingers)

797
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:34,711
I will get him his strawberries.

798
00:35:35,821 --> 00:35:39,321
(This one is for me.)

799
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:43,492
(The duties for the youngest are not easy.)

800
00:35:43,492 --> 00:35:45,461
The strawberries are very big.

801
00:35:48,392 --> 00:35:53,171
(After bringing one for Dong Il, he's having the strawberries.)

802
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:55,571
(Yum)

803
00:35:56,872 --> 00:36:01,171
(A big mouthful of strawberries)

804
00:36:01,812 --> 00:36:02,841
(Singing)

805
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:04,841
(Si Wan is looking at him.)

806
00:36:08,111 --> 00:36:12,551
(With a strawberry...)

807
00:36:13,122 --> 00:36:14,122
(Approaching)

808
00:36:14,122 --> 00:36:15,452
What is this?

809
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:20,961
(Strawberry delivery accomplished.)

810
00:36:22,062 --> 00:36:24,002
- It's delicious. - Yes, it is.

811
00:36:24,002 --> 00:36:25,002
(Happy with the delicious strawberries)

812
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,272
Oh, my...

813
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,611
(Sudden serving)

814
00:36:32,972 --> 00:36:35,941
(Here you are.)

815
00:36:38,082 --> 00:36:40,452
He doesn't like strawberries. That's why he's feeding you.

816
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:41,611
(Growing brotherhood with strawberries)

817
00:36:41,611 --> 00:36:44,252
You guys are feeding each other.

818
00:36:45,082 --> 00:36:48,892
(Such cute brotherhood)

819
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:50,492
Nothing special, but...

820
00:36:50,492 --> 00:36:53,392
(Strawberry made the brothers of House on Wheels happy.)

821
00:36:54,062 --> 00:36:58,361
Do you mostly stay in this space?

822
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:00,801
We were outside all day long yesterday.

823
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,801
Outside?

824
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:04,171
(Oh, my...)

825
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,742
That was...

826
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:09,881
Do you see the tent outside?

827
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:13,651
How long do you think that we spent to set the tent yesterday?

828
00:37:14,551 --> 00:37:17,151
(Let me see.)

829
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:18,452
30 minutes?

830
00:37:18,452 --> 00:37:21,452
30 minutes? You think it took us 30 minutes?

831
00:37:21,452 --> 00:37:23,261
- It took 2 hours. - 2 hours?

832
00:37:23,261 --> 00:37:25,091
- Since we didn't know how... - It took longer.

833
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,091
It was about three hours.

834
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:28,961
The manual said that...

835
00:37:29,131 --> 00:37:32,502
it's easy that anyone can do it.

836
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:35,372
It said so, but it was not easy at all.

837
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,502
Have a seat. You're not supposed to be standing.

838
00:37:38,502 --> 00:37:41,912
We've never made our guests stand.

839
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:44,312
- Have we? - Really?

840
00:37:44,582 --> 00:37:47,711
That's right. We've never made anyone stand.

841
00:37:48,051 --> 00:37:52,492
I watched it when Tae Goo was here. He worked a lot in the rain.

842
00:37:52,492 --> 00:37:54,421
- Did you watch that? - Yes. He was doing a lot of stuff.

843
00:37:54,421 --> 00:37:56,622
That's true. My goodness.

844
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:58,492
(Oh, poor Tae Goo.)

845
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:02,702
(Dong Il carrying broth)

846
00:38:02,702 --> 00:38:03,731
What is it?

847
00:38:03,932 --> 00:38:06,372
- It's dried pollack broth. - Let me...

848
00:38:06,772 --> 00:38:09,142
I'll cook dried pollack noodle soup for Dong Wook.

849
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:11,872
- Dried pollack noodle soup? - We just put noodles in the broth.

850
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,412
Noodles and eggs...

851
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,341
Is the broth enough?

852
00:38:15,341 --> 00:38:17,281
Yes, it is. It's enough.

853
00:38:18,441 --> 00:38:21,582
Dong Wook, we boiled it yesterday.

854
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:23,082
(Using the dried pollack soup from the morning)

855
00:38:23,082 --> 00:38:24,051
With this...

856
00:38:24,252 --> 00:38:26,622
- Is this the broth? - I've made the broth.

857
00:38:26,622 --> 00:38:29,321
(That's the broth? Oh, my...)

858
00:38:29,961 --> 00:38:34,761
(What would he cook with it?)

859
00:38:35,131 --> 00:38:39,272
(Adding Cheongyang chili for the flavor)

860
00:38:39,602 --> 00:38:44,202
(Chopping into small pieces)

861
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:48,071
(Adding scallions for the savor)

862
00:38:48,441 --> 00:38:52,142
(When the water boils for the noodles,)

863
00:38:52,912 --> 00:38:56,952
(put a sum of noodles.)

864
00:38:57,622 --> 00:38:58,622
(Boil them for 4 and a half to 5 minutes.)

865
00:38:58,622 --> 00:39:02,662
(Sliding)

866
00:39:03,022 --> 00:39:05,662
Have you been there after shooting the movie, "Take Off"?

867
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:06,932
Yes, I have.

868
00:39:07,662 --> 00:39:11,502
Heung Soo works at the ski association...

869
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:14,731
near the Winter Olympic place.

870
00:39:15,432 --> 00:39:18,502
So we met up in such a long while.

871
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:21,671
I went to his wedding as well.

872
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:23,142
(He's been keeping in touch for 13 years.)

873
00:39:23,142 --> 00:39:25,912
We went to travel together with our wives.

874
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:29,622
Are you good at skiing and snowboarding?

875
00:39:29,622 --> 00:39:30,622
No, I'm not.

876
00:39:30,622 --> 00:39:31,881
You didn't learn them?

877
00:39:32,082 --> 00:39:34,792
I've learned while shooting the movie.

878
00:39:35,722 --> 00:39:37,392
But I have acrophobia.

879
00:39:37,761 --> 00:39:38,761
Really?

880
00:39:38,761 --> 00:39:41,562
Does that include skiing?

881
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:43,731
I was scared to death while shooting the movie.

882
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:45,162
- You were... - I really was.

883
00:39:46,571 --> 00:39:47,571
(It's a 138m high ski jump tower.)

884
00:39:47,571 --> 00:39:51,571
(It's scary.)

885
00:39:52,412 --> 00:39:56,412
(Sliding down steep ski slope with up to 90 to 100kph)

886
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:01,952
(Flying in the air)

887
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:03,421
(Landing)

888
00:40:04,082 --> 00:40:06,722
(I'm alive!)

889
00:40:07,252 --> 00:40:08,392
It exceeds the imagination.

890
00:40:08,392 --> 00:40:11,861
What did you exactly do? You can't really do the jump though.

891
00:40:11,961 --> 00:40:15,562
We skied from the jump tower...

892
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:20,031
to the middle with wires attached.

893
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:24,202
Then, we skied again...

894
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:25,772
from the landing slope.

895
00:40:25,772 --> 00:40:27,642
We did everything except for the actual jumping.

896
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:28,671
- Really? - Yes.

897
00:40:29,642 --> 00:40:32,281
Oh, my... You skied the actual slope?

898
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:33,281
Yes, we did.

899
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:35,151
(We did.)

900
00:40:35,151 --> 00:40:37,752
- You said that you have acrophobia. - Yes.

901
00:40:38,551 --> 00:40:42,492
How could you? Is it possible?

902
00:40:42,662 --> 00:40:43,722
Because I got paid.

903
00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:46,631
- The power of capitalism. - I had to since I got paid.

904
00:40:46,631 --> 00:40:50,162
- The power of money. - He's got the same mindset as mine.

905
00:40:51,062 --> 00:40:52,671
- It's the same. - What can I do?

906
00:40:55,272 --> 00:40:58,341
Are we allowed to go up to the jump tower? Probably not.

907
00:40:58,642 --> 00:41:00,071
Maybe we can if we go with Heung Soo.

908
00:41:00,071 --> 00:41:02,412
- If we're with Heung Soo. - Maybe, if he speaks for us.

909
00:41:02,511 --> 00:41:04,881
If you go up there and look down,

910
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:06,582
- I kind of want to go and see. - you will see...

911
00:41:06,582 --> 00:41:08,182
that people look very tiny like this.

912
00:41:08,281 --> 00:41:09,352
I do want to see that.

913
00:41:09,722 --> 00:41:12,252
Don't get too excited and think you can do it.

914
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:13,421
(Wiping)

915
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:15,252
I want to go up there though.

916
00:41:15,252 --> 00:41:17,461
Me too. I will ask Heung Soo...

917
00:41:19,591 --> 00:41:21,091
Should I open the window a little?

918
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:22,761
- Since we turned on the fire. - Oh, sounds good.

919
00:41:23,332 --> 00:41:25,002
- Oh... - But I don't think it'll open.

920
00:41:25,602 --> 00:41:28,272
If you want to feel the openness, you need to open the door!

921
00:41:28,272 --> 00:41:29,671
Open this...

922
00:41:30,002 --> 00:41:31,772
(He opened the door energetically.)

923
00:41:31,772 --> 00:41:34,042
We just need to open it this much.

924
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:35,912
It's too cold right now. Don't open it!

925
00:41:36,511 --> 00:41:38,281
No, but the guest...

926
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:40,682
- Oh, then open it. - Because of the heat.

927
00:41:41,252 --> 00:41:42,252
Yeah...

928
00:41:44,651 --> 00:41:48,191
(The outside temperature...)

929
00:41:48,191 --> 00:41:52,062
(and the inside temperature are the same.)

930
00:41:52,531 --> 00:41:55,562
(A blast of breath from the cold from his nostrils)

931
00:42:00,772 --> 00:42:02,432
I think we've ventilated the temperature enough...

932
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:04,042
(Shall we stop?)

933
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:06,611
(Laughing)

934
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:08,011
I think we can close it now.

935
00:42:08,642 --> 00:42:09,881
It suddenly got colder.

936
00:42:10,441 --> 00:42:11,582
It's really cold now.

937
00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:17,781
(Pour the cooked noodles into the sieve.)

938
00:42:17,852 --> 00:42:19,392
(Rinse to get rid of the starch.)

939
00:42:19,392 --> 00:42:23,222
(Shower them in cold water)

940
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:26,992
(Add the eggs for more savor.)

941
00:42:26,992 --> 00:42:28,091
(Add scallions.)

942
00:42:28,091 --> 00:42:29,091
Everyone, take a seat.

943
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:34,702
(Sesame seeds are added as usual.)

944
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:36,372
(Pouring sesame seeds)

945
00:42:36,372 --> 00:42:37,941
(Pouring more sesame seeds)

946
00:42:37,941 --> 00:42:40,972
(Pouring more and more sesame seeds)

947
00:42:44,242 --> 00:42:48,412
(A lemon?)

948
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,622
It makes it refreshing...

949
00:42:52,051 --> 00:42:53,421
Oh, lemon juice is added!

950
00:42:53,852 --> 00:42:57,821
(An unexpected secret method)

951
00:42:58,191 --> 00:43:01,531
(Every last drop is squeezed.)

952
00:43:01,992 --> 00:43:03,731
Oh, lemon juice is added!

953
00:43:04,432 --> 00:43:06,031
We do everything other people don't.

954
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:11,642
(By adding a few ingredients, the dried pollack hangover soup...)

955
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:15,772
(turned into a new menu and became dried pollack noodles.)

956
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:17,312
Let's eat.

957
00:43:17,381 --> 00:43:19,611
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

958
00:43:19,611 --> 00:43:20,682
Thank you for the food.

959
00:43:22,722 --> 00:43:24,151
(Slurping the soup first)

960
00:43:24,151 --> 00:43:25,321
Does anyone want Cheongyang chili?

961
00:43:25,321 --> 00:43:26,691
(Wow)

962
00:43:27,191 --> 00:43:28,591
The soup is so thick!

963
00:43:28,752 --> 00:43:29,792
- It's thick, right? - Yes.

964
00:43:31,861 --> 00:43:33,392
(One more spoonful of soup)

965
00:43:33,392 --> 00:43:34,531
- Wow... - It's so savory.

966
00:43:36,062 --> 00:43:37,531
(Slurp)

967
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:38,832
Wow...

968
00:43:41,031 --> 00:43:42,742
This is just...

969
00:43:42,972 --> 00:43:44,071
This right here...

970
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,642
It's even more savory than what we had for breakfast.

971
00:43:46,642 --> 00:43:49,582
(Oh! I need to take a picture of this.)

972
00:43:50,142 --> 00:43:52,651
(Slurping the soup)

973
00:43:52,651 --> 00:43:54,881
(Slurping the soup)

974
00:43:54,881 --> 00:43:57,122
(Slurping the soup)

975
00:43:57,122 --> 00:43:58,151
(Slurping the soup)

976
00:43:58,452 --> 00:43:59,821
Wow, Dong Il...

977
00:44:00,051 --> 00:44:02,022
It doesn't make the stomach uncomfortable at all.

978
00:44:04,062 --> 00:44:06,932
(Keeps slurping the soup)

979
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:09,662
The soup is so thick. It's so good.

980
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:12,602
I put in so many dried pollack heads in there.

981
00:44:12,602 --> 00:44:15,571
(It's all thanks to the dried pollack broth they made all day.)

982
00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:22,841
(Hee Won starts with slurping the noodles.)

983
00:44:25,341 --> 00:44:27,011
(Nodding)

984
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:28,752
Hee Won, how is it?

985
00:44:29,352 --> 00:44:30,551
It's so savory.

986
00:44:30,852 --> 00:44:33,421
- The dried pollack soup's flavor... - The unique flavor?

987
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:34,452
Yeah.

988
00:44:35,492 --> 00:44:36,761
The soup is so thick.

989
00:44:36,761 --> 00:44:40,131
(He took out a big piece of dried pollack to eat.)

990
00:44:40,892 --> 00:44:42,492
(Wow)

991
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:46,131
(After feeding the younger guys, Dong Il slurps it in too.)

992
00:44:46,332 --> 00:44:47,571
Wow, this is just...

993
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:52,071
The noodles got cooked well.

994
00:44:52,202 --> 00:44:53,742
Yeah, the noodles are really chewy.

995
00:44:54,171 --> 00:44:55,812
This is so good.

996
00:44:55,812 --> 00:44:58,841
(Slurping the noodles)

997
00:44:59,812 --> 00:45:00,881
(The sound of slurping the noodles)

998
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:02,281
An ordinary dried pollack hangover soup...

999
00:45:03,321 --> 00:45:04,321
Wow, this really...

1000
00:45:05,182 --> 00:45:06,392
soothes the stomach.

1001
00:45:07,352 --> 00:45:09,392
(The four brothers are busy eating.)

1002
00:45:09,392 --> 00:45:10,861
Wow, the flavor is so deep.

1003
00:45:13,992 --> 00:45:15,231
(Opens the door wide open)

1004
00:45:15,231 --> 00:45:17,131
Hee Won's getting hot.

1005
00:45:18,162 --> 00:45:19,731
I can get a bit hot after eating this.

1006
00:45:19,731 --> 00:45:21,631
(His body's getting hot after eating this health food.)

1007
00:45:22,102 --> 00:45:23,972
It's refreshing like eating outside.

1008
00:45:26,111 --> 00:45:27,611
This dried pollack noodle is really good.

1009
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:28,772
Yes.

1010
00:45:28,941 --> 00:45:31,441
- I'm eating it for the first time. - It's my first time making it.

1011
00:45:31,642 --> 00:45:33,582
There isn't a recipe for this, right?

1012
00:45:33,952 --> 00:45:35,352
Who would make something like this?

1013
00:45:35,352 --> 00:45:36,421
(Teasing Dong Il.)

1014
00:45:36,421 --> 00:45:38,952
What do you mean, "Something like this"?

1015
00:45:50,801 --> 00:45:54,131
(It's so good...)

1016
00:45:55,131 --> 00:45:56,671
- Are you cold? - I'm okay.

1017
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:57,972
- Are you okay? - Yes. I'm good.

1018
00:45:58,472 --> 00:45:59,671
Si Wan, are you cold?

1019
00:45:59,812 --> 00:46:00,972
I'm good.

1020
00:46:01,312 --> 00:46:03,211
Dong Il, it's nice and cool now that I opened the door, right?

1021
00:46:03,812 --> 00:46:06,182
You always do whatever you want. If you're hot, everyone's hot.

1022
00:46:06,352 --> 00:46:07,781
If you're cold, you need everyone to be cold.

1023
00:46:07,952 --> 00:46:09,582
You're making that face again. I told you to smile.

1024
00:46:13,091 --> 00:46:14,252
One day...

1025
00:46:14,252 --> 00:46:16,591
(One day...)

1026
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:19,292
I'm just waiting for that day to come.

1027
00:46:23,361 --> 00:46:25,461
The flavor of the soup is so deep.

1028
00:46:29,002 --> 00:46:33,772
(The dried pollack noodles fit their taste perfectly.)

1029
00:46:34,011 --> 00:46:36,481
It's from watching my mom...

1030
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:38,412
cook at the tent bar.

1031
00:46:39,312 --> 00:46:41,852
(It's so good.)

1032
00:46:42,182 --> 00:46:44,622
She made soup at the tent bar.

1033
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:48,691
(The doorkeeper of the day)

1034
00:46:48,691 --> 00:46:50,392
After drinking...

1035
00:46:51,321 --> 00:46:53,131
- The sound of the wind outside! - Wow.

1036
00:46:53,231 --> 00:46:54,392
The wind is blowing.

1037
00:46:55,662 --> 00:46:56,761
I bet it'll be really cold outside.

1038
00:46:56,761 --> 00:46:57,932
(It's warm inside the house.)

1039
00:46:58,202 --> 00:47:01,872
(Outside, the wind is blowing.)

1040
00:47:01,872 --> 00:47:04,671
(Even the big trees are shaking.)

1041
00:47:05,142 --> 00:47:07,011
It's colder than yesterday at the moment.

1042
00:47:07,011 --> 00:47:08,742
- Yes, the temperature is lower. - It's much colder.

1043
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,381
- Oh, it's colder? - The temperature is lower.

1044
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:14,381
Yesterday, it was minus 12°C. Today, it's minus 14°C.

1045
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:16,781
Wow, minus 14°C.

1046
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:18,952
No, but this house...

1047
00:47:19,151 --> 00:47:21,992
It's so hot right now. Why was it so cold last night?

1048
00:47:23,461 --> 00:47:24,691
- Oh, no. - Why?

1049
00:47:24,792 --> 00:47:26,691
- It's so cold. - Right?

1050
00:47:26,861 --> 00:47:28,662
It's cold even though I warmed myself up.

1051
00:47:28,662 --> 00:47:30,662
See? It's so cold.

1052
00:47:33,002 --> 00:47:34,031
Wow.

1053
00:47:35,071 --> 00:47:37,042
(Today, after eating...)

1054
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:40,142
(it got hot.)

1055
00:47:41,011 --> 00:47:43,042
(Yawning)

1056
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:46,082
After shaking so much, now that the sun's up...

1057
00:47:46,082 --> 00:47:47,381
Si Wan, don't you feel really tired?

1058
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:49,051
- Yes, indeed. - Don't you want to lie down?

1059
00:47:49,051 --> 00:47:51,252
Taking a nap will be perfect.

1060
00:47:51,252 --> 00:47:52,452
(A warm guy sharing the blanket.)

1061
00:47:53,691 --> 00:47:56,861
Let's lie down when the sun's out.

1062
00:47:57,222 --> 00:48:00,591
(The house is basking in the rays peeking through the clouds.)

1063
00:48:00,591 --> 00:48:01,662
Isn't it so nice?

1064
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:05,602
It's like a real house.

1065
00:48:06,162 --> 00:48:08,801
In the remote mountains of Gangwon Province.

1066
00:48:09,801 --> 00:48:12,202
Sitting here in the warmth.

1067
00:48:13,071 --> 00:48:14,111
Yeah, that's right.

1068
00:48:14,111 --> 00:48:15,142
(Sounds nice)

1069
00:48:15,472 --> 00:48:17,642
- I'm getting really sleepy. - Right?

1070
00:48:18,182 --> 00:48:19,242
Go to sleep.

1071
00:48:19,651 --> 00:48:23,522
(On a tired afternoon with warm sunlight,)

1072
00:48:24,421 --> 00:48:28,492
(with the fir trees in the back as the background,)

1073
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:34,631
(and with the sound of the mountain stream as a lullaby,)

1074
00:48:35,631 --> 00:48:39,461
(the four brothers go off to sleep.)

1075
00:48:39,832 --> 00:48:43,801
(Si Wan goes up to the second floor to his bed.)

1076
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:45,602
- Everyone to his position? - Yes.

1077
00:48:45,602 --> 00:48:46,841
Dong Wook, lie down.

1078
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,472
(Cozy)

1079
00:48:48,472 --> 00:48:49,542
Lie down here.

1080
00:48:49,682 --> 00:48:50,881
Wow, we're really sleeping.

1081
00:48:51,481 --> 00:48:52,642
Lie down.

1082
00:48:52,642 --> 00:48:54,412
Lie down. Just lie down!

1083
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,582
- Don't look around. - Should I go upstairs?

1084
00:48:56,582 --> 00:48:58,352
No, it's more comfortable here. Come here!

1085
00:48:58,651 --> 00:48:59,651
Lie down here.

1086
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:01,492
The floor is warm here,

1087
00:49:01,492 --> 00:49:02,852
so it's better here. Come here.

1088
00:49:02,852 --> 00:49:04,261
(Dong Wook, sleep next to me.)

1089
00:49:04,662 --> 00:49:06,932
(Oh dear)

1090
00:49:06,932 --> 00:49:07,932
Oh, my back.

1091
00:49:07,932 --> 00:49:10,002
(So nice)

1092
00:49:10,761 --> 00:49:11,761
Oh, my back.

1093
00:49:12,062 --> 00:49:13,272
It's so nice.

1094
00:49:15,031 --> 00:49:18,071
(Dong Wook is sleeping after just two hours of coming here.)

1095
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:19,611
It's comfortable, right?

1096
00:49:20,472 --> 00:49:21,711
(Wow...)

1097
00:49:24,142 --> 00:49:26,312
I think when I open my eyes, it'll be nighttime.

1098
00:49:26,312 --> 00:49:27,682
(After lying down, it's so comfortable.)

1099
00:49:29,182 --> 00:49:31,381
It's so nice that our backs are warm.

1100
00:49:31,381 --> 00:49:32,381
It's so nice.

1101
00:49:34,452 --> 00:49:35,651
- Hee Won. - Yes?

1102
00:49:35,852 --> 00:49:38,122
Turn on some music with your phone.

1103
00:49:38,662 --> 00:49:40,332
Classical music you should listen to when you're sleeping.

1104
00:49:41,761 --> 00:49:44,031
- Classical music when sleeping? - Yes.

1105
00:49:45,301 --> 00:49:46,872
You can listen to any classical music...

1106
00:49:47,502 --> 00:49:48,832
- You'll get sleepy? - Yes.

1107
00:49:48,832 --> 00:49:49,901
Really?

1108
00:49:50,671 --> 00:49:52,571
(Dong Wook agrees.)

1109
00:49:57,841 --> 00:49:58,881
It's perfect!

1110
00:49:58,881 --> 00:49:59,952
(Just to his liking)

1111
00:50:01,752 --> 00:50:04,682
(Hee Won goes to sleep after playing the music.)

1112
00:50:05,421 --> 00:50:09,051
(Naptime as they listen to calm classical music)

1113
00:50:10,992 --> 00:50:12,361
It would be nice if it snowed.

1114
00:50:12,992 --> 00:50:14,131
They said it would.

1115
00:50:15,062 --> 00:50:16,292
- Really? - Yes.

1116
00:50:16,832 --> 00:50:17,901
On the weather report.

1117
00:50:24,142 --> 00:50:26,872
(Hee Won, I'll go to sleep first.)

1118
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:30,441
(Wriggle)

1119
00:50:32,711 --> 00:50:36,381
(Even the bewildered Dong Wook peacefully falls asleep.)

1120
00:50:37,481 --> 00:50:40,352
(Si Wan too, who was busy adjusting and taking care of the older guys.)

1121
00:50:40,352 --> 00:50:43,361
(10 times play speed)

1122
00:50:43,361 --> 00:50:47,091
(Breathing heavily)

1123
00:50:48,761 --> 00:50:51,202
(The clear sound of the water that would quiet any anxiety)

1124
00:50:52,401 --> 00:50:55,432
(The sound of the wind in the winter)

1125
00:50:59,941 --> 00:51:04,042
(They rest their tired bodies from the cold by taking a nap.)

1126
00:51:05,182 --> 00:51:06,582
(Snoring)

1127
00:51:06,582 --> 00:51:08,352
(Snoring)

1128
00:51:09,211 --> 00:51:12,452
(The sound of snoring amidst the quiet naptime)

1129
00:51:15,151 --> 00:51:17,321
(Wakes up)

1130
00:51:22,691 --> 00:51:26,671
(Dong Wook woke up first from Dong Il's snoring.)

1131
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:37,312
(The reason he's surprised right after he woke up...)

1132
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:42,051
(is because it started to snow outside.)

1133
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:47,252
(Snow that the family has waited for so long)

1134
00:51:49,792 --> 00:51:54,261
(Blank)

1135
00:51:55,562 --> 00:51:58,031
(Looking around)

1136
00:51:59,231 --> 00:52:02,131
(Should I wake everyone up to see the snow?)

1137
00:52:03,602 --> 00:52:06,941
(He thinks hard for a long time.)

1138
00:52:08,341 --> 00:52:10,511
(House owner 1 who wanted to see snow)

1139
00:52:10,981 --> 00:52:13,452
(House owner 2 who wanted to see snow)

1140
00:52:14,651 --> 00:52:17,981
(While even house owner 3 is sleeping like a log,)

1141
00:52:18,682 --> 00:52:22,151
(Dong Wook decides to see snow first.)

1142
00:52:24,222 --> 00:52:26,832
(The guest got to see the first snow of House on Wheels...)

1143
00:52:26,832 --> 00:52:27,832
(before the owners.)

1144
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:32,602
(Falling at the end of winter near spring)

1145
00:52:33,832 --> 00:52:36,901
(It's lucky for the snow to fall.)

1146
00:52:38,472 --> 00:52:41,642
(To see the snow better, he even moves to another place...)

1147
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:46,341
(and looks at it continuously.)

1148
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:51,622
(The white snow makes you blank out and just look at it.)

1149
00:52:54,651 --> 00:52:58,421
(What is Dong Wook thinking about while looking at the snow?)

1150
00:52:59,562 --> 00:53:02,131
(Taking a glance)

1151
00:53:03,631 --> 00:53:05,502
(Sleeping)

1152
00:53:06,301 --> 00:53:08,102
(Hesitant)

1153
00:53:08,372 --> 00:53:10,702
(Should I wake them up?)

1154
00:53:12,202 --> 00:53:15,671
(Dong Wook wants to see the snow together with them.)

1155
00:53:16,881 --> 00:53:20,412
(But the owners are sleeping soundly.)

1156
00:53:21,452 --> 00:53:23,821
(He's not moving at all.)

1157
00:53:24,252 --> 00:53:26,921
(He has no plan to wake up.)

1158
00:53:27,352 --> 00:53:30,122
(In his dreamland)

1159
00:53:30,591 --> 00:53:32,321
(Should I wake them up?)

1160
00:53:32,321 --> 00:53:35,091
(Should I not? What should I do?)

1161
00:53:36,261 --> 00:53:38,861
(Thinking hard for a long time)

1162
00:53:40,401 --> 00:53:45,772
(He waits with the face of someone who has a story to tell.)

1163
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:52,011
(Yawning)

1164
00:53:53,852 --> 00:53:56,981
(In the end,)

1165
00:53:56,981 --> 00:53:59,222
(He gives up.)

1166
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:04,162
(Will the snow just be left in Dong Wook's memory?)

1167
00:54:05,321 --> 00:54:08,832
(Or will the owners be able to see this snow?)

1168
00:54:09,662 --> 00:54:11,832
(After 15 minutes)

1169
00:54:13,401 --> 00:54:15,731
(Dong Wook wakes up first again.)

1170
00:54:15,731 --> 00:54:18,472
(Dong Il wakes up because of him.)

1171
00:54:18,941 --> 00:54:20,742
- It's snowing a lot outside. - Gosh!

1172
00:54:20,742 --> 00:54:22,571
(Showing off)

1173
00:54:22,912 --> 00:54:24,182
Hee Won, it's snowing.

1174
00:54:24,182 --> 00:54:25,881
(Waking up immediately 1)

1175
00:54:25,912 --> 00:54:28,912
(Waking up immediately 2)

1176
00:54:30,551 --> 00:54:32,122
My gosh,

1177
00:54:33,122 --> 00:54:34,492
the weather...

1178
00:54:35,122 --> 00:54:37,292
(Somewhat proud)

1179
00:54:38,722 --> 00:54:41,361
How can it snow now?

1180
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,031
I know, right?

1181
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:45,461
(Snow is piled up on House on Wheels' roof too!)

1182
00:54:45,461 --> 00:54:47,272
It's piling up.

1183
00:54:48,731 --> 00:54:50,472
It's piled up prettily.

1184
00:54:50,472 --> 00:54:52,901
(The mountain stream is covered in white as well.)

1185
00:54:54,272 --> 00:54:55,742
(The whole world is covered with a white blanket.)

1186
00:54:55,742 --> 00:54:57,242
This is so pretty.

1187
00:54:58,182 --> 00:55:01,151
I think it's worth coming to Pyeongchang...

1188
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:05,082
since we get to see snow piling up. This is so pretty.

1189
00:55:05,082 --> 00:55:07,051
- Yes. - This is so pretty.

1190
00:55:07,051 --> 00:55:08,222
(Dong Il is proud.)

1191
00:55:09,292 --> 00:55:12,062
I guess it was that cold to give us a gift like this.

1192
00:55:12,792 --> 00:55:14,761
Why is it snowing so much?

1193
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:16,062
(Ruining the moment 1)

1194
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,861
The road will get slippery!

1195
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:21,332
(He says that, but we know he likes it.)

1196
00:55:21,531 --> 00:55:24,301
- Our wish is granted. - Our wish is granted.

1197
00:55:24,972 --> 00:55:26,812
This is amazing.

1198
00:55:27,571 --> 00:55:30,381
Anything is possible in this house.

1199
00:55:30,711 --> 00:55:32,582
This is the best part of our house.

1200
00:55:32,582 --> 00:55:34,952
(This is the best part of our house.)

1201
00:55:36,752 --> 00:55:42,022
(Open)

1202
00:55:45,461 --> 00:55:47,392
(So cool.)

1203
00:55:48,392 --> 00:55:50,062
(They open the window and enjoy...)

1204
00:55:50,062 --> 00:55:51,731
(spacing out while staring at the snow.)

1205
00:55:52,602 --> 00:55:55,772
("It’s Dangerous Beyond The Blankets" staring mode)

1206
00:55:57,801 --> 00:55:59,272
This is so nice.

1207
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,472
(It's so pretty.)

1208
00:56:02,242 --> 00:56:04,742
We have a knack for finding good places.

1209
00:56:04,742 --> 00:56:05,981
(He becomes more emotional after opening the window.)

1210
00:56:06,881 --> 00:56:08,511
(Snow is coming in from the window that is wide open.)

1211
00:56:08,511 --> 00:56:10,481
Isn't this unbelievable?

1212
00:56:11,981 --> 00:56:14,952
Whether it's sea or mountain...

1213
00:56:17,091 --> 00:56:19,461
(The house's front yard is covered in snow today!)

1214
00:56:19,461 --> 00:56:21,591
It's so funny how it started snowing when we were sleeping.

1215
00:56:21,731 --> 00:56:22,792
Right?

1216
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:24,801
(The privilege of House on Wheels)

1217
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:27,972
It feels like I'm sitting in a hot spring.

1218
00:56:30,202 --> 00:56:31,772
My bottom feels hot.

1219
00:56:31,772 --> 00:56:33,202
(His breath explains why it feels like a hot spring.)

1220
00:56:35,011 --> 00:56:36,742
He even brought up a hot spring.

1221
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,082
We'll stay like this and eat again later, right?

1222
00:56:41,082 --> 00:56:42,252
Yes.

1223
00:56:42,682 --> 00:56:44,682
Eat, sleep, and see snow.

1224
00:56:44,752 --> 00:56:46,122
You come to this house...

1225
00:56:46,321 --> 00:56:48,921
and eat, sleep, and see snow.

1226
00:56:49,292 --> 00:56:53,122
It feels like I've always stayed here.

1227
00:56:54,031 --> 00:56:56,432
(He's perfectly adjusted to House on Wheels.)

1228
00:56:57,031 --> 00:56:58,901
This is so nice.

1229
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,731
I should open this too. Amazing!

1230
00:57:02,631 --> 00:57:04,772
(He's so cute.)

1231
00:57:05,142 --> 00:57:07,912
(Sticking his head out)

1232
00:57:09,071 --> 00:57:11,312
This is really nice.

1233
00:57:11,841 --> 00:57:13,881
(Sudden movement)

1234
00:57:14,651 --> 00:57:17,281
(He scribbles on the roof.)

1235
00:57:19,622 --> 00:57:22,022
(Trying his best)

1236
00:57:22,392 --> 00:57:26,222
(House on...)

1237
00:57:26,222 --> 00:57:28,461
It's so confusing to write upside down.

1238
00:57:28,591 --> 00:57:32,062
Wheels, the letter W...

1239
00:57:33,531 --> 00:57:36,031
How should I write it? Oh, it's like that.

1240
00:57:36,031 --> 00:57:38,202
Hold on, like this.

1241
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:40,772
(House on W)

1242
00:57:40,772 --> 00:57:42,642
(He successfully writes the letter.)

1243
00:57:43,711 --> 00:57:45,412
(Pause)

1244
00:57:45,481 --> 00:57:46,742
Letter h...

1245
00:57:48,511 --> 00:57:50,011
It's confusing.

1246
00:57:50,011 --> 00:57:51,151
(Reverse)

1247
00:57:51,781 --> 00:57:56,222
(Practicing)

1248
00:57:56,591 --> 00:57:59,691
(House on Wh)

1249
00:57:59,691 --> 00:58:01,932
(He succeeds.)

1250
00:58:04,401 --> 00:58:07,031
(He's finally done with the complicated part.)

1251
00:58:07,031 --> 00:58:09,171
(House on Whee)

1252
00:58:09,171 --> 00:58:12,171
(House on Wheels)

1253
00:58:12,742 --> 00:58:14,841
(He's so proud of himself.)

1254
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:17,182
(I almost forgot!)

1255
00:58:17,412 --> 00:58:20,082
I can't reach it!

1256
00:58:20,852 --> 00:58:22,381
(He scribbles something else.)

1257
00:58:22,381 --> 00:58:23,622
Okay.

1258
00:58:24,551 --> 00:58:27,051
(Satisfied)

1259
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:30,821
- I wrote a message. - What did you write?

1260
00:58:31,062 --> 00:58:33,531
Check it out by watching the show.

1261
00:58:33,531 --> 00:58:34,531
(It's a secret.)

1262
00:58:34,792 --> 00:58:35,832
(House on Wheels is amazing.)

1263
00:58:35,832 --> 00:58:38,261
(Checked)

1264
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:42,002
I feel so much better after sleeping.

1265
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:43,972
- I didn't sleep. - Really?

1266
00:58:43,972 --> 00:58:46,912
I was just thinking deeply.

1267
00:58:48,312 --> 00:58:50,611
(It's just that the thoughts were way too deep.)

1268
00:58:51,642 --> 00:58:54,182
(Engrossed in his thoughts)

1269
00:58:54,852 --> 00:58:57,781
He's thinking about the future of House on Wheels.

1270
00:58:57,781 --> 00:58:59,551
(Nodding)

1271
00:59:00,321 --> 00:59:03,022
(He's wrapped in his padded jacket because it's too cold.)

1272
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:06,492
The floor's so hot.

1273
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,432
- Really. - Yes, come here.

1274
00:59:09,832 --> 00:59:11,062
I'm not joking.

1275
00:59:11,731 --> 00:59:13,002
For real.

1276
00:59:13,131 --> 00:59:14,571
I'll just trust you.

1277
00:59:14,571 --> 00:59:16,602
(I'll just trust you.)

1278
00:59:16,772 --> 00:59:17,972
(He's still in "It’s Dangerous Beyond The Blankets" mode.)

1279
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:19,341
I trust you.

1280
00:59:19,671 --> 00:59:20,872
(Laughing)

1281
00:59:20,872 --> 00:59:22,142
No.

1282
00:59:23,171 --> 00:59:25,981
- I trust you. - Seriously, come sit here!

1283
00:59:26,211 --> 00:59:29,011
- I'm so lazy to move. - Come here.

1284
00:59:29,111 --> 00:59:30,622
- I'm not joking. - I said I trust you!

1285
00:59:30,622 --> 00:59:32,852
- Come here. - I trust you, seriously.

1286
00:59:32,921 --> 00:59:35,452
You won't even trust me when I say I trust you.

1287
00:59:35,452 --> 00:59:37,861
Come here, this side.

1288
00:59:37,861 --> 00:59:40,631
- You should be comfortable. - I said I trust you so many times.

1289
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:43,702
Stay here, don't move!

1290
00:59:44,002 --> 00:59:45,031
Here.

1291
00:59:45,631 --> 00:59:47,731
(Thank you...)

1292
00:59:47,872 --> 00:59:49,901
Put your hand on the floor and see if I'm joking.

1293
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:52,972
- My gosh. - I told you I'm not joking!

1294
00:59:52,972 --> 00:59:55,642
- It's hot. - That's why I said I trust you.

1295
00:59:55,642 --> 00:59:57,082
(That's why I said I trust you.)

1296
00:59:58,781 --> 00:59:59,941
(This is so nice.)

1297
00:59:59,941 --> 01:00:01,551
- It's super warm, right? - Yes.

1298
01:00:03,881 --> 01:00:07,051
(The snow doesn't seem to stop falling any time soon.)

1299
01:00:08,292 --> 01:00:10,892
(He's enjoying the view from the kitchen.)

1300
01:00:12,022 --> 01:00:14,031
(Feeling languid)

1301
01:00:14,992 --> 01:00:18,631
It'll be nice to have sword bean tea now.

1302
01:00:18,631 --> 01:00:21,372
Do you drink sword bean tea?

1303
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:23,642
- What is that? - Sword bean tea.

1304
01:00:23,642 --> 01:00:25,102
- Sword bean tea? - Yes.

1305
01:00:25,102 --> 01:00:26,772
- There's too much. - From here...

1306
01:00:29,642 --> 01:00:30,711
From here...

1307
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:34,412
(Is it necessary to come down so flashily to brew sword bean tea?)

1308
01:00:35,082 --> 01:00:36,111
Gosh!

1309
01:00:37,151 --> 01:00:41,321
(The extraordinary youngest's sword bean tea brewing)

1310
01:00:45,992 --> 01:00:49,261
(Sword bean tea recommended by Si Wan)

1311
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:53,102
(Sword beans look like this.)

1312
01:00:54,202 --> 01:00:55,332
(If you dry them completely and boil it with water,)

1313
01:00:55,332 --> 01:00:56,472
(it smells good.)

1314
01:00:57,301 --> 01:00:59,602
I'm not joking,

1315
01:00:59,602 --> 01:01:01,642
but my throat hurts so much.

1316
01:01:02,341 --> 01:01:04,082
I think my throat hurts as well...

1317
01:01:04,611 --> 01:01:06,841
- now that you say that. - It hurts, right?

1318
01:01:07,381 --> 01:01:10,082
(Got it.)

1319
01:01:11,821 --> 01:01:15,622
(Brown-colored sword bean tea is good for your airway.)

1320
01:01:16,321 --> 01:01:18,062
(Sniffing)

1321
01:01:18,062 --> 01:01:20,432
(Taking a sip)

1322
01:01:24,202 --> 01:01:25,401
This is just nice.

1323
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:26,961
- Really? - Yes.

1324
01:01:27,171 --> 01:01:30,002
He's so smart using the wooden mugs.

1325
01:01:30,602 --> 01:01:33,571
I tried to give a nature-friendly vibe.

1326
01:01:34,642 --> 01:01:37,542
Please take a mug each.

1327
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:38,582
(Nature-friendly sword bean tea is ready.)

1328
01:01:38,981 --> 01:01:39,981
Thank you.

1329
01:01:39,981 --> 01:01:41,852
(Dong Il tries first.)

1330
01:01:42,111 --> 01:01:44,551
It tastes quite traditional.

1331
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:47,452
- What is this again? - Sword bean.

1332
01:01:47,452 --> 01:01:49,292
- Bean. - Sword bean.

1333
01:01:49,752 --> 01:01:51,222
(Drinking)

1334
01:01:51,821 --> 01:01:53,792
(His throat is soothed.)

1335
01:01:56,932 --> 01:01:58,162
It tastes good!

1336
01:01:59,301 --> 01:02:00,531
How is it?

1337
01:02:00,531 --> 01:02:02,731
(Thank goodness.)

1338
01:02:03,671 --> 01:02:06,142
Doesn't it feel like a guest room in the countryside?

1339
01:02:06,142 --> 01:02:09,312
It's great. I think I've perfectly adjusted to this place.

1340
01:02:10,711 --> 01:02:14,881
How long has it been since we filmed "Take Off"?

1341
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,082
2008?

1342
01:02:16,252 --> 01:02:19,352
- Really? - 2008 to 2009.

1343
01:02:19,452 --> 01:02:24,321
Then it's been 12 to 13 years.

1344
01:02:25,461 --> 01:02:27,832
It's already been more than 10 years?

1345
01:02:27,832 --> 01:02:29,832
- We took one year to film. - You're right!

1346
01:02:29,932 --> 01:02:31,861
- And... - When we were filming "Take Off",

1347
01:02:32,432 --> 01:02:33,872
my wife gave birth to my child.

1348
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:38,202
Bin was born during that time. Right? Yes, it's right.

1349
01:02:38,472 --> 01:02:42,042
When we were fixing the skis on the car roof,

1350
01:02:42,441 --> 01:02:44,182
when we were setting it up, I received the phone call.

1351
01:02:44,481 --> 01:02:47,752
- That she's born? - Yes, she's born safe and sound.

1352
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:53,252
(42-year-old Dong Il and 26-year-old Dong Wook met each other...)

1353
01:02:53,952 --> 01:02:55,622
(and filmed for 1 year.)

1354
01:02:55,622 --> 01:02:58,321
(The movie set the record of 8 million audiences.)

1355
01:02:58,662 --> 01:03:02,091
(My daughter Bin is born!)

1356
01:03:03,591 --> 01:03:06,202
I received a round of applause in front of the dormitory.

1357
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:08,171
- When I was on the car... - I think I remember.

1358
01:03:08,171 --> 01:03:10,401
drilling the skis, I got the phone call.

1359
01:03:10,502 --> 01:03:12,901
I said, "My wife gave birth safely!"

1360
01:03:13,071 --> 01:03:15,372
And everyone else was like, "Congratulations!"

1361
01:03:15,972 --> 01:03:17,211
It's back then.

1362
01:03:18,111 --> 01:03:19,341
Time flies.

1363
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:23,011
(They have a lot of memories filming in Pyeongchang.)

1364
01:03:24,222 --> 01:03:25,381
I should make a call.

1365
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:26,381
(Since he's reminiscing, he makes a call.)

1366
01:03:26,381 --> 01:03:28,091
- Hello! - Heung Soo!

1367
01:03:28,191 --> 01:03:30,562
Dong Wook's beside me. Say hello.

1368
01:03:31,022 --> 01:03:32,961
Hello, long time no see.

1369
01:03:32,961 --> 01:03:34,361
- Hello! - Yes.

1370
01:03:34,361 --> 01:03:36,031
- Hello. - How have you been?

1371
01:03:36,031 --> 01:03:38,102
- How are you guys together? - He came over.

1372
01:03:38,502 --> 01:03:42,301
Remember the ski track we filmed the movie, the ski jump track?

1373
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,202
- Yes. - We're near there.

1374
01:03:44,202 --> 01:03:46,042
I'm on a ski jump track as well.

1375
01:03:46,042 --> 01:03:49,142
Really? Then can we go up...

1376
01:03:49,142 --> 01:03:50,242
to the track we filmed on?

1377
01:03:50,582 --> 01:03:52,412
- You can. - Thank you.

1378
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,711
- Please come. - I'll visit soon.

1379
01:03:54,812 --> 01:03:55,881
- Okay. - Okay.

1380
01:03:57,011 --> 01:04:00,852
Let's get moving since Heung Soo is there.

1381
01:04:00,852 --> 01:04:01,852
Okay.

1382
01:04:02,352 --> 01:04:05,562
It will be nice to see from up there with the snow.

1383
01:04:07,022 --> 01:04:09,562
- I'll start driving. - Let's go.

1384
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:13,361
Let's go back to 13 years ago.

1385
01:04:14,071 --> 01:04:15,332
13 years ago.

1386
01:04:16,432 --> 01:04:19,841
It looks different with the snow.

1387
01:04:20,642 --> 01:04:21,941
It's different from when you came, right?

1388
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:23,841
Look at this side, the snow's piled up quite a lot.

1389
01:04:24,082 --> 01:04:25,481
It's so white.

1390
01:04:27,111 --> 01:04:29,611
Seeing snow in Gangwon Province...

1391
01:04:30,111 --> 01:04:32,582
I think it's been about 20 years since I saw snow in this area.

1392
01:04:32,582 --> 01:04:33,892
- Really? - Yes.

1393
01:04:34,392 --> 01:04:36,392
(The white magic that was cast in front of our front yard)

1394
01:04:36,392 --> 01:04:37,522
It looks like a different world.

1395
01:04:38,122 --> 01:04:39,421
It really is a different world.

1396
01:04:40,421 --> 01:04:42,062
(While they are all amazed by the snow...)

1397
01:04:42,062 --> 01:04:45,131
- It snowed a lot suddenly. - Yes.

1398
01:04:46,202 --> 01:04:47,571
The road will be slippery.

1399
01:04:47,901 --> 01:04:49,031
Drive slowly.

1400
01:04:49,932 --> 01:04:53,372
It's quite dangerous, drive slowly.

1401
01:04:53,372 --> 01:04:54,372
(He can't take his eyes off.)

1402
01:04:54,472 --> 01:04:55,611
Slower.

1403
01:04:55,611 --> 01:04:57,912
(Laughing)

1404
01:04:57,912 --> 01:04:59,682
He started interfering with the driving.

1405
01:05:03,211 --> 01:05:04,852
Should I have driven instead?

1406
01:05:04,852 --> 01:05:07,752
(Hee Won is the official driver.)

1407
01:05:08,222 --> 01:05:11,392
No, I trust him.

1408
01:05:11,921 --> 01:05:14,461
(Smiling)

1409
01:05:15,131 --> 01:05:16,131
(He will drive safely.)

1410
01:05:16,131 --> 01:05:18,562
But the snow isn't piled up on the road.

1411
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:20,031
Yes.

1412
01:05:21,231 --> 01:05:24,401
- I want to eat trout sashimi too! - Sounds tasty.

1413
01:05:24,702 --> 01:05:25,702
- Right? - Yes.

1414
01:05:25,702 --> 01:05:27,341
Trout sashimi is good.

1415
01:05:28,211 --> 01:05:29,642
Do you like trout sashimi, Hee Won?

1416
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,981
I don't know what trout sashimi is. Trout?

1417
01:05:32,981 --> 01:05:36,412
Trout is freshwater fish that only lives in grade one water.

1418
01:05:36,412 --> 01:05:38,452
- Can you eat it raw? - You can eat it raw.

1419
01:05:38,921 --> 01:05:43,191
The color of the meat looks pretty splendid.

1420
01:05:44,022 --> 01:05:45,022
Trout sashimi.

1421
01:05:45,492 --> 01:05:47,292
Let's have trout sashimi.

1422
01:05:47,492 --> 01:05:48,961
- Today? - Yes.

1423
01:05:49,392 --> 01:05:50,901
(Tilting his head)

1424
01:05:51,261 --> 01:05:53,432
When I was young,

1425
01:05:53,531 --> 01:05:56,531
my dad almost passed away after eating freshwater fish sashimi.

1426
01:05:56,801 --> 01:05:58,602
Why would you bring that up now?

1427
01:05:59,142 --> 01:06:02,711
From what I remember, I was told to never eat...

1428
01:06:02,711 --> 01:06:04,412
freshwater fish raw.

1429
01:06:04,412 --> 01:06:05,812
Should we not eat, then?

1430
01:06:05,812 --> 01:06:06,912
(Trout raised in a fishery is safe.)

1431
01:06:06,912 --> 01:06:07,952
(He worries a lot.)

1432
01:06:07,952 --> 01:06:08,981
I don't know.

1433
01:06:09,952 --> 01:06:12,321
He's already worried about driving,

1434
01:06:12,321 --> 01:06:15,622
and now he has one more thing to worry about.

1435
01:06:15,622 --> 01:06:16,622
(Worrying doll)

1436
01:06:16,792 --> 01:06:19,191
I think he's worried that we might eat trout sashimi.

1437
01:06:19,191 --> 01:06:22,131
It's okay because I won't eat.

1438
01:06:22,131 --> 01:06:23,131
(He listens to his mom.)

1439
01:06:23,131 --> 01:06:24,901
(Laughing)

1440
01:06:26,401 --> 01:06:30,231
I don't think I've ever been to Pyeongchang except for filming.

1441
01:06:30,231 --> 01:06:31,242
(He's come back to Pyeongchang after a long time.)

1442
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:33,171
It's my first time after "Take Off".

1443
01:06:33,171 --> 01:06:34,171
(The passion of Dong Wook in his 20s is left here.)

1444
01:06:34,171 --> 01:06:37,511
It will feel new when we're there. We're almost there.

1445
01:06:38,381 --> 01:06:41,011
(He looks around to reminisce his memories.)

1446
01:06:41,011 --> 01:06:42,051
The track!

1447
01:06:42,051 --> 01:06:43,352
(He found the ski jump track.)

1448
01:06:43,352 --> 01:06:44,852
(Where is it?)

1449
01:06:45,381 --> 01:06:47,182
(They can't help but get amazed.)

1450
01:06:47,182 --> 01:06:48,191
Amazing.

1451
01:06:49,392 --> 01:06:50,421
The jump track.

1452
01:06:50,421 --> 01:06:53,722
(The great winter kingdom they met after driving on the curvy road)

1453
01:06:54,461 --> 01:06:55,631
This is awesome.

1454
01:06:55,631 --> 01:06:58,602
(Ski jump track built on top of the mountain 850m above sea level)

1455
01:06:59,062 --> 01:07:00,872
(The place where Dong Il and Dong Wook...)

1456
01:07:00,872 --> 01:07:02,872
(poured all of their passion 13 years ago)

1457
01:07:03,631 --> 01:07:07,171
("Take Off" moved the heart of every Korean.)

1458
01:07:07,972 --> 01:07:12,881
(Their sweat and passion for 2 years of filming are left here.)

1459
01:07:13,981 --> 01:07:18,981
(They've come to the ski jump track together after a long time.)

1460
01:07:20,182 --> 01:07:24,961
(They want to share the memories of that time with the family.)

1461
01:07:25,562 --> 01:07:27,832
- Hello. - Hello!

1462
01:07:27,832 --> 01:07:28,861
(A familiar voice is heard from the entrance.)

1463
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:31,432
- Hello. - We need to do this.

1464
01:07:31,432 --> 01:07:33,002
- Hello! - How are you?

1465
01:07:33,002 --> 01:07:34,301
Nice to meet you.

1466
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:36,202
(He was the ski jump coach back then.)

1467
01:07:36,502 --> 01:07:37,502
Are you here to camp?

1468
01:07:37,502 --> 01:07:40,471
Yes, we came to camp, and since Dong Wook came over,

1469
01:07:40,672 --> 01:07:42,542
I wanted to go up to the track.

1470
01:07:42,542 --> 01:07:44,012
Sure, go ahead.

1471
01:07:44,012 --> 01:07:46,242
We're not walking up like last time, right?

1472
01:07:46,582 --> 01:07:47,882
It's changed a bit.

1473
01:07:47,882 --> 01:07:49,281
- Really? - Shall we look at this first?

1474
01:07:49,281 --> 01:07:50,281
Right,

1475
01:07:50,582 --> 01:07:53,122
he filmed the movie in his late 20s.

1476
01:07:53,721 --> 01:07:55,052
Now I'm 39.

1477
01:07:55,851 --> 01:07:56,992
Right.

1478
01:07:56,992 --> 01:07:58,462
(Passionate Dong Wook in his 20s became 39 and came back.)

1479
01:07:59,561 --> 01:08:00,832
(How did the place change in 13 years?)

1480
01:08:00,832 --> 01:08:01,861
Look around.

1481
01:08:02,262 --> 01:08:04,502
It looks pretty tall in real life!

1482
01:08:04,502 --> 01:08:07,971
How do you jump from there?

1483
01:08:08,031 --> 01:08:09,332
(Overwhelming presence of 138m in the sky)

1484
01:08:09,872 --> 01:08:11,771
We're only looking at it from here.

1485
01:08:11,771 --> 01:08:14,641
It's a lot worse once you go up there.

1486
01:08:14,641 --> 01:08:15,941
(The jump track is placed at the end of the steep slope.)

1487
01:08:17,412 --> 01:08:20,311
Isn't this frightening, Hee Won?

1488
01:08:20,311 --> 01:08:21,311
Yes.

1489
01:08:21,311 --> 01:08:22,311
(Jumping downwards at the speed of 80kph)

1490
01:08:22,651 --> 01:08:25,452
(He's reminded of the memories from that time.)

1491
01:08:26,252 --> 01:08:27,391
(Gosh!)

1492
01:08:27,391 --> 01:08:30,891
Did you actually go on top there to film?

1493
01:08:31,021 --> 01:08:32,061
(They actually filmed on top of 138m which is scary to even stand on.)

1494
01:08:32,061 --> 01:08:33,422
Standing by the rail there.

1495
01:08:33,422 --> 01:08:34,832
(Terrifying)

1496
01:08:35,262 --> 01:08:38,462
That's so terrifying.

1497
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:40,901
At the end of the jump track!

1498
01:08:41,132 --> 01:08:43,332
We carried our skis till there...

1499
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:45,101
and came down skiing from there.

1500
01:08:45,502 --> 01:08:46,742
You made us do it.

1501
01:08:46,742 --> 01:08:48,712
Back then...

1502
01:08:48,872 --> 01:08:50,712
You did make them jump for real.

1503
01:08:50,882 --> 01:08:52,382
- From up there? - They really...

1504
01:08:52,382 --> 01:08:53,582
skied down tied to a rope.

1505
01:08:54,311 --> 01:08:56,611
Is that even possible?

1506
01:08:57,311 --> 01:08:58,851
Thank goodness the movie was a success.

1507
01:08:58,851 --> 01:09:01,122
(Thank goodness the movie was a success.)

1508
01:09:01,691 --> 01:09:04,762
It would've been bad if the movie flopped after all you've done.

1509
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:06,061
Thank goodness.

1510
01:09:06,162 --> 01:09:09,691
I don't think I can do it now. How did I even go up there and ski?

1511
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:10,832
Seriously.

1512
01:09:11,861 --> 01:09:13,262
(Let's feel it closer with Si Wan.)

1513
01:09:13,262 --> 01:09:17,542
Every time I look at it, it's so high up.

1514
01:09:17,872 --> 01:09:19,202
It's terrifying even now.

1515
01:09:21,342 --> 01:09:22,412
I can't see the end.

1516
01:09:22,412 --> 01:09:24,941
(He runs uphill.)

1517
01:09:25,242 --> 01:09:28,752
He's going up. Si Wan's excited.

1518
01:09:29,681 --> 01:09:32,422
(Running)

1519
01:09:32,922 --> 01:09:35,292
(He runs on the steep slope...)

1520
01:09:35,292 --> 01:09:37,191
(and looks back.)

1521
01:09:37,922 --> 01:09:39,092
(He can feel the steepness of the track.)

1522
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,792
This is so scary.

1523
01:09:42,361 --> 01:09:44,202
Amazing.

1524
01:09:44,202 --> 01:09:45,302
(He looks like the passionate Dong Wook from 13 years ago.)

1525
01:09:45,302 --> 01:09:46,462
(Grinning)

1526
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:50,071
(Excited Si Wan runs to the top!)

1527
01:09:51,342 --> 01:09:55,111
(He falls down.)

1528
01:09:56,212 --> 01:09:57,441
The steepness is no joke.

1529
01:09:57,941 --> 01:09:59,141
(Sliding down)

1530
01:10:00,582 --> 01:10:01,952
(He tries to stand up,)

1531
01:10:01,952 --> 01:10:03,111
(but he slides down again.)

1532
01:10:03,111 --> 01:10:05,622
He's coming down like that.

1533
01:10:05,622 --> 01:10:06,681
(He has trouble coming down.)

1534
01:10:06,681 --> 01:10:07,691
(My goodness.)

1535
01:10:08,052 --> 01:10:10,221
(Laughing)

1536
01:10:11,162 --> 01:10:13,021
Look at him sliding down.

1537
01:10:13,992 --> 01:10:17,231
The sun's about to set! He's so excited.

1538
01:10:17,462 --> 01:10:18,762
Gosh, ski jump.

1539
01:10:19,531 --> 01:10:21,702
Dong Wook's going to jump from up there today.

1540
01:10:21,771 --> 01:10:23,502
- Today? - I got the skis ready.

1541
01:10:23,502 --> 01:10:24,571
They're ready, right?

1542
01:10:24,571 --> 01:10:25,601
(The coach goes along with him.)

1543
01:10:26,141 --> 01:10:27,141
(Be careful with the snowy downhill.)

1544
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:28,971
I don't know how I did it without getting scared back then.

1545
01:10:28,971 --> 01:10:30,981
I'm shaking from just walking down here.

1546
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:34,012
Just walking down here is scary.

1547
01:10:34,082 --> 01:10:35,412
Even this is dangerous for us.

1548
01:10:35,412 --> 01:10:38,281
Exactly, just this is enough to make me shake.

1549
01:10:39,122 --> 01:10:40,651
(They head to the jump track in the monorail.)

1550
01:10:40,651 --> 01:10:41,821
Hee Won, we're going up!

1551
01:10:43,651 --> 01:10:45,992
It looks steeper like this!

1552
01:10:47,521 --> 01:10:48,792
Look at this!

1553
01:10:48,792 --> 01:10:51,162
(They can see Pyeongchang under their feet at once!)

1554
01:10:51,162 --> 01:10:52,162
The view...

1555
01:10:53,202 --> 01:10:57,502
(The height is more overwhelming when they're closer to it.)

1556
01:10:58,441 --> 01:10:59,441
Man.

1557
01:10:59,542 --> 01:11:02,271
I hated the wire mesh on the floor.

1558
01:11:02,271 --> 01:11:03,512
(The sky walkway 138m above connects to the jump stand.)

1559
01:11:04,842 --> 01:11:07,481
My gosh, the floor's not covered!

1560
01:11:07,481 --> 01:11:08,712
Is it?

1561
01:11:08,811 --> 01:11:11,082
Don't look, we didn't look down when we were filming.

1562
01:11:11,082 --> 01:11:12,082
(Full of holes)

1563
01:11:12,321 --> 01:11:14,821
- My goodness. - This is the lower one.

1564
01:11:14,821 --> 01:11:17,292
- This is terrifying. - Oh my goodness.

1565
01:11:17,721 --> 01:11:20,422
Don't look down. Just look forward, Hee Won.

1566
01:11:20,662 --> 01:11:21,731
Just look straight ahead.

1567
01:11:21,731 --> 01:11:22,731
(Dong Il only looks straight ahead.)

1568
01:11:22,731 --> 01:11:24,361
- Like this? - This is so scary.

1569
01:11:27,302 --> 01:11:29,031
- It must be here. - You need to be really careful.

1570
01:11:29,031 --> 01:11:31,071
- Be careful. - Be careful! Don't go too far.

1571
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:33,172
Wow, this must be it.

1572
01:11:34,742 --> 01:11:36,311
(The slope is still very steep even after all these years.)

1573
01:11:36,311 --> 01:11:37,412
Be careful here.

1574
01:11:38,181 --> 01:11:39,641
It still makes you dizzy.

1575
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:41,811
(No matter how many times you've been there...)

1576
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:43,351
(Shuddering)

1577
01:11:43,351 --> 01:11:44,681
I don't know how we pulled it off.

1578
01:11:45,521 --> 01:11:46,622
It makes me dizzy.

1579
01:11:46,752 --> 01:11:47,821
It's so scary.

1580
01:11:47,821 --> 01:11:49,452
You're really amazing.

1581
01:11:50,092 --> 01:11:51,292
Back then...

1582
01:11:51,922 --> 01:11:53,292
It makes me dizzy.

1583
01:11:53,292 --> 01:11:54,962
(Dong Wook quietly looks down on the field.)

1584
01:11:55,361 --> 01:11:56,391
(Courtesy of KM Culture)

1585
01:11:56,391 --> 01:11:58,561
(When he filmed the movie 13 years ago,)

1586
01:11:58,561 --> 01:12:00,802
(Dong Wook was a vivacious 26-year-old.)

1587
01:12:02,332 --> 01:12:07,342
(It must've been difficult for him as he has a fear of heights.)

1588
01:12:07,971 --> 01:12:14,012
(He overcame the extreme fear with passion and mettle.)

1589
01:12:15,181 --> 01:12:17,412
I think I pulled it off with the mettle I had as a young actor.

1590
01:12:18,952 --> 01:12:19,952
Without any fear.

1591
01:12:19,952 --> 01:12:21,122
(The sun is slowly going down.)

1592
01:12:21,122 --> 01:12:22,851
The sun is going down.

1593
01:12:23,252 --> 01:12:24,321
Let's get going.

1594
01:12:24,321 --> 01:12:25,962
(Hope the day Dong Wook spent with the members...)

1595
01:12:25,962 --> 01:12:27,422
(become another good memory to him.)

1596
01:12:27,622 --> 01:12:31,101
My gosh, the sun sets so fast because it's winter.

1597
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:32,401
(The members are back to the house.)

1598
01:12:33,361 --> 01:12:35,071
- I'll carry it, Dong Il. - Okay.

1599
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,071
Be careful.

1600
01:12:36,071 --> 01:12:38,242
Guests shouldn't be carrying things. Give it to me.

1601
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:39,872
You shouldn't carry things.

1602
01:12:39,872 --> 01:12:42,172
(You can relax today, Dong Wook!)

1603
01:12:42,311 --> 01:12:43,611
The house...

1604
01:12:43,611 --> 01:12:45,311
(Lights on)

1605
01:12:46,641 --> 01:12:47,811
Wow, the ambiance is so nice.

1606
01:12:49,582 --> 01:12:51,452
It really feels like my house now.

1607
01:12:52,781 --> 01:12:53,981
How does it look at night?

1608
01:12:53,981 --> 01:12:55,151
So this is why you didn't fold the blankets.

1609
01:12:55,151 --> 01:12:56,151
That's right.

1610
01:12:56,292 --> 01:12:58,162
- It'd have been too cold. - This is why we don't fold them.

1611
01:12:58,162 --> 01:12:59,262
This is why.

1612
01:12:59,262 --> 01:13:00,721
(Their laziness turned their house cozier.)

1613
01:13:03,092 --> 01:13:06,231
Dong Wook, I prepared this just for you.

1614
01:13:06,662 --> 01:13:07,731
Take a look.

1615
01:13:08,101 --> 01:13:10,672
Hee Won, this is what you call trout sashimi.

1616
01:13:11,002 --> 01:13:12,242
Look at its color.

1617
01:13:12,242 --> 01:13:13,242
(They bought trout sashimi for Dong Wook.)

1618
01:13:13,542 --> 01:13:15,712
- I haven't seen it in a long time. - Isn't it amazing?

1619
01:13:16,412 --> 01:13:18,181
Goodness, since Dong Wook is here,

1620
01:13:18,842 --> 01:13:21,151
I need to prepare it fast and serve him dinner.

1621
01:13:21,452 --> 01:13:23,012
(They're also having the Korean beef they bought yesterday.)

1622
01:13:23,012 --> 01:13:24,452
Isn't that too much meat for us?

1623
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:26,851
Not at all. I'm not planning to feed you rice tonight.

1624
01:13:27,552 --> 01:13:29,221
I'm feeding you only meat.

1625
01:13:29,691 --> 01:13:31,321
- Dong Wook. - Yes.

1626
01:13:31,891 --> 01:13:32,962
I love it.

1627
01:13:33,092 --> 01:13:34,832
It's raw beef. Hee Won.

1628
01:13:35,262 --> 01:13:36,962
- It's raw Korean beef. - Right, it's raw Korean beef.

1629
01:13:37,561 --> 01:13:39,962
Doesn't this already look fantastic?

1630
01:13:39,962 --> 01:13:41,832
(It looks so good.)

1631
01:13:41,832 --> 01:13:43,771
I might die eating beef...

1632
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:46,571
- if we're having this much. - I won't let you go home tonight.

1633
01:13:47,502 --> 01:13:49,971
- First, open it and... - Okay.

1634
01:13:50,412 --> 01:13:52,082
Let's use margarine.

1635
01:13:52,412 --> 01:13:54,781
- Margarine? - Yes, place margarine...

1636
01:13:54,882 --> 01:13:56,952
- on the pan. Put it in the middle. - You mean on the meat?

1637
01:13:57,351 --> 01:13:58,981
Put a bit of margarine on the pan.

1638
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:00,622
(Dong Wook greases the pan with margarine.)

1639
01:14:00,622 --> 01:14:01,691
Then start grilling.

1640
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:03,691
Grill the meat on that.

1641
01:14:04,151 --> 01:14:06,762
The melting margarine is...

1642
01:14:07,662 --> 01:14:08,662
already appetizing.

1643
01:14:10,092 --> 01:14:12,162
Let's feed Dong Wook some meat.

1644
01:14:12,162 --> 01:14:13,802
(He places sirloin on the pan when the margarine starts to melt.)

1645
01:14:14,262 --> 01:14:17,571
- You can grill this with it. - Look at the visual.

1646
01:14:19,271 --> 01:14:20,641
It's fantastic.

1647
01:14:20,641 --> 01:14:22,672
(The Korean beef sirloin fills the whole pan.)

1648
01:14:22,672 --> 01:14:24,271
It smells so nice.

1649
01:14:24,712 --> 01:14:27,441
(Gosh, it smells nice.)

1650
01:14:27,882 --> 01:14:29,582
When can I turn the meat over?

1651
01:14:30,412 --> 01:14:32,351
I think we need to use tongs.

1652
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:33,922
They're here. I took them out.

1653
01:14:34,151 --> 01:14:36,691
- There you go. - I'll bring the tongs.

1654
01:14:38,361 --> 01:14:40,061
Shall we cut this with scissors?

1655
01:14:40,061 --> 01:14:41,391
Yes, you should. Here.

1656
01:14:41,832 --> 01:14:42,861
- Here. - Get them for me, Si Wan.

1657
01:14:43,632 --> 01:14:44,802
I'll cut them.

1658
01:14:46,401 --> 01:14:47,802
- Shall I cut it? - No, it's okay.

1659
01:14:47,802 --> 01:14:50,731
(Hee Won grills the meat for Dong Wook.)

1660
01:14:53,172 --> 01:14:55,172
- Pull this here. - Gosh, it's hot.

1661
01:14:56,471 --> 01:14:58,842
- Do you need gloves, Hee Won? - Goodness, it's hot!

1662
01:14:58,842 --> 01:15:00,382
- Here. - Put on gloves, Hee Won.

1663
01:15:00,582 --> 01:15:03,052
- You need gloves. - Oh, right. You gave me gloves.

1664
01:15:03,052 --> 01:15:04,311
Here. This is perfect.

1665
01:15:04,311 --> 01:15:07,821
You gave me the gloves, but I didn't think of using them. How dumb of me.

1666
01:15:09,952 --> 01:15:12,122
You should definitely put on gloves to grill meat.

1667
01:15:12,792 --> 01:15:14,061
(As the oil doesn't get on his hands, he boldly cuts the meat.)

1668
01:15:14,061 --> 01:15:15,561
(Cutting in big pieces)

1669
01:15:15,561 --> 01:15:17,262
- My goodness. - I'll cut them one more time.

1670
01:15:17,962 --> 01:15:19,632
These gloves are really nice.

1671
01:15:20,632 --> 01:15:22,101
It's not hot at all.

1672
01:15:22,502 --> 01:15:23,601
I'm serious.

1673
01:15:23,901 --> 01:15:25,342
- It's not hot at all. - You can use them...

1674
01:15:25,641 --> 01:15:26,941
when you have a bonfire.

1675
01:15:26,941 --> 01:15:28,172
I know. My gosh.

1676
01:15:28,311 --> 01:15:29,542
You look like an expert.

1677
01:15:30,141 --> 01:15:31,342
It's not hot at all.

1678
01:15:31,342 --> 01:15:32,412
(He's done grilling the sirloin in no time.)

1679
01:15:32,412 --> 01:15:33,441
- They look so good. - I'll cut them into smaller pieces.

1680
01:15:33,441 --> 01:15:35,552
- This is just... - Goodness.

1681
01:15:36,252 --> 01:15:38,122
- It smells so nice. - This is just...

1682
01:15:38,122 --> 01:15:39,151
It's amazing.

1683
01:15:39,151 --> 01:15:40,922
(Sprinkling pepper)

1684
01:15:40,922 --> 01:15:42,651
- Since you're here... - Sprinkle some pepper.

1685
01:15:42,891 --> 01:15:44,622
- Go ahead and eat it. - You can have it now.

1686
01:15:44,622 --> 01:15:45,622
Eat up, Dong Wook.

1687
01:15:45,622 --> 01:15:47,721
- Try one, Dong Il. - It's okay. You can have it.

1688
01:15:48,292 --> 01:15:49,832
(Then you should try one first, Hee Won!)

1689
01:15:49,832 --> 01:15:50,832
It's hot.

1690
01:15:52,561 --> 01:15:55,071
(Munching)

1691
01:15:55,971 --> 01:15:57,901
- Dong Il. - Yes?

1692
01:15:58,672 --> 01:16:01,071
We had beef just yesterday, right?

1693
01:16:02,412 --> 01:16:04,172
But I think this one tastes even better. Why is that?

1694
01:16:04,781 --> 01:16:06,712
- Oh, really? - I'm serious.

1695
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:10,481
Isn't the meat grilled with charcoal supposed to be tastier?

1696
01:16:10,481 --> 01:16:11,481
(The margarine scent is stronger than that of charcoal.)

1697
01:16:11,952 --> 01:16:14,422
(He brings a piece to Dong Il who's been working all along.)

1698
01:16:14,422 --> 01:16:15,492
It melts in my mouth.

1699
01:16:16,351 --> 01:16:17,422
It's so good.

1700
01:16:18,262 --> 01:16:19,422
Dong Wook, you should eat a lot.

1701
01:16:21,262 --> 01:16:22,962
- Eat up. - Si Wan, you should have this.

1702
01:16:22,962 --> 01:16:24,132
Thank you for the food.

1703
01:16:24,132 --> 01:16:25,262
(Impressed)

1704
01:16:25,262 --> 01:16:26,262
It looks so good.

1705
01:16:26,431 --> 01:16:28,832
If you dip it in salt, it's even better.

1706
01:16:28,832 --> 01:16:30,502
- I made you sesame oil dip. - Where?

1707
01:16:31,502 --> 01:16:33,571
(Exclaiming)

1708
01:16:34,542 --> 01:16:35,672
It's just so good.

1709
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:37,912
Does it taste okay?

1710
01:16:37,912 --> 01:16:39,111
- It's really good. - It's really good.

1711
01:16:40,842 --> 01:16:43,552
It's more savory if you grill meat with margarine.

1712
01:16:43,552 --> 01:16:44,552
It's all cooked. Eat up.

1713
01:16:44,552 --> 01:16:45,681
- It is savory. - It's so good.

1714
01:16:46,252 --> 01:16:47,481
I'm glad you like it.

1715
01:16:47,481 --> 01:16:48,922
(Chef Sung starts cooking after feeding the three guys.)

1716
01:16:48,922 --> 01:16:49,922
I'm glad you like it.

1717
01:16:50,391 --> 01:16:52,361
Dong Il, I should add more margarine...

1718
01:16:52,561 --> 01:16:54,792
to grill another piece, right?

1719
01:16:54,962 --> 01:16:57,361
- Yes, you need to keep adding. - Right?

1720
01:16:57,361 --> 01:17:00,832
You should add a lot as though you scooped too much by mistake.

1721
01:17:00,832 --> 01:17:02,302
You're right. That's what makes it more savory.

1722
01:17:02,302 --> 01:17:03,802
- Should I add more? - Yes.

1723
01:17:03,802 --> 01:17:05,502
You're actually right. It's more delicious if you add a lot.

1724
01:17:05,672 --> 01:17:07,302
(Adding margarine generously)

1725
01:17:07,302 --> 01:17:10,542
I think that part will be much more delicious.

1726
01:17:13,012 --> 01:17:15,512
I should cut this in advance.

1727
01:17:15,512 --> 01:17:17,082
(Filling the meat with savory taste)

1728
01:17:17,082 --> 01:17:18,151
Like this.

1729
01:17:19,021 --> 01:17:20,622
Hee Won, have this.

1730
01:17:21,181 --> 01:17:22,521
Don't mind me.

1731
01:17:23,021 --> 01:17:24,321
I'm on a diet.

1732
01:17:24,321 --> 01:17:26,962
(Chef Sung has no time to sit and eat.)

1733
01:17:27,361 --> 01:17:31,262
(The current temperature at Pyeongchang is minus 15°C.)

1734
01:17:32,132 --> 01:17:33,132
(The windows are all fogged up due to the temperature difference.)

1735
01:17:33,132 --> 01:17:35,101
The windows keep getting fogged up.

1736
01:17:36,872 --> 01:17:39,242
(Getting up)

1737
01:17:43,071 --> 01:17:45,981
(Wiping)

1738
01:17:47,042 --> 01:17:48,181
(Dong Wook cleans the foggy windows instead of Dong Il.)

1739
01:17:48,181 --> 01:17:50,512
If you apply a bit of toothpaste and wipe them, it'd be clean.

1740
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:54,821
I don't think this would work.

1741
01:17:54,821 --> 01:17:56,752
- It gets fogged up right away. - It does.

1742
01:17:57,992 --> 01:17:59,861
- It got fogged up right away. - I know.

1743
01:18:00,422 --> 01:18:02,092
It got fogged up as I wiped it clean.

1744
01:18:03,731 --> 01:18:06,731
(Rummaging)

1745
01:18:07,531 --> 01:18:09,672
(What's he doing?)

1746
01:18:10,231 --> 01:18:13,042
(It's Dong Wook's toiletries.)

1747
01:18:14,912 --> 01:18:18,641
(The all-round toothpaste that keeps everything clean in army bases.)

1748
01:18:20,382 --> 01:18:21,712
(Where you can use toothpaste to clean in army bases)

1749
01:18:21,712 --> 01:18:23,151
(1. Removing dirt on windows, 2. Removing toilet mold,)

1750
01:18:23,151 --> 01:18:24,512
(3. Removing slime on sinks, 4. Removing stink from toilets,)

1751
01:18:24,512 --> 01:18:25,952
(5. Wiping headlights, 6. Removing rust on ball chains,)

1752
01:18:25,952 --> 01:18:27,151
(7. Cleaning military boots, 8. Polishing the hallway,)

1753
01:18:27,151 --> 01:18:28,351
(9. Cleaning the soot on canteen, 10. Removing fog on windows)

1754
01:18:28,691 --> 01:18:31,422
(There's nothing you can't do with toothpaste.)

1755
01:18:32,162 --> 01:18:33,492
While you cook,

1756
01:18:33,492 --> 01:18:34,521
(While Sergeant Sung cooks...)

1757
01:18:34,521 --> 01:18:36,361
I'll wipe them clean.

1758
01:18:38,662 --> 01:18:39,962
Does it get less foggy then?

1759
01:18:39,962 --> 01:18:41,332
Yes, it doesn't get fogged up.

1760
01:18:41,771 --> 01:18:43,031
Toothpaste is useful.

1761
01:18:43,031 --> 01:18:44,842
(Private Kim is working hard.)

1762
01:18:45,702 --> 01:18:48,311
(Disciplined moves)

1763
01:18:50,242 --> 01:18:51,412
If you use toothpaste...

1764
01:18:52,582 --> 01:18:54,611
Wow, it really doesn't fog up.

1765
01:18:54,611 --> 01:18:56,181
(His eyes get bright as he's fascinated.)

1766
01:18:56,912 --> 01:19:00,082
It'd be good to clean the windshield of a car.

1767
01:19:01,851 --> 01:19:03,691
(Looking bright)

1768
01:19:04,151 --> 01:19:06,162
(Proud)

1769
01:19:06,962 --> 01:19:08,431
Guys, try this one.

1770
01:19:09,431 --> 01:19:11,832
It's grilled with so much margarine as though I dropped it by mistake.

1771
01:19:11,832 --> 01:19:13,202
- Oh, it's that one? - Yes.

1772
01:19:13,901 --> 01:19:15,071
(Hee Won is working extra hard today.)

1773
01:19:15,071 --> 01:19:18,271
Hee Won learned that from me.

1774
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,302
(Having a bite)

1775
01:19:19,302 --> 01:19:20,672
Isn't it better than the previous one?

1776
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:22,412
- It's good. - It is, right?

1777
01:19:23,242 --> 01:19:25,412
- Si Wan, try this. - We don't have this every day.

1778
01:19:25,412 --> 01:19:28,681
Here. I think it's way better than the previous one.

1779
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,452
(Taking a bite of the savory piece of beef)

1780
01:19:31,082 --> 01:19:32,382
How is it?

1781
01:19:32,382 --> 01:19:34,582
I love that you added more margarine by mistake.

1782
01:19:34,582 --> 01:19:35,651
Dong Il, try this.

1783
01:19:35,922 --> 01:19:37,622
I added much margarine as though it was a mistake.

1784
01:19:37,622 --> 01:19:39,361
(Chef Sung tries the savory piece of beef too.)

1785
01:19:40,221 --> 01:19:41,962
- Is it good? - Sprinkle a bit of pepper.

1786
01:19:41,962 --> 01:19:43,332
Oh, right. I forgot to add pepper.

1787
01:19:43,332 --> 01:19:44,492
Where did it go?

1788
01:19:44,931 --> 01:19:47,262
It tastes even better with more margarine.

1789
01:19:47,262 --> 01:19:48,332
(When it gets too queasy from the margarine sirloin,)

1790
01:19:48,502 --> 01:19:50,802
I want to try the trout sashimi.

1791
01:19:50,802 --> 01:19:52,401
(refresh your palate with trout sashimi's clean taste.)

1792
01:19:53,101 --> 01:19:55,342
(Dipping deep in chogochujang)

1793
01:19:56,042 --> 01:19:58,512
(Taking a big bite)

1794
01:20:00,342 --> 01:20:01,611
The trout sashimi is really good too.

1795
01:20:01,611 --> 01:20:02,882
Have more meat.

1796
01:20:03,582 --> 01:20:05,422
(Let me try.)

1797
01:20:10,351 --> 01:20:11,762
(Impressed)

1798
01:20:11,762 --> 01:20:12,922
The trout sashimi is amazing.

1799
01:20:14,191 --> 01:20:15,262
Is it good?

1800
01:20:17,361 --> 01:20:18,361
(He always shares the good food with Dong Il.)

1801
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:19,431
Dong Il, try the trout sashimi.

1802
01:20:19,561 --> 01:20:20,731
Trout sashimi? Is it good?

1803
01:20:20,762 --> 01:20:21,872
It's amazing.

1804
01:20:23,431 --> 01:20:25,971
- Hee Won. - Wait.

1805
01:20:26,471 --> 01:20:28,042
- Try the trout sashimi. - He's afraid to try it.

1806
01:20:28,811 --> 01:20:30,471
(Let me take a deep breath as it's my first time trying it.)

1807
01:20:31,172 --> 01:20:32,912
- He's feeling uneasy. - No, no.

1808
01:20:32,912 --> 01:20:34,311
Oh, it's his first time.

1809
01:20:34,311 --> 01:20:35,412
- No, no. - Hee Won.

1810
01:20:35,651 --> 01:20:36,811
It's really good.

1811
01:20:37,181 --> 01:20:38,851
(Is it?)

1812
01:20:39,052 --> 01:20:40,281
- Okay, give it to me. - It's really good.

1813
01:20:40,281 --> 01:20:42,422
- It's really... - It's very chewy.

1814
01:20:42,891 --> 01:20:44,021
Isn't it good?

1815
01:20:44,122 --> 01:20:45,221
It's really chewy.

1816
01:20:45,221 --> 01:20:46,762
(Munching)

1817
01:20:46,762 --> 01:20:48,962
- This is delicious. - It is, isn't it?

1818
01:20:49,891 --> 01:20:50,962
(Savoring)

1819
01:20:50,962 --> 01:20:52,002
How is it, Hee Won?

1820
01:20:52,401 --> 01:20:53,802
- It's good. - It's good, right?

1821
01:20:53,802 --> 01:20:55,372
- Yes, the trout sashimi... - Hee Won,

1822
01:20:55,372 --> 01:20:58,031
you're trying so many new things...

1823
01:20:58,031 --> 01:20:59,401
while traveling with me.

1824
01:20:59,672 --> 01:21:00,771
You're right.

1825
01:21:02,742 --> 01:21:04,042
The trout sashimi is really good.

1826
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:05,111
(Looking bright)

1827
01:21:06,611 --> 01:21:08,382
It'd have been disappointing if we didn't try this.

1828
01:21:08,582 --> 01:21:10,311
I know. It was a great choice, Dong Il.

1829
01:21:10,611 --> 01:21:11,681
- The trout sashimi? - Yes.

1830
01:21:12,052 --> 01:21:13,122
I added wasabi.

1831
01:21:13,122 --> 01:21:14,721
(Have another bite since it's good!)

1832
01:21:14,721 --> 01:21:15,721
It really is good.

1833
01:21:16,391 --> 01:21:18,391
It's actually good.

1834
01:21:19,361 --> 01:21:20,962
(Then have another one.)

1835
01:21:22,092 --> 01:21:25,702
(He takes a bite right away without dreading it.)

1836
01:21:26,561 --> 01:21:28,132
The trout sashimi is good.

1837
01:21:28,132 --> 01:21:29,302
(He has another piece on his own.)

1838
01:21:30,731 --> 01:21:34,002
(His fear of trout sashimi is gone!)

1839
01:21:34,202 --> 01:21:36,372
It's really chewy and nice.

1840
01:21:37,071 --> 01:21:38,882
- It's chewy, isn't it? - It is.

1841
01:21:39,281 --> 01:21:41,611
I think it feels unique to have sashimi in the mountains.

1842
01:21:41,611 --> 01:21:42,981
- It does, right? - Yes.

1843
01:21:43,611 --> 01:21:45,922
It's fun to enjoy trout that live in the cleanest water...

1844
01:21:45,922 --> 01:21:47,981
when you're in the mountains.

1845
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:50,922
I should try this.

1846
01:21:51,221 --> 01:21:53,061
Yes, it's soft.

1847
01:21:57,361 --> 01:21:59,702
(It really is soft.)

1848
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:03,971
(Chef Sung knocked up a new dish in no time.)

1849
01:22:05,302 --> 01:22:07,372
(Chef Sung's new dish, raw beef wraps)

1850
01:22:07,372 --> 01:22:08,941
- Guys. - Yes?

1851
01:22:09,042 --> 01:22:10,641
- Wow... - This is...

1852
01:22:11,012 --> 01:22:13,681
We're going to grill these now.

1853
01:22:13,681 --> 01:22:14,842
(A fancy-looking dish)

1854
01:22:15,412 --> 01:22:16,452
(Truly happy)

1855
01:22:16,452 --> 01:22:17,882
Look at its visual.

1856
01:22:17,882 --> 01:22:21,422
How did he think of making this?

1857
01:22:21,422 --> 01:22:22,891
(He blanches the raw beef wrap in margarine.)

1858
01:22:23,492 --> 01:22:25,092
Let's add the lemon.

1859
01:22:25,092 --> 01:22:26,691
(Adding lots of refreshing lemon juice)

1860
01:22:26,691 --> 01:22:29,132
My gosh, look how beautiful they are.

1861
01:22:30,391 --> 01:22:31,391
There you go.

1862
01:22:31,391 --> 01:22:34,231
If you turn them over, they won't be undone.

1863
01:22:34,231 --> 01:22:36,202
They won't be undone because it's beef.

1864
01:22:36,372 --> 01:22:37,971
- Is it cooked? - Yes, it is.

1865
01:22:37,971 --> 01:22:39,101
Try it.

1866
01:22:39,101 --> 01:22:40,571
(Try it.)

1867
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:45,412
(Trying Dong Il's new menu instantly)

1868
01:22:46,281 --> 01:22:49,781
(Chef Sung's dishes are guaranteed to be good.)

1869
01:22:53,981 --> 01:22:56,122
Dong Il, you used raw beef to make these?

1870
01:22:56,122 --> 01:22:57,721
- What? - You used raw beef?

1871
01:22:58,662 --> 01:23:00,162
Yes, he used this.

1872
01:23:01,162 --> 01:23:04,231
It's actually good, but why did I pick a tough one?

1873
01:23:04,231 --> 01:23:05,361
(It was really soft when it was eaten as raw meat.)

1874
01:23:06,031 --> 01:23:09,471
I think it got tougher because we grilled it.

1875
01:23:09,471 --> 01:23:11,601
- Shall I grill them? - Right? It got tougher.

1876
01:23:11,702 --> 01:23:14,372
Right? The raw beef got tougher after grilling it.

1877
01:23:14,372 --> 01:23:15,471
(It got tougher after grilling.)

1878
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:17,912
This one is cooked.

1879
01:23:18,611 --> 01:23:19,742
I'm okay.

1880
01:23:20,611 --> 01:23:23,181
- You don't want it? - It's too tough for me.

1881
01:23:23,181 --> 01:23:25,021
- Right? It got tougher. - What did you say?

1882
01:23:25,021 --> 01:23:26,321
It's nothing.

1883
01:23:26,422 --> 01:23:28,252
How is it? Did you try it?

1884
01:23:29,592 --> 01:23:31,021
Dong Il, it's really good.

1885
01:23:31,021 --> 01:23:34,592
It's different because there are vegetables in it, right?

1886
01:23:35,962 --> 01:23:39,162
(Quiet)

1887
01:23:40,361 --> 01:23:44,672
Why did you guys become quiet after having a delicious dish?

1888
01:23:45,141 --> 01:23:46,571
- Hee Won. - Yes.

1889
01:23:47,101 --> 01:23:49,971
- It's really good. - Really?

1890
01:23:49,971 --> 01:23:51,042
(Laughing)

1891
01:23:51,611 --> 01:23:53,912
(It's a secret between us.)

1892
01:23:55,012 --> 01:23:56,712
- Try it, Hee Won. - Okay.

1893
01:23:56,712 --> 01:23:58,012
(Hesitant)

1894
01:23:58,012 --> 01:23:59,281
What's wrong? What are you not happy about?

1895
01:23:59,281 --> 01:24:01,321
I'm not complaining.

1896
01:24:02,191 --> 01:24:04,191
I'm not complaining at all, Dong Il.

1897
01:24:06,361 --> 01:24:08,731
It's refreshing because I added lemon, right?

1898
01:24:09,132 --> 01:24:10,832
- Yes. - It's way better, right?

1899
01:24:10,832 --> 01:24:11,901
(Walking on eggshells)

1900
01:24:12,702 --> 01:24:15,471
(The raw beef wrap became even tougher in the meantime.)

1901
01:24:15,471 --> 01:24:16,632
Give that to Hee Won.

1902
01:24:17,672 --> 01:24:19,872
(Me?)

1903
01:24:20,542 --> 01:24:21,571
(Glancing at him)

1904
01:24:21,571 --> 01:24:22,912
(Bursting into laughter)

1905
01:24:23,212 --> 01:24:25,641
- Have the last piece, Si Wan. - Okay.

1906
01:24:25,742 --> 01:24:27,412
- Eat up. - Thank you.

1907
01:24:27,412 --> 01:24:28,452
Give that to Hee Won.

1908
01:24:30,252 --> 01:24:31,721
Why would you laugh?

1909
01:24:32,181 --> 01:24:33,781
(Falling to the floor)

1910
01:24:34,622 --> 01:24:36,391
(He's almost crying.)

1911
01:24:36,391 --> 01:24:38,861
- What's wrong? - I can't deal with this guy.

1912
01:24:38,861 --> 01:24:40,092
I just realized it.

1913
01:24:40,092 --> 01:24:41,561
(He's hiding his laugh as much as he can.)

1914
01:24:42,561 --> 01:24:43,861
What's wrong, Dong Wook?

1915
01:24:44,891 --> 01:24:47,832
I just realized he has a nasty personality.

1916
01:24:49,872 --> 01:24:52,502
Hee Won did something. It's obvious.

1917
01:24:52,502 --> 01:24:54,702
- No, I didn't. - Can you pass me the tissue?

1918
01:24:55,672 --> 01:24:57,372
(Laughing)

1919
01:25:01,078 --> 01:25:02,678
Dong Il, I just...

1920
01:25:03,548 --> 01:25:04,819
connected with Dong Wook.

1921
01:25:06,218 --> 01:25:07,319
With Dong Wook.

1922
01:25:07,849 --> 01:25:10,218
- We connected through our eyes. - Really?

1923
01:25:10,958 --> 01:25:12,159
Look at these guys.

1924
01:25:12,159 --> 01:25:14,888
He burst into laughter because...

1925
01:25:15,529 --> 01:25:17,128
the raw beef...

1926
01:25:17,899 --> 01:25:20,529
is really soft when it's eaten raw.

1927
01:25:20,899 --> 01:25:23,468
- But it got tough after grilling. - That's true.

1928
01:25:23,468 --> 01:25:26,638
So we were talking about how tough it is,

1929
01:25:26,638 --> 01:25:28,369
and you kept insisting that I have more of it.

1930
01:25:29,678 --> 01:25:32,949
If it was less tough than now,

1931
01:25:32,949 --> 01:25:34,909
it'd be really nice.

1932
01:25:36,619 --> 01:25:38,078
Goodness, now I get how mothers feel.

1933
01:25:38,078 --> 01:25:40,918
I finally get to sit now.

1934
01:25:42,218 --> 01:25:44,788
Dong Il, trout sashimi...

1935
01:25:44,788 --> 01:25:46,029
(I realized the taste of trout sashimi thanks to you.)

1936
01:25:46,029 --> 01:25:47,729
It's different from others.

1937
01:25:47,729 --> 01:25:50,298
Oh, right. I forgot.

1938
01:25:50,659 --> 01:25:54,328
Dong Wook's father gave us a gift.

1939
01:25:54,328 --> 01:25:55,838
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1940
01:25:55,838 --> 01:25:59,208
Not at all. Actually, my parents live in Chuncheon.

1941
01:25:59,208 --> 01:26:00,309
- Chuncheon? - Yes.

1942
01:26:00,309 --> 01:26:01,909
They live in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province.

1943
01:26:01,909 --> 01:26:03,378
- My gosh. - Because Dong Il likes drinks,

1944
01:26:03,378 --> 01:26:06,449
he gave us makgeolli made in Chuncheon.

1945
01:26:06,449 --> 01:26:07,578
(It's Chuncheon's local makgeolli!)

1946
01:26:07,578 --> 01:26:10,119
- It's only made in Chuncheon. - I see.

1947
01:26:10,918 --> 01:26:11,949
I thought we could have it during dinner.

1948
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:13,088
I know you can't drink.

1949
01:26:13,088 --> 01:26:14,918
- So I... - It's okay.

1950
01:26:14,918 --> 01:26:17,258
- I brought something else. - What is it?

1951
01:26:17,859 --> 01:26:18,918
What's that?

1952
01:26:18,918 --> 01:26:20,388
(A special gift for Hee Won?)

1953
01:26:20,388 --> 01:26:22,798
It's a drink that the people of Sri Lanka...

1954
01:26:22,798 --> 01:26:24,298
- love. - Now we're in Sri Lanka.

1955
01:26:24,298 --> 01:26:26,168
It's a tea that tastes like ice wine.

1956
01:26:26,968 --> 01:26:28,729
- It's not alcohol? - No.

1957
01:26:28,998 --> 01:26:31,899
- I brewed it. - You did?

1958
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:36,609
Wow, it smells so nice.

1959
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:38,878
It smells just like Sri Lanka.

1960
01:26:40,149 --> 01:26:42,208
- I'm serious. - It smells like Sri Lanka.

1961
01:26:42,349 --> 01:26:43,779
It smells just like Sri Lanka.

1962
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:47,019
I'm not sure how you'll like the taste though.

1963
01:26:48,218 --> 01:26:50,388
- Actually, this is... - It smells really nice.

1964
01:26:50,388 --> 01:26:52,888
- He can have a taste. - I mixed the tea...

1965
01:26:52,888 --> 01:26:55,229
in Sprite the day before.

1966
01:26:55,559 --> 01:26:57,328
I added the tea in Sprite...

1967
01:26:57,498 --> 01:26:59,869
and put it in the fridge until the morning.

1968
01:26:59,869 --> 01:27:02,638
- You matured it? - Yes, you can have it that way.

1969
01:27:02,798 --> 01:27:04,699
Dong Il, have a taste of it.

1970
01:27:05,099 --> 01:27:07,069
- The tea from Sri Lanka. - This is your mug.

1971
01:27:07,069 --> 01:27:09,279
It tastes like white wine.

1972
01:27:10,739 --> 01:27:12,178
- Like sparkling wine? - Yes, it tastes like that.

1973
01:27:12,178 --> 01:27:14,409
You're right. It tastes just like sparkling wine.

1974
01:27:14,409 --> 01:27:16,279
It's tea that tastes like white wine.

1975
01:27:16,279 --> 01:27:17,619
(You can enjoy the taste of wine even without alcohol.)

1976
01:27:17,619 --> 01:27:19,218
It tastes like sparkling wine, right?

1977
01:27:19,588 --> 01:27:20,949
It really does taste like white wine.

1978
01:27:21,748 --> 01:27:24,359
This is really nice. It helps freshen the aftertaste.

1979
01:27:24,359 --> 01:27:26,088
It's even better with ice in it.

1980
01:27:26,359 --> 01:27:29,059
Maybe it's because it's carbonated.

1981
01:27:29,059 --> 01:27:30,998
- Si Wan. - It helps wash off the grease.

1982
01:27:31,059 --> 01:27:33,269
It's even better to have it cold with ice.

1983
01:27:33,428 --> 01:27:36,269
Here. Since Dong Wook's father gave it to us, let's have a taste.

1984
01:27:36,498 --> 01:27:38,798
To Dong Wook's father who is in Chuncheon,

1985
01:27:40,468 --> 01:27:42,038
- He must be watching. - thank you.

1986
01:27:42,038 --> 01:27:43,708
- Thank you. - Thank you for the makgeolli.

1987
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:45,578
Thank you for dinner, Dong Il.

1988
01:27:45,578 --> 01:27:48,378
- Not at all. - Thank you, Father.

1989
01:27:49,109 --> 01:27:50,178
(They had a great time in the snowy Pyeongchang.)

1990
01:27:50,178 --> 01:27:52,119
- Are you all full? - I'm stuffed.

1991
01:27:53,335 --> 01:27:54,765
(The 3rd front yard of House on Wheels Season 2)

1992
01:27:54,765 --> 01:27:56,406
(Ocean Hill of Chilpo in Pohang)

1993
01:27:56,975 --> 01:27:58,876
(In the third front yard that's paradise-like,)

1994
01:27:59,036 --> 01:28:00,406
(two new guests have come.)

1995
01:28:01,005 --> 01:28:03,276
(It's Kong Hyo Jin and Oh Jung Se.)

1996
01:28:03,446 --> 01:28:05,746
(Jung Se, are you okay?)

1997
01:28:06,645 --> 01:28:08,045
(Scratching)

1998
01:28:08,215 --> 01:28:10,185
(Swaying)

1999
01:28:11,055 --> 01:28:12,156
(Glancing)

2000
01:28:12,156 --> 01:28:14,185
He can't say anything. He's in trouble.

2001
01:28:14,486 --> 01:28:18,326
(Hyo Jin notices Jung Se being shy...)

2002
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:20,725
(and takes care of him.)

2003
01:28:20,725 --> 01:28:22,295
(Wiping)

2004
01:28:22,496 --> 01:28:25,736
(Will Jung Se settle in House on Wheels well?)

2005
01:28:25,935 --> 01:28:29,706
(Jung Se, it's about time you say something.)
