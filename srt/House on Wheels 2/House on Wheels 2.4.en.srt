(there's blue East Sea.)

(Their new front yard, Ocean Hill of Chilpo in Pohang)

00:00:34,022 --> 00:00:35,692
(Two new guests have come to the new front yard.)

(Feeling awkward)

8
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:43,371
(Jung Se who finds cameras awkward)

9
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,031
(Jung Se, are you okay?)

10
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:46,801
(And reliable friend Hyo Jin...)

11
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:49,672
(who notices Jung Se first and takes care of him)

12

(Pakdal snow crabs they prepared for the guests)

13

(Hyo Jin has a bite of it.)

14
00:00:57,911 --> 00:01:00,582
(Jung Se has a bite of it.)

15
00:01:00,682 --> 00:01:02,182
(It's delicious.)

16
00:01:02,282 --> 00:01:07,121
(Their dinner was satisfying.)

17
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:10,091
(What events await them tonight?)

18
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:13,561
(Everyone in the House on Wheels is feeling happy...)

19
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:16,231
(thanks to pakdal snow crabs.)

20
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:18,871
I want to try the shell.

21
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:20,271
I'll have the shell.

22
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:21,841
We can eat the shell?

23
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:23,442
- Yes. - You can get some meat from it.

24
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:25,311
The shell looks delicious.

25
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:27,442
- We can eat this? - Yes, we can just have it.

26
00:01:27,442 --> 00:01:29,241
- This one? - Yes. Yes, that one.

27
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:30,551
You can squeeze it out.

28
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:34,681
It's good. This is...

29
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:39,821
Why aren't you eating? Why are you only getting the meat out?

30
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,892
I need the meat to cook.

31
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:46,161
Shall we just pour all the meat into fried rice?

32
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:47,332
That'd be nice too.

33
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:49,972
Shall we just pour all the meat into fried rice, Dong Il?

34
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:51,232
You could do that.

35
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:53,771
It feels like a cottage industry of getting the crab meat out.

36
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:56,101
- A cottage industry? - It feels like that.

37
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:57,112
(A scene of a cottage industry of getting the crab meat out)

38
00:01:57,112 --> 00:02:00,842
Ma'am. Why did you throw that out? There's some more meat in there.

39
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,681
Is this her first day or something?

40
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:08,681
(They're done with the pakdal snow crabs already.)

41
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:12,051
I'll take all the tomalley.

42
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:14,092
- Take them and debone them. - Okay.

43
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,562
- Okay. - We need to eat it.

44
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:18,332
(Si Wan prepares tomalley fried rice.)

45
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:21,661
Goodness, look at the tomalley.

46
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:23,232
(Collecting fresh tomalley in a bowl)

47
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:25,532
The tomalley.

48
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:27,801
Let's just not sleep tonight.

49
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:30,642
I think we should sell them at the market tomorrow.

50
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:31,742
Then...

51
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:34,182
(Getting up)

52
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:38,712
- Do you have a garbage bag? - A garbage bag?

53
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:40,152
- Here it is. - It's...

54
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:43,722
(Pushing away)

55
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:46,152
They're cut in half.

56
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:51,291
(Jung Se's sudden movement)

57
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:52,891
Isn't this what you had before?

58
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:57,101
(Working hard)

59
00:02:58,032 --> 00:03:01,402
(He's quietly cleaning up.)

60
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:03,712
Jung Se, aren't you moving too much?

61
00:03:03,712 --> 00:03:04,712
I know.

62
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:08,011
(Laughing)

63
00:03:09,081 --> 00:03:10,081
(Grunting)

64

(They finish up cleaning neatly.)

65
00:03:15,951 --> 00:03:19,152
(He naturally enters the kitchen.)

66
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:23,731
(He's cooking as though he's been cooking it all along.)

67
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:29,731
(Fancy wok moves)

68
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,231
(Glimpsing)

69
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,571
- You're good at it. - Right.

70
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:38,571
Do you cook sometimes?

71
00:03:38,772 --> 00:03:40,212
No. I almost never cook.

72
00:03:40,212 --> 00:03:41,282
- You don't cook? - No.

73
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:44,152
Wow, Jung Se is making fried rice?

74
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:45,911
I'm just stirring it.

75
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:49,552
But then again, I can do that much.

76
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:56,092
The tomalley. The tomalley.

77
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:58,432
It looks so good.

78
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:02,002
The tomalley.

79
00:04:03,902 --> 00:04:04,972
I'm adding the soy sauce for seasoning.

80
00:04:04,972 --> 00:04:08,171
(Adding soy sauce...)

81
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:12,442
(and sesame oil)

82
00:04:13,942 --> 00:04:16,212
- Doesn't it smell delicious? - Yes, it does.

83
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:23,022
(It looks quite nice.)

84
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:26,421
Si Wan, do you need any help?

85
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:27,661
It's almost done.

86
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:32,231
Si Wan waited for today.

87
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:34,532
He waited to cook for you two.

88
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:35,932
Are you good at cooking?

89
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:40,802
But this is my first time making fried rice.

90
00:04:40,971 --> 00:04:43,071
He's not flustered at all though.

91
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:45,271
We never get flustered.

92
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:49,381
(The secret weapon to Si Wan's fried rice)

93
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:51,482
(Avocado)

94
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:54,752
(He cuts it into thin pieces.)

95
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,922
Dong Il, that's crab meat fried rice, right?

96
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:58,252
That's right.

97
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:02,922
- He's adding avocado in it. - Yes, we need it.

98
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:06,131
If you have a spoonful of avocado oil every morning,

99
00:05:06,602 --> 00:05:07,802
it's good for your health.

100
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:11,771
It's rich in vegetable fat, right?

101
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:15,672
I'm on a low-carbohydrate,

102
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:17,312
high-fat diet.

103
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:18,372
With vegetable fat.

104
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:21,042
It's switching carbohydrates with vegetable fat.

105
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,942
(Focusing)

106
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:25,912
What's amazing is that, after a week,

107
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:28,182
your skin gets really smooth.

108
00:05:28,182 --> 00:05:29,182
- Really? - Yes.

109
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:31,852
No wonder you seemed a little different today.

110
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:34,792
- Didn't I become prettier? - Yes, totally. I mean it for real.

111
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,761
- Hey. - I mean it.

112
00:05:38,062 --> 00:05:39,591
- I mean it. - You noticed it too?

113
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:40,732
(They felt the same way.)

114
00:05:41,002 --> 00:05:42,162
- Why do you suddenly... - I thought so too.

115
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:44,002
I thought you looked different.

116
00:05:44,002 --> 00:05:46,742
But seriously, your eyes look different too.

117
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:49,672
- You look much better. - Right?

118
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,641
Jung Se, at least look at her face when you say it.

119
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:54,942
- You look so much better. - You looked at the electric pad.

120
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:56,211
I did look at your face.

121
00:05:56,412 --> 00:05:57,412
He meant it.

122
00:05:57,412 --> 00:05:58,581
(Laughing)

123
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:00,781
- You made me laugh. - He looked at the electric pad...

124
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:02,081
when he said it.

125
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:04,951
It smells delicious, Si Wan.

126
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:05,951
- Really? - Yes.

127
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:07,091
I wish it'd taste nice as well.

128
00:06:07,292 --> 00:06:08,321
It will be.

129
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:11,662

132

Wait, we got some bean leaves too.

133
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,982
- Oh, I'll take it out. - We need to put it on a dish.

134
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:30,381
You took away all of our chopsticks?

135
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:32,552
- We have more chopsticks here. - We do?

136
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:33,552
(Adding avocado as a highlight)

137
00:06:33,552 --> 00:06:35,381
Where is it? Is it this one?

138
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:37,792
I'll distribute the bean leaves.

139
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,091
(Let me see.)

140
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:43,391
- Bean leaves. - Thank you.

141
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:44,862
(Adding the bean leaves they got from the market)

142
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:48,662
You can have a shell each. You can take them.

143
00:06:48,662 --> 00:06:50,401
- You can have the shell. - Wow, it looks good.

144
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:52,901
Wow, this is amazing.

145
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:57,808
Thank you for the food.

146
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:00,777

147
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:03,178
Wow, this is amazing.

148
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:06,347

00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:22,698
It's avocado.

155
00:07:22,698 --> 00:07:25,068
I don't eat avocado on purpose.

156
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,667
- Give it a try. - Really?

157
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:28,798
It doesn't feel that nice.

158
00:07:28,938 --> 00:07:33,777
It's too mushy, and I don't like it.

159
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:34,907
That's why I didn't have it on purpose.

160

(Hee Won's bowl is filled with avocado.)

00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:54,957
I gave you the well-cooked ones.

168
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:55,997
- Oh, really? - Yes.

169
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:58,367
Why don't you try this one?

170
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:01,337
- But it's too big. - You can break it.

171
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:04,038
Hee Won, it has no taste. Just have it for your health.

172
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:07,207
(Adding side dishes on his spoon)

173
00:08:07,207 --> 00:08:09,408
You can cover it with dried laver.

174
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,808
He's like a baby.

175
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:17,688
(Chewing)

176
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:22,188
How is it? Are you repulsed by it?

177
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:25,757
It's mushy.

178
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:29,298
(That's too bad.)

179
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:33,398
It tastes bland, doesn't it?

180
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:36,198
I'm sure it's not the avocado.

181
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:38,768
(Taking many bites)

182
00:08:39,207 --> 00:08:41,038
The vegetable fat is...

183
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:44,977
(He tries hard to learn the new taste.)

184
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:46,578
It's good.

185
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:48,318
(Nodding)

186
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:50,178
Why?

187
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:53,048
I'm savoring the taste of avocado.

188
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:54,587
Why?

189
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:57,828
So that I can try it again next time.

190
00:08:58,627 --> 00:09:00,757
(Hee Won is making an effort.)

191
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:03,898
(That's a relief.)

192
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:05,467
It's delicious.

193
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:06,727
(The avocado is neat, and the tomalley is savory.)

194
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:10,668
It looks so good. Have it with rice.

195
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:13,438
Gosh, I haven't had rice for so long.

196
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:15,507
(Taking a big bite)

197
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:16,737
- You mean rice itself? - Yes.

198
00:09:17,977 --> 00:09:20,448
(I'll give it a try too.)

199
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:23,448
(It tastes delicate.)

200
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:25,487
(Looking at Jung Se)

201
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:27,918
(Looking at Hyo Jin)

202
00:09:28,757 --> 00:09:30,217
(Si Wan is especially busy checking his guests today.)

203
00:09:30,217 --> 00:09:31,727
Si Wan, it's really good.

204
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:32,727
- Is it okay? - Yes.

205
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:34,357
- Honestly? - Yes.

206
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:36,727
- Isn't it too bland? - It's good.

207
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:37,768
No, it's good.

208
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:39,798
(Taking another bite)

209
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:42,698
It's good.

210
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:43,768
(Whispering)

211
00:09:44,408 --> 00:09:46,408
- How is it, Jung Se? - It's good.

212
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:48,507
(Are you sure?)

213
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:49,778
- I mean it. It's really good. - Are you sure?

214
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,877
It's good.

215
00:09:52,048 --> 00:09:53,948
You need to express it more.

216
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:56,148
It's good. It's delicious.

217
00:09:56,818 --> 00:09:58,418
- Should I not ask you? - It's good.

218
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:01,117
(Thank you.)

219
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:03,928
- Dong Il, you should join us. Wait. - Okay.

220
00:10:03,928 --> 00:10:06,857
Dong Il must have rice.

221
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,597
(Si Wan delivers the rice to Dong Il.)

222
00:10:09,558 --> 00:10:11,967
(Having a big bite)

223
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,268
Okay.

224
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:15,298
You added plenty of avocados.

225
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:17,967
I love it. Thank you.

226
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:19,668
(He's relieved.)

227
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:21,477
The rice got cold already.

228
00:10:21,477 --> 00:10:23,778
(No, it's still good.)

229
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:25,607
(Super proud)

230
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:27,117
You should dig in. Have some more.

231
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,617
- Isn't it delicate? - It's good.

232
00:10:29,617 --> 00:10:31,717
(Avocado's delicate taste suits the salty crab meat.)

233
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:37,018
(They can't help but fall in love with it.)

234
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,127
(After checking if the members like the fried rice, )

235
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:42,028
(he takes a big bite in relief.)

236
00:10:42,857 --> 00:10:45,497
(He even scrapes the bottom of the shell.)

237
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:46,828
Bean leaves.

238
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:48,097
(He has it with bean leaves too.)

239
00:10:48,097 --> 00:10:49,268
- Isn't it really good? - It is.

240
00:10:49,268 --> 00:10:52,207
(Sweet and sour)

241
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:55,938
- Jung Se, how is avocado? - It's delicious. It's pretty good.

242
00:10:56,137 --> 00:10:58,607
I really like it.

243
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:02,678
(Munching)

244
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:04,188
Avocado.

245
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:06,987
(I love avocado.)

246
00:11:07,717 --> 00:11:08,717
(Exclaiming)

247
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:10,688
Hee Won, you're eating a lot today.

248
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:13,257
- He's... - I'm serious.

249
00:11:13,357 --> 00:11:16,227
It's really good. I love it.

250
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:18,428
(Well done, Si Wan.)

251
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:19,497
I'm so happy.

252
00:11:19,497 --> 00:11:20,967
- Really? - Yes.

253
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,097
(Pleased)

254
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,808
He revived the dead crabs.

255
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:27,308
(Si Wan revived the dead crabs.)

256
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:30,137
They were dead before.

257
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:32,808
(He's so funny.)

258
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,217
Isn't avocado delicious?

259
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:36,948
You fall for its savoriness the more you have it.

260
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:38,587
- It's good. - It's very delicate, right?

261
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:41,188
(The moment Si Wan's small wish came true)

262
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:44,757
The elderlies used to clear the table like this.

263
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:46,658
They'd be like, "I'll clean up later."

264
00:11:47,898 --> 00:11:49,698
I barely managed to finish it.

265
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:53,097
"Gosh, leave it. I'll clean up later."

266
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:54,798
"I'll clean up later. Leave it."

267
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,497
He's like a mom in his purple sweatsuit.

268
00:11:56,497 --> 00:11:57,908
"Gosh, just leave it."

269
00:11:57,908 --> 00:11:59,408
He's like a mom with short hair.

270
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:03,078
"Leave it. Come on. Sit down."

271
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:04,707
(They quickly take a seat after Mom in purple scolded them.)

272
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:05,747
Sit.

273
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:09,418
Well. Well.

274
00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:10,418
(The dessert appears.)

275
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:12,048
Gosh. What's that again?

276
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:15,487
If only the wind had been calm,

277
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,428
today would have been a perfect day to gaze at the fire.

278
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:21,398
Dong Il, isn't it so relaxing today?

279
00:12:21,497 --> 00:12:23,357
- It's the best indeed. - We are relaxed.

280
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:25,168
Gosh. It's good.

281
00:12:25,168 --> 00:12:28,337
- Do you want some? - No, I can't eat more. I'm full.

282
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:29,837
I'm so full that I can't eat more.

283
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:31,507
(Jung Se, do you want a tangerine?)

284
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:33,068
(I'd like that.)

285
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,808
(I have a separate belly for dessert.)

286
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:42,278
Jung Se, didn't you win an award for what you've done with Hyo Jin?

287
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:44,818
- Yes. Baeksang Arts Awards. - I know.

288
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:48,058
When I see Jung Se acting, I can tell he's good.

289
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:49,788
- Jung Se is good. - Goodness.

290
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:51,528
I think he practices from behind all day long.

291
00:12:51,757 --> 00:12:53,887
- There's a scene that he holds... - Yes, that's it.

292
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,727
- my wrist and tells me to drink. - Right, that scene.

293
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:59,028
At that time, I didn't want to act as prepared.

294
00:12:59,497 --> 00:13:02,237
I wanted to show something raw, something I didn't even know.

295
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:05,467
- You actually drank, right? - Yes, a bottle. I was ambitious.

296
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:06,568
In "When the Camellia Blooms".

297
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:08,578
Sir, I'll get going now.

298
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:10,778
(This is the scene.)

299
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:13,948
(You look down on me, don't you?)

300
00:13:14,178 --> 00:13:16,518
(Even his complexion tells he's completely drunk.)

301
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:18,887
(His legendary acting while he was drunk...)

302
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:21,217
(made his character No Gyu Tae into Mr. No Peanuts.)

303
00:13:22,617 --> 00:13:26,928
(Was he really drunk at the time?)

304
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:30,558
I drank till I was 95 percent drunk,

305
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:32,568
and I thought I was drunk enough. I thought it was enough.

306
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:34,268
The director said, "Action!"

307
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:35,898
(When he started to shoot, )

308
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,908
At the sound of "action", that 95 percent changed into rationality.

309
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:41,038
(He sobered up at the sound of "action".)

310
00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:45,007
(That's crazy.)

311
00:13:45,977 --> 00:13:48,948
- He got tired because of drinking. - In my heart... At heart...

312
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:50,747
I acted just as I prepared at home.

313
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,448
(He drank in vain and acted just as he had prepared at home.)

314
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:55,357
In my heart... At heart I was...

315
00:13:55,487 --> 00:13:58,428
really frustrated because I wanted to let go of myself and do stuff.

316
00:13:59,127 --> 00:14:00,857
"I think I'm there. I think I'm relaxed."

317
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:02,857
I wanted to do whatever I want. When I heard "action",

318
00:14:02,857 --> 00:14:05,227
I acted just as I prepared.

319
00:14:05,227 --> 00:14:06,298
(At least once, he wanted to follow his feelings of the moment.)

320
00:14:06,898 --> 00:14:08,597
You're a hard-working type.

321
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,398
He seems very instinctive, right?

322
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:12,768
- No way. - He acts just like as he prepared.

323
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:15,607
The way he moves and acts. All of them.

324
00:14:15,737 --> 00:14:18,377
Jung Se really worked hard indeed.

325
00:14:18,877 --> 00:14:21,518
He worked hard. Even too much. He worked harder than anyone else.

326
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:22,918
(His natural acting style has been built up by endless practices.)

327
00:14:22,918 --> 00:14:24,318
Other actors worked hard as well.

328
00:14:25,747 --> 00:14:28,217
And that's how... Goodness. That's how you...

329
00:14:28,457 --> 00:14:33,158
you made such things into a charming character.

330
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:34,357
That's what I thought.

331
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:36,058
When he acted with Hyo Jin.

332
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:39,328
But haven't he set up the character to some extent?

333
00:14:39,497 --> 00:14:40,898
- The way Jung Se acted... - In fact,

334
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:43,467
the role was set up in the script.

335
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:46,408
That's true. The script was great for that drama.

336
00:14:47,477 --> 00:14:49,207
Gosh. Even if you had not meant it,

337
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:52,308
you should have said that he set up the character well.

338
00:14:52,678 --> 00:14:54,518
How come you say the script was great.

339
00:14:56,217 --> 00:14:59,148
But still, since he did well, Mr. No Peanuts stood out.

340
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:02,688
- You're late. - Hyo Jin, you're late.

341
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:04,528
- I don't buy it. - You're late.

342
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:05,757
You're so late.

343
00:15:06,328 --> 00:15:08,198
(Feeling sorry)

344
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,398
(You know what I mean even if I don't say it, right?)

345
00:15:10,398 --> 00:15:12,967
(While they were laughing incessantly, )

346
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:14,798
(the House on Wheels is blacked out again.)

347
00:15:14,798 --> 00:15:16,467
- Did he understand? - Why is it happening?

348
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:17,538
We stayed still.

349
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:19,337
Let's sleep now that the lights are off.

350
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:21,837
Here... Since the lights are off, let's sleep.

351
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,637
What's this? My gosh.

352
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:25,948
It's because Pohang...

353
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:30,648
turns off the lights at 9pm, as in old days, for children to sleep.

354
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:32,347
- Is that so? - Yes. That's why.

355
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:33,887
They turn off the lights automatically.

356
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:36,918
- Well then, let's go to sleep. - What's this?

357
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:38,987
(Let's go to sleep!)

358
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:44,097
It's good that we came here today. We get to see many stars at night.

359
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:45,097
- I know. - At night.

360
00:15:46,768 --> 00:15:48,198
There's no wind now.

361
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:50,198
It really disappeared.

362
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:51,308
(The waves and the wind became calm as if they always have been.)

363
00:15:52,107 --> 00:15:53,668
It should have been like this before.

364
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:55,178
(They all gathered around in the front yard.)

365
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:04,148
(Shall we enjoy the sound of the waves for a moment?)

366
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:11,158
(A healing sound that eases your heart)

367
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:15,757
Well, Hee Won and I will sleep in this tent.

368
00:16:16,097 --> 00:16:17,158
Hee Won asked me to sleep in it.

369
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:19,768
If you have a headache, be sure to wear a hat when you sleep.

370
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:21,097
Even if you feel warm.

371
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,808
Look. You three should arrange where you're going to sleep.

372
00:16:25,538 --> 00:16:27,478
Come in. Goodness. It's cozy in here.

373
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,937
Hey, it's a hotel mattress.

374
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:30,978
Come up here.

375
00:16:30,978 --> 00:16:32,647
Hyo Jin, look at this.

376
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,847
The cushion is too thick. You won't be able to walk on it.

377
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:37,518
- Well... - It makes me waddle like this.

378
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,857
Then, let's let Hyo Jin sleep here comfortably.

379
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,018
It'd be better if you two sleep at the sides.

380
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:46,758
It's because you went up and down...

381
00:16:46,758 --> 00:16:49,127
last time, like a thief climbing over a wall.

382
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:50,498
I felt bad about it.

383
00:16:51,397 --> 00:16:54,197
(How should I get down?)

384
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:59,337
(She jumps backward since she's in a hurry.)

385
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,538
(Succeeded with difficulty)

386
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:06,578
The merit of sleeping upstairs is you can see the sky as you lie down.

387
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:08,377
Hyo Jin, you should sleep here.

388
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:11,018
Let's sit before we choose. My lower back hurts.

389
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:12,548
(Tumbles)

390
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,048
- Have you decided? - Gosh. This is...

391
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:16,318
- Have you decided? - Did you do a slapstick?

392
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:17,687
(He unexpectedly chose his spot first.)

393
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:19,657
What is your concept all of a sudden?

394
00:17:19,657 --> 00:17:20,728
Gosh. I can't get up.

395
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:22,528
Dong Il, did you decide to sleep there?

396
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:25,397
I earnestly think it would be nice there.

397
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:27,068
- It's good here. - That spot.

398
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:28,738
- You haven't lain down there? - No, I haven't.

399
00:17:28,738 --> 00:17:31,667
- That's the coziest spot, actually. - I should go up there.

400
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:34,677
It's not that slippery. It's coated here.

401
00:17:34,677 --> 00:17:36,038
(A bunk bed which is the proud of House on Wheels 2)

402
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:38,548
- It's warm. - It's cozy up there.

403
00:17:38,548 --> 00:17:39,708
Goodness. This is...

404
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,117
You should lie down.

405
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:42,677
My gosh.

406
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:44,347
(Craning his neck)

407
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:47,048
(How do you like it?)

408
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:49,157
My gosh. This is scary. I may fall down.

409
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:51,028
- You'll never fall. - I see. That feeling...

410
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:52,558
- That is actually... - How do you like it?

411
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:53,988
She won't fall.

412
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:57,028
Is it uncomfortable? Tell me honestly.

413
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:00,528
Honestly, it's not that stable.

414
00:18:00,627 --> 00:18:01,697
- I see. - Is that so?

415
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:03,538
Then, Si Wan should go up there.

416
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:05,137
- Should I go up there? - Yes.

417
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:06,238
That would be good.

418
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:07,877
- Hold on. - Yes.

419
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:08,907
Here...

420
00:18:09,837 --> 00:18:10,837
(Jutting out)

421
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:12,347
Hey, watch out.

422
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:15,677
- Have you been up here? - He slept here too.

423
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,318
(She's curious about the bunk bed near the entrance.)

424
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:20,587
(Shall I lie down?)

425
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:23,357
(Toss...)

426
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:27,028
(and turn)

427
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:29,828
How do you like it there?

428
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:33,498
- I prefer it here than there. - Goodness.

429
00:18:33,897 --> 00:18:37,298
It's different from where you can stretch your legs while sleeping.

430
00:18:37,498 --> 00:18:40,407
- But I like it here. - My gosh. Just do as I tell you.

431
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:42,238
What kind of heater do I have there?

432
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,607
It's hot in here.

433
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:46,208
I think it will be cold there for Jung Se.

434
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,248
- No. - It's not cold.

435
00:18:47,248 --> 00:18:48,617
- There's nothing on the floor. - Never.

436
00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:51,248
Hold her. She might tumble again.

437
00:18:51,248 --> 00:18:52,248
(Holding up)

438
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:53,318
- Jung Se. - Give her your shoulder.

439
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:54,387
Gosh.

440
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:55,788
- Jung Se, what's this? - Your shoulder.

441
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:57,657
- Give her your hand. - My goodness.

442
00:18:57,657 --> 00:18:58,828
- Here. Hold my head. - No.

443
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:00,728
No? What do you want to grab?

444
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:03,028
- Your shoulder... - Wait. I'll go backward.

445
00:19:03,857 --> 00:19:06,097
(Quickly giving his shoulder)

446
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:08,038
You washed your feet. It's okay.

447
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:10,137
But it may turn out that she didn't.

448
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:12,568
Okay. Good.

449
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,607
Hyo Jin should sleep here since it's warm.

450
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:17,238
And Jung Se, come here.

451
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:18,377
- Can I sleep over there? - Yes.

452
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,647
Jung Se, this pillow is used in deluxe hotels.

453
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:24,048
Hyo Jin, is the cushion okay?

454
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:25,347
- Of course. - Okay.

455
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:26,718
You should lie down.

456
00:19:27,447 --> 00:19:30,917
You can go. Don't worry about us. We'll settle it when you're gone.

457
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:33,058
But I want to see you guys lie down.

458
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:34,087
(Dong Il is worried and can't leave them.)

459
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:35,958
You should go quickly and sleep.

460
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:37,558
Lie down first.

461
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:39,127
- Good night. - Sleep tight.

462
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:40,397
- Good night. - Bye.

463
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:42,238
- Sleep tight. - I'll turn off the lights. Sleep.

464
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:44,068
(After turning the lights off, they are ready to sleep.)

465
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:45,407
- It has a nice atmosphere, right? - Yes.

466
00:19:45,407 --> 00:19:47,268
Hyo Jin, should I turn on the light? To look in a mirror?

467
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:49,478
No, I don't need to look into the mirror. I'm fine.

468
00:19:49,478 --> 00:19:51,677
Just go quickly, Mom!

469
00:19:51,677 --> 00:19:52,808
Okay, I will.

470
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:53,808
- Good night. - Okay.

471
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:55,647
- Good night. - Good night, Hee Won.

472
00:19:55,647 --> 00:19:56,718
- Good night. - Good night.

473
00:19:59,288 --> 00:20:02,117
You didn't know he's so caring, did you?

474
00:20:03,788 --> 00:20:06,627
- No. - Gosh. He's not speaking. Really.

475
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:10,427
(Meanwhile, older brothers are out in the front yard.)

476
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:12,728
- It is good indeed, right? - Right.

477
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:14,697
Dong Il, there's no wind now.

478
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:16,937
- Right. Since there's no wind, - It's not windy.

479
00:20:16,968 --> 00:20:18,137
It's so good.

480
00:20:18,837 --> 00:20:21,877
There's not much steam coming out of my mouth.

481
00:20:21,877 --> 00:20:23,478
- Right. I can't see my breath now. - Compared to Pyeongchang.

482
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:27,407
(It's still cold, but it's a relief they can't see the breath.)

483
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:30,048
Hey, the moon looks so big.

484
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,488
Isn't here closer to the moon?

485
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:35,357
This town?

486
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:37,288
- Right. I guess it is closer. - Goodness

487
00:20:37,288 --> 00:20:38,427
(They can't sleep because of the view unfolded in the front yard.)

488
00:20:38,427 --> 00:20:41,298
- Gosh. I can see the moon squarely. - Yes.

489
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:42,558
- Isn't it so pretty? The moon? - Right.

490
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:46,367
- We're lying down at the beach. - I know.

491
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:48,167
Moon, good night.

492
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:51,038
- Jung Se. - Yes?

493
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:54,677
Is there something you regret or feel bad about today?

494
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:55,937
No, there isn't.

495
00:20:55,937 --> 00:20:58,478
There isn't? Do you think you've done well?

496
00:20:58,478 --> 00:20:59,508
Yes.

497
00:20:59,978 --> 00:21:02,947
(They hold Jung Se's hearing in the middle of the night.)

498
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:05,887
The viewers will look forward to you when you're here.

499
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:07,117
- That's right. - Right?

500
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:09,318
Shouldn't you live up to their expectations?

501
00:21:09,657 --> 00:21:11,258
I should...

502
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:13,558
What did he say? I couldn't hear.

503
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:16,028
- Hey, they're still awake. - Right.

504
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:18,728
- We're busted. - Why aren't you sleeping?

505
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:20,828
- You see, Dong Il. I... - Yes.

506
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:23,137
I asked him how long is he going to act shy.

507
00:21:23,137 --> 00:21:25,367
- Hey. - Even when he's being paid.

508
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:27,708
(Embarrassed)

509
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:28,978
Why aren't you doing your best here?

510
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:30,008
(He joins in making fun of Jung Se.)

511
00:21:30,008 --> 00:21:32,508
That's right, Dong Il. You should tell him now, tonight.

512
00:21:32,508 --> 00:21:34,407
- Hey, Jung Se. Let's talk now. - What are you going to do?

513
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:36,947
Why aren't you doing your best?

514
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:39,417
You're all nervous alone when shooting "Mount Jiri"...

515
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,818
- and do a rehearsal. Why not here? - You should talk now.

516
00:21:41,818 --> 00:21:43,218
(Bewildered)

517
00:21:44,357 --> 00:21:48,097
I'll teach him a lesson tonight.

518
00:21:48,097 --> 00:21:49,798
(Giggling)

519
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:51,697
No, Jung Se. I'm good.

520
00:21:51,697 --> 00:21:54,637
- You should be funny. - Okay. You two should talk.

521
00:21:54,768 --> 00:21:55,937
- Jung Se. - Yes.

522
00:21:55,937 --> 00:21:57,697
- Sleep well. Okay. - Sleep well.

523
00:21:57,968 --> 00:22:00,008
Should I turn all the lights off? Or should I turn one on?

524
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:02,308
- Jung Se, will you sleep in a tent? - It's dark here.

525
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:05,208
(Laughing)

526
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,078
Jung Se, will you sleep in the tent?

527
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:11,488
Okay. Now tell me what you're going to do.

528
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:15,218
(They won't stop making fun of Jung Se until they go to sleep.)

529
00:22:15,617 --> 00:22:17,488
I should do better tomorrow.

530
00:22:17,488 --> 00:22:19,587
(Laughing)

531
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:22,927
It's so much fun to tease Jung Se.

532
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:29,298
Gosh. The sound of the waves is...

533
00:22:29,837 --> 00:22:32,968
I can hear...

534
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:35,837
the waves.

535
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:40,078
(The night at the ocean hill at Chilpo deepens.)

536
00:22:40,907 --> 00:22:44,447
(The second day in Pohang)

537
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:49,218
(The sun hasn't come up yet, )

538
00:22:49,218 --> 00:22:52,758
(and the front yard filled with the blue light of dawn.)

539
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:57,458
(The sound of waves at dawn)

540
00:22:58,597 --> 00:23:01,367
(Our house's view at dawn)

541
00:23:10,877 --> 00:23:14,308
(The youngest has set the alarm to see the sunrise.)

542
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:19,347
(Hyo Jin's alarm goes off too.)

543
00:23:21,218 --> 00:23:23,657
(Jung Se wakes up.)

544
00:23:24,258 --> 00:23:26,828
(Dreamy)

545
00:23:28,097 --> 00:23:30,558
- It's hidden behind the clouds. - Did you sleep well?

546
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:31,627
Yes.

547
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:33,528
I slept so soundly.

548
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:36,097
- Really? - Yes.

549
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:38,437
I turned it off because it was too hot.

550
00:23:38,437 --> 00:23:41,068
(Luckily, the guests slept well in a warm house.)

551
00:23:41,808 --> 00:23:43,778
(Meanwhile, in the tent outside...)

552
00:23:44,238 --> 00:23:45,278
(Peeking)

553
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:46,308
(Groaning)

554
00:23:47,107 --> 00:23:48,177
(Groaning)

555
00:23:50,078 --> 00:23:53,387
(It's cold.)

556
00:23:55,187 --> 00:23:56,318
(Grunting)

557
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:58,558
(A wailing cry in the morning)

558
00:23:59,627 --> 00:24:01,558
(Groaning)

559
00:24:02,228 --> 00:24:05,427
(Armed with a padded coat)

560
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:09,097
(Are you okay?)

561
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:12,308
- Jung Se, are you sleeping? - Yes. I slept well.

562
00:24:12,308 --> 00:24:13,468
(Dong Il comes into the warm house.)

563
00:24:15,008 --> 00:24:17,208
- How was it? Wasn't it cold? - It wasn't cold.

564
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,677
- I see. That's a relief. - Was it cold?

565
00:24:18,677 --> 00:24:19,708
I woke up several times because it was hot.

566
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,417
What about you? It wasn't cold here.

567
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:22,847
- Was it hot? - Yes.

568
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:25,288
(They light up the house.)

569
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:27,318
Should I turn on the heater?

570
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:31,988
- The heater is on. It's 25°C. - Okay. Turn it on. Turn it on.

571
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:32,988
(Answering)

572
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:35,458
(Laughing)

573
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:39,097
(While Dong Il is feeling cheerful, Jung Se is...)

574
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:42,068
(Frowning)

575
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:46,208
(He stretches as soon as he wakes up.)

576
00:24:47,008 --> 00:24:48,978
(Wriggling)

577
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:54,748
(He opens his morning with stretching)

578
00:24:57,417 --> 00:24:59,788
(Is the sun coming up?)

579
00:25:01,187 --> 00:25:04,788
(Hee Won and Si Wan stepped out to see the sunrise.)

580
00:25:04,788 --> 00:25:08,728
My gosh. The waves are splashing all day.

581
00:25:08,728 --> 00:25:10,657
(Current time: 6:31am, 20 minutes before the sunrise)

582
00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:14,127
Hey, is the sun up already?

583
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:17,468
Will it turn reddish before it comes up?

584
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,107
Isn't that what it looks like before the sunrise?

585
00:25:20,107 --> 00:25:21,508
Before the sun rises.

586
00:25:22,238 --> 00:25:24,177
- Even if the sun comes up, - Yes.

587
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:26,008
There are so many clouds there.

588
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:28,177
- Right? - Yes, I don't think we can see it.

589
00:25:28,177 --> 00:25:30,248
(Will they be able to see the sun?)

590
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,887
(Pondering)

591
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:34,958
(Then I will...)

592
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:37,258
(get going.)

593
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:40,328
(Peeking)

594
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:43,798
I can't see it. They all went out.

595
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:45,367
Pretend you see it.

596
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:46,867
(Exclaiming)

597
00:25:47,498 --> 00:25:50,568
Right. Yesterday, the moon was up here, so...

598
00:25:50,568 --> 00:25:53,068
The sun will come up here. The moon is over there now.

599
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:55,107
- The moon is over there? - Yes.

600
00:25:55,107 --> 00:25:57,437
If the moon is there, where does the sun rise from?

601
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:01,078
We can see through that window.

602
00:26:01,877 --> 00:26:03,218
We can stick our heads out.

603
00:26:03,218 --> 00:26:04,377
- That way. - We don't have to go out.

604
00:26:04,377 --> 00:26:06,917
Jung Se. It'll make a good scene. When we look that way.

605
00:26:07,248 --> 00:26:10,187
I see. They work individually. There's one.

606
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,458
- I just slept. - You didn't go out?

607
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,357
- Did you see the sunrise then? - I saw something moving.

608
00:26:14,357 --> 00:26:16,627
(Acting cute)

609
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:20,728
I should have stepped out if I had been alone.

610
00:26:20,728 --> 00:26:23,367
- You'll be out there to do that. - But in fact...

611
00:26:24,597 --> 00:26:28,478
(Jung Se has become comfortable overnight. )

612
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:32,978
The waves are high here most of the time.

613
00:26:35,078 --> 00:26:37,318
(Glancing)

614
00:26:37,318 --> 00:26:40,187
Jung Se, your eyes are sparkling in the morning.

615
00:26:40,187 --> 00:26:43,518
- Yes. - Last night, they looked hazy.

616
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:46,627
Did Si Wan go on a photo shoot?

617
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:52,498
(Meanwhile, as he waits for the sun, )

618
00:26:53,627 --> 00:26:56,568
(he's taking a pictorial.)

619
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:59,407
(A cool guy in slippers)

620
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:03,738
(The sun...)

621
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:06,278
Gosh. It certainly faded.

622
00:27:06,278 --> 00:27:08,847
(The sun is playing hard to get with Si Wan.)

623
00:27:10,078 --> 00:27:13,087
(Please come out.)

624
00:27:14,647 --> 00:27:18,488
(Sunflower Si Wan is reluctant to give up.)

625
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:20,328
I was in "How to Use Guys with Secret Tips".

626
00:27:20,788 --> 00:27:24,597
(The youngest comes back at last.)

627
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:29,167
- The sun will rise in 10 minutes. - Really?

628
00:27:29,738 --> 00:27:31,867
If the sun hasn't come out yet, why is it so bright?

629
00:27:32,907 --> 00:27:35,778
(Bright and clear sky)

630
00:27:36,508 --> 00:27:39,078
(Hasn't the sun come out already?)

631
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:45,248
Before it rises, it makes the sky bright.

632
00:27:45,617 --> 00:27:47,617
- I guess it is true. - Right.

633
00:27:49,117 --> 00:27:50,657
Si Wan, come in.

634
00:27:50,657 --> 00:27:53,927
- Yes. I couldn't see at all. - Right?

635
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:55,028
(Sunflower Si Wan has come back.)

636
00:27:57,657 --> 00:27:59,927
(Si Wan is looking at something.)

637
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:04,268
"Plug the battery in the power socket..."

638
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:07,538
"Once click flying..."

639
00:28:08,008 --> 00:28:10,637
This is "one-click flying", it says here.

640
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:13,308
- Once? - Yes.

641
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:17,018
"Left and right. Rotating controller..."

642
00:28:17,018 --> 00:28:18,947
(He steps out again.)

643
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:21,587
(What Si Wan has brought is...)

644
00:28:22,258 --> 00:28:25,687
(a drone.)

645
00:28:27,157 --> 00:28:30,298
(He pushes the button with one click and turns on the power.)

646
00:28:33,268 --> 00:28:35,367
(Pressing)

647
00:28:39,607 --> 00:28:42,907
(The drone won't move with a beeping sound.)

648
00:28:43,377 --> 00:28:45,978
(Flustered)

649
00:28:46,677 --> 00:28:49,078
(Beeping)

650
00:28:49,518 --> 00:28:51,947
(Beeping)

651
00:28:54,387 --> 00:28:57,258
(Flustered hands)

652
00:28:59,357 --> 00:29:01,488
(It suddenly became quiet.)

653
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:04,528
(Why isn't it working?)

654
00:29:07,728 --> 00:29:11,068
(The drone starts to move.)

655
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:17,078
(As soon as it flies, it's flung down.)

656
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,708
(Si Wan...)

657
00:29:20,407 --> 00:29:22,947
(Smirking)

658
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:29,887
(He gives it another try.)

659
00:29:31,058 --> 00:29:33,357
What's this? Why are there so many joysticks?

660
00:29:35,397 --> 00:29:39,097
(A drone for shooting scenery appears at that time.)

661
00:29:40,568 --> 00:29:42,837
(Envious)

662
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,637
(He changes his target.)

663
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:55,278
(The drone moves along with Si Wan's control?)

664
00:29:56,147 --> 00:29:58,718
(Immersed in acting)

665
00:30:00,617 --> 00:30:04,018
(He even makes it spin.)

666
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:10,558
(The youngest is now in perfect harmony with the drone.)

667
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,837
(Look here.)

668
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:18,367
- Is it Si Wan's? - Yes, it's Si Wan's.

669
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,607
- Goodness. - He's good at it.

670
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,107
(Top class acting)

671
00:30:25,008 --> 00:30:27,107
(It's summoned to the house.)

672
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:28,847
Look. Is it moving?

673
00:30:28,847 --> 00:30:32,387
My goodness. I got to see the drone show.

674
00:30:33,447 --> 00:30:37,488
(He holds out his hands.)

675
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,558
(Moving his fingers)

676
00:30:42,197 --> 00:30:45,328
(The drone follows both of their orders.)

677
00:30:46,568 --> 00:30:48,897
(The youngest is in a good mood and gets bolder.)

678
00:30:49,568 --> 00:30:51,708
(Come down.)

679
00:30:52,137 --> 00:30:53,937
(Say hi.)

680
00:30:54,337 --> 00:30:56,637
(Hi.)

681
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:58,078
He's good at flying it.

682
00:30:59,508 --> 00:31:02,647
(The drone show ends with success.)

683
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:05,818
(Someday I will...)

684
00:31:07,018 --> 00:31:08,318
Hang on a second. What time is it?

685
00:31:11,157 --> 00:31:12,687
It's 50. It's 6:50am.

686
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:14,258
(It's almost the time for sunrise.)

687
00:31:14,258 --> 00:31:15,427
It's 6:50am.

688
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:17,857
(Running)

689
00:31:18,897 --> 00:31:20,728
Wait. The sun must have risen now.

690
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:22,068
(Where?)

691
00:31:22,937 --> 00:31:26,667
(Looking forward to seeing the sun)

692
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:30,978
- Oh, there's the sun. Jung Se. - Right. There's the sun.

693
00:31:30,978 --> 00:31:33,147
- There's the sun. Jung Se. - Right. There's the sun.

694
00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:34,278
- Gosh. - My Gosh.

695
00:31:35,847 --> 00:31:37,617
Goodness.

696
00:31:37,617 --> 00:31:39,187
(Admiring)

697
00:31:39,748 --> 00:31:42,518
Oh, my. Was it not?

698
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:47,988
(After the clouds have cleared, )

699
00:31:48,897 --> 00:31:52,298
(the precious figure appears.)

700
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:55,498
(It breaks through the clouds.)

701
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:57,068
My goodness. It's pretty.

702
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:02,208
(Pink morning sunlight)

703
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:06,778
- Isn't it crazy? - Oh, my...

704
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:10,548
(He has this look when he's impressed.)

705
00:32:11,748 --> 00:32:13,347
(The youngest is busy capturing this awaited moment.)

706
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:14,788
No, I'm not...

707
00:32:15,157 --> 00:32:17,718
The camera can't follow up with the beauty.

708
00:32:18,427 --> 00:32:21,258
Can I get my morning coffee?

709
00:32:25,097 --> 00:32:29,798
(It's very satisfying to enjoy a cup of morning coffee...)

710
00:32:31,837 --> 00:32:34,738
(in my own front yard.)

711
00:32:35,008 --> 00:32:38,038
Isn't it beautiful how it's peeking out in between?

712
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:41,647
It's like it made that hole for us to see.

713
00:32:42,578 --> 00:32:44,617
It's a glorious light coming from between the clouds.

714
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:46,218
(A glorious light from the clouds)

715
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:49,187
(It is worth waiting...)

716
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:51,657
(for the sunrise of Pohang offshore.)

717
00:32:53,657 --> 00:32:55,328
Come here. Hurry.

718
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:01,897
(The drone for the shooting is back.)

719
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:05,708
The little guy got caught on its way.

720
00:33:05,808 --> 00:33:08,167
(Did you call me?)

721
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:12,208
Do you want me to tie you up here?

722
00:33:13,907 --> 00:33:15,748
(Buzzing)

723
00:33:16,718 --> 00:33:18,988
(Shaking)

724
00:33:20,387 --> 00:33:23,117
(Dong Il tried to be fun for Si Wan.)

725
00:33:23,687 --> 00:33:25,857
(That was cute.)

726
00:33:26,258 --> 00:33:27,887
It's my morning coffee.

727
00:33:28,597 --> 00:33:30,328
Come here and have some.

728
00:33:30,328 --> 00:33:32,597
(Come to my place and enjoy some coffee.)

729
00:33:40,308 --> 00:33:42,608
- It's pretty. - It is.

730
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:46,677
Let's eat simply for breakfast, like ramyeon.

731
00:33:46,677 --> 00:33:48,308
- Ramyeon? - I like it.

732
00:33:48,308 --> 00:33:49,418
How about you?

733
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:51,547
(Jung Se is...)

734
00:33:52,018 --> 00:33:54,717
(getting out of the blanket.)

735
00:33:54,947 --> 00:33:56,588
- Are you going to make ramyeon? - Yes.

736
00:33:56,588 --> 00:33:58,657
(Jung Se is making ramyeon.)

737
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,027
Jung Se is finally...

738
00:34:00,027 --> 00:34:02,027
ramyeon by Jung Se...

739
00:34:02,527 --> 00:34:04,458
(He's organizing the blanket.)

740
00:34:04,458 --> 00:34:06,367
Jung Se is good at making ramyeon.

741
00:34:07,097 --> 00:34:09,467
(He's going to the kitchen stepping on the blanket.)

742
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:10,768
- No. - Hey, water...

743
00:34:10,768 --> 00:34:13,237
- Are you... - I'll join Jung Se.

744
00:34:13,237 --> 00:34:14,567
- Why? - What?

745
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:17,407
Just leave him alone. You're not helping him to be independent.

746
00:34:17,407 --> 00:34:20,847
- Jung Se, the ramyeon... - Right. Leave him alone.

747
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:23,148
Use two separate pots for the ramyeon.

748
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:26,047
- Two pots... - Cooking small portions is better.

749
00:34:26,987 --> 00:34:28,887
(Mother Dong Il comes in.)

750
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:31,317
(Sneaking in)

751
00:34:34,927 --> 00:34:37,128
Get me some avocado.

752
00:34:37,128 --> 00:34:38,157
I will.

753
00:34:38,498 --> 00:34:42,268
We still have one snow crab left. Should we add that in the ramyeon?

754
00:34:42,768 --> 00:34:46,608
Look. He's got chili peppers to make chili pepper ramyeon.

755
00:34:46,708 --> 00:34:49,007
Are you putting chili pepper slices in ramyeon?

756
00:34:49,007 --> 00:34:51,978
- Yes. - Is that so? Just ramyeon then?

757
00:34:51,978 --> 00:34:53,507
Have a seat, Mr. Oldest.

758
00:34:54,308 --> 00:34:56,117
(No one can stop him.)

759
00:34:56,518 --> 00:34:59,418
(It's ramyeon time.)

760
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:01,748
(Washing it clean)

761
00:35:01,748 --> 00:35:03,058
(Sweeping off the water)

762
00:35:04,317 --> 00:35:07,527
(Slicing chili peppers for ramyeon)

763
00:35:08,728 --> 00:35:11,128
- Should I add two chili peppers? - What?

764
00:35:11,697 --> 00:35:13,967
(Thinking a little)

765
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:16,297
(Slicing again)

766
00:35:16,768 --> 00:35:19,907
- Oh, looking good. - It's not boiling hard yet.

767
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:23,007
This looks great. Okay, I will...

768
00:35:24,177 --> 00:35:27,378
(Lovely Hyo Jin puts the noodle in.)

769
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:30,847
(Jung Se puts the base powder in.)

770
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:32,447
The chili peppers should be in now, right?

771
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:33,918
(Adding Cheongyang chili)

772
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:35,418
Does the amount look okay?

773
00:35:35,617 --> 00:35:36,688
Wouldn't it be okay?

774
00:35:37,617 --> 00:35:40,688
(The house is filled with the ramyeon smell.)

775
00:35:40,688 --> 00:35:41,958
I can smell ramyeon.

776
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:43,427
Are you preparing kimchi?

777
00:35:43,427 --> 00:35:44,628
- Yes. - Let's put it here.

778
00:35:45,197 --> 00:35:46,228
(The space is not enough.)

779
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:48,228
- Did you get the eggs out? - Yes.

780
00:35:48,427 --> 00:35:49,938
- Where is it? - It's here.

781
00:35:50,668 --> 00:35:54,438
Since we're all busy together, it feels like a real morning.

782
00:35:54,438 --> 00:35:55,438
Hyo Jin, have a seat.

783
00:35:55,438 --> 00:35:56,578
- Yes. - Let's sit.

784
00:35:56,578 --> 00:35:57,907
It's done. It's already soggy.

785
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:00,208
- Is it getting soggy? Then... - What about the eggs?

786
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:01,208
Oh, my... Silly!

787
00:36:01,878 --> 00:36:03,317
(Kimchi is taking a cold shower.)

788
00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:04,978
(Hiding it)

789
00:36:05,688 --> 00:36:06,817
(He is surprised the most.)

790
00:36:06,817 --> 00:36:09,217
What are you doing pouring tap water in Kimchi?

791
00:36:09,887 --> 00:36:11,617
This way is more delicious.

792
00:36:12,288 --> 00:36:15,058
Oh, my... He poured tap water in Kimchi.

793
00:36:15,228 --> 00:36:16,597
Let's bring the pots.

794
00:36:16,998 --> 00:36:18,558
Let's all sit.

795
00:36:18,558 --> 00:36:19,828
- Okay. - Let's sit.

796
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:23,938
This is morning ramyeon by Jung Se.

797
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:27,108
- Let's enjoy the meal. - Enjoy.

798
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:28,608
Let's enjoy.

799
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:32,078
(Slurping)

800
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:36,717
(Slurping together)

801
00:36:37,117 --> 00:36:39,188
Cheongyang chili smells good.

802
00:36:39,188 --> 00:36:40,188
(Full in his mouth)

803
00:36:40,788 --> 00:36:43,887
(Hot morning ramyeon after enjoying the cold breeze)

804
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:45,527
It's delicious.

805
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:48,088
(He's very happy.)

806
00:36:49,427 --> 00:36:53,628
(ramyeon is to slurp.)

807
00:36:54,668 --> 00:36:58,097
(Hyo Jin is drinking its spicy soup.)

808
00:36:59,237 --> 00:37:00,237
(So good)

809
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:03,637
(It's hot.)

810
00:37:04,777 --> 00:37:06,748
(It's good.)

811
00:37:07,148 --> 00:37:11,578
(Morning ramyeon is the way.)

812
00:37:12,487 --> 00:37:16,088
(Another slurp with kimchi)

813
00:37:16,918 --> 00:37:18,418
Kimchi is very delicious.

814
00:37:20,427 --> 00:37:22,358
I got some water there.

815
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,527
- That's right. - Is that why?

816
00:37:25,527 --> 00:37:27,297
No wonder why it tastes sour.

817
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,237
(All have enjoyed ramyeon.)

818
00:37:30,697 --> 00:37:32,538
I'm going to eat rice with soup.

819
00:37:33,308 --> 00:37:35,168
- Ramyeon with cold rice. - A way to go.

820
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:38,407
- That looks delicious. - It's perfect.

821
00:37:38,978 --> 00:37:40,777
(Dong Il is putting rice in.)

822
00:37:40,777 --> 00:37:42,248
- Hey, Hyo Jin. - Yes.

823
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:45,688
Did you put all the Cheongyang chili in mine on purpose?

824
00:37:46,887 --> 00:37:49,317
Is this ramyeon or Cheongyang chili soup?

825
00:37:49,487 --> 00:37:50,688
(He's got all the Cheongyang chili.)

826
00:37:50,887 --> 00:37:51,887
This is...

827
00:37:52,088 --> 00:37:53,728
- Look. - Jung Se.

828
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:55,188
(Jung Se, say something.)

829
00:37:55,628 --> 00:37:56,998
Jung Se, how many did you put in?

830
00:37:56,998 --> 00:37:58,328
- 5? - I put 5.

831
00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:01,128
(Should I add 5 Cheongyang chili peppers?)

832
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:02,898
(Hyo Jin didn't hear.)

833
00:38:03,268 --> 00:38:05,907
(Jung Se put 5 Cheongyang chili peppers in.)

834
00:38:05,907 --> 00:38:08,237
(He even put all the seeds.)

835
00:38:08,878 --> 00:38:10,038
(Spicy)

836
00:38:10,308 --> 00:38:12,308
- Do you want more noodles? - I want more soup.

837
00:38:12,308 --> 00:38:14,177
(It's very spicy.)

838
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:17,277
Yesterday, we had crabs,

839
00:38:17,277 --> 00:38:19,088
but I like ramyeon with rice better.

840
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,188
- 5? - Yes, 5.

841
00:38:20,688 --> 00:38:21,817
Among the five...

842
00:38:21,817 --> 00:38:25,487
It's like one pepper per one ramyeon.

843
00:38:25,487 --> 00:38:26,487
(Chunky chili pepper ramyeon)

844
00:38:26,487 --> 00:38:28,128
It's a real Cheongyang chili...

845
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:31,228
(It's spicy.)

846
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:34,067
- I'm going to take this one. - I should not...

847
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:35,067
(Hee Won is grabbing something.)

848
00:38:35,797 --> 00:38:37,938
(A fizzy vitamin tablet instead of morning coffee?)

849
00:38:37,938 --> 00:38:39,268
He's taking care of his health.

850
00:38:41,338 --> 00:38:42,907
Have you been taking care of your health?

851
00:38:42,907 --> 00:38:43,978
He has.

852
00:38:44,507 --> 00:38:46,547
- But, it's... - My bag is filled with pills.

853
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,648
Hee Won, where are you? I'm seeing a doctor.

854
00:38:49,648 --> 00:38:51,317
Hee Won, where are you? I'm on the way to my doctor.

855
00:38:51,777 --> 00:38:54,317
(It was delicious and happy breakfast thanks to Jung Se.)

856
00:38:54,317 --> 00:38:56,717
- Thank you for the meal. - It was good.

857
00:38:56,717 --> 00:38:59,288
The sun is going to be bright today.

858
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:01,358
The sky is...

859
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:04,828
The sunshine is striking.

860
00:39:04,828 --> 00:39:06,268
It's pretty.

861
00:39:06,697 --> 00:39:10,768
In this travel, this is my favorite moment.

862
00:39:11,668 --> 00:39:13,838
- It's so good. - Oh, it's pretty.

863
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:14,838
It is.

864
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:18,947
Let's go to the camping area for a little.

865
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:21,947
It takes 20 minutes from here,

866
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:24,677
and we can have the whole ocean view.

867
00:39:24,878 --> 00:39:26,217
Let's move.

868
00:39:26,387 --> 00:39:28,887
- Okay. Let's go. - Let's go.

869
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:35,427
(It's time to say goodbye to Chilpo Hill.)

870
00:39:36,728 --> 00:39:38,998
(See you next time.)

871
00:39:39,828 --> 00:39:42,998
(Putting the beautiful Chilpo Hill behind, )

872
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:48,878
(they're heading towards the offshore.)

873
00:39:50,978 --> 00:39:52,277
The water is clear.

874
00:39:55,148 --> 00:39:57,648
We never took a walk by the ocean while staying here.

875
00:39:57,947 --> 00:39:59,688
- Right? - Yes.

876
00:40:01,387 --> 00:40:04,088
- The ocean is so nice. - Such a nice view.

877
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:06,328
Look at the clear ocean.

878
00:40:09,058 --> 00:40:13,128
(It's remarkable scenery.)

879
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:15,637
(After all...)

880
00:40:15,637 --> 00:40:18,237
(They ended up staying here.)

881
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:22,838
(It's what they've missed out right by the side.)

882
00:40:23,637 --> 00:40:27,248
(Shall we take a walk by the Chilpo ocean?)

883
00:40:28,047 --> 00:40:30,248
It's the first time walking by the ocean in Pohang.

884
00:40:31,677 --> 00:40:34,047
This is the place to enjoy the ocean.

885
00:40:35,817 --> 00:40:38,358
I'm too scared to go closer to it.

886
00:40:38,817 --> 00:40:40,188
The water came up to here.

887
00:40:41,027 --> 00:40:45,197
(Such a mind-blowing wave of Chilpo)

888
00:40:46,328 --> 00:40:47,628
(The youngest is...)

889
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:48,998
Look at Si Wan.

890
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:51,038
(The youngest is running towards the ocean like crazy.)

891
00:40:52,338 --> 00:40:54,967
(Hello, the ocean.)

892
00:40:55,677 --> 00:40:57,737
(Wandering)

893
00:40:57,737 --> 00:41:00,007
The wave is really...

894
00:41:00,177 --> 00:41:01,378
That's a little scary.

895
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:03,447
- That one looks like coming closer. - It's powerful.

896
00:41:06,617 --> 00:41:08,288
This is really amazing.

897
00:41:08,288 --> 00:41:09,588
(The ocean is attracting the busy members together.)

898
00:41:11,317 --> 00:41:12,788
It's time to go.

899
00:41:12,788 --> 00:41:13,788
(They've got an unforgettable memory.)

900
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:14,788
(See you again.)

901
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:20,228
Hyo Jin, take the passenger seat.

902
00:41:20,427 --> 00:41:21,898
- Do I? - Yes.

903
00:41:21,898 --> 00:41:23,567
I'll sit in between.

904
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:24,938
Yes, Si Wan sits in the middle.

905
00:41:25,538 --> 00:41:27,438
I will sit in the back. You sit in the front.

906
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:28,978
- No. I'm okay. - No, you sit.

907
00:41:28,978 --> 00:41:30,237
Your legs are longer.

908
00:41:30,507 --> 00:41:32,748
You must be uncomfortable in the back.

909
00:41:32,748 --> 00:41:33,847
I want you to be comfortable.

910
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:37,418
(Hyo Jin sits in the front as Dong Il wants.)

911
00:41:37,918 --> 00:41:39,447
Si Wan, are you okay in the back?

912
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:41,518
Yes, I am okay.

913
00:41:41,788 --> 00:41:42,817
Oh, my...

914
00:41:42,817 --> 00:41:43,958
(It's crowded.)

915
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:45,788
Hee Won, don't ask and just go.

916
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,387
(I'm okay as well.)

917
00:41:47,387 --> 00:41:49,197
(Crumpled)

918
00:41:49,797 --> 00:41:51,527
Did you all fasten your seat belts?

919
00:41:51,597 --> 00:41:52,797
Yes, we did.

920
00:41:53,867 --> 00:41:55,467
Let's go.

921
00:41:55,938 --> 00:41:57,467
I will depart.

922
00:41:58,168 --> 00:41:59,168
Oh, my gosh.

923
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:01,438
Oh, the Pohang ocean...

924
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:02,438
(Dong Il already misses it.)

925
00:42:03,637 --> 00:42:09,817
(The gift-like Chilpo Ocean Hill)

926
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:14,047
(With an excited heart, )

927
00:42:15,588 --> 00:42:20,058
(they run to their second front yard.)

928
00:42:20,487 --> 00:42:24,558
Wow, there are houses right in front of the ocean.

929
00:42:25,697 --> 00:42:26,797
(They encounter Chilpo Ocean Village after leaving the hill.)

930
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:27,967
It looks like a fish market.

931
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,898
(They encounter Chilpo Ocean Village after leaving the hill.)

932
00:42:31,038 --> 00:42:32,168
Wow, they're drying seaweed.

933
00:42:32,168 --> 00:42:33,168
(It's cool even though it's the second time seeing it.)

934
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:35,567
(Seaweed?)

935
00:42:35,907 --> 00:42:39,078
(An interesting view of seaweed being dried in front of houses.)

936
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,907
(A small ocean village of Chilpo...)

937
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:44,978
(that they only saw from afar.)

938
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:49,117
(Looking from a closer distance, it is filled with a friendly view, )

939
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:54,588
(and each house smells of the ocean.)

940
00:42:55,427 --> 00:42:58,527
(It's a place that's hard to just pass by as it smells like home.)

941
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:02,797
I want to just live in a house in the countryside...

942
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:06,407
in front of the ocean for a week.

943
00:43:06,407 --> 00:43:10,007
I'll set up a house near the ocean. Let's live together.

944
00:43:10,038 --> 00:43:12,277
- Shall we? - Yeah, for real.

945
00:43:12,277 --> 00:43:15,148
But really, once I get a bit older,

946
00:43:15,378 --> 00:43:17,248
I'm going to live like that for real.

947
00:43:17,547 --> 00:43:21,248
My dad also always says that he wants to live by the ocean.

948
00:43:21,817 --> 00:43:23,958
I like the ocean more than the mountains.

949
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:26,458
- Jung Se, you're the same, right? - Yes, I like the ocean better.

950
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:27,588
I like the mountains better.

951
00:43:27,588 --> 00:43:28,657
- The mountains? - Yes.

952
00:43:28,657 --> 00:43:30,498
- Oh, because you like walking. - Yes.

953
00:43:30,558 --> 00:43:31,657
I like the mountains.

954
00:43:31,657 --> 00:43:33,067
- I like the ocean. - The ocean?

955
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:34,998
- What about you Hee Won? - Hee Won likes the city.

956
00:43:35,297 --> 00:43:37,538
I don't care where as long as they have a hospital.

957
00:43:41,137 --> 00:43:42,438
(Whether the ocean or the mountains, he needs modern medicine.)

958
00:43:42,438 --> 00:43:44,737
Hee Won, what if you become an ambassador because of this?

959
00:43:44,737 --> 00:43:47,047
Don't forget your medical check-up!

960
00:43:47,248 --> 00:43:48,947
(That's my little brother.)

961
00:43:49,748 --> 00:43:53,947
(With their warm laughter, )

962
00:43:56,487 --> 00:43:59,527
(the family refreshingly drive along...)

963
00:43:59,527 --> 00:44:02,458
(the blue Haeparang Road.)

964
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:04,527
Wow, this place is so beautiful.

965
00:44:06,128 --> 00:44:09,697
(Pohang's village)

966
00:44:09,697 --> 00:44:13,938
(Pohang's ocean)

967
00:44:13,938 --> 00:44:16,578
(Pohang's fields)

968
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:19,947
They said that it's a place where we can look down at the whole ocean,

969
00:44:19,947 --> 00:44:21,608
but we're pretty high up in the mountains now.

970
00:44:22,717 --> 00:44:23,918
Wow, it's so pretty here.

971
00:44:23,918 --> 00:44:25,518
It's so beautiful here.

972
00:44:25,518 --> 00:44:29,188
(A forest that surrounds the house.)

973
00:44:30,188 --> 00:44:31,288
(Goodness)

974
00:44:33,387 --> 00:44:35,288
(Goodness)

975
00:44:36,157 --> 00:44:38,458
(A bright smile)

976
00:44:41,628 --> 00:44:42,867
There are many mountains.

977
00:44:42,867 --> 00:44:45,197
(They've finally arrived at the second front yard of Pohang.)

978
00:44:46,237 --> 00:44:48,007
- Well done everyone. - Well done everyone.

979
00:44:52,507 --> 00:44:57,277
(The second front yard is Wolpo Ocean Viewpoint.)

980
00:44:58,148 --> 00:45:00,317
(The second front yard...)

981
00:45:00,317 --> 00:45:04,717
(that's situated halfway up the mountain...)

982
00:45:05,688 --> 00:45:11,697
(is a place where you can look at the ocean village of Pohang.)

983
00:45:12,157 --> 00:45:15,597
(Filmed with the permission of the owner)

984
00:45:16,168 --> 00:45:18,797
(Something's different about this place.)

985
00:45:20,608 --> 00:45:22,168
There's no wind here which is a relief.

986
00:45:22,168 --> 00:45:23,338
- Yes. - A bit.

987
00:45:24,777 --> 00:45:28,277
(They had a rough time at the first front yard because of the wind.)

988
00:45:28,748 --> 00:45:31,817
(Shaking because of the wind)

989
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:35,018
(The people and the grass both...)

990
00:45:35,018 --> 00:45:37,117
(couldn't stand still.)

991
00:45:38,088 --> 00:45:42,128
(But the second front yard of Pohang...)

992
00:45:42,898 --> 00:45:48,097
(is in the embrace of Mount Chollyong and Mount Kwaeryong.)

993
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:51,438
(It's just peaceful, )

994
00:45:51,438 --> 00:45:54,808
(without a hint of wind.)

995
00:45:56,407 --> 00:46:00,148
(If you just raise your gaze from the house, )

996
00:46:00,947 --> 00:46:04,117
(the places you can see...)

997
00:46:05,177 --> 00:46:11,257
(are the village and the beach of Pohang, which are like home now.)

998
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:15,487
(It's one village, but it has completely different charms.)

999
00:46:16,297 --> 00:46:21,898
(That is our house's second front yard.)

1000
00:46:23,097 --> 00:46:25,697
(The House on Wheels finds itself in a place with a great view.)

1001
00:46:25,697 --> 00:46:26,768
(Click)

1002
00:46:26,768 --> 00:46:27,808
(Click)

1003
00:46:27,808 --> 00:46:29,677
Don't I look like an offroad car model?

1004
00:46:29,677 --> 00:46:30,677
(Playing around and taking pictures.)

1005
00:46:30,677 --> 00:46:31,808
That looks good.

1006
00:46:32,878 --> 00:46:35,047
(He even changes positions.)

1007
00:46:35,047 --> 00:46:36,648
(Grunting)

1008
00:46:37,217 --> 00:46:38,847
- The dust like this. - A bit more?

1009
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,688
Yes, like that. It fits you well.

1010
00:46:41,018 --> 00:46:43,657
(Brightly smiling)

1011
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:45,788
You would be a great actress.

1012
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:48,027
- Right? I'm preparing to be one. - Yes.

1013
00:46:48,257 --> 00:46:49,927
- Are you? - Yes, I'm learning acting.

1014
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:51,157
You always make it to the final audition, right?

1015
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:53,228
I always get cut right before the final audition.

1016
00:46:53,228 --> 00:46:54,998
Before? I think you'd make it at least to the final audition.

1017
00:46:55,498 --> 00:46:57,268
I think it's because I'm too tall.

1018
00:46:57,268 --> 00:46:58,737
- It's unfavorable if you're tall. - Yes.

1019
00:46:58,737 --> 00:47:00,507
I started because I had faith in my height.

1020
00:47:00,507 --> 00:47:01,668
(Laughing)

1021
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:04,978
If you start with basics, you work on your diction.

1022
00:47:04,978 --> 00:47:08,007
You need to knock. It will open only if you knock.

1023
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:11,117
There's a big place called...

1024
00:47:11,117 --> 00:47:13,547
You're so funny. How can I go into a place like that?

1025
00:47:13,547 --> 00:47:15,047
Now you're starting to talk.

1026
00:47:15,047 --> 00:47:16,317
He's started now.

1027
00:47:17,018 --> 00:47:20,858
(Jung Se starts talking after they move front yards.)

1028
00:47:21,058 --> 00:47:23,157
I'm so hungry!

1029
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,657
Oh, the place you guys shot the drama together.

1030
00:47:26,197 --> 00:47:27,867
Remember the restaurant you guys went to?

1031
00:47:28,597 --> 00:47:30,438
- Are we going to Guryongpo? - Yes.

1032
00:47:30,938 --> 00:47:32,097
We need to go now that we're here.

1033
00:47:33,907 --> 00:47:36,038
It's my first time after finishing the drama.

1034
00:47:36,038 --> 00:47:37,177
- Really? - Yes.

1035
00:47:37,878 --> 00:47:41,308
("When the Camellia Blooms" was based in Guryongpo.)

1036
00:47:42,047 --> 00:47:46,018
(In a friendly town called "Ongsan,")

1037
00:47:47,847 --> 00:47:51,088
(there lived Dong Baek, the owner of the "Camellia".)

1038
00:47:51,088 --> 00:47:53,027
It's full of roe, so that's okay.

1039
00:47:53,188 --> 00:47:56,527
We're like brother and sister.

1040
00:47:56,527 --> 00:47:58,728
(Dong Baek and Gyu Tae who are like siblings)

1041
00:48:00,927 --> 00:48:01,967
Welcome.

1042
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:05,137
(We're visiting Ongsan again.)

1043
00:48:05,367 --> 00:48:07,838
- There's a really good restaurant. - Yes.

1044
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:11,308
We should say hello to the owner now that we're here in Pohang.

1045
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:12,438
He'll recognize us, right?

1046
00:48:12,878 --> 00:48:14,648
- Who are you...? - Do you want to try?

1047
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,777
- He might not recognize me. - You go in first.

1048
00:48:16,777 --> 00:48:17,847
(The two are excited to go to Guryongpo.)

1049
00:48:17,847 --> 00:48:18,947
Oh, who is this?

1050
00:48:18,947 --> 00:48:20,317
- We'll be back. Get the car ready. - Okay.

1051
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:21,847
Drive safely.

1052
00:48:22,688 --> 00:48:24,257
Are there any snacks you want to eat?

1053
00:48:24,617 --> 00:48:29,458
(Jung Se is driving himself to go to Guryongpo!)

1054
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,498
Go! We're off to the restaurant.

1055
00:48:32,498 --> 00:48:34,697
(From the house to Guryongpo)

1056
00:48:35,027 --> 00:48:36,467
- They serve just home-cooked meals? - Yes.

1057
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:38,538
- Just home-cooked meals. - It's a small restaurant.

1058
00:48:38,538 --> 00:48:41,737
- There are five tables. - Oh, it's a small place.

1059
00:48:41,737 --> 00:48:45,007
The small fish they fry for you were so good.

1060
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:47,648
(Munching)

1061
00:48:48,177 --> 00:48:50,578
(Munching again)

1062
00:48:50,578 --> 00:48:52,817
Hyo Jin has too much food stacked for a person on a diet.

1063
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,018
Snacks.

1064
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:56,088
(Snacks 1, 2, 3, and 4)

1065
00:48:56,317 --> 00:48:58,918
I shouldn't eat like this since we're eating soon.

1066
00:48:59,628 --> 00:49:01,188
(Munching)

1067
00:49:01,887 --> 00:49:04,797
(While the owners of the house talk...)

1068
00:49:04,797 --> 00:49:06,828
They are snacks. Snacks!

1069
00:49:07,567 --> 00:49:09,328
Oh, I want to eat them.

1070
00:49:09,328 --> 00:49:10,737
(Hyo Jin's happily thinking through what to eat.)

1071
00:49:11,338 --> 00:49:13,708
I love this snack!

1072
00:49:14,768 --> 00:49:15,867
I've started again.

1073
00:49:16,308 --> 00:49:17,438
Over here.

1074
00:49:17,438 --> 00:49:18,637
(Urgent)

1075
00:49:19,878 --> 00:49:23,148
(Munching so much)

1076
00:49:23,648 --> 00:49:26,018
(Taking a bite)

1077
00:49:26,217 --> 00:49:28,248
(So interesting)

1078
00:49:29,047 --> 00:49:30,558
(Holding the bag and eating)

1079
00:49:30,558 --> 00:49:32,387
(Savoring)

1080
00:49:33,058 --> 00:49:35,288
(So happy)

1081
00:49:35,788 --> 00:49:36,858
(Let's eat together.)

1082
00:49:36,858 --> 00:49:37,958
No, I have some already.

1083
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:42,027
(Hyo Jin eats well.)

1084
00:49:42,297 --> 00:49:44,998
Even if you shoot in the countryside for a long time,

1085
00:49:44,998 --> 00:49:47,567
it's rare to visit the place again when you think of the place.

1086
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,668
That's right.

1087
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:51,277
It's a quiet place, so there's not a lot of people.

1088
00:49:51,378 --> 00:49:54,748
I just walked around for the five months when we were there.

1089
00:49:55,148 --> 00:49:58,117
I just walked around the basecamp,

1090
00:49:58,648 --> 00:50:00,418
the shooting place, and the way to the market.

1091
00:50:00,648 --> 00:50:03,088
And during the season for snow crabs and gwamegi,

1092
00:50:03,088 --> 00:50:05,657
they sent it to my house through my company.

1093
00:50:06,427 --> 00:50:07,958
They made kimchi as well.

1094
00:50:07,958 --> 00:50:08,987
(The kind village people sent kimchi during the kimchi season as well.)

1095
00:50:08,987 --> 00:50:10,958
- Oh, the village people sent them? - Yes.

1096
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:11,958
Yes, the village people.

1097
00:50:12,998 --> 00:50:16,067
That's why it was more special.

1098
00:50:16,268 --> 00:50:19,297
- Those are the things I miss. - I see.

1099
00:50:19,297 --> 00:50:20,938
(That's what made the memories of Guryongpo so special.)

1100
00:50:21,967 --> 00:50:25,378
(Going to Guryongpo with an excited heart)

1101
00:50:25,978 --> 00:50:28,578
But as the drama became popular,

1102
00:50:28,748 --> 00:50:32,277
people became curious as to who the murderer was in the drama.

1103
00:50:32,277 --> 00:50:34,418
I bet people suspected Jung Se the most.

1104
00:50:34,617 --> 00:50:36,617
He was too much of a scaredy-cat to be a murderer.

1105
00:50:37,317 --> 00:50:38,487
Mr. No Peanuts, right?

1106
00:50:39,018 --> 00:50:40,788
His character got facial nerve palsy from shock...

1107
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:43,097
from hitting an elk with a car.

1108
00:50:45,398 --> 00:50:47,367
That character setting is so...

1109
00:50:47,427 --> 00:50:48,898
Isn't it so funny?

1110
00:50:49,697 --> 00:50:51,067
The police arrest me.

1111
00:50:51,067 --> 00:50:53,867
"You killed her, right? You threw her into the lake, right?"

1112
00:50:54,168 --> 00:50:57,878
Then usually they say, "It wasn't me!" as they get arrested, right?

1113
00:50:57,907 --> 00:50:59,007
But the lines were,

1114
00:50:59,007 --> 00:51:01,308
"No! I can't even carry her!"

1115
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:03,378
And they drag me off.

1116
00:51:04,447 --> 00:51:07,788
(Almost dying of laughter)

1117
00:51:08,047 --> 00:51:09,288
Mr. Noh Gyu Tae!

1118
00:51:10,518 --> 00:51:13,588
(You're a suspect for the murder of Choi Hyang Mi.)

1119
00:51:14,487 --> 00:51:17,257
(I'll explain it all right now!)

1120
00:51:17,558 --> 00:51:19,967
(How can I throw her into the Ongsan Lake?)

1121
00:51:21,168 --> 00:51:23,067
(I can't carry her.)

1122
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:24,998
It's not me! I can't carry her!

1123
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:27,838
(It's been a year and a half, but he remembers so vividly.)

1124
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:31,677
Jung Se's acting is so detailed.

1125
00:51:31,677 --> 00:51:32,777
- Completely. - Completely.

1126
00:51:32,777 --> 00:51:34,847
- He plans out everything. - Plans it all out.

1127
00:51:34,847 --> 00:51:37,748
Jung Se's gaze...

1128
00:51:38,018 --> 00:51:40,918
going up and down is always the same.

1129
00:51:40,918 --> 00:51:42,847
- I was so surprised when I saw it. - He's so great.

1130
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:44,358
That's because I can't relax.

1131
00:51:44,987 --> 00:51:48,058
On stage, my contact lens came off, and it was stuck here.

1132
00:51:48,487 --> 00:51:50,898
I acted for another five minutes without being able to take it off.

1133
00:51:50,898 --> 00:51:51,898
Even though you knew?

1134
00:51:52,297 --> 00:51:54,197
I just can't. I can't think of anything else.

1135
00:51:54,628 --> 00:51:57,838
And usually when you get the lines wrong, you just go with it, right?

1136
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:00,108
- Yes. - After confronting the hero,

1137
00:52:00,108 --> 00:52:01,168
as I'm leaving I say,

1138
00:52:01,308 --> 00:52:03,578
“This shop’s going to become a mess!”

1139
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,378
Then I slam the door shut and leave.

1140
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:08,608
With accurate pronunciation and accurate vocalization,

1141
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:09,817
I shouted loudly,

1142
00:52:09,878 --> 00:52:13,447
“This shop’s going to becomamash!”

1143
00:52:13,648 --> 00:52:14,817
I slammed the door and left.

1144
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:17,018
I went out like that and sat down.

1145
00:52:17,018 --> 00:52:18,157
(Tragedy incurred by anxiety)

1146
00:52:18,518 --> 00:52:19,927
(Sighing)

1147
00:52:19,927 --> 00:52:20,958
Exactly.

1148
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:23,898
I think the viewers wouldn’t have expected it.

1149
00:52:24,128 --> 00:52:26,398
- Everything looks improvised. - That’s right for Jung Se.

1150
00:52:26,398 --> 00:52:27,967
But no matter how many times we film the same scene,

1151
00:52:27,967 --> 00:52:29,527
he sticks to the same thing.

1152
00:52:29,527 --> 00:52:33,708
Jung Se must be the type to prepare a lot in advance.

1153
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:35,967
I can never act the same way twice.

1154
00:52:36,438 --> 00:52:38,708
We both can’t even remember how we acted before,

1155
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:40,248
so how can we act the same way?

1156
00:52:40,248 --> 00:52:41,808
(Humble)

1157
00:52:41,978 --> 00:52:43,217
The directors ask,

1158
00:52:43,217 --> 00:52:45,378
“Would you like to go once more?”

1159
00:52:45,378 --> 00:52:47,788
I barely managed to act the scene out without messing up the lines,

1160
00:52:47,788 --> 00:52:48,817
and if I were to do it again...

1161
00:52:48,987 --> 00:52:50,458
- Me too! - Gosh.

1162
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:54,088
I forget the lines the moment they give an okay.

1163
00:52:54,387 --> 00:52:56,858
In the drama “New Heart”,

1164
00:52:57,628 --> 00:53:00,297
I’m the chief of thoracic surgery, so I perform surgeries.

1165
00:53:00,527 --> 00:53:03,268
I need to shout, “Gauze!” And wipe away the blood.

1166
00:53:03,268 --> 00:53:04,737
But after I performed suction,

1167
00:53:05,067 --> 00:53:06,708
- I couldn’t remember the gauze. - I see.

1168
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:07,967
But it's an urgent scene.

1169
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,438
Did you shout something like "tissue"?

1170
00:53:09,438 --> 00:53:10,608
“Cotton swab!”

1171
00:53:10,608 --> 00:53:12,978
(Cotton swab!)

1172
00:53:12,978 --> 00:53:15,007
The director said, “Cut!"

1173
00:53:15,347 --> 00:53:18,317
"Dong Il, cotton swab’s too much.” “What was it?”

1174
00:53:18,447 --> 00:53:20,547
“Gauze.” “Right, I’m sorry.”

1175
00:53:20,547 --> 00:53:21,547
Cotton swab!

1176
00:53:21,547 --> 00:53:24,288
“I’m sorry, what was the line? I’m sorry.” I was supposed to say that.

1177
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:26,257
- You’re in thoracic surgery, - “Cotton swab!”

1178
00:53:26,257 --> 00:53:27,657
and you shout for a cotton swab!

1179
00:53:27,657 --> 00:53:28,958
I said, “So it wasn’t a cotton swab as expected.”

1180
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,328
That was so funny.

1181
00:53:30,328 --> 00:53:31,697
(They are heading to the restaurant while recollecting memories.)

1182
00:53:32,157 --> 00:53:34,027
Hold on. Hold on, please.

1183
00:53:34,027 --> 00:53:36,197
Let’s set it up. Hold the bottom.

1184
00:53:36,467 --> 00:53:37,967
Place it right next to it.

1185
00:53:37,967 --> 00:53:39,838
- There. - Okay.

1186
00:53:40,938 --> 00:53:42,538
- Like this. - If we do this...

1187
00:53:47,547 --> 00:53:48,808
- All done, right? - Yes.

1188
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:50,047
(Since Dong Il’s not there, Hee Won acts as the eldest!)

1189
00:53:51,248 --> 00:53:52,617
This is fine.

1190
00:53:52,617 --> 00:53:54,047
(This is perfect!)

1191
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,117
Right?

1192
00:53:55,217 --> 00:53:57,217
I want to fly the drone!

1193
00:53:57,858 --> 00:53:59,358
I want to try flying the drone!

1194
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:00,728
But you can't.

1195
00:54:01,288 --> 00:54:03,998
But I really want to fly the drone.

1196
00:54:03,998 --> 00:54:05,027
(Si Wan’s only thinking of the drone.)

1197
00:54:05,628 --> 00:54:07,398
- Should I try once more? - Try what?

1198
00:54:07,398 --> 00:54:08,697
The drone.

1199
00:54:08,697 --> 00:54:11,137
(He hasn’t given up on flying the drone yet!)

1200
00:54:15,067 --> 00:54:17,538
- The light’s on! - Really?

1201
00:54:18,108 --> 00:54:19,478
Okay.

1202
00:54:19,478 --> 00:54:21,447
(The youngest got his hopes up, )

1203
00:54:22,248 --> 00:54:24,947
(and Hee Won is tired from setting up the house.)

1204
00:54:26,078 --> 00:54:28,518
(Shall I try flying it?)

1205
00:54:32,257 --> 00:54:33,657
It’s making some sound.

1206
00:54:35,058 --> 00:54:36,498
(Stretch)

1207
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:38,097
That's strange.

1208
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:43,067
(He glances at Si Wan once, )

1209
00:54:43,067 --> 00:54:44,168
(then at the drone once.)

1210
00:54:44,168 --> 00:54:46,367
After it beeps,

1211
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:49,777
the propeller should start spinning.

1212
00:54:49,777 --> 00:54:51,007
If it doesn't...

1213
00:54:51,108 --> 00:54:52,237
(Spinning)

1214
00:54:52,578 --> 00:54:54,648
- Look! It worked! - It's spinning!

1215
00:54:55,748 --> 00:54:57,947
- I'll give it a go. - Try flying it.

1216
00:54:59,717 --> 00:55:02,887
- Goodness! - Amazing!

1217
00:55:06,588 --> 00:55:09,328
(Si Wan's dream is finally flying!)

1218
00:55:09,328 --> 00:55:10,597
Okay!

1219
00:55:14,867 --> 00:55:19,297
(The drone that was flung to the ground in the morning...)

1220
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:23,578
(is now flying freely in the sky!)

1221
00:55:24,438 --> 00:55:25,978
(It's finally flying!)

1222
00:55:25,978 --> 00:55:27,478
It's working!

1223
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:32,148
(Nimble)

1224
00:55:32,217 --> 00:55:33,617
Do you see it moving sideways?

1225
00:55:33,617 --> 00:55:36,347
Yes. Is that how you move it sideways?

1226
00:55:36,347 --> 00:55:38,987
- I'll land it first. - Make it fly to this side.

1227
00:55:38,987 --> 00:55:41,228
I don't know how to do that!

1228
00:55:41,228 --> 00:55:42,858
- Make it come here. - Forward!

1229
00:55:42,858 --> 00:55:44,157
I don't know how!

1230
00:55:44,157 --> 00:55:45,628
This side.

1231
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:49,628
- It keeps going that way. - I don't know how to control it.

1232
00:55:49,797 --> 00:55:53,338
Can't you move the controller this way?

1233
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:55,838
I see!

1234
00:55:55,967 --> 00:55:57,237
Okay!

1235
00:55:57,237 --> 00:55:58,407
(Si Wan's getting used to the drone!)

1236
00:55:58,407 --> 00:56:00,248
It's coming here! Move back.

1237
00:56:00,248 --> 00:56:02,347
- Make it stop. - Move forward.

1238
00:56:02,478 --> 00:56:03,978
Did you see it spin?

1239
00:56:03,978 --> 00:56:06,717
- How did you make it spin? - Like this.

1240
00:56:07,347 --> 00:56:08,547
(Spinning)

1241
00:56:08,547 --> 00:56:09,617
Like this.

1242
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:12,288
Make it land here.

1243
00:56:12,288 --> 00:56:13,427
Okay.

1244
00:56:14,257 --> 00:56:16,958
Can you lower it? That's right.

1245
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:17,958
(Successful landing)

1246
00:56:18,097 --> 00:56:19,867
How did you turn it off?

1247
00:56:19,867 --> 00:56:21,297
- How do you turn it off? - I just lowered it.

1248
00:56:21,297 --> 00:56:23,398
Did the propellers stop spinning once it landed?

1249
00:56:23,398 --> 00:56:27,668
- Now, I'll connect it to my phone. - Yes.

1250
00:56:27,907 --> 00:56:29,838
- You can film it with a camera? - Yes.

1251
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:31,237
Gosh.

1252
00:56:33,378 --> 00:56:34,608
If that's the case...

1253
00:56:35,478 --> 00:56:38,117
(Remote control without its owner)

1254
00:56:38,447 --> 00:56:39,578
(He's connecting to his phone.)

1255
00:56:39,578 --> 00:56:41,418
Look, it's connected to my phone.

1256
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,987
- It's connected. - What's this?

1257
00:56:43,987 --> 00:56:45,858
- Pardon? - This.

1258
00:56:45,858 --> 00:56:47,427
- Yes? - Is this that?

1259
00:56:47,427 --> 00:56:48,987
What is this?

1260
00:56:48,987 --> 00:56:51,157
What is this?

1261
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,628
- You need to first... - Yes.

1262
00:56:52,628 --> 00:56:54,597
Communicate with it.

1263
00:56:54,597 --> 00:56:56,467
- I see. - Let me show you.

1264
00:56:56,467 --> 00:56:58,168
For the sides,

1265
00:56:58,867 --> 00:57:01,907
I think I moved them like this.

1266
00:57:01,967 --> 00:57:05,378
Left, right, this is going forward,

1267
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:08,108
- and this is backward. - Wait, how?

1268
00:57:08,608 --> 00:57:10,248
- You need to try it first. - Like this?

1269
00:57:10,817 --> 00:57:12,648
- It's working! - It's working, right?

1270
00:57:12,648 --> 00:57:14,148
- It's going up! - It's going up now.

1271
00:57:14,148 --> 00:57:16,188
That's right!

1272
00:57:16,188 --> 00:57:18,188
(He successfully communicates with the drone at once!)

1273
00:57:19,188 --> 00:57:20,328
(He continues to look up without stopping.)

1274
00:57:20,328 --> 00:57:22,288
It's up!

1275
00:57:23,157 --> 00:57:24,597
But what do I do now?

1276
00:57:25,828 --> 00:57:28,067
(Reversing)

1277
00:57:28,128 --> 00:57:29,197
Forward.

1278
00:57:29,197 --> 00:57:30,998
- Hold on. Careful! - This is bad!

1279
00:57:30,998 --> 00:57:32,367
(They both spring up from their seats.)

1280
00:57:33,168 --> 00:57:34,168
(Risky)

1281
00:57:34,168 --> 00:57:36,268
It needs to go up. Forward.

1282
00:57:37,007 --> 00:57:39,137
This isn't it. This way, the opposite side.

1283
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:41,878
And this.

1284
00:57:41,878 --> 00:57:42,978
(The drone is slowly widening its radius of action.)

1285
00:57:44,547 --> 00:57:46,578
Camera, I need to see the camera.

1286
00:57:48,648 --> 00:57:50,958
Hold on.

1287
00:57:51,418 --> 00:57:52,858
It's going up. Hey!

1288
00:57:53,117 --> 00:57:54,558
Hee Won, no!

1289
00:57:54,987 --> 00:57:56,387
- Wait! - Hold on!

1290
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:58,458
(Flying to the side)

1291
00:57:58,757 --> 00:58:00,467
- Wait! - Hold on! Where's it going?

1292
00:58:00,467 --> 00:58:03,168
Hold on, where's it going? Trees!

1293
00:58:03,168 --> 00:58:04,967
- Try to control it. - Where's it going?

1294
00:58:04,967 --> 00:58:06,438
Where's it going? Trees!

1295
00:58:06,438 --> 00:58:08,308
- The opposite. - Hold on!

1296
00:58:08,608 --> 00:58:09,708
My goodness!

1297
00:58:09,867 --> 00:58:11,708
Hold on, sir!

1298
00:58:11,907 --> 00:58:14,478
Wait, sir!

1299
00:58:14,478 --> 00:58:16,347
- Where's it going? - It's not stopping!

1300
00:58:16,347 --> 00:58:19,677
(I'm getting off work first!)

1301
00:58:22,148 --> 00:58:24,117
It went too far!

1302
00:58:25,558 --> 00:58:27,858
Goodness, what's that?

1303
00:58:27,858 --> 00:58:30,197
Hee Won, it's gone!

1304
00:58:30,297 --> 00:58:32,898
- My goodness. - It went too far!

1305
00:58:32,898 --> 00:58:35,768
- Is it not working? - It's gone, I don't know.

1306
00:58:35,967 --> 00:58:38,637
Where did it fly to? Can we go find it?

1307
00:58:38,938 --> 00:58:41,067
- Maybe? - Should we go find it?

1308
00:58:41,737 --> 00:58:44,578
- I wonder where it is. - Let's bring the remote control...

1309
00:58:44,578 --> 00:58:47,047
- and go there. - Yes, let's go.

1310
00:58:48,407 --> 00:58:49,907
My goodness.

1311
00:58:50,478 --> 00:58:52,947
You need to...

1312
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:54,418
- Okay. - check if there's any sound.

1313
00:58:54,748 --> 00:58:57,117
- With this, okay. - I'll try to check the camera.

1314
00:58:57,788 --> 00:58:59,987
It beeped!

1315
00:58:59,987 --> 00:59:02,088
(Beeping)

1316
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:03,958
- It's a car. - It's not the drone.

1317
00:59:06,228 --> 00:59:07,328
Wait!

1318
00:59:08,797 --> 00:59:10,697
- I didn't touch anything. - I see.

1319
00:59:11,398 --> 00:59:12,567
It's the sound of an animal.

1320
00:59:14,407 --> 00:59:16,808
(They're sensitive to various sounds in the forest.)

1321
00:59:17,907 --> 00:59:19,538
(Let me see.)

1322
00:59:20,148 --> 00:59:22,208
(If it's stuck in a tree, )

1323
00:59:23,547 --> 00:59:25,518
(which tree would it be stuck in?)

1324
00:59:25,518 --> 00:59:27,117
I think it's stuck somewhere.

1325
00:59:28,918 --> 00:59:31,518
It should be somewhere around here, right?

1326
00:59:31,518 --> 00:59:34,128
- It didn't fly that far. - But isn't this too near?

1327
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:36,998
It didn't fly that far.

1328
00:59:39,297 --> 00:59:42,067
(Continuous beeping)

1329
00:59:43,867 --> 00:59:46,597
(He continues to press the button hoping for any signal.)

1330
00:59:46,597 --> 00:59:48,038
There's no sign of it.

1331
00:59:51,108 --> 00:59:54,748
(What if we really can't find it?)

1332
00:59:56,447 --> 00:59:59,447
(The youngest walks deeper into the forest.)

1333
01:00:00,547 --> 01:00:03,558
(Feeling sorry)

1334
01:00:04,317 --> 01:00:06,688
- The recording. - Yes.

1335
01:00:06,927 --> 01:00:09,688
From the last recording, we can check if it shows the sky...

1336
01:00:09,688 --> 01:00:12,228
or the ground, right?

1337
01:00:12,228 --> 01:00:14,398
I couldn't record it.

1338
01:00:14,728 --> 01:00:17,297
- I see. - I just connected it,

1339
01:00:17,297 --> 01:00:20,237
and was turning on the application,

1340
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,168
then this tragedy happened.

1341
01:00:22,168 --> 01:00:23,838
It disappeared even before it's connected?

1342
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:24,907
That's right.

1343
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:30,117
(Sighing)

1344
01:00:31,547 --> 01:00:34,588
(He can't meet Si Wan's eyes because he feels sorry.)

1345
01:00:35,288 --> 01:00:36,788
I think it's gone.

1346
01:00:36,788 --> 01:00:38,358
(Let's give up now, Si Wan.)

1347
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,128
- We must return. - Goodness.

1348
01:00:40,927 --> 01:00:45,257
(Meanwhile, what is Team Guryongpo doing?)

1349
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:48,067
- Hyo Jin! - Hyo Jin's passing by!

1350
01:00:48,067 --> 01:00:49,427
Cheer up today too!

1351
01:00:49,427 --> 01:00:51,067
- Cheer up! - Cheer up today too!

1352
01:00:51,067 --> 01:00:52,567
You work hard!

1353
01:00:54,208 --> 01:00:57,338
We should tell them to cook rice.

1354
01:00:57,538 --> 01:00:59,708
What if they don't have the rice ready?

1355
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:02,777
Hyo Jin, leave a text to Hee Won saying to have the rice cooked.

1356
01:01:02,777 --> 01:01:03,817
Got it.

1357
01:01:03,817 --> 01:01:08,088
(To Hee Won: We're still on the way, and Dong Il asked you to cook rice!)

1358
01:01:08,688 --> 01:01:10,858
(Ding)

1359
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:14,387
(We're still on the way, and Dong Il asked you to cook rice!)

1360
01:01:14,387 --> 01:01:16,858
- Hyo Jin just texted me. - Yes.

1361
01:01:16,858 --> 01:01:19,228
She says to cook rice.

1362
01:01:19,228 --> 01:01:20,367
Pardon?

1363
01:01:20,567 --> 01:01:22,367
Should I reply, "How dare you order us around?"

1364
01:01:24,998 --> 01:01:26,038
We're not in the mood to cook now.

1365
01:01:26,038 --> 01:01:28,067
I should send, "How dare you order us around?"

1366
01:01:28,067 --> 01:01:30,808
"Sorry, but we're not in the mood to cook."

1367
01:01:31,177 --> 01:01:32,277
Should I say that?

1368
01:01:33,277 --> 01:01:34,578
Should I say it like that?

1369
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:36,978
That we're not in the mood to cook?

1370
01:01:37,578 --> 01:01:41,248
(Laughing)

1371
01:01:41,918 --> 01:01:43,688
- I sent the message. - Okay.

1372
01:01:43,688 --> 01:01:45,157
He replied.

1373
01:01:45,257 --> 01:01:47,887
He says that they're not in the mood to cook.

1374
01:01:48,157 --> 01:01:49,788
(Laughing)

1375
01:01:49,788 --> 01:01:52,558
I should reply, "Then we'll eat out and go back."

1376
01:01:52,558 --> 01:01:53,967
(We'll eat out and go back.)

1377
01:01:54,398 --> 01:01:56,567
(Hyo Jin has a better comeback than Hee Won and Si Wan.)

1378
01:01:56,567 --> 01:01:58,168
And we actually eat out.

1379
01:01:58,168 --> 01:01:59,737
- Right. - We really eat out.

1380
01:02:00,407 --> 01:02:01,608
(Then we'll eat out and go back!)

1381
01:02:01,608 --> 01:02:03,168
"Then we'll eat out and go back."

1382
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:08,407
(They'll eat out?)

1383
01:02:08,777 --> 01:02:10,717
(Without us, )

1384
01:02:10,717 --> 01:02:13,688
(they'll eat out?)

1385
01:02:14,117 --> 01:02:16,817
(He wrecks his brain.)

1386
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:20,387
(Busy fingers)

1387
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:23,958
"I'm sorry, I'll cook."

1388
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:25,097
Did Hee Won say he'll cook?

1389
01:02:25,398 --> 01:02:27,197
But I'll leave it as unread.

1390
01:02:28,228 --> 01:02:29,467
I won't click on the message!

1391
01:02:29,898 --> 01:02:31,838
(Laughing)

1392
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:34,838
(Unread: I'm sorry, I'll cook.)

1393
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:38,507
(Did it not get through?)

1394
01:02:38,677 --> 01:02:40,277
(Ringing)

1395
01:02:40,277 --> 01:02:41,277
Exactly.

1396
01:02:42,177 --> 01:02:45,978
(The ring back tone resonates in the front yard.)

1397
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:49,047
She won't pick up. Why isn't she picking up?

1398
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:52,288
Is she not checking her phone?

1399
01:02:55,157 --> 01:02:56,228
We're here.

1400
01:02:56,527 --> 01:02:59,697
This town. My heart is fluttering.

1401

(Looking around)

1402
01:03:02,367 --> 01:03:03,367
I remember.

1403
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:04,797
- You're starting to recall, right? - Yes.

1404
01:03:05,237 --> 01:03:08,268
This area will be more familiar.

1405
01:03:08,268 --> 01:03:10,507
- Past this point. Right? - Yes, from here.

1406
01:03:10,838 --> 01:03:12,038
It's our town from here.

1407
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,708
Yes, it's our town from here.

1408

you've come back to your hometown after a long time.

They really find these places strangely well.

1451
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,538
- I know, right? - I think that's why the director...

1452
01:05:23,538 --> 01:05:24,777
was so set on filming it here even though it's far.

1453
01:05:25,478 --> 01:05:26,578
I see.

1454
01:05:28,407 --> 01:05:29,447
It's Dong Baek.

1455
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:32,177
- Was this street this short? - Yes.

1456
01:05:32,347 --> 01:05:33,378
It's shorter than you think, right?

1457
01:05:33,378 --> 01:05:34,387
Yes!

1458
01:05:34,387 --> 01:05:36,117
(As they reminisce while walking, )

1459
01:05:36,217 --> 01:05:37,717
(Camellia)

1460
01:05:37,987 --> 01:05:41,558
(Dong Baek's Camellia appears.)

1461
01:05:42,728 --> 01:05:45,757
(In the drama, )

1462
01:05:45,757 --> 01:05:48,398
(this is where Dong Baek works, )

1463
01:05:49,128 --> 01:05:53,737
(and where Dong Baek and Yong Sik love each other.)

1464
01:05:54,038 --> 01:05:55,168
You did it first.

1465
01:05:58,407 --> 01:06:01,507
(To Camellia which made us fluttered)

1466
01:06:01,847 --> 01:06:05,117
(Dong Baek's back again!)

1467
01:06:05,777 --> 01:06:07,887
- This is my house! - Dong Baek's house.

1468
01:06:07,887 --> 01:06:09,387
(This is my house!)

1469
01:06:10,347 --> 01:06:13,317
(They smile at the familiar sight.)

1470
01:06:13,688 --> 01:06:18,027
"Mr. No! Can't you repair the eaves?"

1471
01:06:18,027 --> 01:06:19,828
"I already repaired them."

1472
01:06:19,828 --> 01:06:22,168
- "I already did." - "Water leaks from there!"

1473
01:06:22,168 --> 01:06:24,567
"I already had them repaired, but it's still leaking."

1474
01:06:24,567 --> 01:06:26,168
"I'll speak with your wife."

1475
01:06:26,168 --> 01:06:27,208
"Don't do that."

1476
01:06:27,768 --> 01:06:29,367
"I'll speak with your wife."

1477
01:06:29,438 --> 01:06:30,578
"Hyang Mi!"

1478
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:33,078
"Hyang Mi, come out!"

1479
01:06:33,078 --> 01:06:34,378
(She's super excited.)

1480
01:06:34,478 --> 01:06:37,217
"Experience living as Dong Baek."

1481
01:06:37,217 --> 01:06:38,617
(Hyo Jin takes a close look.)

1482
01:06:38,748 --> 01:06:40,817
It's so amazing, everything's the same.

1483
01:06:41,947 --> 01:06:43,547
Is this the one?

1484
01:06:43,547 --> 01:06:46,317
(They walk in.)

1485
01:06:47,058 --> 01:06:49,558
- It's still the same! - They left the things as they are?

1486
01:06:49,558 --> 01:06:51,828
- They're the same. - Even the door's the same.

1487
01:06:52,097 --> 01:06:54,967
(Is this Dong Baek's store?)

1488
01:06:56,398 --> 01:06:59,268
(Hyo Jin's busy looking around.)

1489
01:06:59,268 --> 01:07:00,708
They have something like this.

1490
01:07:02,668 --> 01:07:05,007
We used to sit down here and film.

1491
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:06,978
That's right.

1492
01:07:07,407 --> 01:07:09,308
Gyu Tae's here too!

1493
01:07:09,308 --> 01:07:10,978
- No Gyu Tae's here too! - No Gyu Tae!

1494
01:07:12,018 --> 01:07:13,817
(It's in the same place for one and a half years.)

1495
01:07:13,817 --> 01:07:16,047
"No Gyu Tae, Yes Gyu Tae."

1496
01:07:16,047 --> 01:07:18,717
"He has a clearer heart than Ongsan crabs!"

1497
01:07:20,588 --> 01:07:23,527
"The worker who knows the people's heyday."

1498
01:07:23,588 --> 01:07:25,898
It was his dream to become a district head...

1499
01:07:25,898 --> 01:07:27,427
- in the drama. - In the drama.

1500
01:07:29,168 --> 01:07:30,898
Did you see this?

1501
01:07:31,197 --> 01:07:33,168
"Born in Ongsan in 1972."

1502
01:07:33,168 --> 01:07:35,808
"Married with Lawyer Hong in 2002."

1503
01:07:35,867 --> 01:07:38,708
"Successfully arrests Kabuli in 2019!"

1504
01:07:40,777 --> 01:07:41,807
- Isn't this made by the town? - Who made this?

1505
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,277
- Yes. - It's so funny.

1506
01:07:43,277 --> 01:07:45,277
The name of the party is "I'm A Man Party".

1507
01:07:45,578 --> 01:07:47,017
They say he lost the election.

1508
01:07:47,017 --> 01:07:48,418
(The town is stopped during the time when they filmed the drama.)

1509
01:07:48,617 --> 01:07:50,348
There's the famous one over there!

1510
01:07:50,348 --> 01:07:51,718
- What is it? - The stairs.

1511
01:07:53,218 --> 01:07:54,328
- I see. - Those stairs.

1512
01:07:54,328 --> 01:07:55,428
Where we shot for the poster.

1513
01:07:57,128 --> 01:07:58,958
- It's here! - Stairs?

1514
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:00,458
- Stairs. - Here.

1515
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:02,628
(These stairs that Hyo Jin led them to...)

1516
01:08:02,628 --> 01:08:03,628
It's here.

1517
01:08:06,338 --> 01:08:10,107
(allow you to see Guryongpo at once, )

1518
01:08:12,477 --> 01:08:15,048
(and it's the place where they shot for the poster...)

1519
01:08:15,048 --> 01:08:18,378
(of "When the Camellia Blooms".)

1520
01:08:19,918 --> 01:08:25,157
(The place is full of Hyo Jin's memories.)

1521
01:08:25,817 --> 01:08:27,588
It brings back memories, doesn't it?

1522
01:08:28,657 --> 01:08:29,788
I want to take photos.

1523
01:08:29,788 --> 01:08:31,557
Yes. Let's take photos!

1524
01:08:31,897 --> 01:08:32,958
Let's go up!

1525
01:08:32,958 --> 01:08:35,168
(Giggling)

1526
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:37,838
It really brings back memories.

1527
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:38,867
Right?

1528
01:08:39,767 --> 01:08:43,367
It was really hot, so we evacuated to film sometimes.

1529
01:08:43,367 --> 01:08:45,508
(Two of them are feeling a lot of mixed emotions from coming back.)

1530
01:08:46,477 --> 01:08:49,178
The view is really nice here.

1531
01:08:49,178 --> 01:08:50,578
It looks pretty when you look down!

1532
01:08:50,578 --> 01:08:53,718
(They get on top where Guryongpo can be seen at once.)

1533
01:08:54,517 --> 01:08:56,517
It's really nice coming here.

1534
01:08:56,517 --> 01:08:57,987
- Right? - Yes.

1535
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:02,557
Sit here. I want to take that photo in Ha Neul's place.

1536
01:09:02,557 --> 01:09:04,758
- Sure. - Sorry, Ha Neul.

1537
01:09:05,128 --> 01:09:06,828
I'm on this side, right? Come here.

1538
01:09:06,828 --> 01:09:07,828
(He wants to take a photo like the poster.)

1539
01:09:07,928 --> 01:09:10,697
- Can you help us take a photo? - Like this?

1540
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:12,498
- Your backs? - Yes.

1541
01:09:12,498 --> 01:09:14,107
(Should I take one like this?)

1542
01:09:15,008 --> 01:09:16,607
(Laughing)

1543
01:09:16,607 --> 01:09:18,078
Smile, Jung Se!

1544
01:09:18,437 --> 01:09:19,578
(Giggling nonstop)

1545
01:09:19,578 --> 01:09:20,647
Smile.

1546
01:09:22,178 --> 01:09:25,017
(Dong Baek and Mr. No Peanuts)

1547
01:09:25,378 --> 01:09:27,918
(They look pretty similar.)

1548
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:29,848
Hyo Jin, move aside.

1549
01:09:29,848 --> 01:09:32,218
You have to smile exactly the same at me!

1550
01:09:32,288 --> 01:09:33,357
Sit down.

1551
01:09:33,857 --> 01:09:35,027
(Awkwardly laughing)

1552
01:09:35,487 --> 01:09:37,557
(Breathing in)

1553
01:09:37,697 --> 01:09:39,157
It's pretty similar. I mean the looks.

1554
01:09:39,157 --> 01:09:40,798
It feels different!

1555
01:09:41,968 --> 01:09:43,128
Look into my eyes!

1556
01:09:45,138 --> 01:09:49,107
(Bromance blossomed from forced laughter)

1557
01:09:49,937 --> 01:09:51,878
- Look at me. Look into my eyes! - 1, 2, 3!

1558
01:09:51,878 --> 01:09:53,338
(Dong Il and Hyo Jin take a picture too.)

1559
01:09:53,907 --> 01:09:55,807
- We're natural! - Yes.

1560
01:09:55,807 --> 01:09:56,907
(They're laughing endlessly.)

1561
01:09:57,248 --> 01:09:58,578
- Isn't it nice here? - 1, 2, 3!

1562
01:09:58,578 --> 01:09:59,647
Yes.

1563
01:09:59,748 --> 01:10:01,147
1, 2, 3!

1564
01:10:04,088 --> 01:10:05,617
The weather's so cool.

1565
01:10:05,617 --> 01:10:06,617
The photos look pretty good.

1566
01:10:07,458 --> 01:10:09,328
- Your head is cut off! - Hey!

1567
01:10:09,588 --> 01:10:11,227
- It's Dong Il. - What is this?

1568
01:10:12,227 --> 01:10:15,628
Your natural pose. This is Hyo Jin.

1569
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:16,697
(This is Hyo Jin.)

1570
01:10:16,998 --> 01:10:19,638
I can't handle you.

1571
01:10:20,098 --> 01:10:21,737
Did you only take photos of my head?

1572
01:10:21,867 --> 01:10:22,937
I took one.

1573
01:10:22,937 --> 01:10:23,937
(There's a properly taken one too.)

1574
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:25,678
My goodness.

1575
01:10:26,477 --> 01:10:28,178
- Time flies, doesn't it? - Yes.

1576
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:31,117
I don't think I often went back to the places...

1577
01:10:31,117 --> 01:10:33,178
that I filmed dramas or movies.

1578
01:10:33,218 --> 01:10:36,388
I also never filmed a drama before...

1579
01:10:36,388 --> 01:10:37,918
- where we went to every corner... - It feels like a hometown.

1580
01:10:37,918 --> 01:10:39,288
Of the town to film.

1581
01:10:39,317 --> 01:10:40,317
Staying for a long time.

1582
01:10:40,317 --> 01:10:41,458
Normally, it's one scene in this town...

1583
01:10:41,458 --> 01:10:42,588
and another scene in that town.

1584
01:10:42,588 --> 01:10:45,027
So I didn't feel as attached.

1585
01:10:45,227 --> 01:10:48,168
But for this, the main stage was this town.

1586
01:10:48,168 --> 01:10:49,527
(It's the first time for her to film in one place for a long time.)

1587
01:10:49,527 --> 01:10:50,527
That's right.

1588
01:10:50,737 --> 01:10:54,267
(This town is special to Hyo Jin.)

1589
01:10:55,437 --> 01:10:58,838
(They went around the alleys to film.)

1590
01:10:59,477 --> 01:11:03,378
(6 months in Guryongpo)

1591
01:11:03,378 --> 01:11:07,548
When I left the town after the last shooting, it felt really strange.

1592
01:11:07,548 --> 01:11:08,817
Even though it was in the afternoon.

1593
01:11:09,647 --> 01:11:12,017
When we were filming for episode 16, I couldn't come in here.

1594
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:13,788
Because the crew was regulating the area.

1595
01:11:13,788 --> 01:11:15,258
- For other people. - Me!

1596
01:11:16,057 --> 01:11:17,657
They said, "We're filming here."

1597
01:11:18,027 --> 01:11:19,027
They didn't recognize him...

1598
01:11:19,027 --> 01:11:20,357
- when he filmed for 16 episodes. - The crew didn't recognize you?

1599
01:11:20,357 --> 01:11:23,027
My manager said, "He's an actor too."

1600
01:11:23,328 --> 01:11:25,237
And they said, "He can't enter even if he's an actor!"

1601
01:11:25,237 --> 01:11:27,168
(Firm)

1602
01:11:27,468 --> 01:11:28,737
(Laughing)

1603
01:11:28,737 --> 01:11:29,807
So I couldn't go in.

1604
01:11:30,538 --> 01:11:33,237
A few days ago, I went to shoot for another drama.

1605
01:11:33,237 --> 01:11:35,407
Someone came to say hi.

1606
01:11:35,407 --> 01:11:37,848
"I'm the one who regulated the area last time!"

1607
01:11:38,117 --> 01:11:39,578
- Really? - It was nice to see him again.

1608
01:11:39,578 --> 01:11:42,647
(Guryongpo indeed has a lot of memories.)

1609
01:11:42,788 --> 01:11:44,458
- Here. - Let's go now.

1610
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:45,958
- Shall we? - Since we're hungry.

1611
01:11:46,258 --> 01:11:48,057
- We made another memory. - Exactly.

1612
01:11:48,057 --> 01:11:49,657
I really made another memory.

1613
01:11:50,328 --> 01:11:54,867
(Leaving the alley to go to the restaurant)

1614
01:11:55,668 --> 01:11:57,598
This is the jjamppong restaurant!

1615
01:11:58,367 --> 01:12:02,107
Hot dogs! We ate a lot of those too.

1616
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:04,777
(Looking wistful)

1617
01:12:05,777 --> 01:12:10,678
(Among the restaurants they often went to, )

1618
01:12:11,718 --> 01:12:16,388
(they're heading to the one they were sad to miss.)

1619
01:12:17,187 --> 01:12:18,588
There's the restaurant.

1620
01:12:19,117 --> 01:12:20,157
Right there.

1621
01:12:20,718 --> 01:12:22,428
- It's closed. - Go straight.

1622
01:12:22,428 --> 01:12:24,197
- Why did they close? - It's their day off.

1623
01:12:25,098 --> 01:12:27,298
(But the lights are on.)

1624
01:12:27,298 --> 01:12:28,767
- The lights are on. - Oh, are they?

1625
01:12:28,767 --> 01:12:29,897
Do you have a death wish?

1626
01:12:29,897 --> 01:12:31,538
(Being playful)

1627
01:12:31,998 --> 01:12:38,437
(This was filmed when temporary parking was permitted.)

1628
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:40,107
Wow, we're finally here.

1629
01:12:42,607 --> 01:12:44,378
(Looking inside)

1630
01:12:44,378 --> 01:12:46,248
- My goodness. - The owner is inside.

1631
01:12:46,248 --> 01:12:47,548
- He's inside? - Yes.

1632
01:12:47,888 --> 01:12:49,647
- Go ahead. - Hello.

1633
01:12:49,647 --> 01:12:50,647
Welcome.

1634
01:12:50,788 --> 01:12:52,758
- How have you been? - How have you been?

1635
01:12:52,758 --> 01:12:55,288
- It's been over a year, right? - Hello.

1636
01:12:55,288 --> 01:12:57,328
- It's so good to see you. - Likewise.

1637
01:12:58,057 --> 01:12:59,298
You've been well, right?

1638
01:12:59,298 --> 01:13:00,498
(Holding each other's hands tight)

1639
01:13:00,498 --> 01:13:02,867
- Are you crying? - Because it's so good to see you.

1640
01:13:02,867 --> 01:13:04,897
He really teared up.

1641
01:13:04,897 --> 01:13:06,397
(To him, Hyo Jin is like a daughter who came back home.)

1642
01:13:06,397 --> 01:13:09,107
- We're here to pack some food. - Okay, let's do that.

1643
01:13:09,107 --> 01:13:11,138
I told them your hairtail jjigae is really nice.

1644
01:13:11,138 --> 01:13:12,338
It is nice.

1645
01:13:12,477 --> 01:13:13,607
Hi, Jung Se.

1646
01:13:13,878 --> 01:13:15,807
- He's glad to see you. - Hello.

1647
01:13:15,807 --> 01:13:16,878
(He greets Jung Se warmly too.)

1648
01:13:16,878 --> 01:13:18,617
They kept telling me that your food is nice,

1649
01:13:18,617 --> 01:13:20,418
and they wanted to come again.

1650
01:13:20,418 --> 01:13:23,187
Their hairtail jjigae is nice. It's quite soupy.

1651
01:13:23,718 --> 01:13:27,157
There are two other members,

1652
01:13:27,157 --> 01:13:29,758
so we were wondering if we could pack the food.

1653
01:13:29,788 --> 01:13:32,998
(I'll make it extra delicious for my dear Dong Baek.)

1654
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:36,498
(Using fresh hairtail)

1655
01:13:36,727 --> 01:13:39,867
(Cutting them in big pieces)

1656
01:13:40,437 --> 01:13:43,208
(Added to their special broth)

1657
01:13:43,508 --> 01:13:47,008
(Adding doenjang and garlic to remove the odor)

1658
01:13:47,947 --> 01:13:51,848
(Add some pumpkin for more flavor.)

1659
01:13:53,718 --> 01:13:59,357
(The hairtail jjigae that Dong Baek loves)

1660
01:13:59,588 --> 01:14:00,987
- Wow. - Thank you.

1661
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:04,157
Stay healthy, sir. We'll come back again.

1662
01:14:04,157 --> 01:14:05,628
Okay, please come again.

1663
01:14:06,928 --> 01:14:10,498
The owner actually cried because he was so glad to see you.

1664
01:14:10,498 --> 01:14:12,237
- I know, he really cried. - He cried?

1665
01:14:12,237 --> 01:14:14,708
- He got teary-eyed. - Yes, he got teary.

1666
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:18,578
(Meanwhile, how are these two doing with the drone?)

1667
01:14:21,777 --> 01:14:23,147
I should delete the app.

1668
01:14:23,147 --> 01:14:24,678
(I should delete the drone app.)

1669
01:14:25,348 --> 01:14:27,117
(I'm sorry.)

1670
01:14:27,117 --> 01:14:30,117
I installed it only a few hours ago.

1671
01:14:30,117 --> 01:14:31,687
(He still has lingering feelings as he had to say goodbye too soon.)

1672
01:14:31,687 --> 01:14:34,657
(Hee Won is really sorry.)

1673
01:14:37,697 --> 01:14:38,958
I should make rice.

1674
01:14:38,958 --> 01:14:40,057
(Now that the drone is gone, I should just make rice.)

1675
01:14:40,758 --> 01:14:42,168
I should make rice.

1676
01:14:42,168 --> 01:14:43,767
(Glimpsing)

1677
01:14:44,598 --> 01:14:47,397
(He prepares dinner even before his lingering feelings are gone.)

1678
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:50,977
I'll wash my hands first.

1679
01:14:50,977 --> 01:14:53,477
(He washes his hands clean after a quick walk.)

1680
01:14:59,848 --> 01:15:02,187
(Rub-a-dub)

1681
01:15:04,418 --> 01:15:05,588
(Sighing)

1682
01:15:05,588 --> 01:15:07,357
How did it disappear in the blink of an eye?

1683
01:15:08,288 --> 01:15:10,328
I wish it comes back to our house...

1684
01:15:10,328 --> 01:15:11,657
like a miracle.

1685
01:15:12,357 --> 01:15:16,668
(I need to find it.)

1686
01:15:21,168 --> 01:15:24,878
(Walking on eggshells)

1687
01:15:27,407 --> 01:15:29,777
- Did you start cooking rice? - I'm on it right now.

1688
01:15:29,777 --> 01:15:30,977
(He hangs around Si Wan as he feels sorry.)

1689
01:15:31,748 --> 01:15:33,147
Did you wash the rice?

1690
01:15:33,147 --> 01:15:34,317
- You didn't, did you? - I need to wash it.

1691
01:15:34,748 --> 01:15:37,187
I'll wash it. I can do that.

1692
01:15:37,647 --> 01:15:39,687
(Surprised)

1693
01:15:39,687 --> 01:15:40,687
Where though?

1694
01:15:40,687 --> 01:15:43,157
Over there. I'll wash the rice. You can make something else.

1695
01:15:43,157 --> 01:15:44,598
What is it?

1696
01:15:44,598 --> 01:15:46,328
- Oh, that? - Yes, the spicy squid.

1697
01:15:46,328 --> 01:15:47,628
Should I do that? Okay.

1698
01:15:47,628 --> 01:15:51,067
(Hee Won is preparing dinner?)

1699
01:15:53,498 --> 01:15:55,437
Do I wash this three times?

1700
01:15:55,668 --> 01:15:56,968
Yes, three times is enough.

1701
01:15:56,968 --> 01:15:58,678
- Three times? - Yes.

1702
01:15:58,777 --> 01:15:59,907
It's done.

1703
01:15:59,907 --> 01:16:01,048
(He volunteers to prepare dinner.)

1704
01:16:03,248 --> 01:16:04,517
(He makes rice instead of Si Wan.)

1705
01:16:04,517 --> 01:16:06,178
Keep pressing it.

1706
01:16:06,178 --> 01:16:07,277
- Is it done? - Yes.

1707
01:16:08,218 --> 01:16:09,718
(Looking around)

1708
01:16:09,718 --> 01:16:12,617
- And... - You need to put this on.

1709
01:16:13,758 --> 01:16:15,357
You might get splattered on.

1710
01:16:15,357 --> 01:16:16,857
(Hee Won puts on the apron on Si Wan sweetly.)

1711
01:16:16,857 --> 01:16:18,727
Like this. Is it okay?

1712
01:16:19,598 --> 01:16:21,668
- There you go. - Thank you.

1713
01:16:21,668 --> 01:16:23,767
I'll tie it for you.

1714
01:16:23,767 --> 01:16:25,798
- It's perfect. - Thank you.

1715
01:16:25,798 --> 01:16:27,397
- It's perfect, right? - Yes.

1716
01:16:27,668 --> 01:16:29,008
What else should I do?

1717
01:16:29,267 --> 01:16:31,307
- What else? - Should I cut these?

1718
01:16:32,038 --> 01:16:33,178
How small should I chop them?

1719
01:16:33,178 --> 01:16:35,607
Just chop them long.

1720
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:37,848
- Yes, you can chop like that. - Like this?

1721
01:16:38,977 --> 01:16:40,048
(What?)

1722
01:16:40,447 --> 01:16:42,848
(Rolling)

1723
01:16:43,248 --> 01:16:45,788
(Clearing his throat)

1724
01:16:46,487 --> 01:16:48,657
(Falling)

1725
01:16:48,657 --> 01:16:50,128
My goodness.

1726
01:16:50,328 --> 01:16:52,758
- That's good enough. - Right?

1727
01:16:52,758 --> 01:16:54,328
- Right? They don't have to... - Yes.

1728
01:16:54,328 --> 01:16:56,328
(Hee Won finds it difficult to chop onions.)

1729
01:16:56,928 --> 01:16:58,767
They'll get smushed anyway.

1730
01:16:58,767 --> 01:17:00,338
(Si Wan is cutting squid with scissors again.)

1731
01:17:00,638 --> 01:17:04,008
(Cutting the body with scissors)

1732
01:17:04,107 --> 01:17:08,107
(Separating innards with scissors)

1733
01:17:08,147 --> 01:17:11,617
(Removing eyes with scissors)

1734
01:17:12,777 --> 01:17:14,017
(The scissors master assistant chef)

1735
01:17:14,017 --> 01:17:16,017
Are these small enough?

1736
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:18,157
It needs to be smaller than that.

1737
01:17:20,718 --> 01:17:22,157
(Rolling)

1738
01:17:22,157 --> 01:17:23,888
(Rolling)

1739
01:17:24,088 --> 01:17:25,628
- Using a caldron lid... - What?

1740
01:17:25,628 --> 01:17:27,227
(The vegetables fall when Hee Won tries to chop them.)

1741
01:17:27,798 --> 01:17:29,168
Why do they keep falling?

1742
01:17:29,168 --> 01:17:30,767
(In the meantime, Si Wan is cutting the second squid.)

1743
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:34,737
(Cutting open the head slightly)

1744
01:17:34,737 --> 01:17:39,708
(He perfectly removes the bone.)

1745
01:17:40,407 --> 01:17:43,807
(He's even skilled in cutting squid, which is really difficult!)

1746
01:17:44,647 --> 01:17:45,878
It's done.

1747
01:17:45,918 --> 01:17:48,048
- I'm done. - Thank you. Yes, it's done.

1748
01:17:48,048 --> 01:17:50,248
Now, you can take a break.

1749
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:52,817
I can finish it in no time thanks to you.

1750
01:17:53,117 --> 01:17:54,987
What else do you need me to do?

1751
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:57,187
It's all done. Now, I need to...

1752
01:17:57,557 --> 01:18:01,397
make seasoning and mix it with the squid.

1753
01:18:01,397 --> 01:18:03,067
(Si Wan's recipe of seasoning: Red chili pepper powder, )

1754
01:18:03,067 --> 01:18:04,767
(soy sauce for seasoning, cooking wine, crushed garlic)

1755
01:18:05,298 --> 01:18:08,338
(Thanks to Hee Won, he finishes making the seasoning in no time.)

1756
01:18:09,567 --> 01:18:11,977
I hope it'll be delicious.

1757
01:18:13,138 --> 01:18:15,477
(Clattering)

1758
01:18:16,307 --> 01:18:20,218
(He works hard without resting at all.)

1759
01:18:20,878 --> 01:18:24,187
Hee Won, do you want to taste the seasoning?

1760
01:18:24,718 --> 01:18:26,388
- Can you? - But I won't be of much help.

1761
01:18:28,057 --> 01:18:30,928
(The seasoning looks delicious already.)

1762
01:18:30,928 --> 01:18:32,197
Should we cook it?

1763
01:18:32,258 --> 01:18:34,567
It'd be much better if we do, right?

1764
01:18:34,567 --> 01:18:35,828
- Yes, let's just cook it. - Right?

1765
01:18:36,498 --> 01:18:37,897
- Should I put it here? - Yes.

1766
01:18:37,897 --> 01:18:42,838
(Safely filmed with the permission of a landowner)

1767
01:18:42,838 --> 01:18:43,937
It's all set.

1768
01:18:44,267 --> 01:18:45,777
I only need to stir it like this, right?

1769
01:18:45,777 --> 01:18:46,977
(Hee Won even makes scallion oil for Si Wan.)

1770
01:18:47,838 --> 01:18:50,508
Can you put in the pork belly now?

1771
01:18:50,508 --> 01:18:51,918
- Should I put it in? - Yes.

1772
01:18:51,918 --> 01:18:53,777
- Don't put it all in. - How much should I put in?

1773
01:18:53,878 --> 01:18:57,958
I think you can put in about two-thirds of it.

1774
01:18:57,958 --> 01:18:59,388
- Two-thirds? - Yes.

1775
01:19:00,788 --> 01:19:02,958
Isn't this much two-thirds?

1776
01:19:03,628 --> 01:19:05,098
I think so.

1777
01:19:05,258 --> 01:19:06,527
- Right? - Yes.

1778
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:09,527
I think it'll be delicious.

1779
01:19:09,697 --> 01:19:11,838
- You think so? - Yes, I think it'll be delicious.

1780
01:19:11,838 --> 01:19:13,168
I hope it will be.

1781
01:19:13,168 --> 01:19:15,208
It's not even burning.

1782
01:19:15,838 --> 01:19:17,807
- Oh, yes! - It's being cooked well.

1783
01:19:18,407 --> 01:19:21,777
(Putting the seasoned squid that Si Wan made)

1784
01:19:21,777 --> 01:19:24,078
I hope it'll be delicious.

1785
01:19:25,647 --> 01:19:27,078
You need to say the magic words.

1786
01:19:27,078 --> 01:19:28,147
(He adds it while wishing that the members will like it.)

1787
01:19:28,147 --> 01:19:30,487
- You need to mix it, right? - Yes.

1788
01:19:30,548 --> 01:19:31,958
So that it gets seasoned too.

1789
01:19:35,458 --> 01:19:37,357
(Pleased)

1790
01:19:38,428 --> 01:19:39,727
It's hot. Don't use your hands.

1791
01:19:39,727 --> 01:19:40,758
(He's so sweet.)

1792
01:19:42,168 --> 01:19:44,168
- It looks delicious, doesn't it? - I know.

1793
01:19:44,168 --> 01:19:45,197
Seriously.

1794
01:19:46,998 --> 01:19:51,477
(The meat is looking glossy amid the smoke.)

1795
01:19:53,937 --> 01:19:55,977
My, I mixed it really well.

1796
01:19:56,548 --> 01:19:58,678
It was a good idea to add scallions.

1797
01:19:58,678 --> 01:20:00,017
- Really? - It looks more colorful.

1798
01:20:00,017 --> 01:20:01,078
(The squid and pork belly are well-seasoned in red seasoning.)

1799
01:20:01,078 --> 01:20:02,088
The heat is perfect.

1800
01:20:03,888 --> 01:20:06,317
(Shall I give it a try?)

1801
01:20:07,788 --> 01:20:09,057
How is it? Is it good?

1802
01:20:09,687 --> 01:20:12,057
- I think it's pretty good. - Is it? Then we're done.

1803
01:20:12,057 --> 01:20:15,227
It smells delicious already.

1804
01:20:16,498 --> 01:20:19,168
How you're mixing it with the paddles...

1805
01:20:19,937 --> 01:20:24,038
seems like a seller mixing food at a market.

1806
01:20:24,038 --> 01:20:25,237
Then I'd ask for a taste and try it on the spot.

1807
01:20:25,237 --> 01:20:26,338
(Impressed)

1808
01:20:27,038 --> 01:20:31,277
(The guardian angel of today's dinner)

1809
01:20:32,418 --> 01:20:33,447
(The members arrive just in time.)

1810
01:20:33,447 --> 01:20:35,517
- They're coming. - They're finally here.

1811
01:20:35,517 --> 01:20:37,088
- Right when we were done. - I know.

1812
01:20:37,718 --> 01:20:39,857
- You must've waited for long. - We're here!

1813
01:20:39,888 --> 01:20:41,428
- Yes. Dong Il. - Yes.

1814
01:20:41,428 --> 01:20:43,157
You'll be totally surprised.

1815
01:20:43,157 --> 01:20:44,328
- Why? - Why?

1816
01:20:44,328 --> 01:20:45,928
We made spicy squid and pork belly.

1817
01:20:45,928 --> 01:20:47,357
- Really? - Yes.

1818
01:20:48,897 --> 01:20:50,027
- They really did. - What?

1819
01:20:50,027 --> 01:20:52,098
We made spicy squid and pork belly!

1820
01:20:52,437 --> 01:20:54,267
It looks absolutely amazing.

1821
01:20:54,267 --> 01:20:55,567
My goodness.

1822
01:20:56,367 --> 01:20:57,607
Wow, this is...

1823
01:20:57,607 --> 01:20:59,708
(This is amazing.)

1824
01:20:59,708 --> 01:21:01,708
I thought you'd be sleeping.

1825
01:21:02,508 --> 01:21:03,678
Wow, is this it?

1826
01:21:03,678 --> 01:21:05,078
- This is... - Let's put it here.

1827
01:21:05,548 --> 01:21:07,848
This is the jjigae that Hyo Jin's been wanting to eat.

1828
01:21:07,848 --> 01:21:09,088
(The hairtail jjigae that Hyo Jin's been wanting to eat)

1829
01:21:09,355 --> 01:21:11,326
- Did you make rice too? - What?

1830
01:21:11,486 --> 01:21:13,086
- It's done already. - They already did.

1831
01:21:13,086 --> 01:21:14,725
(The rice is done already.)

1832
01:21:14,725 --> 01:21:17,025
- We already made it. - 4, 5...

1833
01:21:17,225 --> 01:21:20,225
He's not someone we can underestimate.

1834
01:21:20,326 --> 01:21:22,836
Let's sit down. Let's sit.

1835
01:21:22,996 --> 01:21:25,366
Let's have this while the jjigae comes to a boil.

1836
01:21:25,366 --> 01:21:26,605
Si Wan, come over here.

1837
01:21:26,605 --> 01:21:29,336
You guys worked hard. I told them to buy kkwabaegi that you like.

1838
01:21:29,336 --> 01:21:31,236
- Wow. - It looks so good.

1839
01:21:31,236 --> 01:21:32,246
Try it.

1840
01:21:33,605 --> 01:21:35,315
(Having a big bite)

1841
01:21:37,175 --> 01:21:38,616
I like that they didn't sprinkle sugar on it.

1842
01:21:38,616 --> 01:21:41,015
- Hee Won, you did well. - Yes?

1843
01:21:41,185 --> 01:21:43,385
I didn't do much.

1844
01:21:45,126 --> 01:21:46,225
What did you get?

1845
01:21:46,626 --> 01:21:48,225
The doughnut is so good.

1846
01:21:48,225 --> 01:21:49,256
(I like the one with sugar.)

1847
01:21:49,656 --> 01:21:51,696
(It's good.)

1848
01:21:52,666 --> 01:21:56,435
(Jung Se is waiting for Dong Il to give him one.)

1849
01:21:56,435 --> 01:21:58,965
- Here, Jung Se. - Thank you.

1850
01:22:02,275 --> 01:22:05,345
(It's delicious.)

1851
01:22:05,876 --> 01:22:07,246
It's very chewy.

1852
01:22:07,246 --> 01:22:10,645
(Chewy and delicious kkwabaegi and doughnuts)

1853
01:22:11,116 --> 01:22:14,515
We told you we'd eat outside, but you prepared this for us.

1854
01:22:15,116 --> 01:22:17,656
Pork belly looks so good because they're thin.

1855
01:22:17,656 --> 01:22:19,326
I know. It is good.

1856
01:22:19,525 --> 01:22:22,525
- Hee Won is no ordinary person. - Right.

1857
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:24,725
I think it's boiling now.

1858
01:22:24,725 --> 01:22:27,296
I know. It's just starting to steam.

1859
01:22:27,296 --> 01:22:29,336
(Revealing the hairtail jjigae)

1860
01:22:29,336 --> 01:22:31,036
What's that?

1861
01:22:31,666 --> 01:22:34,065
(The smell attracts them as soon as it's uncovered.)

1862
01:22:34,065 --> 01:22:35,675
- Wow, what's that? - It's all cooked.

1863
01:22:35,706 --> 01:22:37,336
Anything with fish is good.

1864
01:22:37,336 --> 01:22:38,675
Be careful, it's hot.

1865
01:22:40,046 --> 01:22:41,576
Some more? Is it good?

1866
01:22:41,775 --> 01:22:43,515
- It must be spicy. - It is.

1867
01:22:43,645 --> 01:22:45,385
- Is it all done? Let's eat now. - All right.

1868
01:22:45,385 --> 01:22:48,086
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1869
01:22:48,715 --> 01:22:51,826
(A hearty meal that was prepared faster than any other meals)

1870
01:22:52,756 --> 01:22:55,725
(The spicy squid and pork belly that Si Wan and Hee Won prepared)

1871
01:22:56,256 --> 01:23:00,225
(The hairtail jjigae that Hyo Jin has been dying to have)

1872
01:23:00,796 --> 01:23:02,496
Try the spicy squid and pork belly.

1873
01:23:03,065 --> 01:23:04,465
It's a bit bland.

1874
01:23:05,435 --> 01:23:06,565
It's not bland at all.

1875
01:23:10,536 --> 01:23:12,906
What do you mean? It's delicious.

1876
01:23:12,906 --> 01:23:15,416
- Really? - He's indeed good.

1877
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:16,645
(That's a relief.)

1878
01:23:17,246 --> 01:23:18,416
Try one, Dong Il.

1879
01:23:18,416 --> 01:23:21,345
(Jung Se quietly tries the squid.)

1880
01:23:21,345 --> 01:23:23,055
(He approves of it.)

1881
01:23:23,355 --> 01:23:24,925
- How is it, Jung Se? - It's good.

1882
01:23:24,925 --> 01:23:26,055
- Is it? - Yes.

1883
01:23:26,185 --> 01:23:28,296
- It's really good. - Describe it.

1884
01:23:28,296 --> 01:23:29,296
(Curious)

1885
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:32,196
It tastes like you bought it from somewhere.

1886
01:23:32,326 --> 01:23:34,425
What? It tastes like it's not burnt?

1887
01:23:34,425 --> 01:23:35,696
No, it tastes like you bought it from somewhere.

1888
01:23:35,696 --> 01:23:38,536
Oh, you mean you can't believe we made it? That's right.

1889
01:23:39,236 --> 01:23:41,635
(He can't help but smile.)

1890
01:23:41,635 --> 01:23:45,046
When you make food while camping, they tend to get too salty or bland.

1891
01:23:45,046 --> 01:23:47,805
But this tastes like the ones sold in restaurants.

1892
01:23:48,975 --> 01:23:50,315
(They're both pleased.)

1893
01:23:50,315 --> 01:23:51,345
Let's try it.

1894
01:23:52,616 --> 01:23:55,416
It's so good when it's wrapped with bean leaves.

1895
01:23:55,416 --> 01:23:56,656
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1896
01:23:57,385 --> 01:24:00,355
(Hyo Jin gulps it down as it's so good.)

1897
01:24:00,355 --> 01:24:02,496
The spicy squid and pork belly is really nice.

1898
01:24:02,496 --> 01:24:03,826
Really?

1899
01:24:03,826 --> 01:24:05,025
(Even the main chef Dong Il approves of its taste.)

1900
01:24:05,025 --> 01:24:06,166
It's good.

1901
01:24:06,425 --> 01:24:08,095
It's so good.

1902
01:24:08,265 --> 01:24:11,095
It is shockingly good. The spicy squid and pork belly.

1903
01:24:11,095 --> 01:24:13,206
(How would the hairtail jjigae taste?)

1904
01:24:13,206 --> 01:24:14,236
It's really good.

1905
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:16,790
- We still haven't tried the jjigae. - Oh, right. We should...

1906
01:24:17,721 --> 01:24:19,191
I'm really curious how it'll taste.

1907
01:24:20,361 --> 01:24:22,160
Can you get the hairtail meat for him?

1908
01:24:22,361 --> 01:24:24,130
- The hairtail? - The hairtail meat.

1909
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:25,761
This one is hairtail.

1910
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:30,271
(He adds rice to it and takes a big bite.)

1911
01:24:31,471 --> 01:24:32,471
- Hee Won. - Yes.

1912
01:24:32,471 --> 01:24:34,070
- Try the jjigae. - Wow.

1913
01:24:34,841 --> 01:24:36,540
- What is it? - The hairtail jjigae is...

1914
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:38,511
- It's so good. - The hairtail jjigae?

1915
01:24:38,511 --> 01:24:39,880
- Yes. - Here, Jung Se.

1916
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:41,141
Wow, it's so refreshing.

1917
01:24:41,141 --> 01:24:42,181
(I told you it's delicious, right?)

1918
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:44,920
How is it so spicy and good?

1919
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,080
I love this level of spiciness.

1920
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,080
Really?

1921
01:24:48,851 --> 01:24:50,391
(Dong Il who likes spicy food has a bite.)

1922
01:24:50,391 --> 01:24:52,790
- Is it good? - It's really good.

1923
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:55,761
I'd order it to eat at home if they do delivery.

1924
01:24:55,761 --> 01:24:57,731
Really? But it's in Pohang.

1925
01:24:57,731 --> 01:24:59,160
This is just...

1926
01:24:59,601 --> 01:25:01,870
The restaurant is right next to the seaside.

1927
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:03,101
- I see. - It's so good.

1928
01:25:04,370 --> 01:25:07,670
How come it's not salty?

1929
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:10,841
- Right? - And it's also...

1930
01:25:10,841 --> 01:25:12,210
not fishy at all.

1931
01:25:13,011 --> 01:25:15,051
- It's not fishy. - Right.

1932
01:25:15,051 --> 01:25:16,481
It tastes really deep.

1933
01:25:16,481 --> 01:25:18,580
(Refreshing and spicy seasoning added to fresh hairtail)

1934
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:21,021
- That's how it tastes. - Yes, that's how it tastes.

1935
01:25:21,021 --> 01:25:23,651
How is it, Hyo Jin? Does it taste the same as it used to?

1936
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:25,891
I think it's even more delicious.

1937
01:25:26,361 --> 01:25:28,490
- Here. Si Wan. - I can handle this much.

1938
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,990
- Have some hairtail. - That's enough.

1939
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:33,231
Today's dinner is amazing.

1940
01:25:33,231 --> 01:25:35,670
- Thank you. - You made it really well.

1941
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:38,301
Hee Won, have some onions.

1942
01:25:38,301 --> 01:25:40,170
Onions? I've had enough.

1943
01:25:41,101 --> 01:25:42,511
(Laughing)

1944
01:25:42,511 --> 01:25:44,841
Bring it here. Actually, smaller hairtail...

1945
01:25:44,841 --> 01:25:47,380
is more delicious.

1946
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:48,551
(Staring)

1947
01:25:48,551 --> 01:25:49,910
- Do you not like hairtail? - No.

1948
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,780
- You want me to scoop it for you? - Yes.

1949
01:25:53,021 --> 01:25:54,151
Oh, really?

1950
01:25:55,391 --> 01:25:56,950
(I want your love too.)

1951
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:58,051
You're funny.

1952
01:25:58,761 --> 01:26:00,160
You should scoop your own soup now!

1953
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:02,290
- Should I? - I scooped the fish for you.

1954
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:03,761
I thought you'd do it for me.

1955
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,130
(Laughing)

1956
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:11,431
Jung Se looks more comfortable...

1957
01:26:11,431 --> 01:26:13,370
than yesterday, doesn't he?

1958
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:15,611
- Hey, I'm sorry, - Yes?

1959
01:26:16,011 --> 01:26:17,841
- but could you bring some rice? - No.

1960
01:26:18,011 --> 01:26:19,141
No?

1961
01:26:19,141 --> 01:26:20,341
(Laughing)

1962
01:26:20,341 --> 01:26:21,811
Here. Take it.

1963
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:24,750
Do you want a lot?

1964
01:26:25,021 --> 01:26:27,481
Just half the bowl. It's really delicious.

1965
01:26:27,481 --> 01:26:29,290
(Today's dinner was really good.)

1966
01:26:29,591 --> 01:26:31,820
The ocean looks nice,

1967
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:34,561
and the mountains look nice too.

1968
01:26:34,561 --> 01:26:37,431
- It's nice. - It's nice because it's not windy.

1969
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:41,160
Every meal here is nice.

1970
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:44,801
Jung Se, you should take it. You should stand in front.

1971
01:26:44,801 --> 01:26:46,170
- You want me to take it? - Yes, you take it.

1972
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:47,240
How should I...

1973
01:26:47,301 --> 01:26:48,341
(How should I take it?)

1974
01:26:48,341 --> 01:26:50,141
- You should take it. - Come here.

1975
01:26:50,370 --> 01:26:52,080
Can you take it upside down?

1976
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,941
- I have no idea. - Are you taking it sideways?

1977
01:26:53,941 --> 01:26:55,450
Isn't it upside down?

1978
01:26:56,111 --> 01:26:57,380
Are you sure we're in it?

1979
01:26:57,950 --> 01:26:59,320
I have no idea.

1980
01:26:59,521 --> 01:27:01,021
1, 2, 3.

1981
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:06,191
You should go to that restaurant from time to time with Jung Se.

1982
01:27:06,191 --> 01:27:08,021
- Right? You're right. - Yes.

1983
01:27:08,021 --> 01:27:10,891
That village is so heartwarming.

1984
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:14,361
(Doesn't it feel like we should put roof tiles?)

1985
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,870
(The House on Wheels' new front yard, )

1986
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:18,200
(Gyeongju Yangdong Folk Village's back hill)

1987
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:20,740
(There are hanoks along the mountain ridge.)

1988
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:23,941
(Filling this quiet and still place is...)

1989
01:27:23,941 --> 01:27:25,080
(Laughing)

1990
01:27:26,141 --> 01:27:28,551
(A guest who will fill the place with a hearty laugh is coming.)

1991
01:27:29,181 --> 01:27:31,981
(The guest with the most energy, Actress Oh Na Ra)

1992
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:34,651
(You're really full of energy.)

1993
01:27:34,651 --> 01:27:36,691
You might think I'd die out soon, but I'm energetic all the way.

1994
01:27:36,691 --> 01:27:38,420
(I'm energetic all the way.)

1995
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,261
(You'll get tired soon.)

1996
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:44,191
(The House on Wheels is especially loud today.)

1997
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:46,160
It must take after the guest. Why is it being loud as well?

1998
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:48,570
(The House on Wheels became loud just like the guest?)

1999
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,170
(Dancing)

2000
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:51,771
(Not only Dong Il...)

2001
01:27:51,771 --> 01:27:52,801
(It's exciting!)

2002
01:27:52,801 --> 01:27:54,471
(but Hee Won is also excited.)

2003
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:57,111
(Na Ra's positive energy spread to Si Wan as well.)

2004
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:00,981
(What events are awaiting in the excited House on Wheels?)
