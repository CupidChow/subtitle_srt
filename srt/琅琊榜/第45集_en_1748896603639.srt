00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 14

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What are you talking about?

3
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm the most similar prince to you.

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In fact,

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
after you used Princess Linglong,

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
the destruction of the city was not enough.

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You should have killed that prince.

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's called

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
the end of the world.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The end of the eternal world.

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Do you think he's smart enough?

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He's smart enough.

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Mingyu,

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you're crazy.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Who told you that?

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Who?

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In this world,

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I have nothing to say about the defeat of the city king.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Father, you don't have to be so serious.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's good to be a witness.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's good to be a rebel.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's good to be a criminal.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll bear all the crimes.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But if you still treat me as your son,

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
then I just want to ask you one thing.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Please answer me personally.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Is my mother

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
a fairy

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
or Princess Linglong of the Hua Clan?

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Your Majesty.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Your Majesty.

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Your Majesty.

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This should be the last time

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
we've talked about our son.

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Can't you tell me the truth?

36
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Princess Linglong.

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Indeed.

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
She once led the Hua Clan's army

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
to help me

40
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and the throne.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But this woman

42
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
is too smart.

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
She's too dangerous.

44
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
She and the Hua Clan

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
have a secret

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
in this world.

47
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The door is open to the public.

48
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Call 999-4466.

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I can't hide it.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I can only choose

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
to let her and the Hua Clan

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
disappear together.

54
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If this matter is as it is today,

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
then I'll

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
have the same choice

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
as you.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Right?

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't you have any

60
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
stupidity to treat her?

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Son.

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're a noble wife.

63
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're a noble wife.

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If it's useless,

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
you should be willing to

66
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
let the person who

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
is going to be in the next life

68
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to be my wife?

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What am I?

70
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What am I?

71
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The little wife of the wife?

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Jing Huan.

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Before the Hua Clan

74
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
was in the throne,

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
they had already destroyed the country.

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Jing Huan.

77
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're my fifth son.

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Your mother.

79
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Your mother is Xiang Pin.

80
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Do you know that?

81
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Your Majesty.

82
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Your Majesty.

83
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm sorry

84
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
for my mother's death.

85
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No one

88
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
is allowed to enter!

89
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes.

90
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Your Majesty.

91
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Jing Huan.

92
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're defeated.

93
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You're defeated.

94
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Your Majesty.

95
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Mother.

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Please

97
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
beg His Highness for mercy.

98
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Please save him.

99
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I can't keep my life.

100
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What can I do?

101
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Please insist on

102
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
leading the army to Jiu'an Mountain.

103
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Once you're caught,

104
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
you can't go back to heaven.

105
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You'll be punished.

106
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This book

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
is full of lies.

108
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Mother.

109
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Jing Huan is

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
his own son.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He won't kill him.

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Right?

113
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Right?

114
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Mother.

115
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Was it Xiao Jing Yu

116
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
who was the King of Qi?

117
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
shoes.

118
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
25,000 people were killed

119
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,200
in ngishuan,

120
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,300
Free army and

121
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
einfach soldiers were killed

122
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
in mountain识.

123
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
They were beheaded in army.

124
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We were,,,

125
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,500
a crime in ignorance.

126
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
sheriff's case or

127
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,900
I'll take the blame for my revenge.

128
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,300
I'll kill you.

129
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,460
I should have punished you.

130
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,300
But the soldiers are just obedient.

131
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,420
They don't know what's going on.

132
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,180
Please forgive me.

133
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,940
I'll not punish you.

134
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,420
What are you talking about?

135
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,460
Those rebels

136
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,060
have already beaten me.

137
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,100
If I can let go of this crime,

138
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,060
I won't be able to kill the world.

139
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,860
I just didn't kill Zhu Lian.

140
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,980
I'm already grateful.

141
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,200
est

142
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,340
Xu Anmu, I'm a duke

143
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,180
who will be able tochosun.

144
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,900
So the military will question me.

145
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,980
And

146
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,620
Manyitch German예요

147
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,380
antes

148
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,100
unreal

149
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,340
Military

150
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,460
。

151
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,440
Please review, And

152
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,800
Unter

153
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
preparing

154
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
Please think twice.

155
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
This is reasonable.

156
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
Get up.

157
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,820
Get up.

158
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,820
Thank you, Your Majesty.

159
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
Since it is so,

160
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
we can spare the death penalty.

161
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
But the rebel army

162
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
must not let go.

163
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Now it seems that

164
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,820
Prince Yu left the capital

165
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
and did such a big thing.

166
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,820
Now there is no news

167
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,820
from the capital.

168
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,820
So if the empress

169
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
is not controlled by her,

170
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,820
she is in the same boat with her.

171
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
The capital is still in the army.

172
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
I don't believe they will betray His Majesty.

173
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,820
They must be controlled.

174
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
As long as I go back,

175
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
I will help His Majesty

176
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
to regain control of the capital.

177
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,820
I think so.

178
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,820
Meng Qing, bring 100,000 soldiers

179
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
and get out of the city.

180
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,820
Go to Jinling.

181
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,820
Yes.

182
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,820
Take the empress's birthday

183
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,820
and take me to the capital.

184
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Yes.

185
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,820
I heard that there is news

186
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
about the change in Mount Jiuan.

187
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,820
I was really scared.

188
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,820
I was afraid that

189
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
my brother would be hurt.

190
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,820
I thought about it later.

191
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,820
My brother is in the mountain

192
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
and he is in a bad situation.

193
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
I should be afraid

194
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
of Prince Yu and Xia.

195
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,820
Actually, I don't care about the key.

196
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,820
As long as I see the Yuan army

197
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
in three days,

198
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
I will be fine.

199
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,820
Actually, there is a needle and a fly

200
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
around you.

201
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,820
I don't need to be so nervous.

202
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
Is she hurt badly?

203
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
She is not.

204
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
She is your biological father.

205
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,820
Yes.

206
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
She is also your biological father.

207
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,820
Yes.

208
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
She is the subordinate of Jiang Zuo Meng.

209
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,820
I didn't ask her to come.

210
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
She left the capital and got into the army.

211
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,820
I didn't know that.

212
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Actually, there is a subordinate like her

213
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
who is good to you.

214
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
After all, the needle and the fly

215
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
are men.

216
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
They can do anything.

217
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
But to take care of you,

218
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,820
there is a woman who is careful around you.

219
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
I am also worried.

220
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
She didn't take care of me.

221
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
She is the female version of the costume

222
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
standing in front of me.

223
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,820
Standing?

224
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
OK.

225
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,820
From now on, you will be responsible

226
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
for your account.

227
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
Zhan Ying.

228
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,820
Your Highness.

229
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
Why are you still awake?

230
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
I just got rid of the needle.

231
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
I am fine.

232
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,820
Have all the servants come?

233
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Yes.

234
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
Where is Mr. Su?

235
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
Mr. Su is in the east room.

236
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,820
He has fallen asleep.

237
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,820
He must be tired these days.

238
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,820
His Highness is still in the room.

239
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
He needs to discuss something.

240
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,820
Commander.

241
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
The night is close to the guard.

242
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,820
Take care of the jade king.

243
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,820
Take the search and return to the capital.

244
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,820
Once you catch the fire,

245
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,820
report to me immediately.

246
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,820
Yes.

247
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,820
Your Highness.

248
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
We have the medicine.

249
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,820
The medicine.

250
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,820
Take it alone.

251
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,820
Don't scold him.

252
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,820
Let him live in the capital.

253
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
Yes.

254
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,820
The servants are all from our Prince Jing's family.

255
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,820
Don't worry.

256
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,820
What did he say?

257
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,820
He said that Prince Yu lied to him.

258
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,820
He really thinks that Prince Jing is trying to rebel.

259
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
It seems that he didn't want to get out of the palace

260
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
and keep Prince Yu.

261
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
He is so polite.

262
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
He has no feelings for him.

263
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,820
By the way,

264
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Father has given me a look at the confession of Xia Jiang.

265
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
I think His Majesty will not believe

266
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
the confession of Xia Jiang.

267
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,820
I have a look at it.

268
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,820
Most of it is true.

269
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,820
It's not a fake.

270
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,820
But I can't understand it.

271
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,820
He said so many things.

272
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,820
Why did he insist that you are the Prince of Qi?

273
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
He is so stubborn.

274
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,820
He will make people think

275
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
that he is a dog and a chicken.

276
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,820
Xia Jiang should not be so stupid.

277
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,820
He is not stupid.

278
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
I made him do it myself.

279
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,820
You made him do it?

280
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,820
Prince of Qi has always been a word in his heart.

281
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,820
He has a lot of expectations for you.

282
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,820
I said that he was the old man of Prince of Qi

283
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,820
to make him angry and make him feel uneasy.

284
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
After a while,

285
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,820
Ji Tuo made it easy for him to get out of the war.

286
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,820
So it is.

287
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
Be careful.

288
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,820
Don't bite the door.

289
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,820
Be careful.

290
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
Be careful.

291
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,820
Your Highness.

292
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,820
Be careful.

293
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,820
You are caught.

294
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Catch.

295
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Your Highness.

296
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,820
We caught him.

297
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,820
I know that you caught the drug.

298
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,820
Zhan Yin has said it.

299
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
No.

300
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,820
It is not the drug.

301
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,820
It is the monster.

302
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
We caught that monster.

303
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,820
Congratulations.

304
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,820
You caught him for more than a year.

305
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,820
Your Highness.

306
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,820
That monster looks like a person.

307
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,820
He is locked up in the cage.

308
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
Your Highness, why don't you go and see?

309
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,820
I want to see.

310
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,820
Your Highness, can you allow me to leave?

311
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,820
I can't.

312
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,820
Please.

313
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,820
Please.

314
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,820
I want to see.

315
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,820
Please.

316
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,820
Chief.

317
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Be careful.

318
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,820
He is really fierce.

319
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,820
Don't be too close.

320
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Chief.

321
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,820
Chief.

322
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,820
Don't come here.

323
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,820
What's going on?

324
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,820
Your Highness.

325
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,820
Look, Mr. Su.

326
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,820
Don't be afraid.

327
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,820
I won't hurt you.

328
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,820
Can you bring your face up?

329
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,820
Let me see your face.

330
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,820
All right?

331
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,820
I will.

332
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,820
Let me see your face.

333
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,820
All right?

334
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,820
I know.

335
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,820
I know.

336
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,820
Trust me.

337
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,820
Everything will be all right.

338
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,820
Trust me.

339
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,820
If I am here,

340
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,820
everything will be all right.

341
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,820
Trust me.

342
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,820
No.

343
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,820
He is blind.

344
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,820
Mr. Su, get out of here.

345
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,820
He is blind.

346
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,820
He is blind.

347
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,820
He is blind.

348
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,820
Trust me.

349
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,820
If you are blind,

350
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,820
everything will be all right.

351
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,820
He won't hurt you.

352
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,820
But he has been holding on.

353
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,820
He didn't want to hurt me.

354
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,820
Open the cage.

355
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,820
Mr. Su.

356
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,820
I told you to open the cage.

357
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,820
This...

358
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,820
Your Highness.

359
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,820
Your Highness.

360
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,820
Please leave this person to me.

361
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,820
If it's not convenient here,

362
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,820
I can take him outside to hunt.

363
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,820
Since Mr. Su is so sure,

364
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,820
it's okay to stay here.

365
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,820
But be careful.

366
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

367
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,820
Open the cage.

368
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,820
Yes.

369
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,820
Your Highness.

370
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,820
Get out of here.

371
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,820
Follow me.

372
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,820
Come.

373
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,820
Your Highness.

374
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,820
Mr. Su didn't tell that blind man.

375
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,820
He just stopped comforting him.

376
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,820
He even took some medicine for him.

377
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,820
Now that person is quiet.

378
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,820
Mr. Su asked someone to bring him a bucket

379
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,820
and some hot water.

380
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,820
He said he would shower him with it.

381
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,820
Mr. Su and this blind man.

382
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,820
Mr. Su.

383
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,820
Mr. Su.

384
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,820
Mr. Su.

385
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,820
Mr. Su.

386
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,820
Mr. Su and this blind man.

387
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,820
What's the relationship between them?

388
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,820
And, Your Highness.

389
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,820
Mr. Su seems to have cut his own blood for him.

390
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
What?

391
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,820
He drank his own blood?

392
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,820
It seems that I didn't know him well.

393
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,820
Your Highness.

394
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,820
Your Highness.

395
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,820
You're so careless.

396
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,820
It's a white blood.

397
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,820
Your Highness.

398
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,820
It's a white blood.

399
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,820
What white blood?

400
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,820
That monster.

401
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,820
No.

402
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,820
That person.

403
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,820
He only knew when he was washed out.

404
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,820
His hair was all white.

405
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,820
I thought it was too dirty.

406
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,820
I thought it was a black hair.

407
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,820
Qi Meng.

408
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,820
What did you say to the things that are irrelevant to you?

409
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,820
Didn't you want to know?

410
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,820
What you want to know is not these.

411
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,820
You can leave first.

412
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,820
I won't tell you.

413
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,820
I'll ask someone else.

414
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,820
Your Highness.

415
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,820
Take the medicine.

416
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,820
Take this medicine.

417
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,820
I'm worried about what happened today.

418
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,820
Come and have a look.

419
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,820
Don't worry, brother.

420
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,820
No one saw me coming in.

421
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,820
I'm worried about what happened today.

422
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,820
Come and have a look.

423
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,820
Don't worry, brother.

424
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,820
No one saw me coming in.

425
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,820
Can I have a look at your bracelet?

426
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,820
I know it's Chi Yan Jun's bracelet.

427
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,820
It's engraved your name on it.

428
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,820
Your appearance has changed.

429
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,820
Your appearance has changed.

430
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,820
Your appearance has changed.

431
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,820
I want to confirm

432
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,820
if you are the person I often miss.

433
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
Nie Feng.

434
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
Nie Feng.

435
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
Nie Feng.

436
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,820
You are Nie Feng.

437
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,820
Nie Daga.

438
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,820
Nie Daga is dead.

439
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,820
Nie Daga.

440
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,820
I'm a little uncle.

441
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,820
I'm a little uncle.

442
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,820
Nie Daga.

443
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,820
Nie Daga.

444
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,820
Your Highness.

445
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,820
Mr. Su.

446
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,820
You are taking care of the patient in the room.

447
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,820
Why are you here?

448
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
You are so stubborn.

449
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,820
Why are you so polite?

450
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,820
Get up.

451
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,820
Please forgive me.

452
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,820
I hope you are well.

453
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,820
I'll do my best to do it.

454
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,820
Get up.

455
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,820
I'm sorry.

456
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,820
Your Highness.

457
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,820
Your Highness.

458
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,820
Please cure a patient for me.

459
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,820
The patient in your room?

460
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,820
Yes.

461
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,820
It's better to get a doctor

462
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,820
than to get a patient.

463
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,820
His condition

464
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,820
can only be cured by Your Highness.

465
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,820
It's late night.

466
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,820
Tomorrow.

467
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,820
I'll ask my mother

468
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,820
if she will come.

469
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,820
I'll decide.

470
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

471
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,820
You are taking care of the patient?

472
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,820
Yes.

473
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,820
I see.

474
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,820
Wait a minute.

475
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,820
I'll get the medicine.

476
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,820
Your Highness.

477
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,820
Your Highness.

478
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,820
How is she?

479
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,820
Is she poisoned?

480
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,820
It's good.

481
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,820
She is not.

482
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,820
She is not in the third level.

483
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,820
I've been taking the medicine.

484
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,820
I can suppress her

485
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,820
for at least a few months.

486
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,820
The poison of the fire cold

487
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,820
is the least for the world.

488
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,820
Besides,

489
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,820
she is poisoned for too long.

490
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,820
My medicine

491
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,820
can't cure her.

492
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,820
I see.

493
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,820
Please give me the medicine.

494
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,820
Chief.

495
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,820
Chief.

496
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,820
Fei Liu.

497
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,820
This is the letter

498
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,820
from the Chief of the Sect.

499
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,820
Why did you take it back?

500
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,820
Hurry up.

501
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,820
Fei Liu.

502
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,820
Give it back to me.

503
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,820
I'm telling you.

504
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,820
Chief Li is right.

505
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:15,820
He won't bully you.

506
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:16,820
He won't bully you.

507
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,820
Don't pinch me.

508
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,820
You pinched my high-heeled.

509
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,820
You are a mother.

510
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,820
Mother.

511
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,820
Good boy.

512
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,820
Good boy.

513
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,820
I'll come back to see you.

514
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,820
I'm afraid you'll come back again.

515
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,820
All right.

516
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

517
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,820
The doctor is kind and kind.

518
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,820
Thank you.

519
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,820
Come.

520
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,820
You should know

521
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,820
the person who can cure this poison.

522
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,820
Yes.

523
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,820
I've written it down.

524
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,820
It's just that I'm going to the hospital.

525
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,820
I need to wait for some more days.

526
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,820
If there's anything wrong

527
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,820
before this,

528
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,820
just let me know.

529
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

530
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,820
I'm sorry for your illness.

531
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,820
I forgot you.

532
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,820
You and Mr. Su

533
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,820
don't look like the ones you know.

534
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,820
The most exciting game

535
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,820
on the online market

536
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,820
is the game of the four-wheeled car.

537
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,820
The horse is running.

538
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,820
The horse is running.

539
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,820
The horse is running.

540
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,820
Are you there?

541
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,820
What should we do?

542
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:43,100
One of the captain

543
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,180
is taking back a role on Play-In

544
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,300
They made his hand

545
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,300
and spread out to Goofy見てsighs Beufu.

546
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:49,460
Hooray

547
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,460
hurry up!

548
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,700
How are you going to be a Goofy lady?

549
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,780
A spirited horse.

550
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,780
I'll tell you later.

551
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,780
Mr. Su is actually the son of an old man.

552
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,780
I didn't know that before.

553
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,780
It's a great coincidence that we met.

554
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,780
An old man?

555
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,780
Yes.

556
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,780
An old man.

557
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,780
I'm still a little girl.

558
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,780
I followed my master's medical treatment

559
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,780
and was taken to the local hospital.

560
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:34,780
If I didn't have this old man to save me,

561
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,780
I'm afraid I would have died of a stroke.

562
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,780
So this is a savior?

563
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,780
Since Mr. Su is the son of a savior,

564
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,780
why did mother and Mr. Su

565
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,780
always mention this?

566
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:55,780
I only knew this after I met Consort Jing.

567
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,780
But...

568
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,780
There's nothing wrong with this old man.

569
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,780
Why didn't mother tell me?

570
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,780
I didn't mean to say it,

571
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,780
but I didn't want to say it.

572
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,780
After all, the past is a matter of life.

573
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,780
If you mention the past again,

574
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,780
you'll be sad.

575
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,780
What's the relationship between

576
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,780
Mr. Su and me?

577
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,780
He's my friend.

578
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,780
We met a long time ago.

579
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,780
Yes.

580
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,780
Mr. Su has been in the capital for two years.

581
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,780
He has only friends I don't know.

582
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,780
It's normal.

583
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,780
Okay.

584
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,780
Everything is normal.

585
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
I won't ask.

586
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,780
I'll go.

587
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,780
You still have a lot of worries.

588
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,780
I believe in mother and Mr. Su.

589
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,780
But you all have secrets.

590
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,780
I feel lonely.

591
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,780
You're on the road of loneliness.

592
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,780
The higher the road, the more lonely I feel.

593
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,780
I remember the past.

594
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,780
There's a brotherhood, a family, a friend.

595
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,780
Every day, I'm happy.

596
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,780
Jingyan.

597
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,780
You can only bear the burden of your heart.

598
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,780
I can't help you.

599
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,780
But I believe that one day,

600
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,780
when you look back,

601
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,780
you'll realize that

602
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:10,780
you have friends around you.

603
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,780
I'm sorry.

604
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,780
Luckily, you're not very lonely.

605
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,780
Don't worry about anything.

606
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,780
Just take a good rest.

607
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,780
Leave everything to me.

608
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,780
I know

609
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,780
you've worked hard.

610
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,780
From Meiling to the capital,

611
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,780
you've come to Jiuan Mountain.

612
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,780
You've been chased by the district.

613
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,780
You came to see Dongjie.

614
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,780
But he didn't come with you this time.

615
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,780
Don't worry.

616
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,780
When you're back to the capital,

617
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,780
I'll arrange for you to meet him as soon as possible.

618
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,780
Okay?

619
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,780
It's okay.

620
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,780
It's okay.

621
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,780
No matter what you look like,

622
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,780
Dongjie won't care.

623
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,780
As long as you're alive,

624
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,780
you'll be the greatest comfort to him.

625
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,780
The army of Chiyan Army is far away.

626
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,780
You're the only one who can survive.

627
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,780
We're destined to be together.

628
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,780
Vice-Chief,

629
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,780
as the general,

630
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,780
every person's life in the army

631
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,780
is on our side.

632
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,780
So we can't give up.

633
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,780
Everyone's hope

634
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,780
is to be with us.

635
00:39:43,780 --> 00:40:04,780
I'll take you to the comes К deuxième,

636
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,780
hang in there.

637
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,780
I'll pick him up.

638
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,580
Let's go.

639
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,420
Chief, where's the medicine?

640
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,980
Is there any other medicine?

641
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,740
Chief.

642
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,180
Brother Su.

643
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,780
Fei Liu, help Chief to lie down.

644
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,300
Go, Fei Liu.

645
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:26,940
Go and get someone.

646
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,580
Go.

647
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,060
Chief.

648
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,940
Snow.

649
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,900
Snow.

650
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,180
Snow.

651
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,420
Snow.

652
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,620
Snow.

653
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,460
Snow.

654
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,580
What's wrong?

655
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,660
Brother Su.

656
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,700
Zhen Ming.

657
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,660
Don't tell Nian Huang.

658
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,860
Don't let him come.

659
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,820
Okay.

660
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
Okay, I got it.

661
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,180
What's wrong?

662
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,580
Chief is going to be sick.

663
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,780
He's suffering.

664
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,140
Your Highness.

665
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,660
I'm fine.

666
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,020
I'm fine.

667
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,780
I'll go get Mother.

668
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,140
Brother Su.

669
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,140
Brother Su.

670
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,540
Father.

671
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,060
Father.

672
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,180
What did he say?

673
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,180
Mother.

674
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,180
He's finally stable.

675
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:27,180
He needs to be careful in the late night.

676
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,180
He's not stable.

677
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,180
He can't let him be on his own.

678
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,180
Xin Yan.

679
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,180
Don't be afraid.

680
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,180
Mother.
