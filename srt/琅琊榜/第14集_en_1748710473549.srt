1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
the

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
the

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
the

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
the

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
the

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
the

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
the

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
the

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,600
Didn't you want to kill me today?

16
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,120
If I want to kill you,

17
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,720
I should be in Xuanjing Temple.

18
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,960
Why do you have to come here to talk to me?

19
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,800
You have my arm.

20
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,480
But you want to see me.

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,280
How do I repay you?

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,680
Please stay what's at your side,

23
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,880
I beg you to forgive when I will beoperative.

24
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,680
Your grace,

25
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
without giving this deity day

26
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,840
any awards you won't be given.

27
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,640
But why won't you help me?

28
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,440
I want to know what you got.

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,120
How much do you want?

30
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,960
You don't forget Chen Fei for love.

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,840
You don't forget Ling Shuai for meaning.

32
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,480
Now there are too few people in this world

33
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,120
who have love in their hearts.

34
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,000
I can only have one.

35
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,800
You only remember that I have the right to

36
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,560
not to act recklessly.

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,840
I will deal with the black fire on the stage.

38
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,160
I'm afraid...

39
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,160
I'm afraid I'm not the secret

40
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,000
of you.

41
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,280
I didn't know that.

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
How I can do it?

43
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,680
In total, you have given me

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,680
a Kingdom

45
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,160
full of love in your heart,

46
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,820
except the Prince of Yu

47
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,740
while you even made a dark Finally pray

48
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,480
and afraid of who

49
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,500
I'm talking to

50
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,140
this is the not Horace

51
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,700
when Prince of Yu

52
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,440
rammed the Favor

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,620
遠送

54
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,000
If Prince of Yu

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,740
The Prince fell in love with the world

56
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,600
It is God playing

57
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,240
out the Mingろ

58
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,000
You're the best

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,040
Emperor

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,960
but he

61
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,560
He's as heartless and cruel as ever.

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,760
It's harder than

63
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,160
being separated from each other.

64
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,440
I know I'm the King of the Yu.

65
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't you think it's inappropriate?

66
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,680
I'm afraid I can't hide from you.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,880
Now you're sitting here,

68
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,800
you're the sword clan.

69
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
I'm the fish.

70
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,800
If you want to ruin my memory,

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,840
but

72
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
if you want to marry me,

73
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,480
don't worry,

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,880
I'll just ask.

75
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,960
As long as you don't move.

76
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,240
The first in the world, Yu Le Cheng 9994466.

77
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,960
Come on.

78
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,440
The most exciting game on the line.

79
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,800
The horse is running.

80
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,400
The horse is running.

81
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,920
The Queen of the Shangji.

82
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,680
The King of the Xunbao, Huang Jin Cheng.

83
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,680
The Golden Cat.

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,200
The Royal Priest of Shangji.

85
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,640
The Super Pei Lv.

86
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,640
The one with the most rewards.

87
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,480
The one with the most rewards.

88
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,800
Join us now.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,040
The Golden Cat.

90
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,000
The Yu Le Cheng 9994466.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,640
Come on.

92
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,400
I won't mention this.

93
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,520
Mr. Su.

94
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,200
I have a question.

95
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,760
If you're a good friend,

96
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,040
can you read an omniscient poem

97
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,640
with Mr. Su?

98
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,920
Can I ask for his life?

99
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,400
Thank you.

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,360
Bro Leng.

101
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,800
I took good care of Official Lingzun

102
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,000
He residues Zouni.

103
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,080
Now when it comes to the General Cavalry Clique this year,

104
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,720
he and you will stay together.

105
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,480
Thank you, Bro Leng.

106
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,760
It's a good day tomorrow.

107
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Mother's body is very colourful.

108
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,960
The doctor came and adjusted a prescription yesterday.

109
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,000
He said the pulse is very good.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,040
But why must he wait until the year-end

111
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
before he can wake up?

112
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
I don't know.

113
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
I don't know.

114
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
I can't tell you.

115
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
I'm not sure.

116
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
I don't know.

117
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
I don't know.

118
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
I don't know.

119
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
I don't know.

120
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
I don't know.

121
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
I don't know.

122
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
I don't know.

123
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
I don't know.

124
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Then he can wake up and walk.

125
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
Yes.

126
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Mother's illness

127
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
can be cured.

128
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
He even intentionally

129
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,320
recommended Consort Xu to bring the Empress

130
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
and seize the opportunity to sell the blame.

131
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
Mother's health is healthy.

132
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,320
It's a blessing.

133
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
I took the medicine today.

134
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Princess, you've worked hard.

135
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Your Highness,

136
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,520
we've done the thing about the monk.

137
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
We've found the right person.

138
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
It's a man of the past.

139
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,220
The

140
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,720
monk and the warm-hearted are similar.

141
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
He's been in jail for two days.

142
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
He can be dressed up.

143
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Wenyuan won't be able to see the war.

144
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Your Highness,

145
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
is it really necessary?

146
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,720
What can I do?

147
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,720
Who told He Jingzhong

148
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
that he's a treasure?

149
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I've helped him.

150
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Take him to the capital.

151
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Make him clean.

152
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
It smells like the truth.

153
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Lord He, please.

154
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,080
I...

155
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
You may leave.

156
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Lord He,

157
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,080
although he's not exactly the same,

158
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,080
he's still a man.

159
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Thank you, Lord Qi.

160
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
Lord He, what are you doing?

161
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
We're colleagues.

162
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Why do you need this?

163
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,760
Lord Qi,

164
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
you're my only son.

165
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
You're like my own parents.

166
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
This matter needs to be kept secret.

167
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
We can't let it go.

168
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
I know it's the new year in two days.

169
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
But we can't let Lord Ling

170
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,760
spend the New Year in the manor.

171
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,760
We must send him away as soon as possible.

172
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
The sooner, the better.

173
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
I'll listen to Lord Qi.

174
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,760
We must hurry.

175
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,760
I understand.

176
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,760
The New Year is coming.

177
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Is He Jingzhong's illness cured?

178
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,760
He's starting to work on his business.

179
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
The new year is the most busy time.

180
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,760
Lord Yu must have forced him to get up from the bed.

181
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
He's sick.

182
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
If he wants to force him to get up,

183
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,440
he must take a new medicine.

184
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
He Jingzhong's illness is cured.

185
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
He's busy with his business.

186
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Yes.

187
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,440
He's still in bed a few days ago.

188
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
He's been up all day.

189
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
Every year,

190
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,440
he becomes a former crown prince.

191
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
In such a short time,

192
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
he can't find the right person to help He Jingzhong.

193
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Maybe he'll let the Ministry of Health

194
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
to use some way

195
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
to make him stay with He Wenxin.

196
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
What can he do?

197
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
Can't he just let him in?

198
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
He can't change his true heart?

199
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
He really dares to do that?

200
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
He Jingzhong's illness is not innocent.

201
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Go and check it for me.

202
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,800
If Qi Ming really goes to the next round,

203
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
these two ministers

204
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,800
won't need me to do anything.

205
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
As long as we reveal the news to Xie Yu,

206
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
the Ministry of Health will naturally bring us

207
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
to the next round.

208
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
For a minister of power,

209
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Lord Yu has made such a move

210
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
to exchange the dead.

211
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,480
I should have him go in with another Ministry of Justice.

212
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,480
Qi Ming is hiding this.

213
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
We can see the truth.

214
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,480
He Jingzhong has taken He Wenxin out of the prison.

215
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
According to the truth,

216
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
he'll leave the city soon.

217
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
But I don't know why.

218
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
He's secretly taking back his power.

219
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,480
He Jingzhong's mother loves this grandson the most.

220
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,480
She probably wants to see him again.

221
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
That's good.

222
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
In order to save us some time,

223
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
we should call Wenyuanbo too.

224
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,480
As long as we can catch a county man in He's Manor,

225
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Lord Yu can't make it this year.

226
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Go, hurry up and leave.

227
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Father, I don't want to leave.

228
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
It's only been a few days.

229
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,480
Where are you taking me?

230
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,480
In order to protect my life, I can't leave.

231
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,480
I can't let you live in the manor

232
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,480
with the three of you.

233
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Go, hurry up and leave.

234
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
Lord He.

235
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
What are you doing?

236
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Where are you taking the son of the noble?

237
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
My lord.

238
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,480
My lord.

239
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Wenyuan, you've seen it.

240
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,480
How bold is the Ministry of Justice?

241
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
You should believe it.

242
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
Thank you, my lord.

243
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
If you didn't help me,

244
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,480
my son's revenge wouldn't have been successful.

245
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Wenyuanbo.

246
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Go, go to the palace with me and meet His Majesty.

247
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Go.

248
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Father.

249
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Go.

250
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
Father, save my father.

251
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,480
Father.

252
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
Jingrui, Jingrui.

253
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Yujin, did you hear me?

254
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
What did you hear?

255
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Do you remember the He Wenxin who killed the people in Yangluxin?

256
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
I remember.

257
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
He was sentenced to death in the prison.

258
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,480
His father is really good at the He Jingzhong.

259
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
He colluded with the Minister of Justice,

260
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,480
and found a man like He Wenxin.

261
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
He changed him.

262
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
That's impossible.

263
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,480
How is that impossible?

264
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,480
The Qi people are really bold.

265
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,480
I wonder if they've tried it before.

266
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Yujin,

267
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
it's all about the secret.

268
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
How did you know?

269
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,480
I don't know

270
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
what the Minister of Justice is like.

271
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Now,

272
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,480
all the people in the capital know about it.

273
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,480
What?

274
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
It's Xie Yu.

275
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
How did he know

276
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
that the He Jingzhong was so secretive?

277
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
How did he know that

278
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,480
it's not important anymore?

279
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Your Highness,

280
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,480
Wenyuanbo took the He Jingzhong to the palace.

281
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
At this moment,

282
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,480
all the imperial guards in the capital

283
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,480
are busy with writing my memorials.

284
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Your Highness,

285
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,480
you have to save me.

286
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
Xie Yu is so determined.

287
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Wenyuanbo also

288
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
took the He Jingzhong to the palace to report to the imperial court.

289
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,480
That's why

290
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,480
His Majesty is so thoughtful.

291
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
He can't do it.

292
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,480
It's said that

293
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
the imperial court is very important.

294
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
He's so thoughtful.

295
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
What's wrong with the imperial court?

296
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
How can he help His Majesty

297
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
to govern the world?

298
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,480
Is it all my fault?

299
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,480
The emperor is innocent.

300
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
As Yuan Qing,

301
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
Liu Qing,

302
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Yuan Zhuo, Liu Zhuo.

303
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Now, in the imperial court,

304
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,480
the people in the capital are being treated as a god.

305
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,480
The new emperor is being treated as a right.

306
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
It's not like that.

307
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
Who knows?

308
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
You're really a smart man.

309
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
I thought you were not good at politics.

310
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,480
But you're so thoughtful.

311
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Please accept my respect.

312
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
Don't play with me.

313
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,480
I didn't say that.

314
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
Is it Brother Su?

315
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,480
We used to have a chat

316
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480
in the wolf's den.

317
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
So I don't understand.

318
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,480
Since Brother Su is so thoughtful,

319
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
why did he choose to be the emperor?

320
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,480
He didn't have a choice.

321
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,480
How different is the crown prince and the prince?

322
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,480
Brother Su said that

323
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,480
he was a good man.

324
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,480
He's a good man.

325
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,480
He's a good man.

326
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
I think for Brother Su,

327
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
he's the most painful one.

328
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,480
He can't be a good man

329
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,480
to make him believe in the emperor.

330
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
Jingwei.

331
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
Brother Su,

332
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
he's not the one.

333
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,480
What?

334
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
I was wrong.

335
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
I was wrong.

336
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
You're so strange.

337
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
I don't think he's the real emperor.

338
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Why did you say that?

339
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
I just felt it.

340
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,480
I just won the debate.

341
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,480
Prince Yu was so proud.

342
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,480
I didn't expect Xie Yu

343
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,480
to use a core to cut off two walls.

344
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
But he really hurt me.

345
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
Prince Yu is too bad.

346
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
In the future,

347
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,480
the two-step study will be more lively.

348
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,480
But you came.

349
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Didn't you

350
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
crush Prince Yu?

351
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
Actually, the crown prince's best friend

352
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,480
is Xie Yu.

353
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,480
Brother,

354
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,480
you're going to deal with Xie Yu?

355
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
I've prepared it.

356
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,480
The crown prince and his son

357
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
will be rewarded

358
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,480
for their own good.

359
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Thank you, father.

360
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
Your Highness,

361
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
Fengtian Hall has been awarded for the year.

362
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
How is the share?

363
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,480
It's similar to the previous year.

364
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,480
The crown prince is the first one.

365
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,480
But the crown prince

366
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
is only two less

367
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
than him.

368
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,480
He's a pair of two-leaf and a pair of two-leaf beads.

369
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Compared to the other princes,

370
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
they're better than the others.

371
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Your Majesty,

372
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,480
you're so kind.

373
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Jinghuan is the king of seven beads.

374
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Of course, they're different.

375
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
This year,

376
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Prince Jing also won the crown.

377
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Since His Majesty has rewarded Prince Jing,

378
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
I can't let him down.

379
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
You can find

380
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
the one-leaf and a pair of two-leaf beads

381
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
and give it to Jingpin.

382
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480
Yes.

383
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
Your Highness, you're so kind.

384
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
The seven beads are different.

385
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
The empress

386
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,480
won't be able to come tonight.

387
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Your Highness,

388
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
do you want to change the five-leaf beads?

389
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
At this time,

390
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480
what's the point of making a fuss?

391
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Your Highness,

392
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
you're born with a good will.

393
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
Even if you pretend to be a dowry,

394
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,480
you can't see the other princes' eyes.

395
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
Besides,

396
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
if the crown prince is here,

397
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
why bother to be here?

398
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
In the future,

399
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
you can't take the crown.

400
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
You're still the one who knows how to do it.

401
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Let's get married.

402
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
Father, mother, father, mother.

403
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,480
I'm going to give the four princes a happy new year.

404
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
All right, all right.

405
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Get up.

406
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,480
Here you are.

407
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
Thank you, mother.

408
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,480
You're so kind to Jingrui.

409
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
But I have a red envelope for you.

410
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
I heard that you made a dress

411
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,480
for Jingrui on her birthday.

412
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm so relieved.

413
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
Brother,

414
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,480
I've been giving it to you for the past six months.

415
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
I don't have a red envelope for you.

416
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
No need.

417
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,480
You don't have a red envelope for her.

418
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
But

419
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
what's the deal

420
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
with the Han Xue Maju

421
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
that you've worked hard to bring to the capital?

422
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,480
I was going to show it to you tomorrow.

423
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
But now,

424
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
I've told you about it.

425
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
Really?

426
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,480
Thank you, brother Qingyao.

427
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
You must have been a good choice.

428
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
As long as you're here,

429
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
no one can see me.

430
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
As long as you like

431
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,480
what you have,

432
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
take it all.

433
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
Look,

434
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,480
I'm always like this.

435
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
I'm so embarrassed

436
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
to be jealous of him.

437
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,480
Second brother,

438
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,480
you know that

439
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
bullying me is a teacher's job.

440
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
When did we

441
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,480
miss your gift?

442
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,480
It's your birthday.

443
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,480
It's rare that they're so close.

444
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Father, mother,

445
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,480
uncle Zhuo, mother Zhuo.

446
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,480
I've been giving it to you for six months.

447
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Chief lass.

448
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,480
OK.

449
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
Like Heaven himself,

450
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
I had the marriage interested

451
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
in both Jia clan

452
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
and the不heenous masters

453
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
named after the Empress.

454
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,840
We had voted for the family

455
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,480
is also a great opportunity.

456
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Yu Jin,

457
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,480
do you think our Yan family is considered a good country?

458
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Of course it is.

459
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
But these generations of the Chongzhen hot blood,

460
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
how did they get to this point?

461
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
Father,

462
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,480
what's the meaning of this?

463
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Today's trip is over.

464
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Let's go.

465
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
Father.

466
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Are you going back to the room to rest?

467
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,480
Or to the single room to watch the single stove?

468
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
Today is the first day of the wedding.

469
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,480
Prepare some dishes.

470
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
We'll be in charge of the two of you.

471
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Okay.

472
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
I'll go get ready.

473
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
I love you.

474
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Okay.

475
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,480
Take it.

476
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
Fei Liu, you must be good today.

477
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
Okay.

478
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
Come.

479
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
I'll have a cup of night wine.

480
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,480
I wish you a long and safe trip.

481
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

482
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Doctor Yan.

483
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,480
Doctor Yan, I've been waiting for you.

484
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
Doctor Yan,

485
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
it's the New Year.

486
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Can't you be a little more filial?

487
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
You.

488
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,480
You know how to talk to others.

489
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,480
You should be the one to blame.

490
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,480
Yes.

491
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
I'll listen to you today.

492
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Whatever you say,

493
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
whatever it is.

494
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
Okay?

495
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
It's not too bad.

496
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
Have some dumplings.

497
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Have some dumplings.

498
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
Come.

499
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
I'll have some.

500
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
Have some dumplings.

501
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Come.

502
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,480
Come.

503
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
Okay.

504
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
I wish you a long and safe trip.

505
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Okay.

506
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

507
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Hurry up.

508
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
Doctor Yan, come.

509
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
It's delicious.

510
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,480
It's hot.

511
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Be careful.

512
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
It's delicious.

513
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Come.

514
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
Li Gang, come.

515
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
Your Majesty.

516
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,480
Have some more food this year.

517
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
I wish you a long and safe trip.

518
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Okay.

519
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
Okay.

520
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
Your Majesty.

521
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
It's almost time.

522
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
Oh, right.

523
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,480
I'll give you the order

524
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
to distribute the dishes to each of you.

525
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
Well...

526
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
Well...

527
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
I'll give it to Mother.

528
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Your Majesty.

529
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
The Mu's Mansion

530
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,480
was originally in the list of dishes.

531
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
I know.

532
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Mu's Mansion has a special bonus this year.

533
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
We'll give you more dishes.

534
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
Yes.

535
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
I'm here to tell you

536
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,480
how well you've spent at Mu's Mansion.

537
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,560
You need to teach me

538
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,480
to deliver the dishes I've made.

539
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
For recap,

540
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,560
have you got forty guilty

541
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,480
of your FR myself?

542
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
The details are perfect.

543
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,600
Thanks toasty

544
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,980
What a nice host

545
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,740
Sorry, I heard that company.

546
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,720
Go, go

547
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,720
It's time

548
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,700
I have a wrong idea

549
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,860
Also haven't got time

550
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,000
Ready

551
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,540
Vision

552
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:25,060
較老的附諸槃甩了,他們年輕人再一塊也可以自在心

553
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,840
是啊,热鬧了一日,這身子還真有些薄了

554
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,280
どう?

555
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,800
附 seven

556
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,520
附ять

557
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,840
這 Triple

558
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,340
來啦,再喊聽啊

559
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,620
The dishes are not here yet.

560
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,660
In the past,

561
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,220
they were all broken together.

562
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,100
Qingrui,

563
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,940
it's not like you're going to sleep.

564
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,100
I'll play the chess in the study room with your father.

565
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,900
Your mother must have a lot to say to Mrs. Zhuo.

566
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,740
Besides,

567
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,020
we four are old now.

568
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,980
You young people can be together.

569
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,060
Can't you be more confident?

570
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,500
It's better to think more.

571
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,380
Let's go.

572
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,660
I'll take you to see the Hanxi Maju.

573
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,260
Now?

574
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,340
Zhu Yu, now.

575
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:16,860
Let's go.

576
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,300
I'll go, too.

577
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,300
Mr. Zhuo, please.

578
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,100
Please.

579
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,620
Sister, let's go.

580
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,660
Pardon.

581
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,460
You've come home early,

582
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,660
and you're thinking of Antworting Your Raining.

583
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,820
Yu Jin,

584
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,700
we help each other.

585
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,900
It's the ceremony of the year.

586
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,700
Brother Su was doing it for the sake of the year.

587
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,420
What's wrong?

588
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,580
Father and I were in the same boat last night.

589
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,020
He told me everything.

590
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,980
Father has been ignoring me all these years.

591
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,620
As a person,

592
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,020
I can't find his whereabouts.

593
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,980
I'm afraid I can't talk about a filial son.

594
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,420
You can finally talk to each other.

595
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,620
It's a good thing.

596
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,900
Brother Su saved my Yan family.

597
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,180
He's so kind.

598
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,860
I'm sure he'll be in a serious condition.

599
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,500
It's serious.

600
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,140
The situation has changed.

601
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,660
It's too much.

602
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,340
I just don't want to be in a hurry.

603
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,940
I'll just let it go.

604
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,820
No matter what Brother Su says,

605
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,460
I believe there's love in it.

606
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,860
To be honest,

607
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,620
my father doesn't regret

608
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,100
his actions in the past.

609
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,180
But he still dares to stop you from doing it.

610
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,940
It sounds like a contradiction.

611
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,820
But I think, Brother Su,

612
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,860
you know what it means.

613
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,860
Yes.

614
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,420
People often think that

615
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,300
it's not easy to be a man

616
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,940
but a man.

617
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,620
No matter what,

618
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,300
the peace in Yan family is preserved.

619
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,540
As long as I remember Brother Su's kindness,

620
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,020
what's more important is

621
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,980
the reason for my death.

622
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,260
Yu Jing,

623
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,700
you're so smart.

624
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,700
It's hard to predict.

625
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,860
It's hard to predict

626
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,060
how our fate will be.

627
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,500
But I'm sure

628
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,860
that this is the only way.

629
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,060
Well said.

630
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,020
I'll toast you.

631
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,020
Are you sick?

632
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,620
Let's just drink tea.

633
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,860
I'll toast Brother Su.

634
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,020
Commander bung, is it May's 있죠?

635
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:47,900
Yes.

636
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,660
What I say was that

637
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,420
I haven't brought

638
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,780
the Monkey King's team back yet.

639
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:00,980
Let's go.

640
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:10,980
Yes, it is the team that didn't come back last night.

641
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,980
Meng Zhi, what are you doing?

642
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,980
I gave you all the responsibilities of protecting the city.

643
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,980
But you let people outside my palace kill people.

644
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,980
I am willing to take the responsibility.

645
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,980
What do you mean?

646
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:41,980
I can't even protect my life under the guard of the Jin army.

647
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,980
How can you believe that you can protect this city?

648
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,980
I can't do anything.

649
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,980
I can't do anything.

650
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,980
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

651
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,980
I can't do anything.

652
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,980
I can't do anything.

653
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,980
I will take the responsibility.

654
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

655
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,980
Meng Zhi, I have been investigating this case for 30 days.

656
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:11,980
If you can't find the murderer, I will ask you.

657
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,980
I will ask you.

658
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,980
There are 466. Come.

659
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,980
Yes.

660
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,980
Fei Liu, you went to the Prince's Mansion again?

661
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,980
Yes.

662
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,980
I will take you to the Prince's Mansion for breakfast.

663
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,980
That will be better.

664
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,980
Don't say that I taught you.

665
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,980
What?

666
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,980
Oh.

667
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,980
Princess, Prince Mu.

668
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,980
Sorry, Mr. Su.

669
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,980
I have been waiting for you outside.

670
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,980
It's okay. It's just a little bit.

671
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,980
It's New Year's Eve. It's very clear.

672
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,980
Please.

673
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,980
Okay.

674
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,980
I heard that Prince Mu loves to eat the snacks of Yongfang.

675
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,980
He specially asked people to prepare some for him.

676
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,980
Fei Liu.

677
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,980
Fei Liu is very fresh here.

678
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,980
He doesn't like to play around, right?

679
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,980
It's okay. It's okay.

680
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,980
He can play around.

681
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,980
Fei Liu is not as young as I am.

682
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,980
But my martial arts skills are really good.

683
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,980
Now you know that you envy him.

684
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,980
You will know that you are lazy when you practice.

685
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,980
I am not lazy.

686
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,980
I am just learning slowly.

687
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,980
There is a way to improve your skills.

688
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,980
You know that your self-control is bad.

689
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,980
You should work harder.

690
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,980
There are foreigners here.

691
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,980
Princess is really good at learning.

692
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,980
Please.

693
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,980
Now the situation in Nanjing is stable.

694
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,980
Prince Mu doesn't need to fight against the enemy.

695
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,980
It's okay to fight with the enemy.

696
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,980
But the military strategy is a strategy.

697
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,980
You must study and practice.

698
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,980
Did you hear what Mr. Su said?

699
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,980
I heard it.

700
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,980
I should have taught him before.

701
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,980
Now I should teach him too.

702
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,980
As long as it's for your own good, you should listen to him.

703
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
Well...

704
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,980
This is the first year that Prince Mu is in the first place.

705
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,980
He must be busy.

706
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,980
Yes.

707
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,980
I think he is not busy.

708
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,980
Now he is fighting.

709
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,980
I know you are tired.

710
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,980
You are good to be healthy.

711
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,980
I am worried that you are not stable.

712
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,980
You always look like you are not growing up.

713
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,980
You don't have to worry.

714
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,980
Prince Mu is just lack of strength.

715
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,980
He is still strong.

716
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,980
Now the situation is stable.

717
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,980
I will teach him some lessons.

718
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,980
In the future, he will be a hero.

719
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,980
Sister, look.

720
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,980
If Mr. Su says so, you can rest assured.

721
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,980
Princess.

722
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,980
What happened?

723
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,980
Princess, I just got the news.

724
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,980
A fatal case happened on the side of the city last night.

725
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,980
A fatal case?

726
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,980
Last night?

727
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,980
What could have happened last night?

728
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,980
Last night, Prince Mu was in charge of the case.

729
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,980
He gave the dishes to all the officials.

730
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,980
He sent 12 teams.

731
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,980
In the end, only 11 teams came back.

732
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,980
The police and Xun Fangying checked the place.

733
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,980
They found the body of the 7 people outside the city.

734
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,980
The body?

735
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,980
The police are very alert.

736
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,980
They have fought with each other.

737
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,980
They are all dead.

738
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,980
Is there any evidence left?

739
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,980
I...

740
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
Don't ask about the details.

741
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,980
How is Commander Meng?

742
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,980
Slow down.

743
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,980
Be careful.

744
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,980
Why is he still here?

745
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,980
Hurry up.

746
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,980
Go get some water.

747
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,980
Yes.

748
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,980
I...

749
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,980
Commander, you are very loyal.

750
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,980
You have been here for years.

751
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,980
You are not allowed to touch me.

752
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,980
Even if this case is a responsibility,

753
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,980
His Majesty can't put the fire on you.

754
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
This case...

755
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:09,980
Although it didn't happen in the palace wall,

756
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,980
but the crime scene...

757
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:16,980
is indeed somewhere far away from the city.

758
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,980
I should be responsible for the case.

759
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,980
It's not my fault.

760
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,980
What are you complaining about?

761
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,980
I...

762
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,980
It's good that this matter has finally passed.

763
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,980
I will be at ease these days.

764
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,980
Commander, please have a good rest.

765
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,980
It's over.

766
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,980
It's good that it's over.

767
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,980
His Majesty ordered me to break the case within three days.

768
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,980
Otherwise,

769
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,980
there will be a heavy punishment.

770
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,980
It's still a long time.

771
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,980
Wei, continue to talk about the case.

772
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,980
We will report it immediately.

773
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,980
Yes.

774
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,980
Qing, this news will be out soon.

775
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,980
I don't want anyone in the Prince of Mu's house

776
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,980
to be suspicious of anything.

777
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,980
Okay.

778
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,980
This case has been solved.

779
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,980
Commander, please take care of it.

780
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,980
Brother Zhu.

781
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,980
Xie, you're back.

782
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,980
The same person we expected.

783
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,980
The Prince of Mu was killed by Zhang Ze 20.

784
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,980
His Majesty was killed by Zhang Ze 20.

785
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,980
He was killed by Zhang Ze 20.

786
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,980
He was killed by Zhang Ze 20.

787
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,980
He was killed by Zhang Ze 20.

788
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,980
He was killed by Zhang Ze 20.

789
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,980
His Majesty was killed by Zhang Ze 20.

790
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,980
His Majesty was killed by Zhang Ze 20.

791
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,980
I'm preparing for the coup.

792
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,980
There is no evidence left.

793
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,980
No one is involved.

794
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,980
Don't worry.

795
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,980
Meng Zhi will not be involved in our investigation.

796
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,980
Meng Zhi will not be involved.

797
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,980
The people in our house are not Meng Zhi.

798
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,980
What do you mean?

799
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,980
No matter what His Majesty said,

800
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,980
he will not only let Meng Zhi investigate this case.

801
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,980
I believe His Majesty

802
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,980
will investigate this case.

803
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,980
It must be Xuanjing Bureau.

804
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,980
No witnesses or witnesses.

805
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,980
Even if Xuanjing Bureau is the one who investigated it,

806
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,980
what else can we do?

807
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,980
That's right.

808
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,980
In the current situation,

809
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,980
any innocent and innocent people

810
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,980
can only be considered as a trap.

811
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,980
There is no need to plead for justice.

812
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,980
I'm not worried about the current situation of the Prince of Meng.

813
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,980
It's the development of the case.

814
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,980
The development of the case?

815
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,980
That's right.

816
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,980
His Majesty did not suspect that

817
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,980
the case was a result of the attack

818
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,980
of the Prince of Meng.

819
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,980
I'm worried that

820
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,980
if the Prince of Meng can't be solved in 30 days,

821
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,980
it will be a serious crime.

822
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,980
If the case is not solved,

823
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,980
His Majesty will be more and more confident

824
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,980
about the Prince of Meng.

825
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,980
I'm really worried about that.

826
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,980
What exactly is the murderer doing?

827
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,980
The attack he did

828
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,980
is hard to be solved.

829
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,980
Maybe it's to challenge the military crisis.

830
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,980
Maybe it's to test the military's defense

831
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,980
and to be carried out in the future.

832
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,980
Or to go to the Prince of Meng.

833
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,980
The case has been opened.

834
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,980
What else do you have to plan?

835
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,980
There were six soldiers

836
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,980
in the palace wall last night.

837
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,980
They wanted to clean up.

838
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,980
They must have a murderer like you.

839
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:45,980
But our relationship is too tight.

840
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,980
The next action

841
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,980
you don't have to do.

842
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,980
Then, half a year ago,

843
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,980
you made me go to the capital with a murderer.

844
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,980
So, you're preparing this?

845
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,980
Although this case

846
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,980
has been forced by His Majesty's trust in Meng Zhi,

847
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,980
it's still a fact.

848
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,980
The fire I just burned

849
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,980
can't just let it cool down.

850
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,980
But from now on,

851
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,980
Meng Zhi will be more and more powerful.

852
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,980
If you want to intervene in the military's defense,

853
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,980
I'm afraid it won't be easy.

854
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,980
If a palace city is a secret place,

855
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:36,980
military soldiers and martial artists

856
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,980
are always in the past.

857
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,980
Moreover, if it's clear,

858
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,980
I'm in the future.

859
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,980
I'm not afraid of the future.

860
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,980
I'm afraid of the future.

861
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,980
I'm afraid of the future.

862
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,980
I'm afraid of the future.

863
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,980
I'm afraid of the future.

864
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,980
I'm afraid of the future.

865
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,980
I'm afraid of the future.

866
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,980
I'm afraid of the future.

867
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,980
I'm afraid of the future.

868
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,980
I'm afraid of the future.

869
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,980
I'm afraid of the future.

870
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,980
I'm afraid of the future.

871
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,980
I'm afraid of the future.

872
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,980
I'm afraid of the future.

873
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,980
I'm afraid of the future.

874
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,980
I'm afraid of the future.

875
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,980
I'm afraid of the future.

876
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,980
I'm afraid of the future.

877
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,980
I'm afraid of the future.

878
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,980
I'm afraid of the future.

879
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,980
I'm afraid of the future.

880
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,980
I'm afraid of the future.

881
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,980
I'm afraid of the future.

882
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,980
I'm afraid of the future.

883
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,980
I'm afraid of the future.

884
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,980
I'm afraid of the future.

885
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,980
I'm afraid of the future.

886
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,980
I'm afraid of the future.

887
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,980
I'm afraid of the future.

888
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,980
The future.

889
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:12,980
The future.

890
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,040
you
