1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:43,660
that

2
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:51,220
to

3
00:01:51,220 --> 00:02:00,320
continue

4
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Go! Go!

5
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Go! Go!

6
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,320
The capital is coming soon.

7
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,320
General Wei is back to the old land.

8
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
I'm afraid there will be a lot of emotions.

9
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,320
Your friends are really able to live happily.

10
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,320
This gate is their only chance.

11
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,320
I hope they won't make mistakes again.

12
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,320
I know that you don't want them to come, do you?

13
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,320
It's a pity that you made a mistake and shouldn't have been trying to get you.

14
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,320
Otherwise, you wouldn't have to live in this old-fashioned life.

15
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,320
What a good mother and a good son-in-law!

16
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,320
I left the palace five days ago.

17
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
You're the one who took care of the harem, right?

18
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,320
I'm confused.

19
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,320
I don't know why His Majesty specially asked me to come to the Hall of Revenue.

20
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
You're still talking?

21
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,320
If you leave the front foot, you'll lock the harem.

22
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,320
It's been more than 20 years since you entered the palace.

23
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,320
You have the son-in-law and the son-in-law.

24
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,320
It's me who killed the three-digit concubines.

25
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,320
You've been asking him to go to the Zhengyang Palace without reason.

26
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Do you still have any doubts?

27
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
Your Majesty, you're being serious.

28
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,320
I'm afraid I'm not going to show my gratitude to you.

29
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,320
I don't know what you said to me.

30
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,320
But to me, it's not that I'm innocent.

31
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
It's the Imperial Physician's right to say it.

32
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,320
Don't make any more excuses!

33
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Don't pull the Imperial Physician away.

34
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,320
He didn't say a word in front of me to protect you.

35
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
If it weren't for his health,

36
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
and he asked the Consort,

37
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
I'm afraid you didn't know that

38
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,320
you did such a good thing.

39
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,320
What Imperial Physician's decision?

40
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
A doctor who's been doing a lot of research.

41
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
He's been talking nonsense.

42
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,320
I just need to make a few more excuses.

43
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,320
They've tried to use the illusion of the grass to poison me.

44
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,320
Then he'll use the grass of the house to drink for me every day.

45
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,320
I'm a rich family.

46
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,320
Naturally, you don't have the right to be a doctor.

47
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,320
I just heard that someone hurt you.

48
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
It's a mess.

49
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,320
There's no place for you to be so impulsive.

50
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,320
But even so, I'm still a good person.

51
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
I just asked Consort Jing.

52
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
I didn't do anything to her.

53
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Do you think that

54
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
I shouldn't have asked the Imperial Physician

55
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,320
about such a thing?

56
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,320
You?

57
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
You did such a thing.

58
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,320
You even tried to force yourself to do it.

59
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Your Majesty.

60
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
Consort Jing, please.

61
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Hu Jing, Yu Le Cheng, 9994466, come.

62
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Please.

63
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
Let her in.

64
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Consort Jing Xuan.

65
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

66
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Get up.

67
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

68
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,320
I heard that Your Majesty has summoned Her Highness.

69
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,320
The matter I asked was related to me.

70
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
I'm sure that you have something to ask me.

71
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,320
So I came here rashly.

72
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

73
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Consort Jing, don't worry.

74
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,320
I won't let you suffer.

75
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,320
Your Majesty is very kind.

76
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
I understand.

77
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,320
But Her Highness the Empress has the responsibility of the six palaces.

78
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,320
It's not wrong to investigate the marriage of the imperial maids.

79
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,320
As for the misunderstanding of the marriage,

80
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,320
it's just that the matter is clear.

81
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,320
It's not a big deal.

82
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
It's a different matter.

83
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,320
If it's because the Empress has summoned Consort Jing

84
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
and punished the Empress,

85
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
if the matter is discussed,

86
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,320
I'm afraid that it will damage Your Majesty's reputation and reputation.

87
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,320
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

88
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Consort Jing,

89
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,320
if you think like that,

90
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
I understand your reason.

91
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Look,

92
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
the emperor is the emperor of the six palaces.

93
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
He's not as good as half of Consort Jing.

94
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Fortunately,

95
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
Consort Jing is not hurt.

96
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
She's been forgiven.

97
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
But you have to understand.

98
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
My face

99
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
is the status of the Empress for you.

100
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
It's for Prince Yu.

101
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
It's for the Yan family.

102
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
It's not for you.

103
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
If you make any more mistakes,

104
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
I will not forgive you.

105
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,320
I thank Your Majesty for your kindness.

106
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Wait a minute.

107
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Let's go.

108
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
What's here?

109
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
It's a good place to rest.

110
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Look at this.

111
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,320
What's in the glass?

112
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
It's all money.

113
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Let's go.

114
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Run on the side.

115
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Run on the side.

116
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
Run on the side.

117
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Your Majesty.

118
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Your Majesty.

119
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Your Majesty,

120
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
there's a white man in front.

121
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Let's go.

122
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Run on the side.

123
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Wait for the imperial jade silk.

124
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
You really don't have a chance.

125
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,320
You want to risk it?

126
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
Come out.

127
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Go.

128
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Run on the side.

129
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
Run on the side.

130
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Run on the side.

131
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Your Majesty.

132
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Hurry, go.

133
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Go.

134
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Go.

135
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Hurry.

136
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,260
Ha ha want to go back

137
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,280
ha

138
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,480
You got women

139
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,380
Ta

140
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,460
What's wrong?

141
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,060
Didn't you go out to play?

142
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,060
You're a pervert.

143
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,060
You can't play.

144
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,060
Who's the pervert?

145
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,060
Enough.

146
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,060
Don't care so much.

147
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,060
Time to sleep.

148
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,820
Who's that?

149
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,940
He's not even looking.

150
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,660
Don't run, Ruzhong.

151
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,860
Do you know who I am?

152
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,580
I'll catch you if you're in Jinming City.

153
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:38,940
Don't tell me...

154
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,940
Catch me!

155
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,420
Why are you here?

156
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,580
Qiu, you're back.

157
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,380
I just came back.

158
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,380
What's wrong with you?

159
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,260
Don't mention it.

160
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,020
There was a man

161
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,860
who was crazy about his eyes.

162
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,340
He stepped on the car's top.

163
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,660
He stepped on it.

164
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,900
I'm a new car.

165
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,860
My dad is going to scold me.

166
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,860
Where did he go?

167
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
Over there.

168
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,220
Hurry.

169
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,220
Let's go.

170
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,340
Qiu,

171
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:01,860
catch him.

172
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,860
Remember to let him drive with me.

173
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,700
How far is Jinling City?

174
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,380
There's still half a day.

175
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,300
We'll stop here tonight.

176
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,860
We'll arrive in Jinling City overnight.

177
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,300
Mr. Qiu.

178
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,100
What?

179
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,500
Didn't you see that masked man?

180
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
No.

181
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,100
He must have come from your direction.

182
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,900
Mr. Xiaqiu, please stay.

183
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
Mr. Xia.

184
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,340
The patrol is reported.

185
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,180
Xuanjing Temple is in the capital.

186
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,980
Someone is fighting at the west gate.

187
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,380
I came to ask Mr. Xiaqiu

188
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,380
what happened.

189
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,700
This is...

190
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,100
Prince Jing's father,

191
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Lie Zhanying.

192
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,500
So it's Prince Jing's father.

193
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,820
Xuanjing Temple is under the arrest of a criminal.

194
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,020
He's sent back to the capital.

195
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,780
The criminal is in the west gate.

196
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,900
He tried to get away.

197
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,900
He's been kicked out.

198
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,220
The criminal has been put in jail.

199
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,220
That's it.

200
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,220
Criminal?

201
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,940
What criminal?

202
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,580
The 13-year-old man who was in jail

203
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,300
was a man who was in prison.

204
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,260
Wei Zheng.

205
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,260
Be careful.

206
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,260
Be careful.

207
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,860
How is it, Zhen Ping?

208
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,260
The man who was in the front gate

209
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,660
is too busy.

210
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,460
He can't save General Wei.

211
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,060
But General Wei is now

212
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
transferred to Xuanjing Temple.

213
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,260
It'll be harder

214
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,460
if he's in jail.

215
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,460
Yes.

216
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,260
Xuanjing Temple is a man's palace.

217
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,060
He's a man of justice.

218
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,060
If he's in prison,

219
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,660
he'll be in trouble.

220
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,460
Because of the arrest,

221
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,660
all the news channels in the city

222
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,460
and the secret police

223
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,460
are all cut off.

224
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,660
It's nothing to do with General Wei.

225
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660
It's just a matter of time.

226
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,460
But I can't believe

227
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,860
that he's been sent.

228
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,860
He's the most trusted person in the city.

229
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,260
Hold on.

230
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,260
I'll get the medicine for you.

231
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,260
I've always dreamed of him.

232
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,260
He's different from your dream.

233
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,860
He's not a fool.

234
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,460
He's not a fool.

235
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,260
He's hanging there.

236
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,260
He's hanging there.

237
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,660
His face...

238
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,060
His Majesty is in a bad state.

239
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,660
If he's in pain,

240
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,860
he'll be in a bad state.

241
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,860
Can you tell?

242
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,660
His Majesty is missing his old man.

243
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,660
He must be safe.

244
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,860
He's not his sister.

245
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,460
He must be

246
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,460
not willing to stay in this world.

247
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,260
His Majesty dreamed of him.

248
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,260
He can't let go of himself.

249
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,660
If he's not willing to leave,

250
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,660
why wouldn't he leave?

251
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,460
In this world,

252
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,660
Chen Fei is not a fool.

253
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,060
She doesn't even have a pair of beads.

254
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,660
What else does she have?

255
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,260
Maybe you're right.

256
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,060
No one can stop her.

257
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,860
That's why she's so willing.

258
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,260
She can't leave

259
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,060
for a while.

260
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,260
Your Majesty.

261
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,860
You do this for me.

262
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,860
Don't let anyone know.

263
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,060
The criminal is in the dungeon.

264
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,260
I'll go to the patrol every morning and night.

265
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,660
Please rest assured.

266
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,260
No need.

267
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,260
Just follow the usual rules.

268
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,860
You can go and see.

269
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,860
You don't need to go every day.

270
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,660
Master, the criminal is very powerful.

271
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,660
There's another master.

272
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,060
He can't be defeated.

273
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,660
If the guards let him go,

274
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,460
he'll be in trouble.

275
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,660
You don't need to use Wei Zhengguan's death.

276
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,260
He's the one who's used to saving her.

277
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,860
If the guards don't dare to save her,

278
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,460
why should I keep an eye on him?

279
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,460
I should cut him off.

280
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,060
But Wei Zhengguan has already set a trap.

281
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,860
If he wasn't used to saving her,

282
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,460
he'd be killed.

283
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,860
What does that mean?

284
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,660
You'er is still a little bit ahead of me.

285
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,460
If you can't get him,

286
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,460
you can get him a few more times.

287
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,460
It's so late.

288
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,460
Sister Si is still not asleep.

289
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,460
Ban Ru,

290
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,060
I've done everything you asked me to do.

291
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,460
Tong Lu is useless to you now.

292
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,460
Let him go.

293
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,460
How could it be useless?

294
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,460
Didn't you ask Xixi about it?

295
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,660
She knows that he's a 13-year-old

296
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
and a woman from Hexi.

297
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,660
She's just a person who's just

298
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,660
trying to get information for Jiang Zomeng.

299
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,660
She knows that he's a secret.

300
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,260
She has the time to ask questions.

301
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,060
She's just a few more details

302
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,060
that she's planning to do for Prince Jing.

303
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,660
Sister Si said

304
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,660
that he's really useless.

305
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,660
But in other places,

306
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
he's still very useful.

307
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
In other places?

308
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,660
At least, as long as Tong Lu is still in my hands,

309
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,660
then Sister Si won't leave me alone.

310
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,660
Isn't that right?

311
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,660
Ban Ru.

312
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,660
You're so old.

313
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,660
You even came to the capital for General Wei's sake.

314
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,660
You've worked hard.

315
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,660
Where did you say that?

316
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,660
Before I became a soldier,

317
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,660
I was my disciple.

318
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,660
After that, I've been a father for so many years.

319
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,660
And I have two children.

320
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,660
But you guys

321
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,660
have hurt so many brothers

322
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,660
just to save them.

323
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,660
It really hurts my heart.

324
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,660
General Wei is also our brother.

325
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,660
I don't know if Xuan Jin Si

326
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
has ever done anything to Prince Yao.

327
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,660
Although I'm a man of nature,

328
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,660
I never get jealous.

329
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,660
In the battlefield, there are countless soldiers and soldiers.

330
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,660
I'm not that kind of person.

331
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,660
I can enter the court,

332
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,660
and I can go back to the forest.

333
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,660
Xuan Jin Si really wants to seal off Prince Yao.

334
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,660
I'm afraid he doesn't have that much power.

335
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,660
And he's probably just going to seal off my way to Huo Yun Mountain.

336
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,660
He's going to put us all in the forest.

337
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,660
If I really do seal off the mountain,

338
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,660
I'm afraid that wouldn't be a good idea.

339
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,660
Don't worry about that.

340
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,660
Prince Yao is not that powerful.

341
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,660
He's not a good guy to seal off the wolf.

342
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
If Xuan Jin Si does a blackout,

343
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,660
he'll be fine with a blackout.

344
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,660
If he really wants to seal off the mountain,

345
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,660
wouldn't he be able to seal off

346
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
the big amount of money he has invested?

347
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,660
General Qi.

348
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,660
Are you all right?

349
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,660
I'm fine.

350
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,660
General, I'll go and see you in the village.

351
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,660
Yes.

352
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
You're finally back.

353
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
I asked you to send a message to Wei Ling.

354
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,660
His Majesty is in the wilderness now.

355
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,660
Why did you come back?

356
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,660
I was worried for a few days.

357
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,660
I sent more than ten brothers to look for you.

358
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,660
Where did you go?

359
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,660
You thought I didn't want to come back?

360
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,660
You're blaming Mr. Su's people.

361
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,660
Mr. Su's people?

362
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,660
Mr. Su has a man.

363
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,660
He chased me down the road and didn't let me go to Wei Ling.

364
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,660
He said there was a better way.

365
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,660
He even got me pregnant.

366
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,660
Are you all right?

367
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,660
I'm fine.

368
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,660
You go back and rest.

369
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,660
Consort Qing's matter is fine.

370
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,660
I have an important matter to attend to.

371
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,660
What important matter?

372
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,660
He caught Wei Zheng.

373
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,660
Prepare the horses.

374
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,660
Yes.

375
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,660
Wei Zheng?

376
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,660
Sleep.

377
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,660
Sleep.

378
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,660
Sleep.

379
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,660
All right.

380
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,660
I can't sleep even if you do.

381
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,660
Get up.

382
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,660
Where are they?

383
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,660
They said they'd let you sleep.

384
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,660
They said they'd let you sleep?

385
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,660
Uncle.

386
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,660
What?

387
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,660
An old uncle.

388
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,660
What old uncle?

389
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660
How do they know you?

390
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,660
Su.

391
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,660
Old Princess Su?

392
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,660
Does Brother Su Xuan know you?

393
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,660
Yes.

394
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,660
Is he here?

395
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,660
Quick.

396
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,660
Call Li Gang and Zhen Ping here.

397
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,660
They told you to sleep.

398
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,660
Quick.

399
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,660
I'll call you.

400
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,660
Who are you?

401
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,660
You.

402
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,660
Mr. Su.

403
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,660
Mr. Su.

404
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,660
General Lie.

405
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,660
I'm sorry to bother you.

406
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,660
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

407
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,660
My master is ill.

408
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,660
Mr. Li said he couldn't see anyone.

409
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,660
Mr. Su's illness is still good.

410
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,660
Yes.

411
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,660
He's been sleeping and can't wake up.

412
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,660
Then...

413
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,660
When Mr. Su wakes up,

414
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,660
you can see him.

415
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,660
Send someone to inform me.

416
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,660
Yes.

417
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,660
Your Highness.

418
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,660
How dare you come to the capital today?

419
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,660
There's a war ahead of us.

420
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,660
There's a last battle.

421
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,660
There's no escape if you miss it.

422
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,660
Your Highness, look.

423
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,660
Since it's like this,

424
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,660
everyone is tired.

425
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,660
We don't need to rush here.

426
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,660
Go to the Chizang battle.

427
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,660
We'll enter the capital tomorrow.

428
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,660
Yes.

429
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,660
I know you're doing this for my own good.

430
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,660
I've been in a bad mood these days.

431
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,660
You can't tell me.

432
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,660
Thank you.

433
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
Anything else?

434
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,660
I've been with you before.

435
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,660
I've been on the same path.

436
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,660
But...

437
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,660
But don't worry.

438
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,660
Mr. Su has left.

439
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,660
He's safe now.

440
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
That's good.

441
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,660
The Chiyan Army is in a hurry.

442
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,660
The food is getting cold.

443
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,660
Among the people who are still alive,

444
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,660
there's only one thing that's clear.

445
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,660
It's easy to be recognized.

446
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,660
What if...

447
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
I'm not sure if...

448
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,660
I'm not sure if...

449
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,660
I can inform the old department of Langzhou.

450
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,660
No matter what happens,

451
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,660
we can't let it go for now.

452
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,660
Yes.

453
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,660
You two...

454
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,660
Master!

455
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,660
We're all orphans.

456
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,660
We've grown up in Chiyan Army.

457
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,660
We don't have any family.

458
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,660
It was my father's who was a kid.

459
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,660
It's been more than ten years.

460
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,660
The cause has changed.

461
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,660
No one will recognize us.

462
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,660
I hope you don't...

463
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,660
take us to the capital now.

464
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,660
Forget it.

465
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,660
I really don't know who to pick you up...

466
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,660
after you're gone.

467
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,660
You two be careful.

468
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,660
Yes.

469
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,660
Where's Mr. Su?

470
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,660
He's waiting in the front hall.

471
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,660
I'll go get changed.

472
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,660
I'll see him.

473
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,660
Your Highness,

474
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,660
Prince Jin is coming back.

475
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
Yes.

476
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,660
He'll be back tomorrow.

477
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,660
Your Highness, you've been in great pain.

478
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,660
When Prince Jin comes back,

479
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,660
you must tell him.

480
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,660
But the Empress asked me a few questions.

481
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,660
What's there to say?

482
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,660
No way.

483
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,660
Fortunately, His Majesty gave you a chance.

484
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,660
I heard that the doctor who said nonsense...

485
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,660
was already killed.

486
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,660
What?

487
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,660
I...

488
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,660
I heard from others too.

489
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
Your Highness,

490
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,660
is the capital that you're going to serve...

491
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,660
to enter the palace?

492
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,660
Maybe...

493
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,660
Maybe not.

494
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,660
All depends on my good brother.

495
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,660
Did Prince Jin return to the capital today?

496
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,660
It's time for him to come.

497
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,660
He must have entered from the north gate.

498
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,660
I'll go to the capital first...

499
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,660
to welcome him.

500
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,660
Are you sure...

501
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,660
that Prince Jin is...

502
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
going to the capital today?

503
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,660
Are you sure...

504
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,660
that in the world of Wei Zheng,

505
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,660
Mei Chang Su can't stop Prince Jin?

506
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,660
You're right.

507
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,660
Prince Jin's temperament has never changed.

508
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,660
We know what he cares about the most.

509
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,660
I'm just trying to anger him...

510
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,660
to bury this thread in the palace.

511
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,660
Prince Jin is not going to stop...

512
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,660
Mei Chang Su from going to the capital.

513
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,660
Once he comes back,

514
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,660
he'll surely be in trouble.

515
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,660
Your Highness, it seems that you're being too polite.

516
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,660
No matter what they do to me,

517
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,660
I must get Feng Huan back.

518
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,660
As long as we're together,

519
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,660
we'll surely be able to get in.

520
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,660
What the old master said is true.

521
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,660
Chief, the city gate is sending news that Prince Jin is back.

522
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,660
Has Lie Zhan Ying gone?

523
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,660
He's already gone.

524
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,660
He's been waiting at the city gate.

525
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,660
Just let him inform Prince Jin.

526
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,660
At least he has a mental preparation before he enters the palace.

527
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,660
So that he doesn't have to be in front of His Majesty.

528
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,660
He's gone!

529
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,660
Your Highness!

530
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,660
Your Highness!

531
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,660
Is there any key to the Imperial Household Department?

532
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,660
What's wrong?

533
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,660
Xuan Jin Si.

534
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,660
Master, you're finally back.

535
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,660
This time, you've worked so hard.

536
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,660
Brother Yu.

537
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,660
Look, look.

538
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,660
Your face is all black.

539
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,660
You're also thin.

540
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,660
You'll have to feel bad if you see Consort Jin in the palace later.

541
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,660
Why are you here, Brother Yu?

542
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,660
You're a great official.

543
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,660
The imperial court is full of people.

544
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,660
Father ordered me to accompany you.

545
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,660
I'm not afraid of being late.

546
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,660
Of course, I'll be waiting here.

547
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,660
You're going to go to the Imperial Household Department?

548
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,660
Let's go.

549
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,660
Brother Wen, I'll accompany you.

550
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,660
Your Highness.

551
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,660
Father is still waiting in the palace.

552
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,660
Let's go.

553
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,660
If there's anything, let me go back first.

554
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,660
What?

555
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,660
I didn't find the opportunity to talk to you.

556
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,660
Yes.

557
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,660
I was selling the tea next door.

558
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,660
When Prince Jin just entered the city,

559
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,660
Prince Yu stopped me.

560
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,660
It was obvious that General Nie was in a bad mood.

561
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,660
He said that General Wei was in trouble.

562
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,660
I could only see Prince Jin enter the city.

563
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,660
So,

564
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,660
Prince Jin didn't know anything and entered the palace.

565
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,660
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

566
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,660
Please rise.

567
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,660
Please rise.

568
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,660
Thank you, Father.

569
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,660
I ordered that

570
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,660
the Imperial Household Department

571
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,660
and the Imperial Household Department

572
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,660
should be in a good mood.

573
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,660
The city is under a report.

574
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,660
Please go to the Imperial Household Department first.

575
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,660
I'll send the message tomorrow.

576
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,660
Yes.

577
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,660
The imperial household department

578
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,660
is doing well.

579
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,660
I know

580
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,660
that it's a good thing to have a good rest

581
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,660
and have a good rest.

582
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,660
It's not too late to report anything.

583
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,660
Thank you, Father.

584
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,660
Jingyan is back to the city for a happy event.

585
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,660
Why is Father so depressed?

586
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,660
Is he discussing something difficult?

587
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,660
Can I share your worries with him?

588
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,660
It's been years.

589
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,660
What's the problem?

590
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,660
It's difficult.

591
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,660
Yes.

592
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,660
It's a good thing to have a good rest.

593
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,660
What's the problem?

594
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,660
It's hard to catch a criminal like me

595
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,660
who's been a good example of my past.

596
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,660
Criminal?

597
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,660
Is there any crime?

598
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,660
How would I not know?

599
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,660
Of course you know.

600
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,660
It's just that

601
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,660
it's not an recent case.

602
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,660
It was 13 years ago.

603
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,660
13 years ago?

604
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,660
It's just that

605
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,660
13 years ago,

606
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,660
there were other cases.

607
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,660
Of course, it was Chiyan's son.

608
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,660
Chiyan's army was sentenced to death

609
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,660
by the enemy.

610
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,660
But when they were gathered at the base,

611
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,660
the general of Tianjiang University

612
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,660
was arrested.

613
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
His Majesty ordered

614
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,660
to arrest the commander of the criminal.

615
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,660
But there were few people

616
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,660
who couldn't find the missing.

617
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,660
I don't know

618
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,660
whether it was a escape or a death.

619
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,660
Xuanjing Bureau has been in charge of this for many years.

620
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,660
It seems that they didn't dare to arrest him.

621
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660
Fortunately, His Majesty was able to use it.

622
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,660
The King of Heaven escaped.

623
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,660
After 13 years of trial,

624
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,660
they got one of them.

625
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,660
The criminal.

626
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,660
Who is it?

627
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,660
It's the original name of the father.

628
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,660
Wei Zheng.

629
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,660
It's a good thing.

630
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,660
I want to congratulate my father.

631
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
I escaped for more than ten years.

632
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,660
I can't let it go.

633
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,660
I can't let the court take the throne.

634
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,660
Wei Zheng

635
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,660
must be more important

636
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,660
to set the heart of the world.

637
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,660
Your Highness, you are right.

638
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,660
This is indeed the truth.

639
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,660
According to the new and ambitious

640
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,660
criminal Yi Ying,

641
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,660
it's useless to be called by the new and ambitious.

642
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,660
You must be more important

643
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,660
to make the world taste better.

644
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,660
OK, let's go.

645
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,660
Let's go!

646
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,560
I thought that

647
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,660
it's better to be promoted more than ever.

648
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,500
It will be longer and preferable to stay away with you!

649
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:09,760
Our new powerful scoundrel칭 is in no position...

650
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,720
I hope Meng Da Tong called it overmuดsn't!

651
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:27,060
Tr Prabdr ó

652
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,220
Your Highness, am I right?

653
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,340
Chief Xia, what do you mean by chasing after me?

654
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,740
How can you punish His Majesty for your misdeeds?

655
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,780
How can you be meaningful?

656
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,500
Zheng Yan.

657
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,540
I have Καιji message.

658
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,540
Guarained?

659
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:10,900
What do you think?

660
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,540
He was the patron of the royal family.

661
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,980
He spoke ill of her.

662
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,540
Now things go this well.

663
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,300
The state is problematic.

664
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,380
You have a lot of parts to manage.

665
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,740
But now things areicem vile.

666
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,740
and the two words are very important.

667
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,180
As for the new country,

668
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,500
the kingdom of kings,

669
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,300
it's said that

670
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,060
there is a great power in the Holy Preceptor,

671
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,020
and it's said that

672
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,540
there is a great power in the Holy Preceptor.

673
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,340
But Xia Shouzun

674
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,900
is asking me if I'm right.

675
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,300
How can I answer?

676
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,700
The emperor has a common opinion in front of the emperor.

677
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,500
If the emperor doesn't agree with my opinion,

678
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,900
even if he's wrong,

679
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,140
it's not a chance to withdraw.

680
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,900
Could it be that

681
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,020
I've just said something

682
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,580
that hurt you?

683
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,820
If you're not happy,

684
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,620
I'll pay you a visit.

685
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,460
Yes.

686
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,660
Jingyan, you also...

687
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,780
It's not a big mistake.

688
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,620
You're just tempered.

689
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,220
Xia Shouzun, don't be too worried.

690
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,500
You know that Jingyan's temperament is like this.

691
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,300
There's nothing else, right?

692
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,300
Your Highness,

693
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,500
I didn't see anything else.

694
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,340
But...

695
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,220
What did you just say?

696
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,820
No matter what happened that year,

697
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,460
I don't understand.

698
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,220
This case was personally interrogated by the emperor.

699
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,780
There was no difference in opinion.

700
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,180
Is it not clear

701
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,740
that you're still

702
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,540
investigating today?

703
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,060
Then why didn't you cry?

704
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,600
You just Anthem of Net aging

705
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,260
and Ming aktars me every day.

706
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,460
I got my test普通新聞.

707
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,620
But then I went back to Han?

708
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:09,260
No.

709
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,820
But your expected to be

710
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,900
rank before the crown prince

711
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,100
is actually

712
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,300
Commander Lin is still the loyal commander of the palace.

713
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,900
Lord Chiyan is the master of the Bejing Army.

714
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,700
When I came back, they were arrested.

715
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,700
They became traitors, traitors, criminals.

716
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,300
Death, death, and the King's King.

717
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,300
Except for the chaos and the spirit,

718
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,700
I didn't even see a single drop of it.

719
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,500
How could I be so clear?

720
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,900
That's how it was.

721
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,300
So, in your heart,

722
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,900
as long as you have the King's reputation,

723
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,300
the King's army, and the soldiers' army,

724
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,700
can you be so impulsive?

725
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,900
You've done too much, Lord Xia.

726
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,100
Your Highness, you don't mean that.

727
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,500
The so-called impulsion is not practical.

728
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,300
What I saw was just you,

729
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,900
a secret report.

730
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,700
No way.

731
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,700
You only saw the secret report of Lord Xia's subordinate.

732
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,100
Jingyan,

733
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,500
didn't you even see the edict of the King's father?

734
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
No way.

735
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,300
Jingyan,

736
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,900
I have to take the edict of the case.

737
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,500
Are you satisfied?

738
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,900
I'm not satisfied with my father.

739
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,700
I just think that the King's coming...

740
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,300
Shut up!

741
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,900
What King's?

742
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,900
You're a man of the word.

743
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,100
You're a leader,

744
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,700
a criminal,

745
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,500
and a criminal!

746
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:08,500
Did you learn how to fight in front of the army?

747
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,100
Your Majesty,

748
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,900
the year is coming to an end.

749
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,500
Please punish the King's anger

750
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:20,500
and punish the people.

751
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,900
Jingyan, don't say that.

752
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,700
In front of me and the officials,

753
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,300
there's no such thing as being so impulsive.

754
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,500
It's not good.

755
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,900
Your Majesty,

756
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,500
it's almost noon.

757
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,700
Consort Jing often says that she's not good at fighting in front of the army.

758
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:47,700
Moreover, you promised Your Highness this morning.

759
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,500
Stop arguing.

760
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,500
Jingyan,

761
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,500
you should go and visit your mother.

762
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,700
I'll leave the edict to you.

763
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,300
Go back.

764
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,300
I'll leave now.

765
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,300
I'll leave now.

766
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,300
Jingyan!

767
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,300
Jingyan!

768
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,300
Your Highness, look at him.

769
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,300
He's not the kind of person who dared to do this to me.

770
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,300
Prince Jing is not a bloodthirsty person.

771
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,600
How could you lose him that late?

772
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,100
汪儿参见母親.

773
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,100
Hurry and you stand up.

774
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,700
You've totailed so much in the outdoor pursuit.

775
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:59,100
You already are a brave한 Stark and brave står.

776
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,300
Let'sblorde to take a rest.

777
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,300
Come sit down.

778
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,300
Come.

779
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,300
Your Highness, drink some soup.

780
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,300
Your Highness has been boiling for a long time.

781
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,300
Drink some soup.

782
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,300
Don't be so formal.

783
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
You should accompany mother to sit down.

784
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,300
But there is an important ceremony outside.

785
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,300
You should sit down and leave.

786
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,300
What's wrong?

787
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,300
What happened?

788
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,300
Don't worry, mother. I will handle it.

789
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,300
I will explain to mother in the future.

790
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,300
Your Highness,

791
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,300
Your Highness has been so guilty.

792
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,300
It's easy for you to come back.

793
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,300
Why do you leave when you speak?

794
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,300
What did you say?

795
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,300
Don't talk nonsense.

796
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,300
Are you hiding something from me?

797
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,300
Be careful.

798
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,300
What happened?

799
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,300
Your Highness, I almost can't see you.

800
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,300
What's wrong?

801
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,300
Your Highness, I am sorry.

802
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,300
I am sorry.

803
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,300
I am sorry.

804
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,300

I am sorry.

815
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,300
I am sorry.

816
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,300
I am sorry.

817
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,300
