1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,260
That's because you got rid of endặl insanlar with X describe involvement and

2
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,980
hangover in the moon to look serious.

3
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:48,780
I'm against your comfort so I took a break.

4
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,920
While I was sleeping, Jing spielen with X's dad.

5
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,240
Thankfully, he told me I'm going to find a geek moments later.

6
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Yes, there is.

7
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
Still no news from Tong Lu?

8
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Mr. Shi San has been released.

9
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,240
We have to withdraw the large number of people

10
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,240
and add General Wei.

11
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,240
So we are slowly investigating.

12
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Even if there is really any problem with Tong Lu,

13
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,240
it's not like he has released me so early.

14
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,240
They will keep him and ask him slowly.

15
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
The situation outside is mixed up.

16
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
You should send more people.

17
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,240
We must find out Tong Lu's whereabouts as soon as possible.

18
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,240
Yes, I will follow.

19
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,240
Is it snowing?

20
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Yes, Your Highness.

21
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,240
It's so nice to hear the snowing sounds these days.

22
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Noble Consort Yue, are you feeling unwell?

23
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

24
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,240
I am fine.

25
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Although the Crown Prince has left the capital,

26
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,240
he is still the Prince of Yufeng.

27
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,240
His Majesty is well-wisher.

28
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,240
I have not forgotten him since I was a child.

29
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240
You are the mother of the Prince of Xian.

30
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,240
You have never changed.

31
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,240
You are still the son of the Duke of Housong.

32
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,240
If you are feeling well,

33
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,240
please give me some spirit.

34
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,240
His Majesty still has feelings for you.

35
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
You must be patient.

36
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,240
You will not be taken away by others.

37
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Thank you for your advice, Your Highness.

38
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,240
I will take my leave.

39
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,240
I will do my best to serve His Majesty.

40
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Noble Consort.

41
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
I am here.

42
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,240
Have you written the Buddhist scriptures I asked you to copy?

43
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,240
That Buddhist scripture is used by Empress Dowager and Empress Dowager.

44
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
I am very grateful to you.

45
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
I will not forget Your Highness's birthday

46
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
until the day I copy it.

47
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Do you think I will not be mistaken

48
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,240
if I give it to you on the 14th?

49
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,240
If your own Cao Shuai or copy books,

50
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,240
then your Buddhist scriptures cannot be used.

51
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,240
It will be the same for ten days.

52
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,240
If you are not sure,

53
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,240
then let me take the chance to copy it.

54
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Your Highness, you are right.

55
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Why don't you give me a chance to...

56
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,240
...to see the most exciting game in the world,

57
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
the Prince of Ma Jianghu,

58
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,240
the Prince of Ma Jianghu,

59
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,240
the Prince of Shangjing,

60
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
the Prince of Huangjing,

61
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
the Prince of Zhaocaimeng,

62
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
the Prince of Shangjing,

63
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,240
the Prince of Anglai,

64
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
the Prince of Emperor,…

65
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,240
...the Prince of Shangjing,

66
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,240
the Prince of Shangjing,

67
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
the Queen of Shangjing,

68
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,240
the Queen of Shangjing,

69
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,240
the Queen of Shangjing,

70
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,240
the Prince of Shangjing,

71
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:39,240
the Prince of Shangjing,

72
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,320
Your Highness,

73
00:05:40,480 --> 00:06:01,660
your

74
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,700
daughter Alsia he is

75
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,300
considering

76
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,300
I will obey your order.

77
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,300
I heard that you are going to Zhengyang Palace to greet the Empress.

78
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,300
The Empress is humiliating you.

79
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,300
Who is making such a fuss?

80
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,900
The Empress is just a talker.

81
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,300
I am not good at making a sister.

82
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,300
If you don't make a fuss, I will.

83
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,100
Your Majesty.

84
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,900
It's the Empress who gave me a warning.

85
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,700
The Crown Prince has already been the late King of the County.

86
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,100
The more you are a real person, the more you will be punished.

87
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,500
It's just that he has been with me for many years.

88
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,700
It's not appropriate to be too generous.

89
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,500
Consort Xian's position is still in control.

90
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,300
Let him take over.

91
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,300
Consort Xian.

92
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,900
The Crown Prince has been deposed.

93
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,300
Will Noble Consort Yue be able to take over the position?

94
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,500
Of course.

95
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,100
Since the palace, I have always been a childe.

96
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,700
Jingyan is now the King of the Seven Trees.

97
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,700
Your position must be winning.

98
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,300
This is also a rule.

99
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,900
I don't allow you to withdraw.

100
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,900
I am a maid.

101
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,300
I don't care about the status.

102
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,900
As long as the sisters are together, everyone will be fine.

103
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Your Highness.

104
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,700
That's right.

105
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,900
Send her over.

106
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,700
Yes.

107
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,500
What is it?

108
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,100
It's the high-sugar medicine for blood circulation.

109
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,100
Sister Hui Fei has been very sensitive these past few days.

110
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,100
Her hands are very sore.

111
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,700
It's natural that she will feel better after taking some high-sugar medicine.

112
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,300
Why must she be very sensitive?

113
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,900
On the 15th of the month, she will be offering the Empress Dowager's Empress Dowager's Buddha-tang.

114
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,700
Her Highness the Empress is in a hurry. She will also be having double-discontinued.

115
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,100
She will naturally be more sensitive.

116
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Is the Empress still hard to comfort?

117
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,100
I also find it very strange.

118
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Sister Hui Fei is always in a hurry.

119
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,700
Why is the Empress...

120
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,500
Why?

121
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,900
You are so heartless.

122
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,100
Why is it that

123
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,100
this is not a matter of time?

124
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,100
Have you forgotten?

125
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,900
Back then, Empress and Hui Fei were both pregnant.

126
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,500
A few days before, they only had a few children left.

127
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,900
The two children were both ill at the same time.

128
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,100
Jing Ting was a little bit anxious,

129
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,300
but she grew up and became a person and survived.

130
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,900
But...

131
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,700
The Emperor was so stubborn. The Empress was naturally sad.

132
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,100
But at that time, the warmth that was suddenly cast in the mirror

133
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,700
was so natural.

134
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,900
How could it be that Sister Hui Fei was hurt?

135
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,500
If everyone can just say something like this,

136
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,700
but the brother in the heart

137
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,700
can't really speak clearly.

138
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,900
These years, the Empress,

139
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,500
she is not feeling well when she sees Hui Fei.

140
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,700
Jing Ting is even worse. I know that.

141
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,900
But Hui Fei is able to endure.

142
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,500
Jing Ting is also too peaceful.

143
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,900
The Empress is just a little bit difficult.

144
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,500
There is nothing to be afraid of.

145
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,700
So I don't care.

146
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,100
Your Majesty, Jing Ting has grown up.

147
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,300
Now, she has been a Prince of Zhengjing for years.

148
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,500
Sister Hui Fei is an older person in the palace.

149
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,100
If you have the time,

150
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,500
you should still persuade the Empress.

151
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,500
That strict character.

152
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
How can she do it with a strict condition?

153
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Don't worry. I have a way.

154
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,700
Oh, the case of Xuan Jing Si.

155
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,300
Because I was told that the royal family is in trouble,

156
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,700
I don't want the outside to have any personal reasons.

157
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,100
I still have to choose a prince to accept.

158
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,900
But Jing Nian has a body that is not suitable for her.

159
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,700
If you say it like this,

160
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,700
I think that

161
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,900
Jing Ting is suitable.

162
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,100
Your Majesty, you want Prince Ning to handle Xuan Jing Si?

163
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,900
Yes. Jing Ting is timid.

164
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,100
She definitely won't dare to make any mistakes.

165
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,100
But, for the Empress,

166
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,100
she will never make a big mistake.

167
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,700
She will let go of Xuan Jing Si and Prince Yu easily.

168
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:49,500
Let Jing Ting handle this case is no longer suitable.

169
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,900
Your Majesty, you are in charge.

170
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,100
Xia Jiang,

171
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,100
His Majesty is not satisfied with the two palaces that you put on the ground.

172
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,100
I will give you another chance to save the love.

173
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,300
But you know that His Majesty is not patient.

174
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,900
If you still can't admit your crime,

175
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,500
you should know what you are waiting for.

176
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,300
If His Majesty knows,

177
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,900
even you are Prince Jing's man.

178
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,100
How will he think?

179
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,100
You only admit that you are a man of the past.

180
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,700
After His Majesty sees it, he will just be cold-hearted.

181
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,900
In the next palace, you can only admit that I colluded with Prince Jing.

182
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,100
I will definitely turn to His Majesty.

183
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,300
By then, you will know what His Majesty will think.

184
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,900
In the future, one day, His Majesty will understand that

185
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,500
what I said is all true.

186
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,300
Then, the truth 13 years ago, do you dare to tell me everything?

187
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,300
Hold it.

188
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,900
If Lord shouusu substitute him for his death,

189
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,300
then it's fine to put out more time.

190
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:26,500
I have issued a question for both your ministers who were taken into custody.

191
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,900
You once questioning themкие for their defiance.

192
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,700
You needn't challenge them all!

193
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,300
I fought them all for a first class.

194
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,840
Ten.

195
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,100
I set a fire Mia Pierx.

196
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,340
It's for the bloody exhaust Germans.

197
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,680
You were chasing away the после höck.

198
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:59,640
I went through all the motoc

199
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,180
the two fucking masters not did any such thing.

200
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,580
Only if the emperor makes them accordingly,

201
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,940
my Yuan minister will slowly be in charge.

202
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Why are you the one who set the trap?

203
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,100
Are you the one who's still the one who's making a scene?

204
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,100
What a pity.

205
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,100
Everything is already late.

206
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
What's late?

207
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,100
Your two young masters only know the fate of the phoenixes.

208
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,100
But they forget that they know the official position of the court.

209
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,100
When they were in the first place, they said that it was only phoenixes.

210
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,100
So they're innocent.

211
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,100
Prince of Ning reported the words of the phoenixes to His Majesty.

212
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,100
His Majesty was furious and ordered the internal affairs to be taken seriously.

213
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
They couldn't resist.

214
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,100
They're dead.

215
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
D-Dead?

216
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,100
They were dead yesterday.

217
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Your Majesty.

218
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,100
Your Excellency.

219
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,100
You're completely self-righteous today.

220
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
You're a trusted official.

221
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
What's your opinion on His Majesty?

222
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,100
You should know it very well.

223
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,100
His Majesty is no longer interested in any news about you.

224
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,100
I'm sure he won't come to see you again.

225
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Before you die,

226
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,100
you should stay in this prison for a while.

227
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,100
I think you're not only guilty,

228
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
but you've prepared a pen for you.

229
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
You're free to do anything you want.

230
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Think about it.

231
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Think about it.

232
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Don't take all these into consideration

233
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,100
and become a criminal for your life.

234
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,100
Meng Zhi.

235
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Every time I'm in the prison,

236
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,100
I'm free.

237
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
If you're not free,

238
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,100
can you still stay here and be a traitor?

239
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
Greetings, Your Highness.

240
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,100
Greetings, Your Excellency.

241
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Your Highness, this is from the Palace of the Cicada.

242
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Father is still asleep.

243
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
I'll go see Mother first.

244
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Greetings, Your Highness.

245
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,100
A few days ago, my mother went to the Palace of the Cicada.

246
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
I thought of going to the Palace of the Cicada to greet her.

247
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
I didn't expect the Empress to be able to block her.

248
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
She said she was in the Palace of the Cicada.

249
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
Now, she's fine.

250
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,100
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

251
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,100
Everything is fine.

252
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
You two should go to the Hall of the Cicada.

253
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,100
Your Highness.

254
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,100
The Cicada has been sent to the Palace of the Cicada.

255
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,100
It's to pay for His Majesty's death.

256
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,100
The case is soon to be sent?

257
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,100
For me,

258
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
of course, it's not a problem.

259
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
But for His Majesty,

260
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
it's already sent.

261
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
All right.

262
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,100
It's a matter of time.

263
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
Just don't complain.

264
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
It's better to say it in front of the Prince of Jing.

265
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
If anyone else is there,

266
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,100
I won't let you down.

267
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,100
I'm just saying this in front of His Highness.

268
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,100
The outside building.

269
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
You two are all civil servants.

270
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Don't stand there.

271
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Go in.

272
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Yes, Your Highness.

273
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Very good.

274
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,100
As you said,

275
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
tomorrow, send a letter to Ming Zhao.

276
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,100
Tell the Central Academy to send it.

277
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,100
Directly avoid the end of the month.

278
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,100
I'm in charge.

279
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,100
Just follow the order.

280
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Yes, Your Highness.

281
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
The case of the Cicada.

282
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,100
The police have asked about it.

283
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,100
The Xia Jiang.

284
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
They'll be angry if they hear it.

285
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,100
The New Year's Day is not open.

286
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
But the big event is spread out.

287
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
It's all spread out.

288
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Everyone is waiting for it.

289
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,100
All right.

290
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,100
I'll do as they say.

291
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Tomorrow, I'll be in charge.

292
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,100
Did Xia Jiang admit his crime?

293
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
I've made it clear.

294
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
He doesn't admit it.

295
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
Xia Jiang is in a mess now.

296
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,100
He's just a little bit of a nuisance.

297
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
He told me in his memorial.

298
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,100
That Su Zhe is in charge of the Cicada.

299
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,100
He's the savior of the King of Qi.

300
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Do you believe it?

301
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,100
I grew up in the King of Qi's mansion.

302
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,100
If Su Zhe is the savior of the King of Qi,

303
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,100
how could I not know him?

304
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,100
Isn't that the truth?

305
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
It seems that Xia Jiang is indeed forced.

306
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
He's a traitor.

307
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,100
How could he be involved?

308
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,100
What His Majesty said

309
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,100
was the Su Zhe who was raised in the capital

310
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,100
and was respected as a guest.

311
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,100
Last year, when Princess Ni Huang was in charge of the cultural affairs,

312
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,100
I talked to her about it.

313
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,100
What a good news.

314
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,100
But after all, he's a man of the wild.

315
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,100
He's not a good man.

316
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Yes, it's him.

317
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,100
I asked you to visit him.

318
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100
By the way, please tell him to give you a message.

319
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,100
Have you ever been there?

320
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,100
I've been there once.

321
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,100
I was sick.

322
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
I didn't see anyone.

323
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,100
Then?

324
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
I haven't been there.

325
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,100
How can you teach me this?

326
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
You're the best.

327
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,100
I'll tell you the rest.

328
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,100
I'm just asking for the money.

329
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100
Jing Huan is better than you.

330
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
I've been here with Mr. Su.

331
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
Back then,

332
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,100
he used to defeat the three children of the White Household.

333
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,100
He was the guest in my house.

334
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,100
I'll send some gifts to Su Zhe in the next ten years.

335
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,100
Do you think that's enough?

336
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,100
Do you know that Su Rili,

337
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,100
how Jing Huan was able to defeat him?

338
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,100
Did you think that he was able to defeat him?

339
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,100
This time, they forced Su Zhe into Xuanjing Temple.

340
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,100
It seems that he didn't have the courage to defeat him.

341
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,100
They planned to take him away.

342
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,100
You're so brave that you didn't think that way.

343
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,100
It seems that Mr. Su doesn't know this.

344
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
To be honest,

345
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
I've talked to Mr. Su like Mr. Shen.

346
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,100
I've talked to Mr. Su before.

347
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,100
This person is very knowledgeable and unimaginable.

348
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,100
I'm impressed.

349
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,100
If I were to change my mind,

350
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
I'm afraid it's hard to use.

351
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,100
You're right.

352
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,100
But Su Zhe was involved in this accident

353
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,100
because of you.

354
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,100
You should have more chances to talk to him.

355
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,100
I hope so.

356
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,100
This person is very knowledgeable.

357
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
You've been away from the court for ten years.

358
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,100
I want you to be quick to do your best.

359
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
It's a good idea to talk to him about the security of the school.

360
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,100
But not only me,

361
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
but also the court officials shouldn't be too worried.

362
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Since you're going,

363
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
Shen Qing and Cai Qing will go with me.

364
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,100
We're all young and talented.

365
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,100
There's a good chance that we'll be able to make more mistakes.

366
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
You fool.

367
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,100
You still don't understand me.

368
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,100
You should go and ask Mr. Mei Changsu.

369
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,100
You should teach them both.

370
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,100
Isn't that what you're talking about?

371
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
What's wrong with talking about the school?

372
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
Okay, okay.

373
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,100
Forget it.

374
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,100
You can have it.

375
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,100
It seems that you're the only one

376
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,100
who's worried about you.

377
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Okay.

378
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,100
Prince Yu and Xiao Jinghuan

379
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,100
are both in the position of the High Priest.

380
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,100
They're both in the position of the King of the Pearls.

381
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
They're going to retire in three months.

382
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,100
They're going to close the school in three days.

383
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
I'll do as you say.

384
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
The Moon is good at power.

385
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,100
In the face of the Moon, the Noble Consort is in position.

386
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
She's going to change the second-hand Consort Xian.

387
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,100
Consort Jing is good at reading.

388
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,100
She's good at reading.

389
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,100
From the day she's up,

390
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,100
she's going to be the Noble Consort

391
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,100
and the first-hand Consort.

392
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
She's going to take the next day

393
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
to attend the ceremony.

394
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
Prince Jing,

395
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,100
all the princes are now in position to be the High Priest.

396
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,100
Consort Jing is in the palace and is in position to be the Noble Consort.

397
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,100
The fire is burning and the fire is burning.

398
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,100
It should make people happy.

399
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,100
But I don't know what's wrong.

400
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,100
I'm a little nervous.

401
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,100
I understand what you mean.

402
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,100
Today, I'm going to be the first-hand Consort Xian.

403
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,100
The Third Court has come to speak to me.

404
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,100
She asked me to tell you that the high priest is a little heavy.

405
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,100
It seems that the more you're at this time,

406
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,100
the more you need to close your eyes and keep an eye on her.

407
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
Prince Jing.

408
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,100
Where are you going?

409
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,100
I just came back from Mr. Su's place.

410
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,100
Mr. Su saw you?

411
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
I'm not a bad person.

412
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
I'm very strange.

413
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Is he all right?

414
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
No wonder he just came back.

415
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,100
He's not a bad person.

416
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
He's not a bad person.

417
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,100
He's not a bad person.

418
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
He's not a bad person.

419
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,100
He's not a bad person.

420
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,100
No wonder he just had a bad face.

421
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,100
He's sick.

422
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,100
Mother.

423
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,100
I want to ask you something.

424
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,100
I have something to ask you.

425
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,100
This is the reply Mr. Su wrote to my sister.

426
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,100
Do you want to know what it says?

427
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,100
Nonsense.

428
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
Since it's Mr. Su's personal letter to Princess Yihuang,

429
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,100
how can I read it?

430
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,100
I really want to know what it says.

431
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,100
But I don't dare to read it.

432
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
If you insist on reading it,

433
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,100
I can tell my sister that I didn't hold back your pressure.

434
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,100
Mother.

435
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,100
All right. I'm leaving.

436
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
I have a late-night class.

437
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
I'll take my leave.

438
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,100
Prince Jing,

439
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,100
have you been asking about the Lord of the Wood?

440
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
I want to ask him.

441
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
Is Wei Zheng in the Lord's Manor?

442
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
You mean,

443
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
Mr. Su has hidden Wei Zheng in the Wood Manor?

444
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
Mother just left the house.

445
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,100
She wanted to take it away.

446
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,100
It's obvious that she's in danger.

447
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,100
She can't tell me.

448
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,100
Forget it.

449
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,100
If you don't mind,

450
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,100
send someone to invite Lord Cai and Lord Shen to the Su's Manor.

451
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,100
Yes.

452
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
This...

453
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
Princess,

454
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,100
you're still enjoying the fight.

455
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
Let them fight again.

456
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
Brother Meng is a bit more powerful.

457
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,100
It's not a big deal if he's not powerful.

458
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,100
He can't even defeat Brother Meng.

459
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
Uncle Xiao,

460
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,100
you're really short-tempered.

461
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
You say it.

462
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,100
If you're not powerful, it's fine, right?

463
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,100
Stop staring.

464
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,100
Don't drink it.

465
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,100
I'm sorry.

466
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,100
Don't drink it.

467
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,100
Doctor Yan,

468
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,100
you're angry again?

469
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
People say that you're angry and sad.

470
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
You're always angry and angry.

471
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Why are you still so good?

472
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
I'm sorry to say that.

473
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,100
I've been angry for two months for you.

474
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Enough. Stop fighting.

475
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,100
Let Brother Meng enter the room.

476
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,100
He even let you touch his hair.

477
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,100
I've been practicing this for over a year.

478
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,100
You look much better.

479
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,100
You didn't let me in a while ago.

480
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,100
I was so worried.

481
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,100
I didn't tell you clearly when I was in a secret relationship.

482
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
I didn't want to stop you.

483
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,100
Even if Prince Jing wants to see you,

484
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,100
it's also a matter of friendship.

485
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,100
Why do you let people stop you?

486
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,100
When I was sleeping, I often said nonsense.

487
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,100
It made him sound bad.

488
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,100
Chief,

489
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,100
Prince Jing and the Ministry of Justice are in the door and are going to the school.

490
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
We'll come in a while.

491
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,100
I see.

492
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
Really?

493
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,100
You brought him here?

494
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,100
I heard from His Majesty that Prince Jing came to see you.

495
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,100
He said that he would bring the officials together.

496
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,100
I thought he wanted to take away His Majesty's doubts.

497
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,100
I didn't expect that he really brought Cai Quan and Shen Zui here.

498
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,100
Is there such a thing?

499
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,100
Actually, you don't have to be so concerned.

500
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,100
Concerned?

501
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
Shen Zui and Cai Quan

502
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,100
will be the only ones who will take care of the officials.

503
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,100
Now he brought them here.

504
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,100
He just wants to give me a way to the future.

505
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,100
I think

506
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,100
everything will be gone in the future.

507
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,100
It's better than that secret passage.

508
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
When the night is over,

509
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,100
it will disappear without a trace.

510
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,100
And I will gradually bring out the people's reality.

511
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,100
But Jing Yan is a very important person.

512
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,100
He brought these officials here to meet me.

513
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,100
He just wants to prepare a path of progress

514
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,100
for me, Mei Chang Su.

515
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,100
That's right.

516
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
This is Prince Jing's true nature.

517
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,100
It's not that you're not willing to do anything to him.

518
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
I'm not willing to do anything to Jing Yan.

519
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,100
We have the same goal.

520
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,100
No one is worthy of being the one to blame.

521
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,100
You can't say that.

522
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,100
You are...

523
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,100
All right.

524
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,100
They're coming in.

525
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,100
Go out and fight for Brother Meng.

526
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,100
Your Highness, are you going to give up

527
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,100
on the matter?

528
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
Xia Jiang is locked up in the prison.

529
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,100
Father has sent me as the twin prince.

530
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,100
The court officials are afraid of me.

531
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,100
How can I do that?

532
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,100
Prince Jing was implicated

533
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,100
in the case of that year.

534
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
He was almost released.

535
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,100
He was ungrateful.

536
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,100
He was only a prince in danger.

537
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,100
But now, you're still the king.

538
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
The Empress is still in the palace.

539
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,100
There's a certain power in the court.

540
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,100
Is it not as much as he was?

541
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,100
Let's not waste time.

542
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,100
Let's go, Your Highness.

543
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,100
Ban Ruo.

544
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
If I'm not the king,

545
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
will you still come to see me?

546
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,100
Yes.

547
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,100
If I'm expelled from the capital and become a citizen,

548
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
will you still come to see me?

549
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,100
Your Highness,

550
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
these are all fake news.

551
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
Why do you have to think about it?

552
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,100
You won't come, right?

553
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,100
You're right.

554
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,100
You're a devout.

555
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,100
You're a descendant of the Hua Clan.

556
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,100
You're under the responsibility of being unfulfilled.

557
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,100
You'll find someone worthy to assist you.

558
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,100
I'm afraid you won't come again.

559
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,100
It's not like that, Your Highness.

560
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,100
I'm tired.

561
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,100
I don't want to see you again.

562
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Your Highness,

563
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,100
I'm not a good person.

564
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,100
But you're not the one who's been in the dark.

565
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,100
Two months is the new government official's new job.

566
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,100
He's been giving orders to all the people in the world.

567
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
At that time, there will be a new person to enter the court.

568
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,100
You can be with your family again.

569
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,100
You can save He Shan at that time.

570
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,100
Ban Ruo.

571
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,100
The big thing is gone.

572
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,100
Mr. Su,

573
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,100
I don't know if you think this is a final decision.

574
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,100
Shen Qing.

575
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,100
You two have been sitting here for the whole afternoon.

576
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,100
And you had dinner.

577
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,100
Why are you still talking?

578
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,100
Mr. Su is already exhausted.

579
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,100
Please come again sometime.

580
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,100
It's already dark.

581
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,100
I've finished asking about the criminal case.

582
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
But I just started.

583
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,100
Both of you are the victims.

584
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:45,100
Wang Papa,

585
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,260
Please join us.

586
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,380
The first store in澳門, Yu Le Cheng 994466.

587
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,100
Come.

588
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,100
My motivation

589
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,380
is that I have a chance to be close to you.

590
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,700
No need to talk about it.

591
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,380
Please.

592
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,820
The final decision is the final decision.

593
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,340
What's your relationship with it?

594
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,580
I have nothing to do with it.

595
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,460
But the final decision

596
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,980
of the final decision is the most fierce decision

597
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,300
between the Crown Prince and Prince Yu.

598
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,740
The situation is different this year.

599
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,420
The whole court is looking at you.

600
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,420
But you are the Crown Prince.

601
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,500
Minister Shen is right.

602
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,500
The final decision is the final decision.

603
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,300
The test and the world

604
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,700
are all over the court this year.

605
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,820
Who will be the new position?

606
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,580
His Majesty will definitely seek

607
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,780
the opinion of the Crown Prince.

608
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,780
But how can he not?

609
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,060
I have been punished for three months.

610
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,700
Even if I want to be the final decision,

611
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,700
I will be helpless.

612
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,540
Without the Crown Prince and I,

613
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,420
the final decision of the final decision

614
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,060
will be given to my father by Prince Jing.

615
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,740
He will find a way to be the first to be the second.

616
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,500
Who can stop him?

617
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,660
Your Highness,

618
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,500
the Spring Festival will be the second season

619
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,180
of the Spring Festival.

620
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,020
The Spring Festival will be the second season

621
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,380
of the Spring Festival.

622
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,580
Your Highness,

623
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,820
have you heard what the White-Haired Man said?

624
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,860
I really don't want to fight anymore.

625
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,900
I am tired.

626
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,980
I am not fighting anymore.

627
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,460
Yes.

628
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,540
In order to win the title of the final decision,

629
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,780
the Crown Prince and Prince Yu

630
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,860
have never fought against the blood flow.

631
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,820
The chosen one

632
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,900
will naturally consider the interests of the masters.

633
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,540
So, the Crown Prince is very confident.

634
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,500
Even if there are some final decisions,

635
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,660
it will be a great success.

636
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,580
The chosen one must be the final decision.

637
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,260
Of course, it is because the final decision is not right.

638
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,220
As long as we can choose the final decision

639
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,860
of the final decision,

640
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,660
can we not kill the Y-Feng?

641
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,220
Your Highness, you are right.

642
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,860
There is a person who is a little bit selfish.

643
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,460
He must not be the final decision.

644
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,840
he is almost left,

645
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,260
he is in the line.

646
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,860
He will take the scores.

647
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,900
Oh, My.

648
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,660
Why?

649
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,340
Am I wrong?

650
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,140
Your Highness,

651
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,180
many years down the não bene school year,

652
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,660
you'd likely be not very clear about that.

653
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,700
The strong cry of natives

654
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,980
is quite complex,

655
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,460
with low ப childe,

656
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,460
It's not just a single case.

657
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,580
No matter who will be the judge,

658
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,740
if you want to stop the flow of the flow,

659
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,380
you must be able to endure all kinds of pressure.

660
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,620
You must also ensure that the Qinglian Palace

661
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,300
will not be found by someone.

662
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,180
Not only that,

663
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,500
the position of this person is not too low.

664
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,060
You must have the ability to balance the world's crown prince

665
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,460
to serve people.

666
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,340
Your Highness, look.

667
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,220
This person must have the ability

668
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:13,220
and the determination to fight against all kinds of people.

669
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,820
He must also have the ability to choose one of the most difficult.

670
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,020
Moreover,

671
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,460
there are 18 negative evidences.

672
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,900
You two are talking about it.

673
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,100
Are you going to let His Highness break the love affairs

674
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,380
and ask for power?

675
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,980
If you don't limit the love affairs,

676
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,780
will you let His Highness

677
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,380
kill a blood-sucking dragon to make the whole system?

678
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,420
The situation is that

679
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,900
if His Highness is not tolerant enough,

680
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,900
then this matter will not continue.

681
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,580
But if His Highness is too tolerant,

682
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,220
I'm afraid you will feel uncomfortable.

683
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,220
His Majesty won't ask me for responsibility.

684
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,980
If he asks me, I will obey his will.

685
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,620
Then let's take a look at

686
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,740
the 18 negative evidences.

687
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,100
What do you think?

688
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,540
Your Highness, don't look at me.

689
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,100
My mother is a princess of Qinghe.

690
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,100
She is very complicated.

691
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,460
She has a lot of friends in Qingpeng.

692
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,740
She is not very good at fighting.

693
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,460
She can only hide in the light of the light.

694
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,340
I'm not afraid.

695
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,740
His Highness only sent me there.

696
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,740
I dare to go there.

697
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,540
All right.

698
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,860
Then the 18 negative evidences

699
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,860
will be based on the number of dishes.

700
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,860
I'm not sure.

701
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,980
Are you satisfied?

702
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,980
Yes.

703
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,980
18 dishes for 18 dishes?

704
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,980
You are going to kill someone?

705
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,980
What about the people in the central government?

706
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,940
How about I recommend someone to you?

707
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,740
Who?

708
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,500
Cheng Zhi Ji.

709
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Who is he?

710
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Feng Ge Ge Lao, Cheng Zhi Ji.

711
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,500
You are talking about Cheng Ge Lao?

712
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,900
My goodness.

713
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,060
He is almost 80 years old.

714
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,220
How can he be so old?

715
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,700
He is only 75 years old.

716
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,700
He is only 75 years old.

717
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,700
He is only 75 or 80 years old.

718
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:35,700
Anyway, this old man has been raising me for many years.

719
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,700
He never used such an old man.

720
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,700
Although he is the son of the court,

721
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,300
he is still a righteous imperial court official.

722
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,700
He is absolutely qualified to be elected as the central government official.

723
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,460
Lei Chang's

724
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,700
Lei Chang Su's money loss

725
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,700
is that plausible?

726
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,700
No, it's almost impossible.

727
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,700
His Highness even took an envoy to see him.

728
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Impossible.

729
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,900
The real antidote is beyond the Norwegian Empire's perception.

730
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,900
I don't even know where Xia Chun is.

731
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,900
Could there be a master next to him?

732
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,900
Wu Jin is a secret drug in Xuanjing Temple.

733
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,900
No one in the world knows about it.

734
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,900
It's impossible for someone to make a antidote within a few days.

735
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,900
It's so strange.

736
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,900
What about the Prince Yu?

737
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,900
Prince Yu has been gone for a long time.

738
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,900
I've followed him for so many years.

739
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,900
I've never seen him like this before.

740
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,900
Prince Yu is always so capable.

741
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,900
Why is he so ungrateful?

742
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,900
Even if he's been changed,

743
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,900
he's still a prince.

744
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
For Prince Yu,

745
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,900
if he can't be the Crown Prince,

746
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,900
then his identity,

747
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,900
whether he's a prince or a figure,

748
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,900
is actually not different.

749
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,900
He's so wild.

750
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
Unfortunately, in his mind,

751
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,900
Chu Jun's choice has never been made.

752
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,900
I understand.

753
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,900
Why doesn't he understand?

754
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,900
Prince Yu can give up.

755
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,900
We can't give up.

756
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,900
Otherwise, even if we enter the hell,

757
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,900
we can't tell the master about you.

758
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,900
But now that Prince Yu is gone,

759
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,900
our goal is even more unimaginable.

760
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,900
I don't want to.

761
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:06,900
I don't want to.

762
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:20,900
The Princess Xuanjing left you a tight barrier, right?

763
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,900
Yes.

764
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,900
The master said that when you're not happy,

765
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,900
you should open it.

766
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,900
What about Jin Nang?

767
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,900
Bai Ruo has always been with him.

768
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,900
Open it.

769
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,900
Now?

770
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,900
Isn't it still not too late?

771
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,900
If I miss the chance to break through the Spring and Summer Crescent,

772
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,900
we're really done.

773
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,900
Open it.

774
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:27,900
No need to think about it.

775
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,900
It's not that I'm curious about it.

776
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

777
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:42,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

778
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

779
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

780
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

781
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

782
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

783
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

784
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

785
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

786
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

787
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

788
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

789
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

790
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

791
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

792
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

793
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

794
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

795
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

796
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

797
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

798
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

799
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

800
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

801
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

802
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

803
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

804
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

805
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

806
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

807
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

808
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

809
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

810
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

811
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

812
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

813
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

814
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

815
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

816
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

817
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

818
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

819
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,900
I'm just a little bit worried.

820
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,900
I'm just a little bit worried.
