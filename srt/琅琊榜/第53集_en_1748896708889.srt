00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,480
I thought

6
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,820
that all my suitable to be invited

7
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,740
to enjoy a great attention

8
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,580
please let me grieve

00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,900
Mechan freue

10
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,660
You?

11
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,880
Bid it

12
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:48,860
Your Majesty.

13
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,360
Get off.

14
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,360
What do you think this is?

15
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,860
Let's go to the city!

16
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,660
The rest of them are dead.

17
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,660
Please follow the manual of the Nambian people.

18
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Follow him.

19
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,860
He...

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
You can't say anything.

21
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,660
You want me to be saved in the past ten years?

22
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,660
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
Your Majesty.

24
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,160
This case is not only about Xie Yu's crime.

25
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,660
It's also about the rule of the imperial court.

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,660
If you don't take it seriously,

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,160
I will speak my mind.

28
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,460
The person who hurt him is the one you know and the one who is stable in the country.

29
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,960
I will ask Your Majesty to take the case.

30
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,160
I will review the case.

31
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,660
Your Majesty.

32
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,660
I will take the case.

33
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,160
I will take the case.

34
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
I will not take it seriously.

35
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,660
If you don't take it seriously,

36
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,660
I will review the case.

37
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,660
It's the simplest way to review the case.

38
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,660
How dare you!

39
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
Mother.

40
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,160
Mother.

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,160
Do you want to rebel?

42
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,160
I will take the case.

43
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
Your Majesty.

44
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,660
As what the palace princess said,

45
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,660
it's clear that the case is clear.

46
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,660
The case should be reviewed.

47
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,160
But I don't understand why you hesitate.

48
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,660
As you said,

49
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,660
I will take the case.

50
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,660
I will take the case.

51
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,660
Your Majesty.

52
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,660
I will take the case.

53
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,660
You are all relatives.

54
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,160
You are all relatives.

55
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
Who is it?

56
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Who asked you to come to me like this?

57
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
Who asked you to come to me like this?

58
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
Your Majesty.

59
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Qiu Yan.

60
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,160
In the name of Your Majesty.

61
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,160
As I 새蟲 memory,

62
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,060
Your Majesty should try once more.

63
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:46,420
Well, O drivers, during the accident or in aSC, were more fine than lost.

64
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,280
Well, in the end, I'm the right guy.

65
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,720
you?

66
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,340
Jane Paul

67
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,140

эн

72
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,820
who

73
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,100
loves

74
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,920
yourself

75
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,360
All of you in front of me...

76
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,640
what are we doing here?

77
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240
Who прост?

78
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,760
Out of all,

79
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,720
our time and effort

80
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,880
are yours.

81
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,400
Read this.

82
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
The two of them are in the same boat.

83
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,920
They are now in the same boat.

84
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Why are you two going to get back together?

85
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,920
This case is a matter of truth.

86
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
It's a crime of innocence.

87
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
It's not just a crime of two people.

88
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Then who else are you going to punish?

89
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,920
This case is a big crime.

90
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,920
There are criminals and there are losers.

91
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,920
You must be responsible for this.

92
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,920
There are losers and losers.

93
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
Who the hell are you talking about?

94
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Teacher Zhen, you didn't agree?

95
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,920
You want to force the child to do it?

96
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Jingyan has been taught to be the emperor since childhood.

97
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
He has been taught by many.

98
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,920
He is the eldest brother of the Great Liang River.

99
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
He was not doing anything.

100
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Jingyan, the eldest brother of the Great Liang River,

101
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
he didn't do anything.

102
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Jingyan wouldn't do anything.

103
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
You wouldn't?

104
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
What about him?

105
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,920
If Mr. Su's talent is not there,

106
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,920
I'm afraid I can't see the situation now.

107
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,920
Do you think that at this moment,

108
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,920
you can't bear to say anything?

109
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
You don't say anything?

110
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
In the 26th year of Jingyun,

111
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
His Majesty was the prince.

112
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,920
He was killed by the people.

113
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
It was your intention to kill him.

114
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Later, the commander of the Chiyan Sect, Ling Xie,

115
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,920
tried to find the evidence and face the emperor.

116
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,920
Then he saved His Majesty's life.

117
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
In the 29th year of Jingyun,

118
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,920
the King of Wuhang was in the capital.

119
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,920
At that time, Ling Shui was still a commander in the patrol.

120
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,920
He led 300 cavalry to the army.

121
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,920
He was finally able to protect His Majesty.

122
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Shut up!

123
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
You shut up!

124
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
It's been ten years.

125
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
He's been a commander in the patrol.

126
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,920
And Ling Shui has been the king of the capital.

127
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,920
He fought for three days to secure the capital.

128
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,920
No matter who is the leader or who is the minister,

129
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
Ling Shui never gave up on His Majesty.

130
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
The crown prince and the ministers have been together.

131
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
It's not just a fact that wants to return to the past.

132
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,920
Why is the emperor so eager to do so?

133
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
He can't even accept the request of the Qing Dynasty.

134
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
You...

135
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Who are you?

136
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
You're not the minister!

137
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
You're...

138
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,920
You're the one who killed the minister, the thief, right?

139
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
Come on! Kill him!

140
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Kill him!

141
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
You're the thief!

142
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
You're the one who killed the minister!

143
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,920
You're the thief!

144
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Take your hands off him!

145
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
You're the thief!

146
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Your Majesty!

147
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Your Majesty!

148
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Your Majesty!

149
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Your Majesty!

150
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
Your Majesty!

151
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Your Majesty!

152
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
You're the thief!

153
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
You bastard!

154
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
This...

155
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
Get out!

156
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Get out!

157
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Don't think that I won't kill you.

158
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,920
If I kill you, there will be a new crown tomorrow.

159
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
You can kill me.

160
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,920
You can kill all the people who want to investigate this case.

161
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Because you are the king.

162
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,920
But when you kill all the people,

163
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,920
you are still the king of the high-ranking king.

164
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,920
I always treat you as my brother.

165
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,920
But I will never be your second brother.

166
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,920
不要激 supported

167
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Wan Chen Zui Ci...

168
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
I'm a thief.

169
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Brother.

170
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,920
I'm a thief.

171
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
I'm a thief.

172
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
I'm a thief.

173
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
I'm a thief.

174
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,920
I'm a thief.

175
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,920
I'm a thief.

176
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,920
I'm a thief.

177
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
I'm a thief.

178
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,920
I'm a thief.

179
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,920
I'm a thief.

180
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
I'm a thief.

181
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
I'm a thief.

182
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,920
I'm a thief.

183
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
I'm a thief.

184
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
I'm a thief.

185
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,920
I'm a thief.

186
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
I'm a thief.

187
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
I'm a thief.

188
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
I'm a thief.

189
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
I'm a thief.

190
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
I'm a thief.

191
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
I'm a thief.

192
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
I'm a thief.

193
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,920
You lost yourochakedon

194
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,880
immediately after that ocksåa

195
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,840
on youth

196
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
who goes and

197
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,120
and

198
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Mr. Xu

199
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,920
Xiowei

200
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,660
aggi

201
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,660
Although I am the King of Tang,

202
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,660
I have been so determined by him.

203
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,660
So determined!

204
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:46,660
You dare to come and see me?

205
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:54,660
Your Majesty.

206
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,660
Crown Prince.

207
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,660
It's just that I have been so desperate to get back to my old love.

208
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,660
It's not a big deal.

209
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:12,660
What does His Majesty plan to do with the military power?

210
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:22,660
You two have been so desperate to get back to your old love.

211
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,660
I am so blind.

212
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:34,660
How dare I do something so unfilial to you?

213
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,660
Let's be considerate.

214
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,660
But there is one thing that you should know.

215
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:49,660
The case of the trial will be postponed to blood.

216
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,660
Other than our plan,

217
00:18:53,660 --> 00:19:02,660
there is another more important reason.

218
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,660
What is the reason?

219
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,660
The truth.

220
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,660
The truth is like this.

221
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,660
Your Majesty is the King.

222
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,660
As long as you don't want to know the truth,

223
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,660
no one can force you.

224
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,660
But even if you are the King of Tang,

225
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,660
there is something you can't do.

226
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,660
For example,

227
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,660
you can't influence the world's conscience.

228
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,660
You can't change the rules of the future.

229
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,660
You can't stop it.

230
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:49,660
I am here in your dream to save you.

231
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,660
Your Majesty,

232
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:57,660
have you ever dreamt of my sister?

233
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,660
I dreamt of Princess Jingyang.

234
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,660
I dreamt of the King of Qi.

235
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,660
Shut up.

236
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,660
Why did you come to me?

237
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,660
It's all because of Xia Jiang and Xi Yu.

238
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:21,660
I believe that even a person like Xia Jiang

239
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:27,660
has a person who doesn't dare to dream.

240
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,660
That's a good point.

241
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,660
Xia Jiang didn't say anything wrong.

242
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,660
He came back.

243
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:45,660
All this is because of him.

244
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,660
He came back.

245
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,660
Right?

246
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,660
What's the point of being right?

247
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,660
Xia Jiang is not a traitor.

248
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,660
I am not a traitor.

249
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,660
You only need to know these two points.

250
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,660
If it's not the black and white,

251
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,660
why do you need to know more?

252
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,660
Don't you think

253
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,660
the love between the father and the son

254
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,660
and the love between the father and the son

255
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:25,660
are all because of you?

256
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,660
Shut up.

257
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,660
I don't want to hear you talk.

258
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,660
Stop.

259
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Stop.

260
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,660
Stop.

261
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,660
Stop.

262
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,660
Your Majesty, what's the situation outside?

263
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,660
Your Highness, you're leaving the palace.

264
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,660
Where are the officials?

265
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,660
Your Majesty, there's no one left.

266
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,660
Your Majesty,

267
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,660
do you want to summon the Crown Prince to the palace?

268
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,660
No.

269
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,660
I'm not the Crown Prince.

270
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,660
It's Su Zhe.

271
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,660
If he comes in,

272
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,660
I'll kill him.

273
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,660
Kill him.

274
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,660
Yes.

275
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,660
Yes.

276
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,660
Yes.

277
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,660
If you don't want to see him,

278
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,660
don't go in.

279
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,660
When he was a child,

280
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,660
he was just a uncle who loved me.

281
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,660
But now, there's only blood and hatred between me and him.

282
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,660
Uncle.

283
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,660
He can't stop me

284
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,660
from re-examining the old case.

285
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,660
Don't worry.

286
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,660
Let me go in and talk with him.

287
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,660
Your Majesty.

288
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

289
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,660
I remember the first time

290
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,660
I asked you

291
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,660
if you had come to the capital.

292
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,660
What exactly did you come to the capital for?

293
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,660
You said

294
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,660
you were watching the two brothers

295
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,660
for Jingxuan and Jinghuan.

296
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,660
You had to do it, right?

297
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,660
That's true.

298
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:06,660
But it's not the truth.

299
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,660
Everything was under your control.

300
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,660
I had the guts to tell you the truth.

301
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,660
Now?

302
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,660
I'm in the palace of Chuimu.

303
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,660
I can't move a single soldier.

304
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,660
So you

305
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,660
don't need to do anything else.

306
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,660
Your Majesty, you're still His Majesty.

307
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,660
I'm still looking forward to your

308
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,660
success.

309
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,660
Am I

310
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,660
the one who turned the case over

311
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,660
to make it a success?

312
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,660
Yes.

313
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,660
The Crown Prince is now

314
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,660
in charge of the entire court.

315
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,660
I'm

316
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,660
not in a hurry.

317
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,660
Why don't you wait until I die

318
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,660
and turn the case over?

319
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,660
Because it's different.

320
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,660
What's different?

321
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,660
It's different for the Prince of Qi.

322
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,660
He's been in there for a long time.

323
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,660
Your Majesty, now

324
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,660
you can't take the little book anymore.

325
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,660
Tell me.

326
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,660
On Mount Jiouan,

327
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,660
why didn't you take action?

328
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,660
Your Majesty, you're asking about this?

329
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,660
Consort Chen,

330
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,660
Prince of Qi,

331
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,660
Princess of Jingyang,

332
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,660
you're the one who

333
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,660
turned the case over to the Crown Prince.

334
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,660
You're the one who turned the case over.

335
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,660
Those who died

336
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,660
are not related to His Majesty.

337
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,660
They're not His Majesty's family.

338
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,660
But when someone

339
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,660
turned the case over to them,

340
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,660
His Majesty was thinking about something.

341
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,660
I don't believe it!

342
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,660
Are you just trying to turn the case over?

343
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,660
Especially you.

344
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,660
I don't believe it.

345
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,660
From the time that

346
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
Princess of Liyang's eldest princess

347
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,660
was in prison to now,

348
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,660
it's been a few hours.

349
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,660
Don't you want to see

350
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,660
the Xie Yu's surgery?

351
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,660
Is the truth

352
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,660
really related to His Majesty?

353
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,660
Your eldest son,

354
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,660
your flesh and bones,

355
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,660
how he was killed

356
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,660
by the dead

357
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,660
is really

358
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,660
not in your heart.

359
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,660
How dare you!

360
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,660
How dare you!

361
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,660
I've seen this surgery.

362
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,660
How did the Marshal get killed?

363
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,660
How did the King of Qi

364
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,660
get killed in prison?

365
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,660
Every single one of them

366
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,660
has a clear and detailed description.

367
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,660
I've taken a look.

368
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,660
Your Majesty, do you want to see it?

369
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,660
No.

370
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,660
Or I can read it to you.

371
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,660
No!

372
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,660
I don't want you!

373
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,660
I...

374
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,660
I don't want to hear it.

375
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,660
I don't want you!

376
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,660
Your Majesty,

377
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,660
do you want to hear it

378
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,660
or don't want to hear it?

379
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,660
Before the King of Qi died,

380
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,660
the King of Qi

381
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,660
had the Zhao Shou

382
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,660
who killed His Majesty

383
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,660
read it three times.

384
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,660
He only said it

385
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,660
after he heard it.

386
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,660
I don't know the son.

387
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,660
I don't know the father.

388
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,660
He was blinded

389
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,660
and had a poison in his eyes.

390
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,660
Do you know

391
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,660
what this means?

392
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,660
Your Majesty, if you know the King of Qi,

393
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,660
you won't suspect

394
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,660
he's a traitor.

395
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,660
If you know the King of Qi,

396
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,660
you won't believe it

397
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,660
until you die.

398
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,660
You'll kill him.

399
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,660
Your Majesty,

400
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,660
do you have any complaints

401
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,660
about the Marshal

402
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,660
and the King of Qi?

403
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,660
Do you have any complaints?

404
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,660
He's a traitor.

405
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,660
He's a traitor.

406
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,660
That's the truth.

407
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,660
I sent a man

408
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,660
who was supposed to be

409
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,660
the King of Qi.

410
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,660
He was born

411
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,660
and he was always

412
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,660
saying

413
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,660
he's not worthy

414
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,660
of the military power.

415
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,660
How can I congratulate him?

416
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,660
And the King of Qi,

417
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,660
he's a traitor

418
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,660
and a traitor.

419
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,660
People every day

420
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,660
come to play

421
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,660
SI tienen to toilet Thanks to heaven's będą

422
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:16,660
Sell out

423
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:26,660
And bet the affordable

424
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,660
So be it.

425
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,660
Now

426
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:31,860
where does he

427
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,660
Turn to the farm?

428
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,980
The world of the emperor!

429
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,780
The world?

430
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,820
It's the world of the people!

431
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,620
If there's no people,

432
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,380
who will be the emperor?

433
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,220
If there's no emperor, who will be the emperor?

434
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,100
The war was fought in the front.

435
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,100
You were far away from the capital.

436
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,180
You only wanted to eat and eat

437
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,180
and then you drew a sword.

438
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,100
In the emperor's heart,

439
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,460
I'm afraid there's only the throne.

440
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,820
How could there be a world?

441
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,740
Smooth 멋있ables

442
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:13,620
is the emperor's所有灵而

443
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,500
If he makes the perfect in his hands,

444
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,340
the emperor does not end at the saintly face.

445
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,700
This is no tough choice for him.

446
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,820
What kind of tragedy is in your heart?

447
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,820
I'm afraid you can't understand it.

448
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,820
But even if it's for the sake of the father's love,

449
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,820
for the sake of the King of Qi's death,

450
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,820
to find out the truth about the innocence of the past,

451
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,820
is it that hard?

452
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,820
Can't you do it?

453
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,820
I'm not innocent.

454
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,820
As long as I'm sitting on this dragon chair,

455
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,820
people will change.

456
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,820
Remember,

457
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,820
no matter how many years you have,

458
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,820
you will never change.

459
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,820
You will never change.

460
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,820
You will never change.

461
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,820
No matter what it is,

462
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,820
when he's sitting on this throne,

463
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,820
he will change.

464
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,820
The people's blood,

465
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,820
the court he wanted,

466
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,820
the world he wanted,

467
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,820
I can't give him.

468
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,820
King of Qi can't give him.

469
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,820
No one can give him.

470
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,820
His Majesty is lost in the position of the King of Qi.

471
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,820
He lost his heart.

472
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,820
But it's not that easy.

473
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,820
As a father,

474
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,820
you don't know the King of Qi,

475
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,820
and you don't know the Jingyan.

476
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,820
Let's go.

477
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,820
All right.

478
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,820
What you want,

479
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,820
I promise

480
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,820
I will do it again.

481
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,820
Then

482
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,820
I will tell the world

483
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,820
myself.

484
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,820
It's just my condition.

485
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,820
No matter what,

486
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,820
Jingyan

487
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,820
is my son.

488
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,820
But you

489
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,820
don't want it.

490
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,820
The blood of Shi Yan

491
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,820
has been left too much.

492
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,820
I can't let Lin Shu

493
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,820
let you

494
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,820
stand on the throne

495
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,820
and stand in front of me

496
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,820
and in front of the people of Qi.

497
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,820
Do you understand?

498
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,820
All right.

499
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,820
I promise.

500
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,820
What about Jingyan?

501
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,820
He won't be willing to do it.

502
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,820
How can you persuade him?

503
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,820
His Majesty will never let Lin Shu

504
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,820
go back to the court.

505
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,820
Otherwise,

506
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,820
the world will be in a lot of trouble

507
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,820
to punish His Majesty.

508
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,820
I've thought about it long time ago.

509
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,820
Lin Shu didn't want to be here.

510
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,820
As for how to persuade Jingyan,

511
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,820
it's my business.

512
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,820
From now on,

513
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,820
we don't need to see each other again.

514
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,820
Wait.

515
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,820
You have to believe

516
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,820
I'm

517
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,820
a fool.

518
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,820
Lin Xi

519
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,820
has been serving me for ten years.

520
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,820
Your mother,

521
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,820
Jingyang,

522
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,820
is my real sister.

523
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,820
I've been

524
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,820
with you for ten years.

525
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,820
I've been

526
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,820
with you for ten years.

527
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,820
Do you remember?

528
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,820
I remember.

529
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:50,820
Your Majesty,

530
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,820
the Princess of Liyang

531
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,820
has reported to the court

532
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,820
that she has been

533
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,820
the first to be a courtier.

534
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,820
The Crown Prince

535
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,820
has sent a review of the case.

536
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,820
He ordered that

537
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,820
Marquis Yan

538
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,820
and the Court of Judicial Review

539
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,820
to review the case.

540
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,820
He has re-reviewed the evidence

541
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,820
and asked the court to review the case.

542
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,820
He has returned the justice to the world.

543
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,820
That's all.

544
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,820
I accept the decree.

545
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,820
I accept the decree.

546
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,820
Please stand up.

547
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,820
Your Majesty.

548
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,820
The criminal is in the river.

549
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,820
The criminal is in the river.

550
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,820
You can review it anytime.

551
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,820
Please remember.

552
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,820
I only want the truth.

553
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,820
I only want the truth.

554
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,820
I only want the truth.

555
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,820
I only want the truth.

556
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,820
I don't want any unnecessary actions.

557
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,820
I don't want any vicious acts.

558
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,820
I believe that you can do it.

559
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,820
Yes.

560
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,820
Yes.

561
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,820
The case was finalized in a month.

562
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,820
I thank you for your report.

563
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,820
I can't stand it anymore.

564
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,820
I've been in charge of the case.

565
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,820
Who would have thought

566
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,820
that the hundred-year-old man

567
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,820
and the King of the Xins

568
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,820
would be so loyal to the court.

569
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,820
Please let the hand of the dirty house

570
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,820
bury him.

571
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,820
If it wasn't for the Crown Prince

572
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,820
who was so stubborn in his heart,

573
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,820
I'm afraid the bloodshed

574
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,820
will never see him again.

575
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,820
Yes.

576
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,820
The Crown Prince has been in charge of this case.

577
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,820
But he never interfered with the interrogation.

578
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,820
It can be seen that in his heart,

579
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,820
he is so devoted to the brotherhood

580
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,820
and the spirit of the Lin family.

581
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,820
What are you thinking, Marquis Yuan?

582
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,820
I'm thinking if Su Zhe will...

583
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,820
Forget it.

584
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,820
Nothing.

585
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,820
The Crown Prince is here.

586
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,820
Yes.

587
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,820
What are you thinking about?

588
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,820
I was worried about the day

589
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,820
the palace was in the court.

590
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,820
I was worried that if you were to be released

591
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,820
from the court,

592
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,820
you wouldn't be able to do it.

593
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,820
I've been in charge of the case for three years.

594
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,820
I'm worried that the heart will be a little loose.

595
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,820
I just want to see

596
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,820
if I can be satisfied

597
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,820
at the last moment.

598
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,820
Since the result is already in the palm of my hand,

599
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,820
what's the difference between the breath being loose and not loose?

600
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,820
Don't talk about this.

601
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,820
I don't know about you.

602
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,820
What do you know about me?

603
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,820
You can hold it.

604
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,820
It's not that you're really calm and calm.

605
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,820
It's because you're not really

606
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,820
able to relax at all.

607
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,820
Right?

608
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,820
You're scared.

609
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,820
You're scared that when everyone is happy,

610
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,820
you can't hold it.

611
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,820
You're going to be sad all of a sudden, right?

612
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,820
So you're thinking about

613
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,820
holding it for a few more months.

614
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,820
Even if it's just a few days,

615
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,820
it's better than just a case.

616
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,820
People will die.

617
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,820
I don't trust your medical skills.

618
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,820
Since it's not like that,

619
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,820
then believe me.

620
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,820
Don't give yourself a limit.

621
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,820
Don't think about

622
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,820
whether you can hold it for five months

623
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,820
or ten months.

624
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,820
As long as you try your best,

625
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,820
I'll do my best.

626
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,820
Good.

627
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,820
Good.

628
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,820
I'm sorry.

629
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,820
I'm sorry.

630
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,820
I'm sorry.

631
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,820
I'm sorry.

632
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,820
I'm sorry.
