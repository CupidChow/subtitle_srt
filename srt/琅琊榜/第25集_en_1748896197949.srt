1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The King of the Gods

2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 11

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No matter what,

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
if it wasn't for the father's feelings,

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
such a word

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
would only be used to summon the King of the Gods

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and investigate you.

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What's the point of...

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I hate that I wasn't in the country at that time.

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Fortunately, you weren't in the country at that time.

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Otherwise, it would be hard to get back to the country.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm here.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Although I'm going to win this time,

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
the King will take care of it.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm afraid it's not easy to get back to this case.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why don't you listen to me?

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let go of your hand.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't be here anymore.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're right.

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You're indeed a good man.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But if I really let go of my hand,

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
what else can I say?

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What Xie Yu said is just a beginning.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How can I get to this conclusion step by step?

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If I don't find out the truth,

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm afraid it's hard to get back to this.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I know you're thinking about it.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You're looking into it.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You must learn this old trick.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Please do me a favor.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Do you know that

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
once His Majesty finds out that you're investigating the King's old case,

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
he will surely find out that you're a poor man.

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I know.

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Do you know that

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
even if you find out the truth,

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
you won't be able to figure out what you're looking for.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I know.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Do you know that once His Majesty finds out the truth,

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
he won't admit his mistake?

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I know.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Since you know it all,

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
you must investigate.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Investigate?

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I must know how they died in Han Yuan.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
In this way,

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll have the throne

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
and I'll be able to sacrifice them.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll only think about it

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and think about it.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll only think about it

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and think about it.

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But I don't see my brother's death.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is not the first thing I've done.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm the one who's responsible for your death.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Your Highness must obey my order.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
From now on,

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I will do my best

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
to find out the truth for Your Highness.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The first thing I want to do is

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
to make sure that

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I have the chance to

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
get the throne.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll be back.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll be back.

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll be back.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll be back.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll be back.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll be back.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll be back.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll be back.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll be back.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll be back.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll be back.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll be back.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll be back.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll be back.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll be back.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll be back.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll be back.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll be back.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll be back.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll be back.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll be back.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'll be back.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll be back.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll be back.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll be back.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll be back.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll be back.

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll be back.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll be back.

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll be back.

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll be back.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll be back.

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How many lives?

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
27 lives.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sure there are 27 lives in the palace.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I guess it's a great cause.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I was not even the queen mother.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I guess it's...

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,180
f

105
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,720
Nwongshuo

106
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,000
Nwongshuo

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,920
Veng.

108
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,120
Chui.

109
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,640
Grandma czai.

110
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,760
Good girl.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Fire!

112
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Fire!

113
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Fire!

114
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Fire!

115
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Fire!

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Fire!

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Fire!

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Fire!

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Fire!

120
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Su Gui's wife has left.

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
She didn't wait for me to go back to see her.

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Although the Chief can't guard the camp,

123
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I think the funeral ceremony will be held in three days.

124
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And the Imperial Palace and the Kouling will be held in a big camp.

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But it's a long time ago.

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I can't do anything.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can't do anything else.

128
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I can only ask Dr. Yan to help me.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's all I can do.

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The Imperial Palace

131
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The Imperial Palace

132
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Jing Ran, have a bite.

133
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Jing Ran, have a bite.

134
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's okay.

135
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Look at Jing Xuan and Jing Huan.

136
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Have some.

137
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll do it.

138
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm willing to do it.

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Brother San, you're not feeling well.

140
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You should eat something.

141
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Grandma won't blame you.

142
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm going to go and see my mom.

143
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm going to see my mom.

144
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Brother Shen, did you hear that?

145
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What did you hear?

146
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Your Majesty sent a prince to send a prince to the Empress Dowager's house.

147
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Is he Prince Jing?

148
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know.

149
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But from the filial piety of these thirty days,

150
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
why shouldn't he be Prince Jing?

151
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You saw it, too?

152
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Who didn't see it?

153
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The Crown Prince and Prince Yu are very close.

154
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's hard to stand the filial piety of Yan Ke.

155
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But it should be a decree.

156
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It can't be too much.

157
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Prince Jing only has the status of Prince Ju.

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
He didn't used to stand with these two before.

159
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But he still didn't feel it.

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
These thirty days, we're all in the same school.

161
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Compared to that,

162
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
the difference is really big.

163
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Do you think the difference is better or worse?

164
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What do you think?

165
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Go!

166
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Princess, take the medicine.

167
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'll take it.

168
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Fei Liu.

169
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You're back.

170
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I came to comfort your mother.

171
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You saw her?

172
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Your mother's smile...

173
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
is very sweet.

174
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But I'm not here.

175
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You've been here

176
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
for the second night of visitation.

177
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
After I came back,

178
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I saw her once.

179
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That day, she pulled my handkerchief.

180
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Uncle, you're thin.

181
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Come on, Uncle.

182
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Eat.

183
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This is your favorite.

184
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Come on.

185
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
No matter if she really recognized me,

186
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
or if she was just talking nonsense,

187
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I know she still misses me.

188
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I've been hoping

189
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
that she would wait for me.

190
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But I'm still thinking about this.

191
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm not thinking about it anymore.

192
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
This child of ours,

193
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
she's the one who loves you the most.

194
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Every time you're in trouble,

195
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Uncle Lin will punish you.

196
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
He's the one who came to protect you.

197
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Uncle Lin!

198
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I've been thinking of the past.

199
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,840
I feel like I'm

200
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,420
having a war就是

201
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,420
I have a reason to take this.

202
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,420
Brother Lin Shu.

203
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,420
For the future,

204
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,420
for me,

205
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,420
you must take good care of yourself.

206
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,420
Ni Huang,

207
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,420
Ni Huang,

208
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,420
if you don't have me in the future,

209
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,420
you will be very good.

210
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,420
You will be very good.

211
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,420
I won't.

212
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,420
I won't go back to Yunnan anymore.

213
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,420
I won't go to a place that's so far from you.

214
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,420
But you stay by my side.

215
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
I will be very careful.

216
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,420
Do you understand?

217
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
I can't understand.

218
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,420
Now it's the national anthem.

219
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,420
Now it's the national anthem.

220
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,420
His Majesty can't get me out of here so quickly.

221
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,420
He must go back to Yunnan.

222
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,420
He will be more willing

223
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,420
to give me the Tainan's handkerchief.

224
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,420
All right.

225
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,420
We are not so lucky

226
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,420
to have you here.

227
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,420
It's hard to decide.

228
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,420
Maybe we will go to Wei Ling.

229
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,420
It will make Yunnan more at ease.

230
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,420
No matter if it's for Nanjing Army

231
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,420
or for mother,

232
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,420
it's better.

233
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
Brother,

234
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,420
you have agreed.

235
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,420
I just hope you can be safe.

236
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,420
Don't be afraid of anything.

237
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,420
I will go back to Yunnan.

238
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,420
All right.

239
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,420
He is lucky.

240
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,420
Although he was sentenced to death,

241
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,420
he was helped by Xia Jiang

242
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,420
and met the Empress Dowager,

243
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,420
the Empress Dowager,

244
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,420
the Grand Grandson.

245
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,420
He changed the law.

246
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,420
It's all because he misjudged the Crown Prince.

247
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,420
Otherwise,

248
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
the imperial family's reputation

249
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,420
would be ruined

250
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
by the imperial family's marriage.

251
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,420
How could it be so bad?

252
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,420
The law of the country

253
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
is only a matter of time.

254
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,420
I don't know

255
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,420
how to get rid of the law of the country.

256
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,420
It's only a matter of time.

257
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
The imperial family

258
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,420
is being taken away by the imperial family.

259
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,420
Even the firecrackers

260
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,420
don't have to be taken away by others.

261
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,420
The world

262
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,420
is always a matter of time.

263
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,420
You are right.

264
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,420
He chose the wrong path.

265
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,420
It's a good thing to be greedy.

266
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,420
I'm sorry.

267
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,420
Wait.

268
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,420
Open a big opening.

269
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,420
Wait.

270
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,420
Wait.

271
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,420
Brothers,

272
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,420
we're here to send you off.

273
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,420
Make it convenient.

274
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,420
Hurry up.

275
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,420
Okay.

276
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,420
Father.

277
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,420
Your weapon is here, too.

278
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,420
Yes.

279
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,420
Father.

280
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,420
It's over.

281
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,420
I'm afraid it's gone.

282
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,420
How can I help you?

283
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,420
No need.

284
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,420
In the capital,

285
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,420
you can't protect me.

286
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,420
Moreover,

287
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,420
in the future,

288
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,420
you will be busy with the world.

289
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,420
Mr. Su,

290
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,420
yesterday,

291
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,420
he sent someone to see me.

292
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,420
He said he would give me a letter.

293
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
A letter?

294
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,420
He said if you don't have the money,

295
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,420
you can just write it now.

296
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,420
Because the thing you said

297
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
was after that,

298
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
there must be something else.

299
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,420
If you write it down and give it to me,

300
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,420
you can live.

301
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,420
I'm sorry.

302
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,420
I'm sorry.

303
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,420
I can live.

304
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,420
I don't know what he meant.

305
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,420
So I can only tell you

306
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,420
the story one by one.

307
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,420
I think Mr. Su

308
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,420
is not a good person.

309
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,420
He must have something to say.

310
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,420
Think about it.

311
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,420
I understand.

312
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,420
He wants me to write down the secret,

313
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,420
and give it to you.

314
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
I'm alive.

315
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
The secret is safe.

316
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,420
If I die,

317
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
I will be grateful.

318
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,420
I will give it to you.

319
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,420
I will not

320
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,420
let you do it.

321
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,420
The talent of the seven-leaf clover.

322
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,420
Is there a pen?

323
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,420
Mr. Su said

324
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,420
the more people know

325
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,420
you can write this, the better.

326
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,420
That's right.

327
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,420
I was going to let Xia Jiang know

328
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,420
I wrote this book.

329
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,420
I'm sorry.

330
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,420
I heard you were sick

331
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,420
after you came out.

332
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,420
You've been here for so long.

333
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,420
Have you been feeling better?

334
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,420
Much better.

335
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,420
I heard that the handkerchief is already set.

336
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,420
It's set.

337
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,420
16 songs.

338
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,420
Today,

339
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,420
the princess of Ni Huang suddenly went to school.

340
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,420
She has been holding the handkerchief

341
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,420
for the Empress Dowager.

342
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,420
His Majesty has been very happy.

343
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,420
And

344
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,420
Mr. Su once discussed

345
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,420
the war-torn-torn alliance

346
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,420
with you before the funeral.

347
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,420
He is indeed very kind.

348
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,420
This

349
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,420
is the adjustment

350
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,420
you made

351
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,420
for the imperial court.

352
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,420
Have a look.

353
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,420
Okay.

354
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,420
Speaking of the war-torn-torn alliance,

355
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,420
who can

356
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
compare

357
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,420
the real power of His Majesty?

358
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,420
Mr. Su told me to keep my word.

359
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,420
I couldn't say

360
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,420
what I said in court.

361
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,420
I still feel pain

362
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,420
in Mr. Su's words.

363
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,420
Sometimes, I'm not good at arguing.

364
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,420
But the more I do this,

365
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,420
the more I'm not good at it.

366
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,420
You're welcome.

367
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,420
By the way,

368
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,420
when you mentioned

369
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,420
the supply of grain last time,

370
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,420
what other things

371
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,420
do you have in mind

372
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,420
to discuss with me?

373
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,420
I have a question.

374
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,420
If we encounter

375
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,420
a sudden situation

376
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,420
during the supply of grain,

377
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,420
we have to take the land.

378
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,420
The purchase of the land

379
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,420
is only

380
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,420
half of the amount of grain

381
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,420
left by the land.

382
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,420
If we have to take the land,

383
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,420
we have to take the land

384
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,420
and take the land.

385
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,420
We have to take the land

386
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,420
and take the land.

387
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,420
The total amount of grain

388
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,420
left by the land

389
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,420
is 960 eggs.

390
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,420
The total amount of grain

391
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,420
left by the land

392
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,420
is 960 eggs.

393
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,420
The total amount of grain

394
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,420
left by the land

395
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,420
is 480 eggs.

396
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,420
According to

397
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,420
the General's calculation,

398
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,420
10,000 people are left.

399
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,420
Mr. Xiang Wen,

400
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,420
have you heard

401
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,420
that the General of Yan

402
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,420
is a young man?

403
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,420
Lin Shu?

404
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,420
Yue You.

405
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,420
Why did you

406
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,420
suddenly mention this?

407
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,420
The speech

408
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,420
you just made

409
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,420
reminded me of him.

410
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,420
I was thinking

411
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,420
that if he met you,

412
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,420
he would be your friend.

413
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,420
Su Mo is not a good man.

414
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,420
He has a lot of health.

415
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
How could he

416
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,420
discuss this with Young Master Ling?

417
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,420
Your Highness, please.

418
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,420
But I've always been

419
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,420
very strange.

420
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,420
When you were born,

421
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,420
how could you

422
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,420
be so familiar

423
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,420
with the military and military affairs?

424
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,420
The General of Jiangsu

425
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,420
is not capable of

426
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,420
doing some cooking.

427
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,420
They are all very experienced.

428
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,420
I often ask them to teach me.

429
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,420
But in the end,

430
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
they are all rubbish.

431
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,420
They are not good at it.

432
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,420
I can't help but

433
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,420
make you laugh.

434
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,420
You're done?

435
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,420
Yes.

436
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,420
Don't worry.

437
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,420
I won't show you

438
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,420
this book.

439
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,420
I won't.

440
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,420
I don't want to know

441
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,420
what you've done.

442
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,420
I know the best.

443
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,420
I'll show you

444
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,420
the best.

445
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,420
Li Yang,

446
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,420
this Jin Nang

447
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,420
can't be given to Mei Chang Su.

448
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,420
Don't worry.

449
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,420
As long as you're alive,

450
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,420
I'll carry this Jin Nang with me.

451
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,420
I won't leave the sect.

452
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,420
I also brought you

453
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,420
some clothes and silver.

454
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,420
I'll show you.

455
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,420
Liu Shang Yong.

456
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,420
Li Yang,

457
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
will we see each other again

458
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,420
in our lives?

459
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,420
I have a lot of ways to go today.

460
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,420
I'll leave now.

461
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,420
Li Yang.

462
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,420
Father.

463
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,420
I'm sorry.

464
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,420
I'm sorry.

465
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,420
I'm sorry.

466
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,420
I'm sorry.

467
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,420
I'm sorry.

468
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,420
I'm sorry.

469
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,420
I'm sorry.

470
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,420
Take good care of your mother.

471
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,420
Come.

472
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,420
Come.

473
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,420
The rain will be released today, right?

474
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,420
The crown prince has lost his strength.

475
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,420
He's in the yellow zone.

476
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,420
Sir,

477
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,420
do you want Prince Yu to be the one to pursue him?

478
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,420
No.

479
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,420
I'll let Prince Yu go for a while.

480
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,420
But I also know

481
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,420
he won't listen to me.

482
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,420
When he's in the forest,

483
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,420
he's not very smart.

484
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,420
The crown prince is forced to be so calm.

485
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,420
Father will protect him.

486
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,420
If Prince Yu can't be well,

487
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,420
I'm afraid he'll be hit by a big rock.

488
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,420
But

489
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,420
will you really keep Xie Yu alive?

490
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,420
I'm only responsible for the people who block Xia Jiang.

491
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,420
As for the others,

492
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,420
I'm not responsible.

493
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,420
The others?

494
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,420
Xia Dong.

495
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,420
Xia Dong won't let him go.

496
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,420
But this grudge

497
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
can't be counted on Xie Yu.

498
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,420
After all, Xia Jiang is his master.

499
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
You're also in love with him.

500
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,420
What will he do?

501
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,420
He's been dead for many years.

502
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,420
Xia Dong has his own way.

503
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,420
The more he trusts Xie Yu,

504
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,420
the less he'll know about Xia Jiang.

505
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,420
I hope he can let go of this matter.

506
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,420
I'll be very helpful

507
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
to you in the future.

508
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
Dong Jie.

509
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,420
What's the matter?

510
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,420
Jing Rui can be in the way.

511
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,420
What's the matter?

512
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,420
Get out of the way.

513
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,420
My mother is here.

514
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,420
The emperor is here.

515
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,420
We can't let Jing Rui go.

516
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,420
Xia Qing.

517
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,420
What are you all so nervous about?

518
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,420
I'm just here to see you off.

519
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,420
I'm just here to thank you

520
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,420
for taking my husband's corpse

521
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,420
back then.

522
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,420
What's the ik evon?

523
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,420
Help me through the top group.

524
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,420
Help.

525
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,420
Great!

526
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,020
I'm the leader,

527
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,420
but the weak and the goon...

528
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:55,820
the one that's organisms have?

529
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Even the kijon...

530
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,420
prepared them for me.

531
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,260
Every one of us

532
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,420
will have a main save on it.

533
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,420
あの iterateaw

534
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,420
won't let me down.

535
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,420
You still have to endure it.

536
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,420
You must hold on.

537
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,420
Goodbye.

538
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,420
It's late.

539
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,420
Get on the road.

540
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,420
The King of the City

541
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,420
Your Majesty, please take care of the dragon body.

542
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,420
These two are here to fight.

543
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,420
In front of me, it's not a fight, it's a fight.

544
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,420
It's a split.

545
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,420
Your Highness, for the sake of the state,

546
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,420
that's a natural thing.

547
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,420
The King of the City is the one in charge.

548
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,420
Don't be angry, Your Majesty.

549
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,420
Your Majesty,

550
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,420
have you ever been to Wushan?

551
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,420
Do you want to be a little angry?

552
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,420
What?

553
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
The mountains are so deep.

554
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,420
How can I be angry?

555
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,420
Go away.

556
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,420
They are all dead people.

557
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,420
Didn't you hear that?

558
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,420
Hurry up and beat the trees down.

559
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,420
Yes.

560
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,420
Your Majesty.

561
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,420
Your Majesty.

562
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,420
Your Majesty.

563
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,420
Today is the birthday of Consort Jing.

564
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,420
Consort Jing saw the consort this year.

565
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,420
She is different.

566
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,420
Why don't you go and have a look?

567
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,420
Consort Jing's birthday?

568
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,420
Did you send the reward?

569
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,420
Don't worry.

570
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,420
I will send it as soon as I get it.

571
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,420
It's been so many years since I last saw Consort Jing.

572
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,420
I should go and have a look.

573
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,420
Well,

574
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,420
you can cut off the skin on your back.

575
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,420
I will hold the tiger and the jade sword.

576
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,420
I will go with you.

577
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,420
Yes.

578
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,420
Do you think it's good?

579
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,420
Enough.

580
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,420
Mother's hand is really getting better.

581
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,420
I know that Baihe Qingyang is really good at eating.

582
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,420
When I was in the army,

583
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,420
I was in a bad mood.

584
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,420
I was going through the same difficulties as the soldiers.

585
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,420
I was hungry at that time.

586
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,420
I thought about the medicine I made for mother.

587
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,420
If I didn't fear mother's hard work,

588
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,420
I would have known it every day.

589
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,420
I am not afraid of hard work.

590
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,420
It's just a medical treatment.

591
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,420
You can't go to the palace with me.

592
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,420
It's not a good idea.

593
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,420
You can eat more when you come.

594
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,420
I also made the golden dumplings.

595
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,420
And the green beans.

596
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,420
I will take them back when I leave.

597
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,420
Thank you, mother.

598
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,420
This is the chicken soup from Fulin.

599
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,420
I made it for you.

600
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,420
Have a bowl.

601
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,420
I don't know why His Majesty is getting married.

602
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,420
I don't know why His Majesty is getting married.

603
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,420
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

604
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,420
Get up.

605
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,420
Are you all right?

606
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,420
Thank you, father.

607
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,420
I remember that it's your birthday today.

608
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,420
I came to see you.

609
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,420
His Majesty gave Consort Jing a piece of rice.

610
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,420
It's a pearl stone.

611
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,420
It's a precious stone.

612
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,420
Thank you for your kindness.

613
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

614
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,420
Isn't this gift suitable for your heart?

615
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,420
I dare not.

616
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,420
When did Jingyan come here?

617
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,420
Father, I am here to visit you.

618
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,420
Your mother gave birth to me.

619
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,420
Why didn't you come here early?

620
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,420
I ordered her to come later.

621
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,420
I wanted to see the Empress Dowager this morning.

622
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,420
I also wanted to give the Empress Dowager a gold medal.

623
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,420
Even if she came, I couldn't see her.

624
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,420
I came to give Jingyan a few things.

625
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,420
It's good to have her.

626
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,420
I am very satisfied.

627
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,420
You said you would reward her.

628
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,420
You are so bold.

629
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,420
Now, you are just in front of your mother.

630
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,420
Tell me what you want.

631
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,420
Father,

632
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,420
I should have sent my imperial edict.

633
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,420
I dare not reward you.

634
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,420
But I am grateful to you.

635
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,420
Since you are so kind,

636
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,420
I am bold to say hello to you.

637
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,420
Please give me a man

638
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,420
who can help me to save my life.

639
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,420
What man?

640
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,420
He is a man with a high reputation.

641
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,420
He loves to talk nonsense.

642
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,420
Is he a man with a high reputation?

643
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,420
You always come to the court.

644
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,420
Why do you learn to be a man with a high reputation?

645
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,420
You are so bold.

646
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,420
Who taught you that?

647
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,420
Who?

648
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,420
Please calm down, father.

649
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,420
I beg for your mercy.

650
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,420
But I am a poor man.

651
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,420
I have no reputation.

652
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,420
As I was studying in the college,

653
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,420
I forgot the name of the emperor.

654
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,420
I committed a big crime.

655
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,420
So I was expelled.

656
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,420
You are so innocent.

657
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,420
How could you do this?

658
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,420
Please forgive me, your majesty.

659
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,420
This man is a doctor.

660
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,420
I have never been to the palace.

661
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,420
I have been a doctor.

662
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,420
I have a master.

663
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,420
A month ago,

664
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,420
I heard from the news that

665
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,420
he was expelled from the capital.

666
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,420
He was so poor that he was sold for years.

667
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,420
He suffered from the debt of marriage.

668
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,420
He was so poor that he couldn't afford to pay the rent.

669
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,420
He was so generous that he didn't have any money.

670
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,420
I am afraid that in the future,

671
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,420
he will be so lonely and hard to repay.

672
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,420
I am so sorry for that.

673
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,420
But I was so worried about him.

674
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,420
I didn't expect that he would be so guilty.

675
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,420
If he is guilty,

676
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,420
I will be so guilty.

677
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,420
So that's the case.

678
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,420
You are so soft-hearted.

679
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,420
It's not a big deal.

680
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,420
This year, a prince

681
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,420
came to the mansion to make an idea.

682
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,420
How could he save him?

683
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,420
He can't use it.

684
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,420
He wants to get a document from me.

685
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,420
Give me another one.

686
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,420
Father,

687
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,420
I think that

688
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,420
the law is the only way to make him guilty.

689
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,420
Even though I am a prince,

690
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,420
I have no other way.

691
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,420
I am not so selfish.

692
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,420
I hope that father will be right.

693
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:18,420
You are so stubborn.

694
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,420
But you are so kind to use the power of the emperor.

695
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,420
You are so kind.

696
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,420
Please.

697
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,420
You are right.

698
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,420
You will be so kind to me.

699
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,420
Thank you, father.

700
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,420
Thank you, father.

701
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,420
Snow is falling.

00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,420

Fire is burning.

Love is eternal.

705
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,420
We meet again.

706
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,420
We say goodbye.

707
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,420
We don't need to say goodbye.

708
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,420
We meet again.

We don't need to say goodbye.

We don't need to say goodbye.

We don't need to say goodbye.

Goodbye.

00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,420
You are so kind to me.

00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:10,420
You are so kind to me.
