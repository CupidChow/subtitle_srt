1
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Your Majesty, Xia Jiang is here.

2
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Here.

3
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I found it!

4
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Your Highness.

5
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Xiaoli,

6
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
send me to the soup

7
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
of the lily soup

8
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
for His Majesty.

9
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

10
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Xiaoli,

11
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Your Majesty.

12
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What do you think?

13
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I have a question.

14
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
How can this poison

15
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
be detected

16
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,000
by those on a beggars' sense?

17
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Where is that gracias?

18
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What's so hard about it?

19
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This is a divorce.

20
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
There's a fire,

21
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
a snowstorm,

22
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,500
and something that's not necessary.

23
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
That's the beautiful...

24
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Snowflake.

25
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
I'm afraid it's impossible.

26
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
How is it impossible?

27
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,500
If there's someone who's poisoned by the fire,

28
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
he'll come to our capital again.

29
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
He's been doing this for over two years.

30
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
He's been doing this for two years.

31
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
He's a pervert.

32
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,500
Do you still think this is a coincidence?

33
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
No, no, I'm just kidding.

34
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
Your Majesty, you're just guessing.

35
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
You can't be sure.

36
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,500
The imperial Academy has many people.

37
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Before you're sure,

38
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,500
you can't let Mei Changsu hear this.

39
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
I'm in charge of the Imperial Academy.

40
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
No one can enter the door today.

41
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
No.

42
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Not only the Imperial Academy,

43
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
you must immediately send someone to the Imperial Academy

44
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
to find Mei Changsu and enter the palace.

45
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Yes.

46
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Your Majesty,

47
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Noble Consort sent someone to bring the soup of the Ice Formation

48
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
to end His Majesty.

49
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No need.

50
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes.

51
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Wait.

52
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Bring it up.

53
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes.

54
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Bring it up.

55
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

56
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're so kind.

57
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Consort Jing is really thoughtful.

58
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're also very kind.

59
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,500
Tell Her Highness that Mr. Su is not allowed to enter the palace.

60
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
I'll take my leave.

61
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Your Majesty.

62
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Where is Meng Zhi now?

63
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Commander Meng should still be in his mansion.

64
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Send someone to send an order.

65
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm afraid that I'll be sent to the Imperial Academy.

66
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Commander Meng.

67
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Your Highness.

68
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,000
Send His Majesty the order.

69
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

70
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Commander Meng Zhi has been working hard for three days.

71
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He's been working hard for three days.

72
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You don't have to thank him.

73
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
I'm here to send an order.

74
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You didn't hear it wrong?

75
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I didn't hear it wrong.

76
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Eunuch Gao suddenly said that

77
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Mr. Su is not allowed to enter the palace.

78
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Is there no front and no back?

79
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He even lowered his voice.

80
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He must have been afraid that His Majesty would hear it.

81
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Send Xiao Lin to the Eastern Palace.

82
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Please stop Mr. Su.

83
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Yes.

84
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,500
I heard that the palace is being sent here to send an order to send you to the palace.

85
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Yes.

86
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,500
The Emperor is not coming to the court for long.

87
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Why do you suddenly want to see this white doctor?

88
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,500
I also find it strange that I can't think of any reason.

89
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
But I can't go without a decree.

90
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Don't worry.

91
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
I'm not a good doctor.

92
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,500
He always hides his knife and hand in the palace waiting for me.

93
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Don't worry.

94
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
I'll do as you say.

95
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
I won't follow the decree.

96
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Mr. Su will be in danger.

97
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
You must move fast.

98
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Even if you catch him outside the palace, you must stop him.

99
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Yes.

100
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Mr. Su!

101
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Mr. Su, you must not enter the palace!

102
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
You must follow him.

103
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
You must not let him enter the palace.

104
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
Yes.

105
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
You must immediately go to the Prince's Mansion

106
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
and inform the Princess of Niehuang.

107
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Yes.

108
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Mr. Su, you must enter the palace.

109
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
You must enter the palace.

110
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,000
wet rights

111
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Good morning, Tipu.

112
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Good morning, Speakerу.

113
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,760
Now,

114
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,080
show your Vamos

115
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,280
gardens got

116
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:33,820
Expert

117
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,960
Do I

118
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,860
three

119
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,840
Aah

120
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,960
Took

121
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,760
五六 Fish-patterned cynical

122
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,160
北下是在找什么?

123
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,400
苏先生,

124
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,300
你来京城到底有何目的?

125
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,660
苏母自富有财,

126
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,740
若不来京城施展,

127
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,420
还能去哪里?

128
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,960
I will say that you are the savior of the King of Qi.

129
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,960
What do you say about this?

130
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Is there anyone in the King of Qi's Mansion?

131
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Your Majesty knows best.

132
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
Your Highness.

133
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
Why is Commander Meng here?

134
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
I received an order this morning.

135
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
I was forced to take care of it.

136
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,960
His Majesty has handed over the palace guards to the Chai Dutong.

137
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,960
We need to find out why Mr. Su has entered the palace.

138
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
Did he encounter any danger?

139
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Your Highness!

140
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
Your Highness!

141
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
Your Highness, a message from the palace.

142
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Mr. Su has entered the palace and has been taken by the Imperial Army.

143
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,960
After entering the Yangju Palace, he has no news.

144
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,960
No matter if it was a case of war or a case of the King of Yu,

145
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
it was all settled by Chen'ai.

146
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,960
What secret do you want to tell Mr. Su?

147
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
Gao Zhan.

148
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Yes.

149
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Send someone to the palace to pass the order.

150
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,960
Call the crown prince to the Yangju Palace.

151
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
Yes, Your Highness.

152
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
Go to the Yangju Palace and see the price.

153
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Yes, Your Highness.

154
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
You want me to enter the palace?

155
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Yes, Your Highness.

156
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
I understand.

157
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,960
What's the purpose of this time?

158
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
I have suppressed Mr. Su.

159
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
I have controlled the palace guards.

160
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,960
I also want me to enter the palace.

161
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
Something must have happened.

162
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
Mr. Su is in the palace.

163
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
You can't go on your own.

164
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,960
Mr. Su has given you a clear conclusion.

165
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,960
The crown prince has been taken by the Imperial Army.

166
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,960
He is the one who has been taken by the Imperial Army.

167
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,960
You are willing to fight for him?

168
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Do you know Jingyan today?

169
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Yes.

170
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
The Eastern Palace, the Lord Mu's Mansion,

171
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
and the Imperial Army's defense camp.

172
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
It's impossible to build a palace.

173
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,960
The emperor suspects this and that.

174
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,960
We will fight for him.

175
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Okay.

176
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,960
I am relieved that you are leading the army.

177
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,960
What do you mean?

178
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,960
You still want to enter the palace?

179
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,960
From the emperor's situation,

180
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,960
it's not like the soldiers are going to kill me again.

181
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,960
If we are in the palace at this time,

182
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,960
the mother and Mr. Su will not be able to protect us.

183
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
What should we do?

184
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,960
So the only thing we need to do is to go into the palace as usual.

185
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,960
We need to see the mother and Mr. Su first.

186
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
At least we can protect them for now.

187
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
But the palace is under siege.

188
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
If we can't send the message,

189
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
how do we know your safety?

190
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
50.

191
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
If we don't get out of the 50,

192
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
we will go into the palace.

193
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Here.

194
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
This way.

195
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Go.

196
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
Greetings, father.

197
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
Stop.

198
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Thank you, father.

199
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,460
Yes.

200
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:43,860
Yes.

201
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:48,980
Father.

202
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,660
Put Down therasés,

203
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,240
Maker,

204
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,200
There is one more.

205
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,960
All firing.

206
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,420
All firing.

207
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:04,940
Hurry up.

208
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,720
Tell no one.

209
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,920
All firing.

210
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,460
tumbels.

211
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,880
Keep quiet.

212
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,200
My son is your father.

213
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Yes.

214
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,320
The highlight is

215
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,940
from my dad.

216
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,160
Dear saying,

217
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,540
an old man must hate humanолоvers,

218
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,260
labourers or fingerprints.

219
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,980
strands burada farro sit?

220
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,460
There he is,

221
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,780
Prince of bait.

222
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,960
I know that you are good at talking.

223
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,960
I will punish you for your crime.

224
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,960
But I want to report something to you.

225
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,960
I think it's better to listen to you.

226
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Report what?

227
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Xia Jiang.

228
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
If you have anything to say,

229
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
just say it.

230
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
Your Majesty.

231
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,960
I don't want to be punished.

232
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
But this person is more guilty.

233
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
I don't want to be punished.

234
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Who is this person?

235
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
Him.

236
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,960
He was the one who colluded with the eldest son.

237
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
He was the one who escaped.

238
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
He was the son of Lin Xie, the master of the Chiyan Sect.

239
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
He was the leader of the Chiyan Sect.

240
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
Lin Xie.

241
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,960
You are so quiet.

242
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
I'm sorry.

243
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Arrest all the soldiers of the Eastern Palace

244
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,960
and the Chiyan Sect.

245
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
Arrest them.

246
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
Yes.

247
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
I'm leaving.

248
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
Crown Prince.

249
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,960
What do you say to Xia Jiang?

250
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Why do you ask?

251
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
You saw Lin Shuchong grow up.

252
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,960
Don't you know him?

253
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Do you know the poison of the cold?

254
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
The cold of the dead body,

255
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
the cold of the dead body,

256
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,960
and the special blood of the beautiful spirit,

257
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
are poisonous.

258
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,960
They are all dead.

259
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,960
It's hard to recognize the person who killed him.

260
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
You are so ridiculous.

261
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
I believe you.

262
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
I don't believe you.

263
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
Jingyan.

264
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Are you really...

265
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
Are you really not aware of this?

266
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
I don't believe you.

267
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
Crown Prince, you are so clean.

268
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
If you don't believe this person,

269
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
it's Lin Shuchong.

270
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
How could you believe

271
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
he was really trying to get you

272
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
to the Eastern Palace?

273
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
I want to choose you.

274
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Your Highness.

275
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,960
The Chiyan Sect is well-known.

276
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
You are the king of the world.

277
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,960
When you entered the capital,

278
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,960
you and the Crown Prince were in the middle of the day.

279
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
If you weren't Lin Shuchong,

280
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
how could you let the situation in front of you

281
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
not leave?

282
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
And you tried so hard to assist

283
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,960
a prince with a great power?

284
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,960
So, Xia Shouzun came to pay respect to you.

285
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
Stop.

286
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
The imperial guards are all gathered.

287
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
As you ordered,

288
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
we are all ready.

289
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Don't worry,

290
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
I will obey your order.

291
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
Let's go.

292
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Yes.

293
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Your Majesty,

294
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
after the Meilang invasion,

295
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
one thing happened in the capital.

296
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
The imperial guards were all the princes.

297
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,960
He was a ruthless prince.

298
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,960
He was the only one who was a coward.

299
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,960
Now he is in the Eastern Palace.

300
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,960
And the Crown Prince and Prince Yu are fighting like wild animals.

301
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,960
In the end, they are both defeated and injured.

302
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
One was exiled to the capital.

303
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
The other one...

304
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
What about the other one?

305
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Did I force him to rebel?

306
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
How did the Crown Prince get rid of the imperial guards?

307
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
How did Prince Yu recover?

308
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Your Majesty knows it best.

309
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
No matter what I say,

310
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
he didn't really owe Prince Jing the truth.

311
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Prince Yu also fought in Mount Jiuan.

312
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
When His Majesty was under the siege,

313
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
he was severely injured and injured.

314
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
Who did this to him?

315
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
Who did this to him?

316
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,960
He returned to the capital and escorted His Majesty back to the capital.

317
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Now,

318
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,960
the blood of the imperial guards in front of the palace is still not dried.

319
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,960
And the leader of the rebel army in the country,

320
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
he took the Yan City's ancient books

321
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,960
and punished the Crown Prince in front of the imperial guards.

322
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
Aren't you afraid that

323
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
the souls of the dead in Mount Jiuan

324
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,960
will be in danger?

325
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Mr. Su, you are so clever.

326
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
I have already learned the lesson.

327
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
That's right.

328
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,960
In the past two years,

329
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,960
we have been able to know the truth.

330
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,960
But you can't escape from it.

331
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,960
That is the poison that you have been poisoned.

332
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,960
Your Majesty, I have escaped from the prison.

333
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,960
If it wasn't for your efforts,

334
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,960
why did you kill yourself

335
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
and break your own path?

336
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,960
You are right.

337
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
Since you have escaped,

338
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,960
why did you do this to yourself

339
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
to kill yourself?

340
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
Your Majesty, you are right.

341
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,960
The reason I have been fighting with you

342
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,960
is to help you deal with the crime of treason.

343
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,960
After he returned to the capital,

344
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
he wanted to kill me.

345
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
That's not strange.

346
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,960
Xuanjing Temple has a wrong behavior.

347
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,960
It is used by you.

348
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
But no matter how he changes,

349
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,960
the truth is the truth.

350
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,960
Uncle Lin,

351
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Uncle Lin,

352
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,960
the poison that you have been poisoned

353
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,960
will cause the pulse to change

354
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,960
and cause the cold to be filled.

355
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,960
You dare to show your face to His Majesty

356
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,960
and let the doctor take the pulse

357
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,960
to see if there is a difference

358
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,960
or not.

359
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,960
If you are willing to stop this trouble,

360
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
you can admit to His Majesty

361
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,960
who you are.

362
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Fine.

363
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
I admit that I am Uncle Lin.

364
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
Uncle Lin,

365
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
are you not anxious at all?

366
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Yes, I am.

367
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
Are you not anxious?

368
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
The two smartest guys are all in the palace.

369
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Is it useful?

370
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
What we can do now

371
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
is to hope that Changsu's cunning

372
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
can save himself.

373
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
But what if we can't save him?

374
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
What should we do?

375
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
We can't save him.

376
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
We can't save him.

377
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
We can't save him.

378
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
We can't save him.

379
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
We can't save him.

380
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
We can't save him.

381
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
What should we do?

382
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
We can't save him.

383
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
I admit that.

384
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
I hope they can at least

385
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
stick to the 50.

386
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
I said I am Uncle Lin.

387
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
Does His Majesty really believe me?

388
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
No matter what I admit,

389
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,960
what I have been doing,

390
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
I am not afraid of anything.

391
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,960
I have no real evidence.

392
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
If His Majesty

393
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,960
wants the imperial physician

394
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
to come to me for my funeral,

395
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
he can do it.

396
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
But no matter what the result is,

397
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
it doesn't make any sense.

398
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
It doesn't make any sense?

399
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
His Majesty thinks that

400
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
if my body really doesn't look good,

401
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
then it means that I am Uncle Lin.

402
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
Anyway,

403
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
if my pulse is not normal,

404
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
can I confirm that I am not Uncle Lin?

405
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
There is no conclusion.

406
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
To put it bluntly,

407
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,960
I just want to escape from this life.

408
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
And His Majesty

409
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
is just asking for a new life.

410
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
He is just being cunning.

411
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
He is just being cunning.

412
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
He is just being cunning.

413
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,960
He is not an old man.

414
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
He is just being cunning.

415
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
As you said,

416
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
Uncle Lin has come back to revenge.

417
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
If so,

418
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
how could His Majesty

419
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
have come down from Mount Jiuwan

420
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
without any reason?

421
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Zhang Shi's military uniform

422
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
is in Prince Jing's hand.

423
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
As long as he takes a step back,

424
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
Prince Yu's army is successful.

425
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
His troops are in the hands of the rebels.

426
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Isn't that the easiest way?

427
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
Did His Majesty

428
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
not have

429
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
such a plan

430
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
when he was in the hunting palace?

431
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,960
How dare you!

432
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
I didn't know

433
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
what Jingyan was thinking.

434
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Then today,

435
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Father asked us to deal with him.

436
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
What exactly is the purpose?

437
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
The Imperial Physician

438
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
wanted to find some clues

439
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
to help Mr. Su

440
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
to find out

441
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,960
what's going on with Uncle Lin.

442
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
I

443
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
just want to find out the truth.

444
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
How?

445
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
The two are completely different.

446
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
The clues, the fortune,

447
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
and the fortune

448
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,960
are all in the list.

449
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,960
They can't be proved

450
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
and never be overturned.

451
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
What Xia Jia is doing now

452
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,960
is just

453
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
to think about Father

454
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
before he dies.

455
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,960
I'm just a suspect.

456
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
It seems that

457
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
Mr. Su

458
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,960
is really a good person.

459
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
Commander Long,

460
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,960
aren't you in the tomb today?

461
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
Why are you here?

462
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Brother Chen is not

463
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
better than me

464
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
when he's around.

465
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,960
I know

466
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
he's better than me.

467
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,960
This is the closest

468
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
hunting palace in the palace.

469
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
Why am I here?

470
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Brother Chen, do you need to ask?

471
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
His Majesty is just

472
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
talking to the Crown Prince

473
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
in the hunting palace.

474
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
It's nothing serious.

475
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,960
It's the best.

476
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,960
Your Majesty,

477
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
this person is definitely

478
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
a traitor.

479
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,960
I'm willing to risk my life

480
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
to protect him.

481
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Your life?

482
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Do you think

483
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
you saved

484
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,960
the Celestial Palace

485
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
and saved your life?

486
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,960
You've been in the prison

487
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
for so long

488
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,960
and you still want to

489
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
protect him.

490
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,960
I'm not going to

491
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
let you go.

492
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,960
I'm not going to let you go.

493
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,960
You've been in the capital

494
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
for so long.

495
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
Isn't it because

496
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
there's a lot of space out there?

497
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,960
Can't you get away?

498
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
Your Majesty,

499
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
I've admitted that I'm a minister.

500
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
There's nothing to investigate.

501
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Just treat me

502
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
as a minister.

503
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
Even if you hurt

504
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
your father's feelings

505
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
and messed up the court,

506
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
you're just

507
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
a person from the Xiajiang region.

508
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Oh, right.

509
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Do you want to

510
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
take Consort Xian's life

511
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
and take the Prince Xian

512
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
back to Xianzhou?

513
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
Your Majesty.

514
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
Your Majesty.

515
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
You're a bastard

516
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
who's been in the prison for so long.

517
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Your Majesty.

518
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
I'm telling you the truth.

519
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
I'm telling you the truth.

520
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
I'm tired.

521
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
I'm going to

522
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
punish the Crown Prince.

523
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,960
You're guilty of the Xiajiang region.

524
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
You're free to judge.

525
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
You should punish the Ministry of Justice

526
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
and the Court of Judicial Review.

527
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
As for the Crown Prince,

528
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
I'll punish the Crown Prince.

529
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,960
It's all your fault.

530
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
Kill!

531
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,960
Kill!

532
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Your Majesty's brother

533
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
is really a bastard.

534
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Your Majesty.

535
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
You can kill him.

536
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
You can't let him go.

537
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Even if there's a chance,

538
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,960
you can't keep the secret.

539
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,960
Your Majesty.

540
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Take Xiajiang away.

541
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

542
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,960
Your Majesty.

543
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
You can kill him.

544
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
You can't let him go.

545
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,960
Your Majesty.

546
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
Your Majesty.

547
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Gao Zhen.

548
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Your Majesty.

549
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
Aumei, Shimpujing,

550
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
Yulecheng, 994466,

551
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,960
Com,

552
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
the most exciting game on the line.

553
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
The horse is running.

554
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,960
The horse is running.

555
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
You've beaten the horse.

556
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
You've beaten the horse.

557
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
You can't let him go.

558
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,960
Xiaoxiazhe.

559
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,960
You know this.

560
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Let's go.

561
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,360
Sh frigging

562
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,220
OK

563
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,780
We don't have much time

564
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,020
We need to find him

565
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,780
I haven't got him at all

566
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,200
No

567
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,320
Qingyan

568
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,640
I'll send you out of the palace.

569
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,760
I don't think Mother will mind.

570
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,960
Today,

571
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,080
Mr. Su has been implicated.

572
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,800
You were surprised.

573
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,440
I'm afraid I can't go there.

574
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,640
I've prepared some wine.

575
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,560
I'll give Mr. Su some gold.

576
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,440
Don't worry.

577
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,960
I'll send someone to send Mr. Su out of the palace.

578
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,320
You can go.

579
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,720
Mr. Su's深 eye...

580
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,600
You see,

581
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,040
what's though is...

582
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,600
that Jin's conspiracy.

583
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,360
Just once.

584
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:50,760
Father.

585
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:52,880
Father.

586
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:53,760
Father.

587
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,120
I said,

588
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,000
I'd have sent someone to send Mr. Su out of the palace.

589
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,920
You can't.

590
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
I'm confident in my ability to control myself.

591
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
I want to be a man of my own.

592
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
I don't care about the past.

593
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
I don't care about the future.

594
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
I only care about the future.

595
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
I don't care about the future.

596
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320
What?

597
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
You don't want to listen to my teachings

598
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
when I'm in the Eastern Palace?

599
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Surrender to the Emperor

600
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,320
Your Majesty.

601
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,320
I've prepared the wine.

602
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
This is from Mr. Su.

603
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,700
Who's the next person will save you from this?

604
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,440
Gentlemen...

605
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,320
We didn't get to see each other for the first time...

606
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,180
but love turned into a��om all of a sudden.

607
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,140
Fu Hua...

608
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,500
what do you want from people like this?

609
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,060
Why don't you become like Jaila?

610
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,320
I did this for you.

611
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,320
I was used by others.

612
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,320
I'm sure you and I will never die in vain.

613
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
Do you understand?

614
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,320
Father, I don't understand.

615
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,320
I understand what you mean.

616
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,320
You can't trust me.

617
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,320
But you can't let go of your murder.

618
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,320
Your Majesty wants me to die in the palace to avoid the consequences.

619
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,320
Father, do you really mean this?

620
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,320
Yes.

621
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
I'm sorry.

622
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
Jingyan!

623
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,320
Father, you want to be a crown prince.

624
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,320
You want me to be a courtier?

625
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,320
I always thought you were sincere and willing to give up your life.

626
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:12,320
I didn't expect you to be so suspicious and make me suspect you.

627
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,320
You were so secretive and mischievous.

628
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,320
You made me suspect you.

629
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,320
Today, Xia Jiang and I are willing to do this.

630
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,320
It has nothing to do with Mr. Su.

631
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,320
If you think it's hard for me to handle it,

632
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,320
then you should.

633
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,320
You want to be a courtier?

634
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,320
What do you want?

635
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,320
I've always been like this.

636
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,320
I don't want others to take care of me.

637
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,320
Jingyan!

638
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
I'm sorry.

639
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,320
Are you okay?

640
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,320
Let's go.

641
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,320
I've always been like this.

642
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
I don't want others to take care of me.

643
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Jingyan!

644
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
Jingyan!

645
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,320
Princess!

646
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Princess, the crown prince and Mr. Su have left the palace safely.

647
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,320
That's great.

648
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,320
Don't think too much.

649
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,320
I'll find a way to get you out of here in a few days.

650
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,320
Your Highness!

651
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,320
Your Highness!

652
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,320
Your Highness!

653
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,320
Miss, stop right there!

654
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Jingyan, don't be afraid.

655
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,320
I'm sorry.

656
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,320
Jingyan!

657
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,320
Jingyan!

658
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,320
Jingyan!

659
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,320
Jingyan!

660
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,320
Jingyan!
