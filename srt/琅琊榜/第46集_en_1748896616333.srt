00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 19

2
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Jin Yan.

3
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't be afraid.

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Mother.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Did you hear what he said?

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's just some words.

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I can't hear it.

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Mother.

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Your Highness.

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How was Mr. Su's last night?

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Mr. Su saved me once.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I heard from Dr. Li that...

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You know it.

14
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes.

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I know.

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay.

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I know he's worried about me.

18
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I know he must be very ill.

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Your Highness.

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He has a good doctor.

21
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But he needs to be fully recovered.

22
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Come.

23
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I can imagine

24
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
how much he was hurt.

25
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I dare not ask him.

26
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm afraid he will...

27
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You are the closest person to him now.

28
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He is not afraid of you being sad.

29
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm afraid he will...

30
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Zhen Ping.

31
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Chief, you're awake.

32
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Brother Nie.

33
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Chief, Prince Jing has been guarding here.

34
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Come.

35
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Help me up.

36
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Your Highness.

37
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I didn't expect

38
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
that mother's medical skills are so good.

39
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a relief

40
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
to see Mr. Su's anger.

41
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's actually because

42
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm impressed by Consort Jing.

43
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's really a shame.

44
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you feel better,

45
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I have a question

46
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
that I want to ask you.

47
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Your Highness, please.

48
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Please.

49
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What is the name of your father?

50
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Father's name?

51
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Since you are my mother's benefactor,

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I should know

53
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
his name, right?

54
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why don't you ask Consort Jing?

55
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
After you ask him,

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I will ask mother again.

57
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Do you have any difficulties?

58
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is it a secret

59
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
to the Lord's name?

60
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
How could it be?

61
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Father,

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't have any difficulties.

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Which one?

64
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Which one?

65
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The stone.

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The difficulty of the difficulty.

67
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Thank you, sir.

68
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Thank you.

69
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Thank you, sir.

70
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Please have a rest.

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Mother.

72
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Mr. Su, how is he?

73
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The second half is over.

74
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I didn't sleep well.

83
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But I'm much better now.

84
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's good.

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Mother said

86
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Mr. Su is your daughter.

87
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So you will take good care of him.

88
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes.

89
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I want to know

90
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
what is your old name?

91
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Mother doesn't know.

92
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
She even forgot the life of the savior.

93
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What is her name?

94
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Why don't you ask Mr. Su?

95
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I asked.

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You asked?

97
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why did you ask me again?

98
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Could it be

99
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
that the names we said

100
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
are different?

101
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If there is really this person,

102
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
it will be the same.

103
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Mother.

104
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's just a name.

105
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Can't you say it?

106
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
His name is Mei Shennan.

107
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Mei Shennan.

108
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Shennan.

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Which one is it?

110
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Which one is it?

111
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The stone is

112
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
the south wood.

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The stone is the south wood.

114
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I thought I was crazy.

115
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Jingyan.

116
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Last night,

117
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I suddenly had a thought

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
a very powerful,

119
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
very crazy thought.

120
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Every moment,

121
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I thought

122
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I could almost confirm it.

123
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He is a little tree.

124
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I thought he was a little tree.

125
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I didn't know

126
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
why there was such a crazy thought.

127
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He wouldn't come back.

128
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Even if he came back,

129
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
he wouldn't be like this.

130
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Back then,

131
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I was arrogant and arrogant.

132
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I was strong and lively.

133
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
On the battlefield,

134
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
the silver plow and the spear were always coming.

135
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I never knew what the South East Snow was.

136
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But Mei Changsu,

137
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
he was always a lowly,

138
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
kind-hearted and considerate person.

139
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He always had a strong will.

140
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
He didn't have the will to live.

141
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't know why

142
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
they would think of each other.

143
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Jingyan,

144
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
since I came back,

145
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
you have always thought of me.

146
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
My heart is always in your hands.

147
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Your Highness.

148
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Greetings, Consort Qing.

149
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Your Highness,

150
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Commander Meng's new job is here.

151
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm relieved.

152
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,920
The army of the Red Star

153
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
has been under control.

154
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The palace is ready to be rebuilt.

155
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I can go back to the capital anytime.

156
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Commander Meng, you go back yourself.

157
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You can take the army and make progress.

158
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Okay.

159
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What's wrong?

160
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Xia Jiang escaped.

161
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
He escaped before Commander Meng came.

162
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
He also took the Ministry of Justice's punishment.

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This thief is a coward.

164
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
His Majesty is more generous than Prince Yu.

165
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
He is still unruly.

166
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He will definitely get me back

167
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
if he lives or dies.

168
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes.

169
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Thank you for your hard work.

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll arrange for you to come back tomorrow.

171
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes, Your Highness.

172
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Find Ji Wan.

173
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yes.

174
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Your Highness Ji,

175
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
where are you going?

176
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
His Majesty wants to see me.

177
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't know what's going on.

178
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Your Highness Ji,

179
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Jin City is about to be settled.

180
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
His Majesty has many things to do

181
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and he wants to make a decision.

182
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's appropriate for you to discuss this.

183
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You can guess it.

184
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You'll know when Prince Ji is there.

185
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

186
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Have a seat.

187
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Have a seat.

188
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I have something to discuss with you.

189
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
This is the imperial concubine's handkerchief, right?

190
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yes.

191
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Prince Yu was the one who made this decision.

192
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He did what he was told.

193
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
He really stole my heart.

194
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I once had a grudge against him.

195
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But what about him?

196
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
He was a good man.

197
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
He was a good man.

198
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
When Chu Jun and Pang Luo were gone,

199
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
he was so angry.

200
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I really couldn't tolerate him.

201
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Who would have thought

202
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Jin Huan would come to this end?

203
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That kid.

204
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But to tell the truth,

205
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
he is his own son.

206
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
He is dying to go.

207
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
My heart still hurts.

208
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Brother Huang,

209
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
don't think too much about it.

210
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Take care of yourself.

211
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I told you to come here

212
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
to discuss this with you.

213
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Now that the crown prince is gone,

214
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Prince Yu is the most pitiful.

215
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Who will be the next emperor?

216
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
This is the only thing that's left of my heart.

217
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I dare not say anything.

218
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I dare not say anything.

219
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You are so nervous.

220
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Get up.

221
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Eat.

222
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Tell me.

223
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
How is Jingyan?

224
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Jingyan?

225
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Jingyan?

226
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
He is a good man.

227
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
He is loyal.

228
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
He is loyal.

229
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But he is the most pitiful.

230
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Pitiful.

231
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Actually you know

232
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
he is not my best son.

233
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Well,

234
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
well, well, well.

235
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Jingyan has a good point of Jingyan.

236
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
He knows how to train.

237
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
This is different from Jingyu.

238
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Maybe it's related to his mother.

239
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Noble Consort is also gentle.

240
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
This time he came to save the price.

241
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
When he arrived,

242
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
the imperial army was almost out of power.

243
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Actually,

244
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
the palace is under his control.

245
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But he

246
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
gave the military service

247
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
without saying anything.

248
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
He made me

249
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
very surprised.

250
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Surprised?

251
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I thought he would mention something.

252
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
At least he should

253
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
know something.

254
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But I just tried to talk to him.

255
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Jingyan didn't mean

256
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
to delay the return of the capital.

257
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Do you think he is interested

258
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
in the position of the Eastern Palace?

259
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Don't talk about Jingyan.

260
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Any prince

261
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
if they say they have no idea

262
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
about the position of the Eastern Palace,

263
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
it must be fake.

264
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Aren't you also a prince?

265
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I...

266
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I...

267
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
They are princes.

268
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I am the emperor.

269
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I am the emperor.

270
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's different.

271
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's different.

272
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What's the matter with the ceremony?

273
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It turns out that

274
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
the world is his.

275
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Prince Ji has this feeling.

276
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Did you think of the prince?

277
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The world is his.

278
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The talent of the world

279
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
is also his.

280
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Are you going out?

281
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm leaving.

282
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm going back.

283
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I won't come again.

284
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I've been here

285
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
for years.

286
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The scenery looks different

287
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
this year.

288
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It seems that the scenery is different.

289
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
The scenery is different.

290
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
But the people are different.

291
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
We are going back to the capital.

292
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The situation is certain.

293
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You don't have to worry.

294
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Prince Ji has always wanted to

295
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
thank you for the opportunity.

296
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But it's too much.

297
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
We can't find the opportunity.

298
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Why thank me?

299
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm not right.

300
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Even if I say it,

301
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
it must be something I saw in my eyes.

302
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What can I thank you for?

303
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Prince Ji, thank you for saving Ting Sheng.

304
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
If you didn't keep a little thought,

305
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
you would have died.

306
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Ting Sheng can't live in the world.

307
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
If you say it like that,

308
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
you don't have to thank me.

309
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
We were originally a family.

310
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
We are not old friends.

311
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You're awake.

312
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We'll rest for half an hour here.

313
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And then we'll set off.

314
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Your Highness,

315
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I came to ask if you're feeling well.

316
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm fine.

317
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I've been lying on the car.

318
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Lie down?

319
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's uncomfortable.

320
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's just a little bit of a shock on the way.

321
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Looking at the team in the city,

322
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
there's no danger at all.

323
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm fine.

324
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm fine.

325
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The danger is very high in the future.

326
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
His Majesty must be angry.

327
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yes.

328
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Are you angry?

329
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Where has Prince Yu been?

330
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's the first time

331
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I've seen such a dangerous situation.

332
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's the second time.

333
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The second time?

334
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
His Majesty has met two rebels together.

335
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Last time he was the one who launched the attack.

336
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
He won the throne in the end.

337
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But this time,

338
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
maybe he doesn't even know

339
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
what he won.

340
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Your Majesty.

342
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I've found His Majesty.

343
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Your Majesty.

344
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

345
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Your Majesty,

346
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I, Meng Zhi,

347
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
have brought 2,000 soldiers here to support you.

348
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Take care of His Majesty's safety.

349
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Ji Cheng Jun,

350
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'll take care of it.

351
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Your Majesty.

352
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Your Majesty.

353
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Your Majesty.

354
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Your Majesty.

355
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Your Majesty.

356
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I, Meng Zhi,

357
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
have brought 2,000 soldiers here to support you.

358
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'll take care of His Majesty's safety.

359
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Ji Cheng Jun,

360
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'll arrange a tent outside the city.

361
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I wonder if Your Majesty

362
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
is satisfied with my arrangement.

363
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's a good arrangement.

364
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Ji Cheng Jun,

365
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
you're in charge of the escort.

366
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'll take the lead

367
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and return to the base.

368
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Yes.

369
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
With you in charge of the escort,

370
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I feel relieved.

371
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Get up.

372
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

373
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Your Majesty,

374
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I have a decree.

375
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I request that you

376
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
return to the base

377
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
and take care of both of your daughters.

378
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
The officials of the Zhengyang Palace

379
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
will be assigned to the Inner Court

380
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
to be assigned to the imperial court.

381
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Yan Shi,

382
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
accept the decree.

383
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Your Majesty,

384
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Yan Shi is a good man.

385
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What do you want?

386
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
What about Prince Yu?

387
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Prince Yu is a traitor.

388
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
He's been under pressure for a long time.

389
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
He's been under pressure from the top and the bottom.

390
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Yan Shi, accept the decree.

391
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Yan Shi, accept the decree.

392
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You're a criminal.

393
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Accept the decree.

394
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Get in.

395
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Your Highness.

396
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Your Highness.

397
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Your Highness.

398
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Your Highness.

399
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Are you all right?

400
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm sorry.

401
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I implicated you.

402
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I implicated you.

403
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
We're husband and wife.

404
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
We should have been in a different world.

405
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
What did I say I'm sorry?

406
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
These years,

407
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I've never treated you well.

408
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Now, I only want you to die with me.

409
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Your Highness.

410
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm willing to

411
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
be with you.

412
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But...

413
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
But...

414
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But...

415
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I've already

416
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
got your bones.

417
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm willing to die with you.

418
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm willing to die with you.

419
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm willing to die with you.

420
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
What?

421
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
What did you say?

422
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
It's good.

423
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We're together.

424
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
We're together.

425
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
No.

426
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
You can't die.

427
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You have to live for me.

428
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Live for our children.

429
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I beg Your Majesty.

430
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Your Majesty, it's normal.

431
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Your Majesty, it's useless to beg him.

432
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Guards.

433
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Guards, I want to see Your Majesty.

434
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Let me see Your Majesty.

435
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Guards.

436
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Guards.

437
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Your Highness.

438
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Your Highness, don't be like this.

439
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I want to see Your Majesty.

440
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Guards.

441
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Guards.

442
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
What do you want to see?

443
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I want to see Your Majesty.

444
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I want to see Xiao Jinhua.

445
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Guards.

446
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
What are you?

447
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
How dare you do this to me?

448
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Go tell the people outside.

449
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I want to see Your Majesty.

450
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Let me see Your Majesty.

451
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Your Highness.

452
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You're dead.

453
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Save your strength.

454
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Guards.

455
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Guards.

456
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Give me another ball.

457
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Guards.

458
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What are you doing?

459
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What are you doing?

460
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
What are you doing?

461
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
What are you doing?

462
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Let go of me.

463
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Let go of me.

464
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Let go of me.

465
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Let go of me.

466
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Guards.

467
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Your Highness.

468
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Guards.

469
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Your Highness.

470
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Don't worry.

471
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'll go to beg father to kill me.

472
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Your Highness.

473
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Let go of me.

474
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Let go of my child.

475
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Don't worry.

476
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Don't worry.

477
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I'll beg father to let go of you.

478
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Don't be afraid.

479
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Don't be afraid.

480
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Don't...

481
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Don't be afraid.

482
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Don't be afraid.

483
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Don't be afraid.

484
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Don't be afraid.

485
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Don't be afraid.

486
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Don't be afraid.

487
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Don't be afraid.

488
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Don't be afraid.

489
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Don't be afraid.

490
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Don't be afraid.

491
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Don't be afraid.

492
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
What are you doing here?

493
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We've always been together.

494
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'll send you off.

495
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
If you could have kept it for a long time,

496
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
at least you could have a safe return.

497
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
And you wouldn't have fallen to this level.

498
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Keep it?

499
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
You mean...

500
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
like King Ning and King Huai...

501
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
to be under King Jin's feet?

502
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You're a minister.

503
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
The wildness and obsession of the Emperor

504
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
have deeply rooted in your bones.

505
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It seems that you won't regret it.

506
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Of course I will.

507
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I shouldn't have let you down.

508
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It's not me who knows you and the Emperor.

509
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's you.

510
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Do you think you can really do this?

511
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Let me tell you.

512
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
They let me destroy the Great Nine Mountains in Chenzhou.

513
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It's the fastest thing I've ever done.

514
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I've lost.

515
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Of course I'll die.

516
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
But I don't regret anything.

517
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It's just like the King of Qi.

518
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Like the King of Qi?

519
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You also live in this prison in Han Zihao's room.

520
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
What right do you have to say you're like the King of Qi?

521
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You can never become the world's most powerful and most famous Xiao Jingyu.

522
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
After you die, no one will think of you.

523
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
No one will be proud of you.

524
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Because you have no right to be called.

525
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
How do you know that no one will be very happy for me?

526
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
There are all kinds of things in the world that can be done by the UK.

527
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Forget it.

528
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You won't understand after you say it.

529
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You've been killing me for so long.

530
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I finally died because of you.

531
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I've made you think of something before.

532
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
How could I not?

533
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
13 years ago,

534
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
you were watching your brother drink poison.

535
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
He told you to tell the Emperor that you were not strong enough.

536
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Now you're standing in the same prison with him.

537
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
This is the cause and effect you deserve.

538
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It seems that I didn't guess it right.

539
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You really are the King of Qi.

540
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You will never know who I am.

541
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
In this world,

542
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I can't find the second Xiao Jingyu anymore.

543
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Even if it's the middle of the day,

544
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
the King of Jing, who is the position of the Eastern Palace,

545
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I'm afraid I can only look at his appearance.

546
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm afraid I can only look at his appearance.

547
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Your Majesty.

548
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Your Majesty.

549
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Your Majesty.

550
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Your Majesty.

551
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Your Majesty.

552
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Your Majesty.

553
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Your Majesty.

554
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Your Majesty.

555
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Your Majesty.

556
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Your Majesty.

557
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You are dreaming.

558
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm afraid the soul of Jiuan Mountain is not gone.

559
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
How about we ask the imperial doctor to come and see?

560
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
No need.

561
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Your Majesty.

562
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
This is the memorial of the Prince Yu who came to the Ministry of Justice.

563
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Please have a look.

564
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
The memorial of the Prince Yu who came to the Ministry of Justice.

565
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Please tell me.

566
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
The Princess Consort has a pregnancy.

567
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Please don't make them suffer.

568
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yes.

569
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Gao Zhen.

570
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yes.

571
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Go to the heaven with me.

572
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yes.

573
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

574
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Wait a minute.

575
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
His Majesty is going to see Yu.

576
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Your Majesty.

577
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
His Majesty...

578
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
What's wrong?

579
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Why is he still in the position?

580
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
How?

581
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
How dare he die?

582
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Your Majesty.

583
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I just found the memorial of Prince Yu.

584
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
He has been buried.

585
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Your Majesty.

586
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Your Majesty.

587
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I should have been a talented man in Jiuan Mountain.

588
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I wanted you to kill me

589
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and beg for a life.

590
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Now I have to take the blame for my crime.

591
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I only beg you to let Lan Jin and my child go.

592
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
You will pay for it.

593
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Jing Huan.

594
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Where is the Princess Consort?

595
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Where is she?

596
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Where is she?

597
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Tell me.

598
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
The Princess Consort is following Prince Yu

599
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
and is going to suicide.

600
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Your Majesty.

601
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Your Majesty.

602
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Your Majesty.

603
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Your Majesty.

604
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Your Majesty.

605
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
You found that corpse.

606
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
No problem, right?

607
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
A woman who died in the prison

608
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and the son of Prince Yu

609
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
is not to be blamed for her.

610
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Actually, I think

611
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
His Majesty might not kill her.

612
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Are we too much?

613
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
According to His Majesty's faith,

614
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
the Princess Consort is not to be blamed for her.

615
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
According to His Majesty's faith,

616
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
even if she doesn't kill her now,

617
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
she might not let her go.

618
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Besides,

619
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
as Prince Yu's son,

620
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
he is in the capital of this world.

621
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
How can you let this child go?

622
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Why don't you let him be a civilian

623
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
in the distant world?

624
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
This is his best return.

625
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Let this child leave the court.

626
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
You're still thinking about it.

627
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Send someone to ask

628
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
why the Princess Consort is still not out?

629
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Why are you so worried?

630
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Your Highness.

631
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Are you going out?

632
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm not going out.

633
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Princess Consort Feng is going to the palace.

634
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The carriage is ready.

635
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Look, this woman is in trouble.

636
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
She's still picking the right choice.

637
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So,

638
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
what I heard is true?

639
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
What did you hear again?

640
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Prince Jing has been ill for many years.

641
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
His Majesty is preparing to give her a new wife.

642
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
He ordered the Princess Consort

643
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
to pick the right choice

644
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
in all the cities.

645
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
The Princess Consort is helping

646
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
pick the right choice this time.

647
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Do you have a daughter?

648
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
What's the use of your news?

649
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
My daughter doesn't have one.

650
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
She has a close friend.

651
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Now,

652
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
all the officials in the capital

653
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
are excited.

654
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Your Highness, why are you laughing?

655
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I remember when your mother was pregnant,

656
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
she thought you were a daughter.

657
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
She was trying to make you a wife.

658
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I also picked the right choice.

659
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But she didn't.

660
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
She didn't pick the right choice.

661
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Your Highness,

662
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
what does it mean?

663
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Why hasn't the Princess Consort come out yet?

664
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Go and have a look.

665
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Your Highness,

666
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
who has picked the right choice?

667
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
You tell me.

668
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
If I were a girl,

669
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
who would I marry?

670
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Xiao Yu Jing,

671
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
you've tried to get married.

672
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You're not a girl.

673
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
What are you worried about?

674
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But if that child is still alive,

675
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
you should be the one who's getting old.

676
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I'm sorry.

677
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm sorry.

678
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I'm sorry.

679
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I'm sorry.

680
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I'm sorry.

681
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
I'm sorry.

682
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I'm sorry.

683
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I'm sorry.

684
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I'm sorry.

685
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I'm sorry.

686
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I'm sorry.

687
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I'm sorry.

688
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I'm sorry.

689
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I'm sorry.

690
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm sorry.

691
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm sorry.

692
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm sorry.

693
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I'm sorry.

694
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I'm sorry.

695
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'm sorry.

696
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
I'm sorry.

697
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I'm sorry.

698
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm sorry.

699
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'm sorry.

700
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm sorry.

701
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'm sorry.

702
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I'm sorry.

703
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I'm sorry.

704
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I'm sorry.

705
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm sorry.

706
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I'm sorry.

707
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I'm sorry.

708
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I'm sorry.

709
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I'm sorry.

710
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I'm sorry.

711
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'm sorry.

712
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I'm sorry.

713
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I'm sorry.

714
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I'm sorry.

715
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm sorry.

716
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I'm sorry.

717
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I'm sorry.

718
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I'm sorry.

719
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I'm sorry.

720
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I'm sorry.

721
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm sorry.

722
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm sorry.

723
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I'm sorry.

724
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'm sorry.

725
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I'm sorry.

726
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I'm sorry.

727
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm sorry.

728
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I'm sorry.

729
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I'm sorry.

730
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I'm sorry.

731
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I'm sorry.

732
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I'm sorry.

733
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I'm sorry.

734
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm sorry.

735
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I'm sorry.

736
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I'm sorry.

737
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm sorry.

738
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I'm sorry.
