00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 19

2
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,400
Tell me.

3
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
Who sent you here?

4
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,680
Prince Yu.

5
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,440
Prince Yu?

6
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,880
Prince Yu has been dumped by me.

7
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,920
Try another one.

8
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,080
Tell me.

9
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,920
Who is it?

10
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,080
Duke Qing's case.

11
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,280
I don't know how much it will be

12
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,560
if it's in the court.

13
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,400
What?

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,520
I...

15
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,320
He's dead?

16
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,680
What did he say?

17
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,200
The sound is too loud.

18
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,280
Don't listen to it.

19
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,440
Who sent them here?

20
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,840
I've known who it was.

21
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,960
I just can't be sure.

22
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,880
Nonsense.

23
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,880
He died so easily.

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,440
It's so cheap.

25
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,400
Sister Dong.

26
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,440
You're a woman.

27
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
You're making a mistake.

28
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,440
You're so ungrateful.

29
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,760
What?

30
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,040
Someone is reading it today.

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,440
Someone is looking for it.

32
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,680
I can't let them down.

33
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,160
Let's go.

34
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,040
Let's go together.

35
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,880
Come with me.

36
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,600
Come.

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,920
Come.

38
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,320
Let's start.

39
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,760
Let's do it.

40
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,200
Prince Mu.

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,640
Please wait here, Prince Mu.

42
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,080
Thanks for your report.

43
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,640
OK.

44
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,720
I'm looking for Mr. Su.

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,480
Is he here?

46
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,520
Ministry of Health.

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,160
I'm just a little young.

48
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,920
What you said is true.

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,160
Chief,

50
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,480
I don't want to say anything else.

51
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,280
I'm so sorry for your kindness.

52
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,680
But I can't say anything.

53
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm sorry for what I said.

54
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,400
Since you're fine,

55
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,520
I'm relieved.

56
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,120
Is there anything wrong with your life?

57
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,120
No.

58
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,680
I'm looking for Su Xingrong to look for a house.

59
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,680
I really want to find a house to move out.

60
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,080
But I'm not in a hurry.

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,280
My lord,

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,480
why don't you tell me where you are?

63
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,080
I'll go and see for myself.

64
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,680
You're so stubborn.

65
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,880
You bought a house earlier,

66
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,080
but you're not writing anymore.

67
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,480
Fine, fine, let's go.

68
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,080
If you don't like it, let's pick another one.

69
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
My lord.

70
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,880
Fei Liu.

71
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,280
Don't, don't, don't.

72
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Su Xingrong.

73
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,680
Mr. Su, Mr. Su.

76
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
Put him down.

77
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,680
Fei Liu.

78
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,680
Put him down.

79
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,480
Don't throw.

80
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Put him down, put him down.

81
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,280
My lord, you're rude.

82
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,680
I've heard that Fei Liu is very skilled.

83
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,880
I didn't expect that.

84
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,080
How did you learn this?

85
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,480
My lord,

86
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,880
since you're taking me to look for a house,

87
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
then go.

88
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,880
Fei Liu,

89
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
get me a house.

90
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,080
Come.

91
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,280
Didn't you say you're going to the temple?

92
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Hurry up.

93
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,880
I won't ask you for a place to live.

94
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,680
Dong Jie,

95
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,680
it's not a small thing to kill someone.

96
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,680
No matter what,

97
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,280
we'll have to escort you to Xuanjing Temple to the mansion.

98
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Don't worry.

99
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
We've entered the city.

100
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,680
The city is not as remote as the church.

101
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,080
Their actions are not so convenient.

102
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Besides,

103
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,680
if I rely on you two to protect me,

104
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
I'll be the one to find the stone you're looking for.

105
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,080
Okay, go and listen to the music.

106
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,880
I won't disturb you.

107
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,480
Dong Jie.

108
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,280
Jingrui,

109
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,280
Dong Jie is right.

110
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,680
Maybe we still love to play with our feet.

111
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,280
Dong Jie,

112
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,280
let's go first.

113
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:01,880
Go.

114
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,880
Dong Jie,

115
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,880
take care of yourself.

116
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,080
Let's go.

117
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:36,760
The

118
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,680
How could it be Xinyu?

119
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,880
Since Jingrui was born,

120
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,880
Tianquan Manor and the Ninguo Manor

121
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,280
have been separated.

122
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,880
Zhuoding Feng sent his eldest son to escort Yuan Gao himself.

123
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,280
He's just one of them.

124
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,680
Xie Yu?

125
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,880
Xie Yu is a very skilled man.

126
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,680
He let his son Xie Bi to be my son.

127
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
He also supported Dong Gong secretly.

128
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,280
It's really hard to believe.

129
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,480
I didn't find out his true face earlier.

130
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,880
Duke of Qing's palace is not safe.

131
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,080
Xie Yu is the one who is the emperor.

132
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,680
Your Highness,

133
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,880
we've lost too much.

134
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,280
Mr. Su, please.

135
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,080
Greetings, Your Highness.

136
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,280
Mr. Su.

137
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,880
I was in the palace for a moment.

138
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
I didn't see you as a threat.

139
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
I was wronged by you.

140
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,280
I let you go.

141
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,480
You shouldn't blame me.

142
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,480
I was wronged.

143
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,880
I was wronged.

144
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,280
I was wronged.

145
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,880
I was wronged by you.

146
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,480
I was wronged.

147
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,680
It's a common thing.

148
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,480
Everything can be done.

149
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,480
I believe you won't be suspicious

150
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,680
and make things worse.

151
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,680
You're just a few-faced person.

152
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
How can you believe me?

153
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
In this capital where you've been living,

154
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,480
you shouldn't trust others.

155
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,080
Mr. Su, you're right.

156
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,280
But I don't know why.

157
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,880
I feel that you're not the first person

158
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,680
to believe me.

159
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
If everyone wants to be a princess,

160
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,880
I can put up with a lot of trouble.

161
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,880
What?

162
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
About that thing,

163
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,280
I don't know why.

164
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,880
Does anyone think that

165
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
the new thing is different?

166
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,880
I'm sure it's that little boy Xiao Jingyan.

167
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,680
You know about Prince Jin's feelings.

168
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,880
He's stubborn.

169
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,480
He loves to talk about

170
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,080
many things that he can't see.

171
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,280
You don't have to worry about him.

172
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,480
Your Highness, you're smiling.

173
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,680
Prince Jin's personality

174
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,280
is so different from what he's known for.

175
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,480
Your Majesty,

176
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,480
the princess of Ni is in charge of the memorial.

177
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,480
I've been thinking about her for so long.

178
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,280
I just want her to be able to calm down.

179
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,280
But she's not willing to be in love.

180
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,880
After the ceremony,

181
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,280
the candidate who left the palace

182
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,880
decided to go out of the palace.

183
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,880
It was clearly meant to be a wedding.

184
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
In the end,

185
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,680
the memorial was written in the honor of the request.

186
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
It's a relief.

187
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,480
The princess also knows that she has lost her grace.

188
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,280
So she specially asked for an apology.

189
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,480
Who would let His Majesty

190
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,880
be so loyal to the princess?

191
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,080
No matter how much you complain,

192
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,880
you have to be careful

193
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,280
of what you should do in the future.

194
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,680
Who are you talking about?

195
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,680
You know a lot.

196
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,680
After all, Prince Yunnan's mansion is a big family.

197
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,880
Although this time,

198
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,880
I can't let you be in the capital

199
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,480
with a calm and safe life.

200
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,880
But I can't let him

201
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,680
go back to Yunnan without a reason.

202
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
That's all.

203
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,080
The palace is a small house.

204
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,080
There are two small gardens outside.

205
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,680
I wonder if you can see it.

206
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,480
The princess chose a good house.

207
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,880
But it's too big for me.

208
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,280
Then choose another one.

209
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,280
The garden in the capital is also a little better.

210
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,280
You choose such a small house.

211
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,880
I really don't dare to bother the princess.

212
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,880
I'll go to the capital first.

213
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,080
It's not a big deal.

214
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,080
It's getting late.

215
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
Let's go back.

216
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,480
Please.

217
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,680
Please.

218
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
Mr. Su.

219
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,680
From this door,

220
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,480
the main street is closer to the main street.

221
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Please.

222
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,880
Please.

223
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Do you know where this is?

224
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
I don't know.

225
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,480
This is the place where I played with

226
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,880
the handsome man in the banquet.

227
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Do you want to come with me?

228
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,880
It's the old man in the banquet.

229
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,880
Can you come in?

230
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,680
According to the truth,

231
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,280
the servant of the tea house

232
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,880
should be a fan of the inner court.

233
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,880
But I don't know why.

234
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,280
His Majesty forgot him in the past 12 years.

235
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,880
He didn't take care of the house at all.

236
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,080
He was so useless.

237
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,080
It seems that he has been waiting for a day.

238
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
He can only rest in peace.

239
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
That's all.

240
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Ji Ye has been in the palace for many years.

241
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
He has been in the palace for many years.

242
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,080
Why do you have to go into the private room?

243
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
People go to the air.

244
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
They are so careless.

245
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,080
It doesn't mean that everything will disappear.

246
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,080
What should be left will still be left.

247
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,080
Some people, some things

248
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
are still hidden in their hearts.

249
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,080
They won't be erased by time.

250
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Your Highness is a person who values justice.

251
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,080
But this is a serious matter in the court.

252
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Until now, you have been watched by the master.

253
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,080
Don't stay here anymore.

254
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Mr. Su,

255
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
I really don't want to come in and see you.

256
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,080
This is just a matter of time 12 years ago.

257
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,080
It has nothing to do with Su Mo's current situation.

258
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Goodbye.

259
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,080
I will go to the palace.

260
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
Father.

261
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Uncle.

262
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Uncle.

263
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
Father.

264
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
Father.

265
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,080
I will go to the palace.

266
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Father.

267
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
Father.

268
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
What's wrong with you these two days?

269
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
You don't go out or talk.

270
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,080
Do you know that mother is worried about you?

271
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
What's wrong?

272
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
Are you sick?

273
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
Or are you in a hurry?

274
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
Say it if you are in a hurry.

275
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
I will carry it for you.

276
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
You think I am a gold-gainer?

277
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
I will carry it for you if I am in a hurry.

278
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,080
Since you are not sick,

279
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,080
and you don't have any trouble,

280
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
why do you ask?

281
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,080
I know that you have been in the palace

282
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,080
for a few days.

283
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,080
Brother.

284
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,080
Where are you?

285
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,080
Brother.

286
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
What do you think

287
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,080
I am in father's heart?

288
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Why do you ask suddenly?

289
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,080
You are the son of the Duke of Ningguo.

290
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,080
Father is very proud of you.

291
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
Maybe sometimes

292
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
he is too strict.

293
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,080
Brother.

294
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,080
I am doing this for Prince Yu.

295
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,080
Actually father has always been

296
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
supporting the Great Li.

297
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,080
Do you know that?

298
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,080
I don't know.

299
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,080
I thought father was just against it.

300
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
It's been two years.

301
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
I was supported by father

302
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
and stood up for Prince Yu.

303
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
A few days ago,

304
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
father suddenly told me

305
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,080
that he has always been the new father of the East Palace.

306
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,080
He told me not to come back to Prince Yu again.

307
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
What?

308
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,080
Father is the person of the East Palace.

309
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,080
What am I in father's heart?

310
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
A wife?

311
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
You want to take me out?

312
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
It's for Prince Yu's eyes.

313
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
I am useless.

314
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
Just take it back.

315
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Brother.

316
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
Don't be sad.

317
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,080
Father is the father.

318
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,080
You can see it earlier.

319
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
You are not bad

320
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
for coming out.

321
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,080
Brother.

322
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
Since I heard about the news

323
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
of buying the house,

324
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
I have received so many letters.

325
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
There are still many good people

326
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
in the capital.

327
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
Right?

328
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
It's not.

329
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Look at this.

330
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,080
This yard is called Lan Yuan.

331
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
The land is good.

332
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
The price is also high.

333
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,080
Go and visit Brother Su.

334
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
If you like it,

335
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
we will buy it.

336
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
Go.

337
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
You.

338
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
Name.

339
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,080
What?

340
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,080
Don't you want to give me a name?

341
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,080
Name?

342
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,080
It's a guest.

343
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
What if I break into the house?

344
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,080
You can fight with Commander Meng

345
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,080
and the master of the battle.

346
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
You can't fight with him.

347
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
You can't fight with him.

348
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
You can't fight with him.

349
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,080
You can fight with the master of the battle.

350
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
You can't fight with him.

351
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
Stop.

352
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,080
It's the flight.

353
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
The flight is not safe.

354
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
Is there any wound on you?

355
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
There is.

356
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
It's not the enemy.

357
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
It's the master of the battle.

358
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
The master of the battle.

359
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
There is a wound on you.

360
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
It's not the enemy.

361
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,080
I think this is Mr. Su.

362
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,080
Is there any case

363
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,080
for the head of the Xuanjing Bureau?

364
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,080
Father, the head of the Xuanjing Bureau

365
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
has been in the east.

366
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,080
There is a search in the capital.

367
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,080
But the case of the Qing State's

368
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,080
Qing State's Qing Emperor

369
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
has not been decided.

370
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,080
The court is really

371
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,080
suspicious.

372
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,080
Your Highness.

373
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,080
Isn't it in the east palace

374
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
to study in the forbidden tribe?

375
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
How did the court

376
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
know

377
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
what the situation is?

378
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Father asked me to study in the forbidden tribe.

379
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
He didn't ask me to participate in the court.

380
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,080
What do you mean?

381
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
Do you want me

382
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,080
to be trapped in the east palace forever?

383
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,080
Shut up.

384
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,080
You two

385
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
are both in the Qing State's

386
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,080
Qing State's attack.

387
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,080
I don't know

388
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,080
what kind of judgment I have.

389
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
If you are in the main court,

390
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,080
it's a big matter.

391
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
It's a small matter.

392
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
How about you?

393
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
How many people can be trapped?

394
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
How many people can be trapped?

395
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
Father, shut up.

396
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
The case of the Qing State's attack.

397
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
You two

398
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,080
are both in the same place.

399
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
You are really...

400
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
Leave.

401
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
When I came back to the capital,

402
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,080
I heard about

403
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,080
Mr. Xu's rumors.

404
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
Someone said

405
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,080
you are the rich man

406
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,080
who is in the Qing State's tea house.

407
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
Someone also said

408
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
you are the plan of the whole city.

409
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
You are so kind-hearted.

410
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,080
You are not a person of words.

411
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,080
I am really worried.

412
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
Who is worried?

413
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,080
Your Majesty.

414
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,080
The emperor is the emperor's wife.

415
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,080
He is important to the court.

416
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
Why are you still

417
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
worried about him?

418
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,080
I am just worried that

419
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
the rumors in the capital

420
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
say that you pushed

421
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
his wife away

422
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
because of Mr. Xu.

423
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
I am a person of words

424
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,080
with Mr. Xu.

425
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,080
His Majesty has been waiting for you for a long time.

426
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
This time, he is not as happy

427
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
as he was in the court.

428
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
His Majesty is so happy

429
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
that he let you

430
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,080
go back to the south.

431
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,080
Because he is his friend,

432
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,080
he can't be seen

433
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
as in the trap.

434
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,080
So,

435
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
I am afraid

436
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,080
you have to say something.

437
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
Do you

438
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,080
only want to

439
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,080
keep the princess's love for the princess?

440
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,080
The princess is so beautiful.

441
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,080
She is so charming.

442
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
I have never

443
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
felt any love for her.

444
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,080
But

445
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,080
I have been weak for a long time.

446
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
I am afraid that I will be in trouble.

447
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
I am not a person

448
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,080
who wants to be a burden to others.

449
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
Second,

450
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,080
the princess is so kind and

451
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,080
she is so good at writing.

452
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
If it is not for the war,

453
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,080
she is so hot-blooded.

454
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
How can she be with him?

455
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Your Majesty,

456
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,080
it is late.

457
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
I should

458
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
escort you

459
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
to the palace.

460
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,080
These two kids.

461
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,080
It is a normal thing.

462
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
Duke Qin

463
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,080
is my country.

464
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
They are so ignorant.

465
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,080
Duke Qin is not loyal.

466
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
Even if

467
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
he is a minister,

468
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
he should have

469
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,080
a prince

470
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,080
to be the host.

471
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
Your Majesty,

472
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
I advise you two

473
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
to not let anyone

474
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,080
Your Majesty,

475
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
am I wrong?

476
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,080
You remind me.

477
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,080
This case needs the royal family to be the host.

478
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
But it is not necessarily

479
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
the two of them.

480
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Jingyan is not in the capital, right?

481
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
Your Highness.

482
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
Yes.

483
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,080
His temperament

484
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,080
is so good.

485
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,080
Yes.

486
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,080
It is him.

487
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
We will

488
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,080
find Prince Jing

489
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,080
to attack tomorrow.

490
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
Yes.

491
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
As far as I know,

492
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,080
you sent someone to help the princess

493
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
to solve the war in Nan Chu.

494
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Indeed.

495
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
I am worried

496
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
that you are just

497
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,080
worried about the princess.

498
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,080
I am worried about nothing.

499
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
But you are

500
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
in the south of Nan Chu.

501
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
Why are you

502
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
afraid of someone else?

503
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,080
What?

504
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
I am wrong.

505
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,080
As a citizen of Liang,

506
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,080
you should ask

507
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,080
why you are fighting outside.

508
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,080
Now the air in the capital

509
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,080
has become so low.

510
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,080
Mr. Su, you are right.

511
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,080
I was wrong.

512
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
Yisun, I am in the capital now.

513
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,080
It is hard to be a good person.

514
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
But what you asked me

515
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,080
today

516
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
is not a secret.

517
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,080
I hope you can take me

518
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
to the princess.

519
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
I am sorry.

520
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
You are the one

521
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,080
who asked me to talk to you.

522
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,080
I am just worried

523
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,080
that you and Mr. Huang

524
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,080
have made a mistake

525
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
because of the wrong cause.

526
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
That is why I am here.

527
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,080
Mr. Cheng Meng is not a stranger.

528
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,080
I am here to thank you.

529
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
I also thank you

530
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,080
for your kindness.

531
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
It is my pleasure

532
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,080
to have you here.

533
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,080
I finally know

534
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,080
the truth in the message.

535
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,080
You are worthy of my respect.

536
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
I dare not.

537
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
I am leaving.

538
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,080
I am leaving.

539
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,080
Goodbye.

540
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,080
My lord.

541
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Come out

542
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,080
and ask me

543
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,080
Mr. Xia is here.

544
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
I heard that

545
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,080
Mr. Xia came to my mansion

546
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,080
and no one came to accompany you.

547
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
You sent Tianquan Manor

548
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,080
to escort the case of Duke Qing

549
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
to the court.

550
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,080
It is not me

551
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,080
who is the one

552
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,080
who is the one who is the one who is the one.

553
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
My lord, you are not just

554
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,080
afraid of this

555
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,080
but you sent someone

556
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
to kill me.

557
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
Am I not?

558
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,080
Mr. Xia Dong,

559
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,080
you are so smart.

560
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,080
I am absolutely not...

561
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
You don't have to say more.

562
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
I didn't plan to

563
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,080
reveal your secret.

564
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,080
But you didn't spare me.

565
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,080
Lv Si sent Tianquan Manor

566
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,080
to escort the case.

567
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080
But the case was solved.

568
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
In the end,

569
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
the Prince of Yu

570
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
found out.

571
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,080
I can't

572
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
blame you for that.

573
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
It's not my fault.

574
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,080
Mr. Xia Dong,

575
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,080
why did you hide it from me?

576
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
My husband Nie Feng

577
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
was in the capital of the capital.

578
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,080
You gave him

579
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,080
half of his shares

580
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080
to me in the capital.

581
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
I will not forget

582
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
this kindness.

583
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,080
But you forgot it yourself.

584
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
Isn't that right?

585
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
Look,

586
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
it's a misunderstanding

587
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
as such.

588
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
I have always

589
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,080
thought of you.

590
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,080
You sent someone

591
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,080
to kill me.

592
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,080
I won't report it to Xuanjing Bureau

593
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,080
nor will I pursue it.

594
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,080
We

595
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
have been

596
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,080
kind to each other.

597
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,080
You

598
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,080
are so smart.

599
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,080
Mr. Xia Dong,

600
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
I...

601
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,080
I

602
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,080
am

603
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,280
a

604
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
friend.

605
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,080
Brother Zhu,

606
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,080
if I didn't see

607
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
the tower of the tower of the Chongyin Tower here,

608
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,080
I wouldn't know

609
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,080
where I am.

610
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,080
How can the capital

611
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,080
be so deserted?

612
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
How did you

613
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
find this place?

614
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
I recommended it to thearp.

615
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
It's called Li Ji Hao.

616
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,080
This is also called Ji Hao?

617
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,080
The businessmen are full of gold teeth.

618
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,080
Why don't you take a look first and pay the money?

619
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,080
Fei Liu has been here before.

620
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,080
It's also said that this is called Ji Hao.

621
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,080
It seems that Fei Liu likes this place.

622
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,080
It's fine. It's not that bad.

623
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,080
The land is good. The small one is also suitable.

624
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,080
I haven't lived here for so many years.

625
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,080
It's not strange that it's like this.

626
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,080
As long as I renovate it, it will look very beautiful.

627
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,080
The main thing is that Fei Liu likes it.

628
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,080
I don't think you need to renovate it here.

629
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,080
You can just rebuild it.

630
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,080
Brother Su, you should buy a piece of land.

631
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,080
But this garden should be good too.

632
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,080
At least this scenery and the outline

633
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,080
looks quite good.

634
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,080
Brother Su, let's go over there and take a look.

635
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,080
Okay.

636
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,080
Yu Jun! Jing Rui!

637
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,080
Yu Jun! Come and take me down!

638
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,080
Jing Rui, don't move!

639
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,080
Are you okay?

640
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,080
Are you okay?

641
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,080
It turned out that the city is a cry scene.

642
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,080
The scene is all over. No wonder we can't see it.

643
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
I don't know how deep this scene is.

644
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
I'm not bothered by the depth of the scene.

645
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
I just caught my eyes.

646
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
Yes. You were the one who fell down.

647
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,080
If it was Brother Su, he wouldn't be able to catch anything.

648
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
What is it?

649
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
What is it that you fell down?

650
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,080
I fell down and you were very happy?

651
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
You little...

652
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Okay, okay. You're not hurt, right?

653
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
No, no.

654
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,080
A master like me is not that easy to get hurt.

655
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,080
Brother Su, this garden is so weird.

656
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,080
It's not comfortable.

657
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,080
Let's go quickly.

658
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,080
Yu Jun, you can't leave here.

659
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,080
Let's go back the same way.

660
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080
Okay, okay. Let's go.

661
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,080
Brother Su, I think you should just leave this garden.

662
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,080
You're right.

663
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,080
If we really need to rebuild this place,

664
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,080
I don't know how long it will take to make a living.

665
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
Brother Su, you're staying in the Snow Tower.

666
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Isn't that good?

667
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,080
I still have to stay in the capital for a while.

668
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
I always bother you in the house.

669
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,080
I can't go there.

670
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,080
It's good to move out and live.

671
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,080
Anyway, it's not far from me.

672
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,080
For me, it's more convenient to visit Brother Su here.

673
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,080
It's more convenient than going to Ningguo's Mansion.

674
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,080
What's wrong?

675
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
I'm missing.

676
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,080
I'm missing for sure.

677
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,080
He was here just now.

678
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
Why is he gone?

679
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,080
Is this thing very important?

680
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
It's Yu Jun's grandfather, Master Yan.

681
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,080
He left his belongings in the forest.

682
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,080
Could it be that he was just jumping in the well?

683
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,080
It's possible.

684
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,080
Yes, yes, yes. Let's go back and look for him.

685
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,080
Yes.

686
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,080
Fei Liu, go find a rope.

687
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,080
Okay.

688
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,080
Hurry up and join us.

689
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,080
The Aom Shimp Jin Entertainment Center 994466, come.

690
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,080
Gong Yu.

691
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,080
Mr. Shi San.

692
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
You're leaving again?

693
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,080
Yes.

694
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,080
He's been visiting the Prince of Yu's Mansion every day.

695
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
He seems to be having a good time.

696
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,080
I'm a little worried about you.

697
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
What's there to worry about?

698
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,080
Everything is in your mind.

699
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,080
You're still living in Ningguo's Mansion.

700
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:57,080
That place really makes people worried.

701
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,080
If Fei Liu is with us, Li Gang will be outside.

702
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
Nothing will happen.

703
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
Mr. Shi San.

704
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,080
I told you before

705
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,080
that I wanted to visit the Prince of Yu's Mansion

706
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,080
and you've reported it to me.

707
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
Tuoligang asked the Prince of Yu's Mansion.

708
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,080
He said you're not going.

709
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,080
You're the main character in the capital.

710
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,080
It's easy to be recognized.

711
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,080
You'd better not go.

712
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,080
I'm not going.

713
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
I'm not going.

714
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
I'm not going.

715
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,080
I'm not going.

716
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,080
I'm not going.

717
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
I see.

718
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Thank you.

719
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,080
Even if there's no water below,

720
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,080
I'm afraid there will be a cloud.

721
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,080
It's okay.

722
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
Just cry.

723
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
I'll go down right now.

724
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
I'll find you.

725
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
Forget it.

726
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
I'll go down.

727
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,080
Anyway, my clothes are dirty.

728
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
You?

729
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
You're just blind.

730
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,080
It's so dark down there.

731
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
What can you see if you go down?

732
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,080
Thank you, Brother Xiao.

733
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,080
A rope.

734
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
Jingrui.

735
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
Be careful.

736
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,080
It's okay.

737
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
Put it down.

738
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
Put it down.

739
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
Put it down.

740
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,080
It's almost there.

741
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
It's almost there.

742
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Jingrui.

743
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,080
It's so dark down there.

744
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
It's not easy to find.

745
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,080
It's hard to find a chance to show my love.

746
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,080
You should look carefully.

747
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
Look carefully.

748
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,080
You should put more effort.

749
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,080
I'll go up to you.

750
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
I'll go up to you.

751
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
I'll get you.

752
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Jingrui.

753
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
What's wrong?

754
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Jingrui.

755
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
What's wrong?

756
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,080
Kunlun.

757
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,080
There's something wrong.

758
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
Don't move.

759
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Don't move.

760
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,080
What's going on?

761
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
Jingrui.

762
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,080
I'm okay.

763
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,080
I'm fine.

764
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,080
You're okay.

765
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,080
What are you shouting for?

766
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,080
Are you scaring me?

767
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
You.

768
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,080
You.

769
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,080
You.

770
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,080
You.

771
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
You.

772
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
You.

773
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
You.

774
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
You.

775
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
You.

776
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
You.

777
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,000
Go

778
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,040
I will come

779
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,480
This way

780
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,160
Take me up

781
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,080
Pull me up!

782
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
Hurry, pull him up!

783
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
Get up!

784
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,080
Did you find Jin Rui?

785
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,080
Good.

786
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,080
Great.

787
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,080
I'm so sorry.

788
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Jin Rui,

789
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
go back and take a shower.

790
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
I'm afraid it's not going to work.

791
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Brother Su,

792
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
we might need to go to the Jin Rui.

793
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,080
I just got a message.

794
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
The case in the Qing Palace,

795
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,080
father has already decided.

796
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,080
So fast?

797
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
Father has summoned Prince Jing to the palace today.

798
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,080
He is the one who ordered him to investigate this case.

799
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
In a few days,

800
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,080
the cabinet will have a decree.

801
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
Sit.

802
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,080
For you,

803
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,080
it's indeed a good thing.

804
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
I was thinking,

805
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,600
Prince Jing was accused of

806
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,080
abusing me in the Zhao Palace last time.

807
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,080
Prince Yu was the one who asked for mercy.

808
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
You said Prince Jing

809
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
wouldn't do this because of this?

810
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,080
If Xiao Jingyan knows how to make a change,

811
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,080
he wouldn't have any interest in the Jin State.

812
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,080
Don't worry, Your Highness.

813
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
His temper

814
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
will never change in a while.

815
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,080
I'm relieved

816
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,080
that you said that.

817
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Your Highness,

818
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
regarding the Princess's case,

819
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,080
I heard something different.

820
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,080
What's different?

821
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,080
I heard

822
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,080
the one who led the case

823
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
was not the Empress,

824
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,080
but Prince Yu.

825
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,080
It was Meichang Su.

826
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,080
Young Master, Young Master Yan.

827
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,080
Lord Gao. Lord Gao.

828
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
Is this gentleman Yuan Gao?

829
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
I'm not Yuan Gao.

830
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
I'm just a security guard.

831
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,080
Yes, yes.

832
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
The security guard and Yuan Gao

833
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
are different.

834
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,080
Lord Gao,

835
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,080
how many sea bones are there

836
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,080
in the capital now?

837
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,080
Some of them are not full.

838
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,080
There are probably seven.

839
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,080
There are still many left.

840
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,080
Five of them are out of the hospital.

841
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,080
They say that they are almost all female.

842
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,080
Female?

843
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,080
Don't say that you are the royal family's son.

844
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,080
I've known the head of the government for many years.

845
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
I've never seen such a big case.

846
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Jinling is the emperor's subordinate.

847
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,080
I'm afraid that

848
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,080
he will be in danger.

849
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,080
I'm afraid that he will be in danger.

850
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080
But I can't help you now.

851
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
I bought this garden

852
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,080
with Cheng Yi's business.

853
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
It's also the first time I came here today.

854
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
Lord, why don't you ask the owner

855
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,080
who the owner of this garden is?

856
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,080
These wet hands

857
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
have been buried here for several years.

858
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,080
It's not easy to find out.

859
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
Lord Gao,

860
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
the case has been reported.

861
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,080
Can we leave now?

862
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
Of course. Of course.

863
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,080
But...

864
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,080
I'm now in the Ningshu Marquis's Mansion.

865
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,080
If you have any questions,

866
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,080
you can send someone to ask me.

867
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,080
You're welcome.

868
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,080
This place is really a great place.

869
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Please excuse me.

870
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,080
I'm leaving.

871
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,080
Please.

872
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,080
Brother Zhou,

873
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,080
it's time for you to come.

874
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,080
What? What's the matter?

875
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,080
Your Highness,

876
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
I have a decree for you.

877
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
I'm afraid that

878
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
someone will

879
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,080
find a way out.

880
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,080
Who?

881
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,080
Mei Changsu.

882
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
But Brother Langya

883
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,080
didn't say it out loud.

884
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,080
The talent of a beggar

885
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,080
who can't be obtained

886
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,080
can only be destroyed.

887
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,080
Brother Xie,

888
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,080
he is the master of the Jiangzuo Sect.

889
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,080
All the people in my Tianquan Manor

890
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,080
are from the Jianghu people.

891
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,080
I really don't agree with that.

892
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,080
I know, Brother Zhou.

893
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,080
I just want you to try

894
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,080
to see if the guards around him

895
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,080
are only the one who is left.

896
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,080
Don't worry.

897
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,080
I won't

898
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,080
make Brother Zhou suffer the consequences.

899
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,080
I'm leaving.

900
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
I'm leaving.

901
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,080
Please.
