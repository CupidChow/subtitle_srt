00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,000
Your sword skills are very good.

3
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,200
Brother Feiliu has been praising you.

4
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,960
You don't need to be afraid

5
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,920
when you get into that big fat man.

6
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Lu Yuan, you are bigger than them.

7
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,280
You need to take good care of them later.

8
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,400
Don't worry, sir.

9
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,840
I will take care of them.

10
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,200
Prince Jin.

11
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,760
Why are you

12
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,760
coming to Do oh?

13
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,800
I cannot be sure

14
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,800
of the constitution.

15
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,600
Your하'm here early.

16
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,920
Your하, Your conduct

17
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,600
is quite honorable.

18
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,040
Why are you laughing?

19
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,600
It's been several years.

20
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,040
The scenery is familiar.

21
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,940
qualquer it was a total Moments

22
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,780
of three are standing together

23
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,000
God's Originally

24
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,260
Su Mao is also blinded

25
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,460
I and Mr.Gim is the person who Ease the great

26
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:51,620
eatagly min at

27
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,800
to까지

28
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,700
because I have transmitted

29
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,660
I have never...

30
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,800
Langqing,

31
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,380
you have been sipping my Ambition have you been sipping my Ambition

32
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,740
Your mention,

33
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,740
their whatsoever beautify me,

34
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,620
you have waست now.

35
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,020
Throughout the previous three days

36
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,180
or you haven't been in battle with getting out of a battle prospective.

37
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,780
I think it's worth watching today's battle.

38
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,540
Father, I think this is a good thing.

39
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,140
If this White-Ledged Knight

40
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,060
really loses to some children,

41
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,660
then he won't challenge our Princess?

42
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,300
If that's the case,

43
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,740
we'll be at ease.

44
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,940
But...

45
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,020
But what?

46
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,540
But the other seven people who entered the Wen Clan

47
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,900
are no match for Princess.

48
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,180
I think Princess

49
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,100
doesn't seem like it was meant to be.

50
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,560
I think Father

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
would get lonely because he would fall in love with her.

52
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,940
He's tooегда kind.

53
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,920
I agree with this.

54
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,560
I think Princess is very top-class

55
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,720
andMP ты非형 doesn't need aperor.

56
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,320
But how come it could be like this?

57
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,880
People and these wildly talented hints

58
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,880
are what might as Father consider them.

59
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,180
Yes.

60
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,660
According to Prince Yu,

61
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,460
that person is under the leadership of the Alliance,

62
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,260
and he can't even walk for ten seconds.

63
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,420
Liao Tingjie is actually quite good.

64
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,700
Compared to that person who is more powerful than that person,

65
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,740
he is more powerful than you.

66
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,420
Shut up.

67
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,340
The princess is in the middle of the world.

68
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,380
Let's see what the result is today.

69
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,380
Let's take care of it.

70
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,380
Okay?

71
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
What?

72
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,380
Mr. Su wants to tell me

73
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,620
the secret of this pre-war.

74
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,300
Princess Liyang, I must tell you.

75
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:04,140
The first female character of the Alliance, Yu Lecheng, is the most exciting game of the game.

76
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,540
The horse is running.

77
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,100
The horse is running.

78
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,540
The queen of the reward,

79
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,220
the treasure of Huangjing City,

80
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,140
the rich cat,

81
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,820
the leader of the reward,

82
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,260
the superior in the ranking,

83
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,260
the reward of the reward,

84
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,060
the reward of the reward,

85
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,340
the reward of the reward,

86
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,900
Yu Lecheng994446 Com

87
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,500
You're very important.

88
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,300
You never like to treat your daughter.

89
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,940
This habit is not good.

90
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,300
How do you know I never treat my daughter?

91
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,180
Brother Su.

92
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,220
Brother Su.

93
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,620
Sister Yin Huang.

94
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,220
You didn't even call me when you left.

95
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,820
I...

96
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,660
You didn't see Mr. Su talking to my sister.

97
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,860
What are you talking about? Hurry up.

98
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,300
It's all on your face.

99
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,420
Are youheading ant AMG?

100
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,100
His Majesty is here.

101
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,900
Su Qing.

102
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,460
Yes, brother.

103
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,700
Please have a look at the play.

104
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,700
Okay.

105
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
Let's begin.

106
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,020
We're about to start.

107
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,860
The kids can't win.

108
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,460
If you have any tricks,

109
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,580
just let them out.

110
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,980
As long as you're safe, I'll do it.

111
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,460
Your Majesty, look at this.

112
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,460
Come on.

113
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,460
Look.

114
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,460
Go.

115
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,460
Okay, we won.

116
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,460
We won.

117
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,860
Bailiqi, how are you?

118
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,860
Don't worry, sir.

119
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,460
We won't hurt the guests.

120
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,860
You three,

121
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,060
thank your Majesty for your kindness.

122
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,660
Thank you, Your Majesty.

123
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,660
I'm not done yet.

124
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,060
You should thank them first.

125
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,860
Your Majesty,

126
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,660
they're all criminals.

127
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,060
They don't have any sales.

128
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,660
Why don't you

129
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,860
let them be the criminals

130
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,860
and let Ni Huang take them back?

131
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,260
Your Highness,

132
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,260
these three kids

133
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,060
are my children now.

134
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,860
If you're grateful,

135
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,860
I should take them back.

136
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,460
Mr. Su wants to take the children.

137
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,260
How can he not take them?

138
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,460
Is it because he's a good student

139
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,060
and he's afraid that Ni Huang will learn?

140
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,860
I'm going to take

141
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,860
these three kids.

142
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,860
Your Highness,

143
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,060
aren't you putting me in trouble?

144
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,660
Your Majesty,

145
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,860
Ni Huang said it first.

146
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,460
Your Majesty,

147
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,660
I haven't said it yet.

148
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,860
Why are you two fighting?

149
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,260
I'm not going to take them.

150
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,860
I won't break them for you.

151
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,260
Are these three kids' criminals?

152
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,260
He Min,

153
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,660
as for who should take them back,

154
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,460
you can discuss it yourself.

155
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,460
Father,

156
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,460
how can you just take these three kids?

157
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,260
Mr. Su has worked so hard for these five days.

158
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,860
If you don't have any reward,

159
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,060
I'll have to pay you back.

160
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,660
Your Highness,

161
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,660
you're too anxious.

162
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,860
Father didn't say he wouldn't take them back.

163
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,660
Father,

164
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,260
I think Mr. Su is a good man.

165
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,460
He should be at home with his family.

166
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,740
Mr. Su,

167
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,460
what do you want?

168
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,460
Have this.

169
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,060
Thank you.

170
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,460
You're really kind.

171
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,060
Thank you.

172
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,860
You promised too much.

173
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,060
Mom.

174
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,060
Even three children can't fight.

175
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,060
They want to challenge the princess.

176
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,060
Even if it's according to the order,

177
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,060
the princess doesn't want to fight by herself.

178
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,060
So they ask the three children to fight.

179
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,060
This is not bullying Bai Li Yong, right?

180
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,060
Master.

181
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,060
Bai Li Yong's health is important.

182
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,060
Take him back and recuperate.

183
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,060
Mr. Su, thank you.

184
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,060
After the ceremony, you will be rewarded.

185
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,060
Your Majesty, rise.

186
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,060
I will send you off.

187
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,060
Qing, bring some children to the palace.

188
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,060
Let's go.

189
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,060
I will wait for you outside.

190
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,060
Let's go.

191
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,060
I don't have any other eyes.

192
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,060
But I can see that

193
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,060
this sword can't beat Bai Li Qi.

194
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,060
He is so weird.

195
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,060
Can you explain it?

196
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,060
It's easy to explain.

197
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,060
You just have to use your strength.

198
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,060
You can't beat Bai Li Qi.

199
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,060
You can't beat Bai Li Qi.

200
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,060
It's very simple.

201
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,060
Just one sentence.

202
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,060
Bai Li Qi is the one who is blinded by Jiang Zuo.

203
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,060
He is the one who is blinded by Jiang Zuo?

204
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,060
I came to the capital to do some preparations.

205
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,060
First, I have to send Bai Li Qi.

206
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,060
I am afraid that there will be some other experts on the stage.

207
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,060
If the princess doesn't like it,

208
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,060
then I can send him to solve it.

209
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,060
It's a good idea to sell him a love.

210
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,060
A love?

211
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,060
What is it?

212
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,060
Yunnan's man is not a man who can do anything.

213
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,060
Although this sword is amazing,

214
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,060
I can see it.

215
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,060
Commander Meng can also see it.

216
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,060
Aren't you afraid that he will ask?

217
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,060
Commander Meng is very stable.

218
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,060
He has a good sense of justice.

219
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,060
I will make sure that he won't say anything.

220
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,060
Greetings, Princess.

221
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,060
I have ordered the empress

222
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,060
to be here again.

223
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,060
She said that she has not seen you for many days.

224
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,060
She really missed you.

225
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,060
I have been drinking tea today.

226
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,060
Please go to Zhengyang Palace.

227
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,060
Your Highness, please go to Zhengyang Palace.

228
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,060
Yes.

229
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,060
Your Highness, please.

230
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,060
How dare you disobey me?

231
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,060
Please.

232
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,060
I am sorry that I have not been able to help you.

233
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,060
I will go to Zhengyang Palace.

234
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,060
I am sorry.

235
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,060
I am sorry.

236
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,060
I am sorry.

237
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,060
I am sorry.

238
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,060
I am sorry.

239
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,060
I am sorry.

240
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,060
I am sorry.

241
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,060
I am sorry.

242
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,060
I am sorry.

243
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,060
I am sorry.

244
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,060
Actually, I am not sure

245
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,060
if I can get out of the palace.

246
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,060
You are not sure?

247
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,060
How can I not get out?

248
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,060
Actually, it is nothing.

249
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,060
I am tired these days.

250
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,060
Yes.

251
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,060
It is really easy to get three kids and five girls.

252
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,060
But today's battle is really exciting.

253
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,060
When we play the game,

254
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,060
I will tell Tingjie well.

255
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,060
If she knows that Bai Liqi is defeated,

256
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,060
she will be happy to die.

257
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,060
Who do you think?

258
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,060
Tingjie.

259
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,060
I have seen the prince of the Central Court.

260
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,060
You are going to play with him later?

261
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,060
Yes.

262
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,060
We made a deal yesterday.

263
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,060
Brother Su, why are you...

264
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,060
Brother Su, you...

265
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,060
Since you don't like to eat honey,

266
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,060
try this Quli soft cake.

267
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,060
It is very delicious

268
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,060
with the taste of the honey.

269
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

270
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,060
I can't eat this either.

271
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,060
You don't like sweet cakes.

272
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,060
Don't you know that, Your Highness?

273
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,060
I have been here for a few days.

274
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,060
I haven't been able to make a good call.

275
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,060
I will have dinner at the Zhengyang Palace today.

276
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

277
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,060
Your Highness, you shouldn't have said that.

278
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,060
It's just...

279
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,060
It's just...

280
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,060
I have already promised to go to the Zhaoren Palace.

281
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,060
I will go to the Zhaoren Palace.

282
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,060
I will go to the Zhaoren Palace.

283
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,060
I have already promised to go to the Zhaoren Palace.

284
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,060
I will talk to Yunnan's maid.

285
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,060
Your Highness, look.

286
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,060
I have met a family member in the palace.

287
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,060
Please don't fight with me.

288
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,060
You came to the Zhengyang Palace.

289
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,060
You didn't even drink a drop of water.

290
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,060
You were in a hurry to go to the Zhaoren Palace.

291
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,060
It's not that you are in a hurry.

292
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,060
It's me who is in a hurry.

293
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,060
Your Highness, you are very generous.

294
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,060
Let us leave first.

295
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,060
Brother Su.

296
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,060
Are you all right?

297
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,060
Are you all right?

298
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,060
Mr. Su, Commander Meng.

299
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,060
What's wrong with you, Mr. Su?

300
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,060
Commander Meng.

301
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:45,060
Please help me push Qi Xue down the palace.

302
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,060
Okay.

303
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,060
Xingrui.

304
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,060
Call the imperial physician.

305
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,060
Okay.

306
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,060
Yuji, go get some water.

307
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,060
Hurry up.

308
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,060
Okay.

309
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,060
Hurry up.

310
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,060
Please sit, Your Highness.

311
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,060
Your Highness, please invite me here.

312
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,060
I'm not afraid of just talking about family matters.

313
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,060
Please tell me if you have something to say.

314
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,060
Okay.

315
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,060
I won't be in a hurry.

316
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,060
Brother Meng, I think I was wrong.

317
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,060
What's wrong?

318
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,060
The Empress wanted to invite the princess.

319
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,060
I warned her to be careful of the Empress.

320
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,060
You warned her.

321
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,060
But Yuji told me just now.

322
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,060
The chat room that Prince Yu recommended

323
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,060
was arranged by him outside the palace.

324
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,060
That means the person who was going to be the next

325
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,060
is not the Empress and Prince Yu.

326
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,060
Could it be the Crown Prince?

327
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,060
This time, the one who chose it

328
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,060
was a young man named Sima Lei.

329
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,060
He was the one who personally selected

330
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,060
the Crown Prince to visit the Crown Prince of the capital.

331
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,060
This man is a good man with both his skills and talent.

332
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,060
He is definitely the best match for the princess.

333
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,060
Look, we are the same age.

334
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,060
The Crown Prince is very important to you.

335
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,060
I hope the princess can support the Crown Prince

336
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,060
more at this time.

337
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,060
The Crown Prince is the Crown Prince.

338
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,060
I, Yunnan, am in charge of the Imperial Court.

339
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,060
Today, I will be the Empress.

340
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,060
After the Crown Prince is on the throne,

341
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,060
I will be the new emperor.

342
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,060
Please don't worry about that.

343
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,060
Actually, I knew this would happen.

344
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,060
But I can't stop asking.

345
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:28,060
Our man's determination can't be changed.

346
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,060
Here, I toast to the princess.

347
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,060
I will be your advisor.

348
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,060
When we meet again,

349
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,060
I will definitely talk to the old man.

350
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,060
I will take care of those affairs.

351
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,060
You must be careful about those guards in the back.

352
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,060
Stay back.

353
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,060
Don't be too late now.

354
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,060
"[You clearly underestimated me for being ie.]

355
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,060
Brother Jinghong is6

356
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,060
It should all be solved soon.

357
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,060
It's about time that I have man ropes.

358
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,860
Okay.

359
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,060
Wait.

360
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Send someone to send a letter to the Empress.

361
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,460
She won't give up any chance to deal with Noble Consort Yue.

362
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,340
Also,

363
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,860
you're taking her with you to the Palace of the Moon.

364
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,660
Once Si Ma Lei comes out,

365
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,940
take her down with the reputation of a stranger.

366
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,060
Do you remember?

367
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,260
Thank you.

368
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,060
Come.

369
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,860
What about you?

370
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,660
I have something to do.

371
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,060
Go now.

372
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,060
Your Highness,

373
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,060
Prince Si Ma and Prince Si Ma are asking for an audience.

374
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,060
Oh, my goodness.

375
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,060
I've never asked Prince Si Ma to come see me.

376
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,060
If you're here,

377
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,060
let's have a look.

378
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,060
I've seen Si Ma Lei before.

379
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,060
She's no longer the Empress.

380
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,060
Please excuse me.

381
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,060
Princess.

382
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,060
Princess.

383
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,060
Princess.

384
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,060
Princess.

385
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,060
Greetings, Mother.

386
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,060
Greetings, Your Highness.

387
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,060
Princess.

388
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,060
Princess, are you okay?

389
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,060
Si Ma Lei, hurry.

390
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,060
Princess.

391
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,060
Princess.

392
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,060
You're so annoying.

393
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,060
Si Ma Lei.

394
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,060
Si Ma Lei, help me, Your Highness.

395
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,060
Princess.

396
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,060
Princess.

397
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,060
Princess.

398
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,060
Princess.

399
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,060
Hurry.

400
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,060
Stop her.

401
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,060
Princess.

402
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,060
Princess.

403
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,060
Princess.

404
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,060
Princess.

405
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,060
Princess.

406
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,060
Princess.

407
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,060
Princess.

408
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,060
Princess.

409
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,060
Princess.

410
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,060
Mother, please leave.

411
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:58,060
Your Highness, where are you taking me?

412
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,060
Mother, I miss you.

413
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,060
I'll take you to visit her.

414
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,060
Okay.

415
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,060
Okay.

416
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,060
Hurry.

417
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,060
Hurry up.

418
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,060
Prince Jing, this is the Imperial Palace.

419
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,060
You can't break in here.

420
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,060
Prince Jing.

421
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,060
Prince Jing.

422
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,060
Princess.

423
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,060
Princess.

424
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,060
Prince Jing.

425
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,060
Hurry.

426
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,060
Stop her.

427
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,060
Prince Jing.

428
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,060
Prince Jing.

429
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,060
I know you can't do anything.

430
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,060
I didn't expect you to be so annoying in my palace.

431
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,060
Do you want to rebel?

432
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,060
Prince Jing.

433
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,060
You dare to bully the princess.

434
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,060
You're so bold.

435
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,060
What did you do?

436
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,060
You know it yourself.

437
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,060
Get out of the way.

438
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,060
You...

439
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,060
Prince Jing is a killer.

440
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,060
He can't stand this.

441
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,060
What should we do?

442
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,060
Let the dead stop talking.

443
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,060
We have a chance to talk.

444
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,060
Give up.

445
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,060
But he's a prince.

446
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,060
He's not good at this.

447
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,060
His Majesty didn't treat him like a bad person.

448
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,060
Since he's in trouble and has changed our good things,

449
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,060
we can't let him get away.

450
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,060
Prince Jing broke into the palace.

451
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,060
He killed his mother.

452
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,060
He killed the princess.

453
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,060
He killed the princess.

454
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,060
Come on.

455
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,060
Let's go.

456
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,060
Stop.

457
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,060
Prince Jing.

458
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,060
You're so bold.

459
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,060
Prince Jing.

460
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,060
I'm good at fighting in the army.

461
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,060
I'm good at this.

462
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,060
Prince Jing is too close to me.

463
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,060
Jingyan.

464
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,060
What do you want?

465
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,060
Let me and the princess go out.

466
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,060
I don't want to.

467
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,060
Do you dare to kill the princess?

468
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,060
Do you want to bet on me?

469
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,060
Mother.

470
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,060
Mother.

471
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,060
The queen is here.

472
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,060
Go out from the back.

473
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,060
Remember.

474
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,060
You didn't kill Zhang Ronggong today.

475
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,060
Jingyan.

476
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,060
You broke into Zhang Ronggong and killed the princess.

477
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,060
This is not fair.

478
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,060
I don't want to be with you.

479
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,060
Let's take it as nothing happened.

480
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,060
You're a coward.

481
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,060
You should know that this is a good deal.

482
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,060
administer medicine.

483
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,060
I won't kill you.

484
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,060
Go ahead.

485
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,060
You're making me23 ani 16.

486
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,060
Everything will be fine.

487
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,060
I erase the bed sheet.

488
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,060
Put it under the writings.

489
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,060
If we have the time,

490
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,060
just send me over tooking encara.

491
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,060
那年鏈下面就沒人了

492
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,260
So, you can manage it ahead of tomorrow.

493
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,260
I want to eat even more.

494
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,060
You've paid.

495
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,060
But Why?

496
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,680
You peopleユ彥你拉人zo

497
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,680
Why is Princess Ni Huang lying on the ground?

498
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,680
What's wrong with her?

499
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,680
Today, I invited Princess Ni Huang to drink.

500
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
I didn't expect that the alcohol is too strong.

501
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
You're drunk.

502
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,680
Princess Ni Huang is a good girl.

503
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,680
Her alcohol tolerance is not bad.

504
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Why is it so easy to get drunk?

505
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
Yes.

506
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,680
I'm also surprised.

507
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,680
Maybe it's because of the marriage that happened recently.

508
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,680
I'm worried.

509
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,680
What's the position of the garden?

510
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Well...

511
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,680
Well...

512
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:38,680
The crown prince said he would show me how to make a sword.

513
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,680
If I do, I'll be a dancer.

514
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,680
You let Princess Ni Huang lie on the ground without a care.

515
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Instead, you and the crown prince will make a sword and a sword.

516
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,680
You can use this to destroy me.

517
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,680
Could it be that you will destroy His Majesty like this?

518
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,680
How to report to His Majesty about me?

519
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,680
I don't need to thank you, Your Highness.

520
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:11,680
Who gave birth to this child?

521
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Why is he lying on the ground?

522
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Come, get up.

523
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Come to the crown grandma.

524
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Come.

525
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
Grandmother, don't worry.

526
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,680
Ni Huang is just drunk.

527
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,680
But he will wake up sooner or later.

528
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,680
After he wakes up, I must tell him

529
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,680
not to drink so much alcohol again.

530
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,680
You bastard!

531
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,680
How dare you bully my sister?

532
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
I can't recognize you.

533
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,680
Beat me up!

534
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,680
What's wrong?

535
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,680
What's the big deal?

536
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,680
You came to the nursing home?

537
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Ni Huang, are you upset?

538
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,680
Please do it for Ni Huang.

539
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,680
This child is so stupid.

540
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,680
How could you do such a big deal?

541
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
Get up.

542
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
I have something to tell you.

543
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Noble Consort Yu, you are using the word of family.

544
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
You called Ni Huang to the Zhaoren Palace

545
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,680
but you secretly made a move in the water.

546
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,680
The crown prince was so angry that he took a trip to Sima Lei

547
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,680
and forced Ni Huang to marry.

548
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,680
I hope that His Majesty will investigate this matter

549
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,680
and give Ni Huang a justice.

550
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Noble Consort Yu,

551
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
Crown Prince,

552
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,680
is there anything wrong?

553
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,680
Your Majesty, I am wronged.

554
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,680
Today, I asked you to come and have a look.

555
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,680
Later, you were drunk and didn't have time to rest.

556
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,680
When Crown Prince and I were taking care of the child,

557
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,680
the Empress Dowager suddenly helped the Empress Dowager marry.

558
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,680
She didn't say anything and took the child away.

559
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,680
Then she received the imperial decree

560
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,680
and asked the Crown Prince to go to the Zhaoren Palace to see the child.

561
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
I was worried,

562
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,680
but I didn't dare to look at the Empress Dowager's will.

563
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
I didn't expect that the Empress Dowager

564
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,680
suddenly deducted such a huge amount of punishment.

565
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,680
I really don't know where it came from.

566
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Do you think that the Empress Dowager is not taking care of her?

567
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,680
Do you think that she is slow?

568
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,680
Your wine is really good.

569
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,680
The only thing that makes you drink is the heavy drugs.

570
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,680
It's not light.

571
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,680
Is there such a strong wine in the world?

572
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,680
Besides, I just drank this wine.

573
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,680
Crown Prince took Sima Lei to come and investigate.

574
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,680
Is this a coincidence?

575
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Today, the one that the Princess came to drink

576
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
is the one that His Majesty predicted.

577
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
His Majesty sent someone to investigate.

578
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
There is no second kind of wine.

579
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,680
And His Majesty has already been drunk.

580
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,680
There is only Crown Prince who came recently.

581
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,680
There is no Sima Lei.

582
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,680
His Majesty can ask all the people in Zhaoren Palace

583
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,680
to see if there is anyone else who can see Sima Lei.

584
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Zhaoren Palace is all yours.

585
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,680
If you refuse, who dares to punish you?

586
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,680
Your Majesty, please investigate.

587
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,680
Although Zhaoren Palace is all mine,

588
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,680
all the people in Zhaoren Palace are His Majesty's servants.

589
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,680
If His Majesty is so proud of himself, who dares to bully His Majesty?

590
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,680
You are really a cunning and kind person.

591
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,680
How dare you do this?

592
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,680
Is it possible that the Princess of Ni Huang

593
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,680
would have no reason to be so envious of you

594
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,680
with her daughter's body?

595
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,680
I really don't understand

596
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,680
why the Princess made such a story.

597
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,680
I don't know.

598
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,680
The Empress is so innocent.

599
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,680
She doesn't believe in me.

600
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,680
If His Majesty is willing to do so,

601
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,680
I would like to ask Your Highness to make a witness.

602
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,680
Your Highness, in the palace of Zhaoren Palace,

603
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,680
did anyone see that

604
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
someone is against the Princess?

605
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,680
Did anyone see that there is

606
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,680
a scene where she is not willing to look at?

607
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,680
That is because they arrived in time and

608
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,680
were not able to follow.

609
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,680
The Princess insists on believing that I am not a ghost.

610
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,680
I don't want to argue.

611
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,680
The Princess is closer to the Empress and the Prince of Yu.

612
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,680
And not me and the Crown Prince.

613
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,680
This is the reason why we are so close.

614
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,680
I don't dare to be willing to do so.

615
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,680
But please ask the Princess,

616
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,680
you said that you were into my trap.

617
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,680
Did your body get hurt?

618
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,680
I really suffered a poison.

619
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,680
How could there be a good and good Empress

620
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
to save me?

621
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,680
Ni Huang is in the battlefield.

622
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,680
He is fighting with thousands of soldiers.

623
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,680
He is against the British.

624
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,680
But he can't defeat you.

625
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,680
Could it be that I have the right to you

626
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,680
and move you to the border?

627
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,680
Your Majesty, Prince Jing wants to see you.

628
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,680
Why is he here?

629
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,680
He is not here.

630
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,680
Prince Jing said that he knows that

631
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,680
His Majesty is investigating the Princess.

632
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,680
He can testify.

633
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,680
What?

634
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Did you find him here?

635
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,680
Brother Su, is the matter over?

636
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,680
Yes.

637
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,680
Then go and see me play the game.

638
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,680
You are the one I have seen the most.

639
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,680
I am here to see you.

640
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,680
You said you could testify.

641
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,680
What to testify?

642
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,680
I can't believe you

643
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,680
are here to see me play the game.

644
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,680
Your Majesty,

645
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,680
I am here to see you.

646
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,680
You are here to see me play the game.

647
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,680
You are here to see me play the game.

648
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,680
You are here to see me play the game.

649
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,680
I saw the Princess

650
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,680
get married

651
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,680
in the Palace of the Zhao people.

652
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,680
And Sima Lei was

653
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,680
standing beside her.

654
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,680
She was in a hurry.

655
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,680
Prince Jing, you...

656
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,680
You had to be careful.

657
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,680
You wanted to force the Princess

658
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,680
to take her out.

659
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,680
But the Princess and the Princess

660
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,680
were in a mess.

661
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,680
So they were forced to do it.

662
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,680
They were forced to do it.

663
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,680
What did you say?

664
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,680
You want to frame the Crown Prince

665
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,680
for the hostage?

666
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,680
Your Highness, please tell me

667
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,680
I can't bear to

668
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,680
blame the Crown Prince for this.

669
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,680
But I don't want to hide the truth from you

670
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,680
and the Princess

671
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,680
to exchange the agreement.

672
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Please think about it.

673
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,680
If you didn't have the spirit,

674
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,680
how could the Crown Prince

675
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,680
want to kill me?

676
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
You want to kill the Prince?

677
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,680
This happened today.

678
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,680
It's not true.

679
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,680
Noble Consort,

680
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,680
is this true?

681
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,680
Since Your Highness, Princess

682
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,680
and Prince Jing are all guilty,

683
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
I don't dare to change

684
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,680
or to bring them any evidence.

685
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,680
If this happens again,

686
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,680
how can I resist?

687
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,680
I only want Your Majesty to be clear.

688
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,680
If Your Majesty

689
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,680
thinks I'm guilty,

690
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,680
then we

691
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,680
will not complain

692
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,680
about the Crown Prince and me.

693
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,680
Noble Consort, you...

694
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,680
Your Majesty,

695
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Commander Meng wants to see you.

696
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,680
He's here again.

697
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,680
Let him in.

698
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,680
Your Majesty, I'm looking for a palace.

699
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,680
I'm looking for a good

700
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,680
foreign minister

701
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,680
Sima Lei.

702
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,680
I have a position to make.

703
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,680
I don't want to be punished.

704
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,680
Please let me know.

705
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,680
Noble Consort,

706
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,680
what else do you want to say?

707
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,680
I'm wronged!

708
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,680
At this time,

709
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,680
do you still want to be wronged?

710
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,680
I'm not wronged.

711
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,680
But... but the Crown Prince is wronged.

712
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,680
What are you talking about?

713
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,680
I'm wronged.

714
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,680
I'm wronged.

715
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,680
But... but the Crown Prince is wronged.

716
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,680
What are you talking about?

717
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,680
All this

718
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,680
is my plan.

719
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
The Crown Prince doesn't know anything.

720
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,680
He just

721
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,680
let Sima Lei bring Sima Lei in.

722
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,680
He just

723
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,680
obeyed my order.

724
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
Your Majesty, you know

725
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
the Crown Prince is always

726
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,680
filial. He's not only

727
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,680
so filial to me, but also to His Majesty.

728
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,680
If the Crown Prince is completely innocent,

729
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,680
why would he

730
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,680
not have any change

731
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,680
since you guys entered the palace?

732
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,680
Your Majesty,

733
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
how could the Crown Prince have any change?

734
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,680
Could it be that

735
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,680
you let him take all the blame

736
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,680
and leave him with his own mother?

737
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,680
The Crown Prince is so filial.

738
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,680
He can't do this.

739
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,680
It's because he doesn't know how to protect himself.

740
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,680
That's why I've done so much for him.

741
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,680
I'm afraid that he'll be fooled by the innocent.

742
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,680
I'll be so upset for him.

743
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,680
I hope that he'll be more

744
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,680
responsible and more powerful

745
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,680
to make him pay for what he did.

746
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,680
Nonsense!

747
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,680
The Crown Prince is the guilty one.

748
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,680
How could anyone be so insincere?

749
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,680
As his mother,

750
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,680
I should have taught him

751
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,680
to be kind and righteous.

752
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,680
I should have done this

753
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,680
to save my father and my people.

754
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,680
I should have taught him to be kind and righteous

755
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,680
to protect him.

756
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,680
But what are you doing?

757
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,680
You can do

758
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,680
such a heart-broken and despicable thing.

759
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,680
If you have any problem today,

760
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,680
I'm afraid that you'll be killed.

761
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Even the Crown Prince's reputation

762
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,680
will be implicated by you.

763
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,680
It's a stupid thing.

764
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,680
Meng Zhi,

765
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,680
where is Sima Lei?

766
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,680
He's in the guards' room.

767
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,680
Get up.

768
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
I'm afraid that

769
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,680
he'll only be able to get in.

770
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,680
What's going on?

771
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,680
I think the Crown Prince

772
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,680
heard the news.

773
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,680
He went there and looked.

774
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,680
Then Sima Lei's leg broke.

775
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,680
It's broken.

776
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,680
He's the one who took it.

777
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,680
He's the one who sent the edict.

778
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,680
Sima Lei

779
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,680
went to the guards' room.

780
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,680
He's the one who

781
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,680
left the guards' room.

782
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,680
Sima Xu sent his men to the guards' room

783
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,680
to be in the guards' room.

784
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,680
He's been in the guards' room for three years.

785
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

786
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,680
Father.

787
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,680
Father.

788
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,680
Please.

789
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,680
Please, Father.

790
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,680
Father, I'm willing to take Mother

791
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,680
to apologize to Her Highness.

792
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,680
Father,

793
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,680
you'll be forgiven

794
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,680
for spending so much time with Mother.

795
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,680
You're a scumbag.

796
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,680
You've done such a foolish thing.

797
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,680
Why don't you go to the guards' room?

798
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,680
Where's your filial piety?

799
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,680
Father,

800
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,680
I only have one mother.

801
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,680
If Mother

802
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,680
has anything to do with it,

803
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,680
what should I do?

804
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,680
Father,

805
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,680
I'm willing to take it.

806
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,680
The moon is not good.

807
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,680
The moon is not good.

808
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,680
The moon is not good.

809
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,680
The moon is not good.

810
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,680
The moon is not good.

811
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,680
The moon is not good.

812
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,680
The moon is not good.

813
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,680
Everything is fine.

814
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,680
But the moon is not good.

815
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,680
The moon is not good.

816
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
The moon is not good.

817
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,680
The moon is not good.

818
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,680
Jingyan.

819
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,680
I'm here.

820
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,680
Do you know what's wrong?

821
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,780
Lonely, promise to say goodbye

822
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:38,840
Like the redoing clothes

823
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:45,680
The luckiest ending

824
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,360
In persistence

825
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,540
Mlething checkpoint

826
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:27,540
I am the one who is willing to die

827
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:32,540
I am the one who is willing to die

828
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:37,540
I am the one who is willing to die

829
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:42,540
I am the one who is willing to die

830
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:47,540
I am the one who is willing to die

831
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:51,540
I am the one who is willing to die

832
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,540
I am the one who is willing to die

833
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:59,540
I am the one who is willing to die

834
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:12,540
I am the one who is willing to die

835
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:20,540
I am the one who is willing to die
