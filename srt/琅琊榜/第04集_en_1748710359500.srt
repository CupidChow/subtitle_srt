00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,860
Episode 13

2
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,340
Stop !

3
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,380
OK !

4
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,400
Wait for me !

5
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,240
Who is度 Alright?

6
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,980
I have to say

7
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,960
Tie it in one hand

8
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,240
Thank you, emperor

9
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,040
is the mastermind of the royal family

10
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,340
He called me to testify

11
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,700
In the next days

12
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,180
I will marry you

13
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,380
There is a long line

14
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Isn't that so?

15
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,520
You haven't spoken to the princess yet.

16
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,880
Why are you so eager to talk about this?

17
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,680
You're speaking so strangely.

18
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,200
Are you the envoy of the North British

19
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,280
or the envoy of the Fourth Prince?

20
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Nihuang,

21
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,880
what are you talking about with Su Qing?

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,840
Mr. Su just discussed

23
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,000
the battle just now.

24
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
He's not saying anything.

25
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,920
Could it be that Su Qing

26
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,280
is having a Gaolun means

27
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,040
in martial art style?

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,040
Your Majesty.

29
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,600
Mr. Su said

30
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,760
even though Bai Li isはは

31
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,560
but he is so tough.

32
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,600
If they find

33
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,800
many little kids

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,380
的时候,便可祭 end.

35
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,980
ortortortortortortortortortortortortortortortortortortortortortortortortort island

36
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,280
几个小孩子便可积而导之!

37
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,040
先生若真是高人竞请辞教!

38
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,500
是我望言了,白蒂岐勇士功夫可以练到 of 그냥这个量的

39
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,040
实属不易,我怎能毁了他的虔诚呢?

40
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,120
还望二位寄魔放在心上。

41
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,140
先生在陛下面前放肆狂言,我们可不能当然没听到!

42
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,140
As you said, it's better to do it as it is.

43
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,140
You can ask some of the children to come and try.

44
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:58,260
Although we have a few

45
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,260
tired people in the White Power Yong clan,

46
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,260
I don't want to ruin your words.

47
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,260
How can you be so quick?

48
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,260
I really can find some children.

49
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,260
At least I can teach them a few days.

50
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,260
All right, all right.

51
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,260
Just think of me as a fool.

52
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,380
You two are far away.

53
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,380
It's not good to hurt your temper.

54
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,380
My lord,

55
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,380
I can't keep my word.

56
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,380
All right.

57
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,380
If you really want to teach them a lesson,

58
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,380
we won't be in a hurry.

59
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,380
Please make a decision.

60
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,380
We'll come back as you please.

61
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,380
But I also came out of the capital.

62
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,380
I'm not familiar with the land.

63
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Where should I find these children?

64
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
This is difficult.

65
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,500
I heard that there are many small schools

66
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
in the Five Kingdoms.

67
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
The children in the Five Kingdoms are too strong.

68
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,500
I'm afraid that the White Power Yong clan will be ruined.

69
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
It's still what you think.

70
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Let's talk.

71
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
He is also a poor girl!

72
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,700
Having a right to preach is a huge sin.

73
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,580
Creating a new saying.

74
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,580
Making good money.

75
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,580
He is a friend of yours.

76
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,500
Speak of it.

77
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,500
If I told you about a right of power,

78
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
I'mbrahim Lee once again will never lie to you.

79
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Nothing for you to marry!

80
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,500
I'm afraid that you and I can't get in on your piece of good.

81
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,340
We shutdown people like this one today so it's easy for you to avoid something

82
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,340
that has downs.

83
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,340
I see Ye You Ting Li has a lot of children.

84
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,340
Ye You Ting Li's crime is more suitable than the children of ordinary people.

85
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,340
I wonder if Your Majesty is right.

86
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,340
Wang Qing, look.

87
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,340
Your Majesty.

88
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,340
What Su Zhe said is not unreasonable.

89
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,340
If I win, of course it's good.

90
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,340
If I lose, I can kill Bai Li Qi's Rui Qi.

91
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,340
We have no loss.

92
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,340
Your Majesty, please be safe.

93
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,340
Yes, sir.

94
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,340
Guards.

95
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,340
Go to Ye You Ting and find some children.

96
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,340
Yes, sir.

97
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,340
Your Majesty, the people of Xiwu are watching the Golden Valley.

98
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
I'll go.

99
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,340
Okay.

100
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,340
Go.

101
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,340
Go.

102
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,340
Go.

103
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,340
Go.

104
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,340
Go.

105
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,340
Go.

106
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,340
Raise your head.

107
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,340
Raise your head.

108
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,340
Su Qing, do you think these children are suitable?

109
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,340
Commander Meng chose them himself.

110
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,340
The Golden Valley is not bad.

111
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,340
I just need to bring these children back to the manor

112
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,340
and teach them a lesson.

113
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,340
I hope Your Majesty will be well.

114
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
I hope so.

115
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,340
I hope you can teach them a lesson.

116
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,340
I hope you can teach them a lesson.

117
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,340
I hope so.

118
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,340
I hope you can win in the future.

119
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,340
I have a reward.

120
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,340
I hope you can win in the future.

121
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,340
I hope so.

122
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,340
But these children are guilty.

123
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,340
I'm sure they have no use in the Golden Valley.

124
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,340
Su Qing, you misunderstood.

125
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,340
I'm more than happy to have you.

126
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,340
The people of the grass are guilty.

127
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,340
They are all in charge.

128
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,340
I hope you can take the credit for your kindness.

129
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:19,340
Your Majesty, it's too early to discuss the reward.

130
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,340
You're right.

131
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,340
I'll see Su Qing's ability in five days.

132
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,340
Yes.

133
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,340
Su Qing, how much confidence do you have?

134
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,340
I tried it just now.

135
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,340
These three children will never be a match.

136
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,340
Have you heard of Lingxu Sword?

137
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,340
You said Lingxu is a phantom.

138
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,340
The one who is so evil.

139
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,340
I just heard it.

140
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,340
But I heard it was already lost.

141
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,340
What?

142
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,340
Can't believe you, Su Qing?

143
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,340
You are the best student in the world.

144
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,340
How dare you not believe me?

145
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,340
But these three children have no use in the game.

146
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,340
Since Brother Su said it,

147
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,340
he must be very confident.

148
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,340
If these three children win,

149
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,340
I don't think he will face

150
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,340
the battle between Ni Huang and me.

151
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,340
Meng Qing.

152
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,340
You are the first master of Liang.

153
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,340
You are the best at martial arts.

154
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,340
I trust you.

155
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,340
Look, Su Zhe is very strict today.

156
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,340
He is so strict.

157
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,340
He is very strict.

158
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,340
Your Majesty.

159
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,340
He said that Bai Liqi is not good at martial arts.

160
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,340
He is too strict.

161
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,340
That's right.

162
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,340
As far as I know,

163
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,340
there are indeed some strange moves and moves in the martial arts world.

164
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,340
The more you don't know martial arts, the more you can practice.

165
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,340
Your Majesty, you should watch it after five days.

166
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,340
Even if you lose,

167
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,340
you will not be able to fight more than you are now.

168
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,340
Sister Hui Fei.

169
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,340
Sister Jing Ping.

170
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,340
What's wrong?

171
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,340
Your eyes are red.

172
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,340
What else can I do?

173
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,340
If it's Empress,

174
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,340
Empress said that I can copy the scriptures and I can't read them.

175
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,340
I can just call me to the punishment.

176
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,340
The Empress Dowager asked me to go to the palace of Empress Dowager.

177
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,340
She ordered the three-dimensional knowledge of the Buddha's Hall to be the result.

178
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,340
The Empress Dowager has been in the palace for many years.

179
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,340
The palace is closed.

180
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,340
The Buddha's Hall is closed.

181
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,340
She is always so timid.

182
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,340
I will go with you.

183
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,340
Sister Wu.

184
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,340
Sister Wu.

185
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,340
Miss Zhen.

186
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,340
Sister, you can go now.

187
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,340
Come, let's go out.

188
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,340
Sister, the people who serve you are waiting in the corner of the south.

189
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,340
They are more cautious from this side.

190
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,340
But there is a chance that they will be able to escape.

191
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,340
They will be able to escape.

192
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,340
They will be able to escape.

193
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,340
They are now in danger.

194
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,340
But there is a sister who has been with me for so long.

195
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,340
Sister also knows that I am a maid.

196
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,340
I can't help myself.

197
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,340
Did you find the thing that the Empress and the mother wanted?

198
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,340
I did.

199
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,340
I did.

200
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,340
In the whole palace,

201
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,340
only the old servant has this thing.

202
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:24,340
Are you sure this is the thing that the Empress Dowager used to carry on Princess Liyang's body?

203
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,340
This is the love letter.

204
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,340
If you want to use it,

205
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,340
They are not talking about love letters.

206
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,340
Just half a cup is enough.

207
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,340
You stay here for a few days.

208
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,340
I will arrange for you to go to the palace to see your family.

209
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:41,340
But you can't tell anyone about the thing for the Empress Dowager.

210
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,340
Yes.

211
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,340
I understand.

212
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,340
Let me tell you.

213
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,340
I have heard of the love letter before.

214
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,340
It has the effect of blowing up love.

215
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,340
And the woman will be so helpless that she will die of boredom.

216
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,340
If it was the Empress Dowager who used it...

217
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,340
I don't know why there is such a thing in the palace.

218
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,340
But if someone wants to use it,

219
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,340
it's not a good thing.

220
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,340
I don't know.

221
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,340
It's not a good thing.

222
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,340
Sister, what should we do now?

223
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,340
In the palace, the Empress Dowager is not well.

224
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,340
I don't think she will hear it.

225
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,340
Let's go.

226
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,340
Beiliu.

227
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,340
Let them practice as fast as you.

228
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,340
Brother Su will have the chance to win.

229
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,340
Yes.

230
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,340
Faster.

231
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,340
You are really a good teacher.

232
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,340
Princess, please.

233
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,340
Why are you here?

234
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,340
Mr. Su.

235
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,340
Mr. Su is teaching these kids to play the game of white rice.

236
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,340
It has to do with me.

237
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,340
It's not a good thing to come here.

238
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,340
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,340
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,340
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,340
I'm sorry.

242
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,340
It's none of my business.

243
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,340
Come and see if it's not a good thing.

244
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,340
But these kids haven't made any progress yet.

245
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,340
I'm afraid they will make you laugh.

246
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,340
Thank you for coming.

247
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,340
You're welcome.

248
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,340
I have something else to do.

249
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,340
I won't bother you.

250
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,340
If you don't mind,

251
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,340
can you please teach these kids

252
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,340
how to play the game of white rice?

253
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,340
Mr. Su's way of playing is really amazing.

254
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,340
But it's not enough to attack.

255
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,340
White rice is hard to attack.

256
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,340
It's not easy to defeat him.

257
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,340
It's been a few days.

258
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,340
It's not too late.

259
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,340
It's been a few days.

260
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,340
Mr. Su,

261
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,340
you have something else to do.

262
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,340
I'm in a difficult situation.

263
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,340
I can't leave.

264
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,340
I hope you can take care of me.

265
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,340
Please don't worry.

266
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,340
I will make it through this.

267
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,340
I don't know why.

268
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,340
I trust you.

269
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,340
Be careful.

270
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,340
Take it.

271
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,340
Your Highness,

272
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,340
it's been an hour.

273
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,340
You should rest.

274
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,340
The medicine is not ready

275
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,340
for a day or two.

276
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,340
Why do you have to rush out?

277
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,340
You should have a good rest.

278
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,340
You can show your kindness to Empress Dowager.

279
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,340
You don't have to accompany me.

280
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,340
Go back and rest.

281
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,340
Yes.

282
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,340
I like this taste.

283
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,340
How is it?

284
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,340
It's good.

285
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,340
Who made it?

286
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,340
It must be Jingping.

287
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,340
Jingping?

288
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,340
I haven't seen him for a long time.

289
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,340
Jingping is not enough.

290
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,340
I can only ask him to stay outside.

291
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,340
If not for special summoning,

292
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,340
he won't see Empress Dowager.

293
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,340
Jingping is outside.

294
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,340
Call him in.

295
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,340
Yes.

296
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,340
Okay.

297
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,340
It smells good.

298
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,340
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

299
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,340
Your Highness,

300
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,340
please accept my greetings.

301
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,340
It's okay.

302
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,340
I like the medicine you made.

303
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,340
I see that you are much better than the one in the palace.

304
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,340
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

305
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,340
I can only do some small things

306
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,340
for Empress Dowager and all the concubines.

307
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,340
I think it's a little bit of a relief.

308
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,340
Your Highness,

309
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,340
I made this for you.

310
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,340
I have a share too.

311
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
The truth is very clear.

312
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,340
Please don't be angry.

313
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,340
Empress Dowager.

314
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,340
Empress Dowager.

315
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,340
Empress Dowager.

316
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,340
Empress Dowager.

317
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,340
Jingping, come here.

318
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,340
I know

319
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,340
you are a smart girl.

320
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:34,340
Are you used to living in the palace?

321
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,340
Thank you for your concern.

322
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,340
I am used to living in the palace.

323
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,340
After Consort Chen gave birth to a child,

324
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,340
she is not feeling well.

325
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,340
You are a medical girl.

326
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,340
Since I sent you into the palace,

327
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,340
you must take good care of her.

328
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,340
Grandmother, you must be tired.

329
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,340
Where is Consort Chen now?

330
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,340
Lingyuan is a rebel's mother.

331
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,340
She has died long ago.

332
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,340
Consort Chen is dead?

333
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,340
Where is my good grandson Jingyu?

334
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,340
Why didn't he come today?

335
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,340
Hurry up.

336
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,340
I will call him in.

337
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,340
Hurry up.

338
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,340
Hurry up.

339
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,340
Yes.

340
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,340
Empress Dowager.

341
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,340
Are you all right?

342
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,340
Empress Dowager.

343
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,340
Where is my grandson?

344
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,340
Your Highness, Princess Bi Yang is here.

345
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,340
Greetings, Princess.

346
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,340
I feel a little bit sick after coming in.

347
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,340
I can't call the doctor.

348
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,340
The medical girl in the palace is not well-off.

349
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,340
I just passed by your door.

350
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,340
I want you to help me see.

351
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,340
I am sorry.

352
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,340
Please help me see.

353
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,340
That's it.

354
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,340
You all wait outside.

355
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,340
Yes.

356
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,340
Imperial Concubine Jing is not that strong.

357
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,340
She can read and write.

358
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,340
She asked me to come here to see her.

359
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,340
What is the reason?

360
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,340
I am not very good at it.

361
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,340
I don't have the chance to talk to you.

362
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,340
Please forgive me, Princess.

363
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,340
You are always so calm.

364
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,340
I think you are right.

365
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,340
Tell me.

366
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:44,340
I am here because of a wine.

367
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:49,340
A wine that is called the wine of love.

368
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,340
I think...

369
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:59,340
In this world, only the Princess of the Royal Palace can understand it.

370
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:04,340
What kind of wine is this?

371
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,340
Li Yang, listen to me.

372
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,340
Come, drink this wine.

373
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,340
Li Yang, look at me.

374
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,340
I only said no more narrow · · · · · · · ·.

375
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,340
Minister, had this black slide been kept?

376
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,340
Its title was really safe and sealed of the show!

377
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:51,340
Now, I found it hard to remember but I am sorry to say something to you today.

378
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,340
What's the use of you mentioning it today?

379
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,340
It's not that I intentionally colluded with the past.

380
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,340
I'm upset that Princess Rourang is sad.

381
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,340
But I have no intention of knowing.

382
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,340
I came to the palace recently.

383
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,340
I was actually trying to imitate Empress Dowager that year.

384
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,340
I'm sorry again.

385
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,340
What are you saying? Who is it?

386
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,340
Who should I use it on?

387
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,340
I don't know who the person behind the scenes is.

388
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,340
I just want to use it on someone.

389
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,340
Think about the most important thing in the palace recently.

390
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,340
Can't Princess Rourang be able to guess it?

391
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,340
Princess.

392
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,340
Princess Rourang.

393
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,340
Yunnan's Talisman is 100,000 taels of gold.

394
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,340
It's really powerful.

395
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,340
All the rooms want to take Princess Rourang's place

396
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,340
and take her back to the palace.

397
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,340
How can she easily make her go back to Yunnan?

398
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,340
The most important thing in the palace is not to be taken by force.

399
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,340
Princess Rourang.

400
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,340
Now I have no other choice.

401
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,340
I can save Princess Rourang from the harm she caused.

402
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,340
And that's all I have.

403
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,340
Princess Rourang.

404
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,340
You've been practicing so well in the past two days.

405
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,340
Very good.

406
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,340
You're good at flying.

407
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,340
Mr. Su, Prince Jin is here.

408
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,340
Take them to play.

409
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,340
Yes.

410
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,340
Let's go.

411
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,340
Prince Jin is still worried.

412
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,340
He wants to check the situation of the stop.

413
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,340
I'm afraid you've already known I would come.

414
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,340
Mr. Su, you've been here a few days ago.

415
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,340
You're still worried about Prince Jin?

416
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,340
I'm worried about Prince Jin.

417
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,340
I'm worried about Prince Jin.

418
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,340
I've heard about the situation of Jin people in the palace a few days ago.

419
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,340
I've also inquired about your arrival.

420
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,340
What did you inquire about?

421
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,340
I've been away from the imperial court

422
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,340
and I've been informed about the situation.

423
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,340
I didn't know you were in a relationship with Prince Jin and Prince Yu.

424
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,340
It's really a miracle.

425
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,340
Prince Jin and Prince Yu are not my friends.

426
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,340
They just want to stop me from becoming a wooden god.

427
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,340
I heard that you were a genius in the art of the Meilang.

428
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,340
But you didn't expect to be a model.

429
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,340
Why not?

430
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,340
People have been working hard to build a palace.

431
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,340
If you can still make it to the temple,

432
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,340
you can still make it to the temple.

433
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:40,340
So, are you going to choose the crown prince or Prince Yu?

434
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,340
I want to choose you.

435
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,340
Prince Jin.

436
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,340
Choose me?

437
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,340
Choose me?

438
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,340
You're too blind.

439
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,340
My mother is just a servant in the harem.

440
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,340
She has no sense of honor.

441
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,340
My mother is just a servant in the harem.

442
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,340
She's just a servant. She has no sense of honor.

443
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,340
I'm 31 years old and I'm still not married.

444
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,340
I've been told by the military and the servants.

445
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,340
There are six of us in the court.

446
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,340
There are not many people.

447
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,340
What can you choose me for?

448
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,340
I know that you're in a bad situation.

449
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,340
I just have no choice.

450
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,340
I wonder if you're married and have a lot of children.

451
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,340
But the prince and the princess have gone to the city early this morning.

452
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,340
They're going to return tomorrow.

453
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,340
I wonder if you have something to do with it.

454
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,340
Return tomorrow?

455
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,340
Yes.

456
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,340
It's nothing.

457
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,340
I'll just go to the room.

458
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,340
I'll just go to the room.

459
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,340
In the capital, there is a crown prince and a prince.

460
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:24,340
No one in the court knows that the throne will be theirs.

461
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,340
The more you're sure of it, the more boring it will be.

462
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,340
If I can do it with my own strength,

463
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,340
I'll send a person who no one has ever thought of.

464
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,340
It will make me more mature.

465
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,340
So the world is a big one.

466
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,340
The idea is all a weirdo.

467
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,340
Prince Jin, to be honest,

468
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,340
are you really willing to watch this throne fall on his hands?

469
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:16,340
Since you're here, you must be ready to go.

470
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,340
You've already checked everything about me.

471
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,340
That's right.

472
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:26,340
I did check how the leader of the seven spirits can be blind.

473
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,340
The throne and I are far from being blessed and selfish.

474
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,340
But if you can break the rule of the crown prince and prince Yu,

475
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,340
I'm willing to do anything.

476
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,340
I'm just giving you a meeting.

477
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,340
If you're satisfied, you can just do it.

478
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,340
How is it?

479
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,340
You're just doing it for this?

480
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,340
Yes.

481
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,340
Since you're here,

482
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:10,340
you should know that the person I like the most is someone who is like you.

483
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,340
Even if you help me to ascend the throne,

484
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,340
you may not be able to get the great honor.

485
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,340
Don't you mind?

486
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,340
Coming to the court,

487
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,340
I'll have a chance to talk to you about the conditions.

488
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,340
What I see as important is your confidence

489
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,340
and the two of you are different.

490
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,340
We don't know each other.

491
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,340
How do I trust you?

492
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,340
How do you know?

493
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,340
Just be my bet.

494
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,340
Among the three princes who are in the world,

495
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,340
the third prince is born in a cruel state.

496
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,340
The sixth prince is a fierce and fearless man.

497
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,340
The ninth prince is still young and young.

498
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,340
I've already said

499
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,340
that although you're not in a good condition,

500
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,340
I don't have any other choice.

501
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,340
You mean that the princess of the Royal Palace

502
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,340
came out of the palace and went to the Prince of Mu's Manor?

503
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,340
Yes.

504
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,340
But the princess of the Prince of Mu's Manor and the prince are not here.

505
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,340
The princess of the Royal Palace is not in the palace either.

506
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,340
You may leave.

507
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,340
Yes.

508
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,340
You really can confirm that

509
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,340
the prince of the Prince of Mu's Manor is the prince of the Prince of Mu's Manor?

510
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:45,340
The Prince of Mu's Manor was born in a cruel state.

511
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:50,340
The Princess of Mu's Manor is a brave and fearless man.

512
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,340
The Prince of Mu's Manor is still young and fearless.

513
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,340
I think we can confirm it.

514
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,340
But, as far as I know,

515
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,340
the female lead in the game is quite famous.

516
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,340
It's not until one year that they're all forced to die.

517
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:11,340
It's not that easy for a single female lead to have a life after death, right?

518
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,340
I can't tell the details of the game.

519
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,340
But I can't tell the details of the game.

520
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,340
I can't tell the details of the game.

521
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:28,340
But the female lead is a loyal person.

522
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,340
While the situation was chaotic,

523
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,340
it's possible that she could have saved Jing Yu's blood.

524
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:43,340
I think the eyes of the child are a bit similar.

525
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,340
No matter what, it's always God's eyes.

526
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,340
To be honest, when you first sent someone to contact me five years ago,

527
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,340
I couldn't believe it.

528
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:03,340
Uncle, you never told me about that.

529
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:07,340
But I know that if you don't experience the pain of being a tough guy,

530
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:12,340
your appearance won't be like this.

531
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,340
Since I'm alive,

532
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,340
I won't live a simple life.

533
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,340
Sister, I've finished my homework.

534
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,340
Do you need anything else?

535
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,340
Are you going to ask me to do it?

536
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,340
It's okay. Go to take a shower and go to bed early.

537
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:54,340
Well, I'm still very nervous.

538
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:59,340
You said that Su Che could really defeat Bai Li Qi with three children.

539
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,340
But you were talking. Didn't you go to see her?

540
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,340
Can you really defeat her?

541
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,340
No matter what kind of defeat,

542
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,340
only three children can defeat Bai Li Qi.

543
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:17,340
I don't know where her confidence comes from.

544
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,340
That's not good. If she can't defeat her,

545
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,340
you'll have to personally go to the war. I'll ask her.

546
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,340
Come back. Why are you always so reckless?

547
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,340
I...

548
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:31,340
Don't worry. Even if you fight with Bai Li Qi like this,

549
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,340
your sister might not be able to defeat her.

550
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,340
You mean you're going to support Prince of Jing?

551
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,340
Prince of Jing is not good at fighting.

552
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,340
He has no power to fight.

553
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,340
Plus, he has some stubborn and stubborn temper.

554
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,340
What kind of threat is he going to get?

555
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,340
With his personality, how could he defeat the new-born prince

556
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,340
and Prince of Yu who is powerful and strong?

557
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,340
It's not me.

558
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:02,340
I'll do the things that will make the war go on.

559
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,340
If you want to push the evil official to the end,

560
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,340
it's hard for the people of Jing to get hurt.

561
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:13,340
Sometimes, you even have to hold onto them.

562
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,340
These pain and guilt,

563
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,340
Prince of Jing can't bear it.

564
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,340
Let me handle it.

565
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,340
Where is the crown prince?

566
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,340
Prince of Yu is still in the mansion. He hasn't come back yet.

567
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,340
If you and the crown prince come to greet him,

568
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,340
I'll tell him that I've already slept.

569
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,340
Yes.

570
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,340
Prince of Jing

571
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,340
Who is it?

572
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,340
It's late at night. Please excuse me.

573
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,340
I wonder if you can go inside.

574
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,340
What you said is really shocking.

575
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,340
But I don't understand anything.

576
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,340
With the crown prince's identity,

577
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,340
there should be many ways to stop this.

578
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,340
Why did you come to see Su Mao?

579
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,340
How many ways?

580
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,340
I don't think so.

581
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,340
I'm not a commoner.

582
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,340
I can't go to the imperial court.

583
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,340
I can't tell the emperor and the emperor.

584
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,340
I can't let my father and the crown prince get involved.

585
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,340
I want to go to the palace to stop them.

586
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,340
Who knows when they'll fight.

587
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,340
The crown prince's identity

588
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,340
is useless to me.

589
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,340
I understand.

590
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,340
What do you want me to do?

591
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,340
You and Beiyan's five days of marriage

592
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,340
will be in the palace tomorrow.

593
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,340
You should tell the princess

594
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,340
that you're going to leave the palace.

595
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,340
I'll tell the princess

596
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,340
that you're going to leave the palace tomorrow.

597
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,340
When you get to know the princess,

598
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,340
be careful.

599
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,340
Even if you're smart,

600
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
you should be fine.

601
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,340
Sister Zi Xi, what should we do?

602
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,340
The princess said

603
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,340
that we can't let the prince know that she's out.

604
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,340
The prince didn't come out

605
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,340
so quickly from the study.

606
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,340
You're really a good girl.

607
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,340
Aunt Qin.

608
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,340
You're in a hurry.

609
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,340
You're in a hurry.

610
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,340
I'll go to see the prince later.

611
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,340
Yes.

612
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,340
Have a rest, princess.

613
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,340
Please stay, my lord.

614
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,340
What are you doing?

615
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,340
Please excuse me, my lord.

616
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,340
The princess is in a bad mood today.

617
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,340
I've told her that no one is here.

618
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,340
Even I'm not here.

619
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,340
Please excuse me.

620
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,340
I'm sorry.

621
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,340
I'm sorry.

622
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,340
I'm not here either.

623
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,340
Please forgive me.

624
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,340
The princess doesn't want to see you

625
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,340
the most.

626
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,340
How dare you!

627
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,340
What nonsense are you talking about?

628
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,340
I deserve to die.

629
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,340
But today,

630
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,340
the princess came to the palace

631
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,340
to see the Empress Dowager.

632
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,340
Wuyi Jian went to

633
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,340
the Empress Dowager's palace.

634
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,340
She remembered that I was old

635
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,340
and hurt all the time.

636
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,340
My lord, you understand, right?

637
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,340
I'm sorry for the trouble.

638
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,340
Don't worry, princess.

639
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,340
I'll take care of it.

640
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,340
Please excuse me.

641
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,340
I'll take my leave.

642
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,340
Since the princess is resting,

643
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,340
you can take care of her.

644
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,340
Yes.

645
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,340
Who is it?

646
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,340
Such a despicable thing is happening behind you.

647
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,340
It's not the Empress.

648
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,340
It's the Noble Consort.

649
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,340
It's time to see who will

650
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,340
enter the palace tomorrow.

651
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,340
I'm sorry.

652
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,340
I'm sorry.

653
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,340
I'm sorry.

654
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,340
I'm sorry.

655
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,340
I'm sorry.
