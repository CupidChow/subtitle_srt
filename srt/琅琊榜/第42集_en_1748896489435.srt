00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Where's Jin Nang?

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He's been in the sky for a long time.

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Open it.

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Now?

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Is it still not too late?

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If we miss the chance of the Spring and Summer in March,

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
we're really done.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Open it.

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Jin Huan?

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This...

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
How could it be a letter...

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
a letter to Prince Yu?

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The person who wrote it wasn't Princess Xuan Ji.

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It was her sister, Princess Ling Long.

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why are you here again?

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't want to hear any noise from the court.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't you understand my words?

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Your Highness.

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
My Your Highness.

23
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You can't give up.

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're a burden.

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Not only are you burdened,

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
but also our hope for the whole Huazu.

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Huazu?

28
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You've been helping me for so many years.

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But you're doing the thing that's to prevent the Huazu.

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I won't send you to the Ministry of Justice...

31
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
to punish you.

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How dare you mention Huazu to me?

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Your Highness.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I only knew it today.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So, you've been...

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
keeping the blood of the Huazu.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

40
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Recently,

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the officials have been saying that...

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Prince Yu and Xuan Jing Si...

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
were trying to prevent the Great Khan from coming.

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm just trying to keep him from getting better.

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's a punishment.

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What do you think?

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Your Majesty's decision...

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
is of course of your own.

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Jing Huan.

50
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Tianzi is smart.

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The first female king of the澳門仙埔京娛樂城 9494466,

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
com,

53
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
is the most exciting game online.

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The horse is running.

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The horse is running.

56
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The second female king of the Shangjing City,

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
the prince of the Shangjing City,

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
the prince of the Zhaocaimeng,

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
the prince of the Shangjing City,

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
the prince of the Shangjing City,

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
the prince of the Shangjing City,

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
the prince of the Shangjing City,

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
the prince of the Shangjing City,

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
com.

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I've been a good boy since I was a child.

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Everyone says...

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the prince is like me.

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Actually,

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't think so.

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Your Majesty.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Prince Yu is now being forced to stay in the capital.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
he won't be able to get the throne again.

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
His Majesty is a small town.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He's a smart man.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He'll know the truth.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm afraid he'll be like his mother.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He won't be able to tell the truth.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Your Majesty.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're the only one who knows

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
what I want to hear.

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
These years,

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've been in love with Jinghuan.

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You only know

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
how to understand.

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Your Majesty.

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How did you come up with

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
the past?

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This secret

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
will disappear with you and me sooner or later.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The reason why

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
he was the king of the Seven Pearls

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
is that he was so loyal to the crown prince.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I really want to see

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
if his virtue can surpass the crown prince,

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the world

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
will not be able to give him the throne.

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's a risk.

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Your Majesty, you're being generous.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm generous.

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But look at what he's been doing these years.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He's been fighting the crown prince for so many years.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He's been fighting for so many years.

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He's been a master of his own virtue.

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He's been really worried about me for so many times.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll leave it to him.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Tell me.

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Can I be at ease?

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll take it.

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll take it.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It turns out that my mother is the princess of the Huazhu.

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Master, you're the master of the first step.

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I need you to help me.

114
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Until now

115
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I've realized my true intention.

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Your Highness.

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You must avenge the two princesses.

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You must avenge the two princesses.

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You must avenge the two princesses.

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Jing Huan.

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The last thing that mother regrets in this life

122
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
is that she's wronged the king of Liang.

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
She's been a traitor since she was ascended to the throne.

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
She didn't just follow the rules

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
but also give us the Huazhu

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
to make a big deal out of it.

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
She sent out the Chiyan army to kill them.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The Huazhu was destroyed.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
They were not allowed to return.

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
They were punished by the Chiyan army.

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Later,

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
how did my mother die?

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I heard from Master

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
that Princess Linglong

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
was the last one who died in the last second of the war with Liang.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Only my master Xuan Ji

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
could escape from the royal family.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Father.

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I finally understand

140
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
why I was so hard-working.

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You always ignored me.

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So, from the moment I was born,

143
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I decided to never

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
become a traitor.

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I was a traitor.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You were destined to never

147
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
become a traitor.

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Because you would never let a son

149
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
who was left by the Huazhu

150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
inherit the throne.

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You are the greatest blessing to me.

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You just treat me

153
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
as your wife.

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
From the time I was a prince,

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I am now the King of Qing.

156
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You are so funny.

157
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You are so funny.

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I have always been a prince.

159
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No matter how I fight with Jingyan,

160
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
or Xuan Dong,

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I never thought

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I would fight you.

163
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And you.

164
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I will tell Xia Jiang

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that we still have a lot

166
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
to do

167
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
in the three months.

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yes.

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
How did you get the throne?

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I was a traitor.

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I was a traitor.

172
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was a traitor.

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I was a traitor.

174
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I will do it now.

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The emperor is here.

176
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Your Highness,

177
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
how did you do this?

178
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
If you are tired,

179
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
how can you do it?

180
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's all about the habit.

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I am tired.

182
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What good thing

183
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
do you have today?

184
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The new spring tea.

185
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,520
I have finished the

186
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,000
Yangju Hall and Zhengyang Palace.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Of course it's here.

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Your Highness is making tea.

189
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Maybe you can use it.

190
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Your Highness,

191
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
making tea is always

192
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
a beauty.

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You don't need other green tea.

194
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't talk about the five-y-y tea.

195
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't understand

196
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
how good it is.

197
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I will leave two bags

198
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
and have a look.

199
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Thank you for coming.

200
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,600
The palace is always

201
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
a little bit crowded.

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But it's also your kindness.

203
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Don't be angry.

204
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You are making me upset again.

205
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's your reward.

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Who dares to be angry?

207
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Your Highness,

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I will take my leave

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
from here.

210
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Xiaoli,

211
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
take the Zi Tang He Zhuang.

212
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Wait for Jing Nian to enter the palace

213
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and let him take it away.

214
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yes, Your Highness.

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That child

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
has always liked drinking water.

217
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He is a good drinker.

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Please.

219
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's really good tea.

220
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Of course.

221
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
My sister knows

222
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
you like drinking tea.

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
She sent someone from Minzhou to come here.

224
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Even the interior silk

225
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
is no better than this tea.

226
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Thank you for your trust.

227
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
My sister's heart,

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
you can remember it.

229
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But to be honest,

230
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
what's the difference

231
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
between this tea and my drink?

232
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
How can I not drink it?

233
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Someone likes tea,

234
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
so naturally, someone dares not.

235
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Some people

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
just need to give you a cup of white water.

237
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Where is Fei Liu?

238
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I want to play with him.

239
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He must be in the yard.

240
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I will go now.

241
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Your Highness.

242
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You should go back

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
and bring the guest

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
who lives in your mansion.

245
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What?

246
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You want to take him away?

247
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes.

248
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I will send someone to pick him up today.

249
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Let him prepare for it.

250
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He has been living there for almost three months.

251
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
He is really reluctant.

252
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Fei Liu, what are you playing?

253
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Young Marshal.

254
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Young Marshal.

255
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Young Marshal.

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The position of the Gui Wei is not checked.

257
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's not your fault.

258
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's good to be able to come out.

259
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Get up.

260
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You go in first.

261
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Don't be so excited.

262
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Prince Jin will be here soon.

263
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You should be careful

264
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
when you talk.

265
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Especially,

266
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
you should know my name.

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes.

268
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Greetings, Prince Jin.

269
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Prince Jin.

270
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Please sit down and talk.

271
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I think what you said

272
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
is a long story.

273
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay.

274
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Come on.

275
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't want to be in the same position

276
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
as you.

277
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I have many questions.

278
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Please sit down.

279
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
There are many questions.

280
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You need to ask me.

281
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't want to be in the same position

282
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
as you.

283
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I have been hiding the goods

284
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
for many years.

285
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I thought I would never be in the same position

286
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
as you.

287
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I was so lucky

288
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
to meet you again.

289
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I hope you can help me.

290
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Your Highness, please ask me.

291
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I will be in the same position

292
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
as you.

293
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I will be in the same position.

294
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
There were many other

295
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
new members

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
who were in the same position as you.

297
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes.

298
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
But there are not many.

299
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm afraid there are fewer people

300
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
who are in the same position as you.

301
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
After the election,

302
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
you will have to work hard.

303
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So you can't even

304
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
return the soldiers.

305
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You can only stay in the same position

306
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and live a life of your own.

307
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Who else do I know?

308
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
There are not many people.

309
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm afraid

310
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
you are not familiar with

311
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
what you have done.

312
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Since you are still alive,

313
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
you are not a person

314
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
who is beautiful.

315
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Maybe

316
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
there are other people who can...

317
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Your Highness,

318
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I was not beautiful at that time.

319
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The front line of Nifeng Shui Ling

320
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
was not in the right place.

321
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I didn't feel any pressure to reinforce it.

322
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Don't send me.

323
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Go to the front line.

324
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
How can my beauty

325
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
be like this?

326
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The Chiyan Army of General Lin

327
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
is the strongest battle in the country.

328
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But with Xie Yu and Xia Jiang

329
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and the 100,000 soldiers that Xijin has sent here,

330
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
how could they be like this?

331
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Do you think

332
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
we are like this

333
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
with Xie Yu and Si Sha?

334
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Your Highness,

335
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
what's wrong?

336
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Nothing.

337
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Nothing.

338
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Go and rest.

339
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yes.

340
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Sister Chen Fei,

341
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
what will you

342
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
hear tonight?

343
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What did you

344
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
suffer

345
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
from?

346
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
With General Lin's personality,

347
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
we won't be a burden.

348
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But when Xie Yu's head was raised,

349
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
we had just experienced

350
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
a terrible battle.

351
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We had no strength.

352
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
A terrible battle?

353
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Did Xie Yu

354
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
report that

355
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
the 200,000 soldiers who retreated from the Great Fish

356
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and kept the North Jing's defense at bay?

357
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It was actually your attack.

358
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The Great Fish and the Wuliguo were in the army.

359
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
If it weren't for our Chiyan Army,

360
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I would have lost my last chance

361
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
to defeat the Yellow Shaman army

362
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
who was in the opposition.

363
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
How could the Great Liang

364
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
have a peace of 13 years in the North?

365
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We were far away from the Emperor of the Capital.

366
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
We were only using

367
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Xie Yu and Xuan Jing Si's secret treasure.

368
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
With the help of the Great Fish

369
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
and the Wuliguo,

370
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
we could have lost

371
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
the Chiyan Army

372
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
and the Wuliguo.

373
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The charm of the past year

374
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
is that

375
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
the Great Liang

376
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and the Wuliguo

377
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
were the only ones

378
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
who were left behind.

379
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The Great Liang

380
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
was the only one who was left behind.

381
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The Great Liang

382
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
was the only one who was left behind.

383
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The Great Liang

384
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
would have been destroyed

385
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
if it hadn't been for the Great Liang

386
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and the Wuliguo.

387
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
We were two in the opposite team.

388
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The Great Liang

389
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and the Wuliguo

390
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
were the only ones left behind.

391
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
We could have lost

392
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
our last chance

393
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
to defeat the Great Liang

394
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
and the Wuliguo.

395
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
There's no way

396
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
the Great Liang

397
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
would have destroyed the Great Liang

398
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,960
After that,

399
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,280
I found out something was wrong.

400
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,480
I thought the wind that came to the ring

401
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,560
didn't show up.

402
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,400
So I sent my men to the ring.

403
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,840
Who knew that I had just left the mountain?

404
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,360
Xie Yu and Xia Jiang's 100,000 soldiers

405
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,760
arrived.

406
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,480
I thought...

407
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,480
I thought they were the Yuan Army.

408
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,320
Thanks God.

409
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,000
Every second of the curry

410
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,800
was burned to pieces.

411
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,360
Jiao Shi died,

412
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,240
Her Majesty was killed on the hunt.

413
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,560
We were killed

414
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,040
by the most popular imperial fм Jorgeiro.

415
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,160
A very intense

416
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,320
murder had filled up

417
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,600
our own 몸.

418
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Many people died.

419
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,480
I don't know what happened.

420
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
Go back to your place.

421
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
I can't go back.

422
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
I can't go back.

423
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
I can't go back.

424
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
I really can't go back.

425
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
This is the 13th year of Zhengzheng.

426
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,480
I hope that the king will not be in danger.

427
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
I really can't go back.

428
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
I really can't go back.

429
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
I really can't go back.

430
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
Your highness.

431
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Your highness.

432
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
The prince is in danger.

433
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
He is in danger.

434
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,480
It's not easy to tell him to go back.

435
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
In the future,

436
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
you can be a spy.

437
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
You can be a disciple.

438
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,480
As long as you have a solid goal,

439
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
you can't be a spy.

440
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Yes, your highness.

441
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
If you want to return the favor,

442
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
you have to admit your mistake.

443
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
But this mistake is too big.

444
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
How can you admit it?

445
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,480
Besides,

446
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
I am now a criminal.

447
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
His words

448
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
can't be used in the court.

449
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Please don't think too much.

450
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,480
But...

451
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,480
But why are you so angry?

452
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,480
Please, please, please.

453
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
I am not a spy.

454
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
I am just a spy.

455
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,480
You can't be a spy.

456
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
You still have the blood of the prince.

457
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
If you agree with me,

458
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,480
you have to admit your mistake.

459
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
This means that

460
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,480
he will kill the emperor and the emperor

461
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,480
in the future.

462
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
It's not easy.

463
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,480
Your highness.

464
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,480
If you want to achieve your final goal,

465
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
at this moment,

466
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
you can't

467
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
bring out the case of the re-examination.

468
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
Let me remind Mr. Su.

469
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,480
My final goal

470
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
is to find out the case.

471
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,480
Other things

472
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
can be considered

473
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
as a matter of the moment.

474
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
Yes.

475
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
I will do my best.

476
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
The spring festival is coming.

477
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,480
I have something to discuss with you.

478
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
But

479
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
maybe the south is not so far away.

480
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
Please excuse me.

481
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
You are welcome.

482
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
As for General Wei,

483
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
it's quiet here.

484
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
It's safe to live here.

485
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
You can rest assured.

486
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
Thank you, sir.

487
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
You can save him this time.

488
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
You can rely on Mr. Su.

489
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
You can live here.

490
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,480
You still need to listen to

491
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,480
his orders.

492
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Yes.

493
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
I will do my best.

494
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
As you command.

495
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
What do you mean?

496
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
You are welcome.

497
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,480
I won't bother you.

498
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Goodbye.

499
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,480
Goodbye.

500
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,480
Sister.

501
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
I can't die

502
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
because of some lies.

503
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
You want him to live

504
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
and there is a reason for that.

505
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
As long as I ask what I want,

506
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,480
I will let you go.

507
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
Tang Long.

508
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Ju Niang.

509
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Why are you here?

510
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
I didn't pay attention to them.

511
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
I escaped through the key.

512
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480
Let's go.

513
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
Okay.

514
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
I'll take you away.

515
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
As long as we escape

516
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
from the brothers in the door,

517
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
we will be safe.

518
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
You can't go back to Jiangsuo again.

519
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
You are already

520
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
a rebel.

521
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
You can't go back to Jiangsuo.

522
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
You can't go back to Jiangsuo.

523
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
You can't go back to Jiangsuo again.

524
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
You can't go back to Jiangsuo.

525
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
You are already dead.

526
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
And

527
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
your master is dead.

528
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
What are you doing?

529
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,480
I heard from those who saw me yesterday.

530
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480
Wei Changsu was poisoned during the patrol.

531
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
He has been poisoned.

532
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Now you are the one who is the master of the martial arts.

533
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
Even if you escape,

534
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
we can only leave the city

535
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
to escape from the village.

536
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
It's impossible.

537
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,200
No way.

538
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,000
The Chief...

539
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,880
No way.

540
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,240
No way.

541
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,560
How is that possible?

542
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,720
You know Xuanjing Temple's means.

543
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,040
As long as they poison it,

544
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,760
there's no way to revive it.

545
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,080
No.

546
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,600
No way.

547
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,320
There are so many people around the Chief.

548
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,240
Dr. Yan has been healing him.

549
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,080
And the Master of the Lian Shao.

550
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,640
He saved his life.

551
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,040
When the Chief was giving birth to the Fire Hive,

552
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,160
he was so sober.

553
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,120
He was so sober.

554
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,320
Fire Hive?

555
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,040
What fire hive?

556
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,040
You...

557
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,320
Your Highness.

558
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,280
It's going to be spring.

559
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,160
I got news.

560
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,600
His Majesty is only with Consort Qing.

561
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
He also ordered Prince Jing

562
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,200
to take Mei Changsu to Lian Shao.

563
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,720
Okay.

564
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,560
Take Mei Changsu away.

565
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Leave the Empress.

566
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,480
I'll help him.

567
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:40,960
But...

568
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,200
The Empress isn't from the Hua Clan.

569
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,720
Will she help me?

570
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,440
She won't.

571
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,000
For so many years,

572
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,120
I've been obedient.

573
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,840
She's getting married to Consortà

574
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,600
and supervises all the traitors.

575
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,760
Now, like crochets,

576
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,840
she's late.

577
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,360
The

578
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
the

579
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,360
the

580
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
the

581
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
the

582
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,360
the

583
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,360
the

584
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
the

585
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,360
the

586
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,360
the

587
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,360
the

588
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
the

589
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,360
the

590
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,360
the

591
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,360
Your Highness,

592
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
is Longzhang all right?

593
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
Father has been resting.

594
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,360
Your Highness.

595
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Your Highness, Mr. Su.

596
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Mr. Su's camp is in the middle.

597
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
Be careful not to get caught.

598
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
You can't be careless.

599
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,360
That's exactly what I've planned.

600
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,360
Mr. Su's camp is ready.

601
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
Let's go rest now.

602
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,360
Your Highness,

603
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360
these days of being on the road,

604
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
there are indeed some tiredness.

605
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,360
Su Meng has lost his company.

606
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,360
That's good.

607
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,360
Mother also said that she wants to see you.

608
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
I don't think she'll be in a hurry today.

609
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,360
Please go to bed.

610
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,360
Your Highness.

611
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,360
You three,

612
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,360
do you want to compete?

613
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
Father is biased.

614
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
Who dares to compete with Jingyan?

615
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,360
You guys are not afraid of me.

616
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,360
Jingyan, come on.

617
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,360
Aom Shimp Golden Entertainment Center 949466.com

618
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,360
The most exciting game on the line.

619
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,360
The horse is running.

620
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
The horse is running 2.

621
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,360
The reward queen.

622
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
The treasure Golden City.

623
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,360
The rich cat.

624
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,360
The reward captain.

625
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,360
The super high-payment rate.

626
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,360
The reward rate is higher.

627
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,360
The reward chance is high.

628
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,360
Hurry up and join.

630
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,360
Aom Shimp Golden Entertainment Center 949466.com

631
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
General Lie.

632
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,360
They're all gone.

633
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,360
Why don't you go?

634
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,360
Your Highness told me to protect you.

635
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,360
What's the danger?

636
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,360
There are so many people.

637
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
Go ahead.

638
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
Okay.

639
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,360
Mr. Su.

640
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
Don't rush.

641
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,360
I'll let Brother Fei Liu take you there.

642
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,360
But remember.

643
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,360
It's spring now.

644
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,360
It's not suitable to kill.

645
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,360
So, it's better to use some of your power.

646
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Don't run around after the animals.

647
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Just take a look around.

648
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,360
Yes, sir.

649
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,360
Go.

650
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,360
Brother Su, are you taking the whole life as a disciple?

651
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
It's okay.

652
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,360
You're so biased.

653
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,360
You've never taught me.

654
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
Do you remember

655
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,360
who taught you the rules

656
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
when you first joined the Wili?

657
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
It's Brother Lin.

658
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,360
It's not like a young man

659
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
who's too energetic

660
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,360
and doesn't want to talk.

661
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,360
It's like having a new life.

662
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
Young people

663
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,360
sometimes have a happy life

664
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
and sometimes don't.

665
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
They don't care about their own life.

666
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,360
Anyway, you're not your own son.

667
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
You're just a new official.

668
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
You're really smiling.

669
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,360
You're really smiling.

670
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
Young man's home.

671
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,360
Third Brother.

672
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,360
Jingyan, what's wrong?

673
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,360
Why aren't you happy?

674
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,360
Jingyan.

675
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,360
Nothing.

676
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,160
But I don't know what's wrong with this.

677
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,860
I feel a bit uncomfortable.

678
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,160
I think Jingyan is too scared.

679
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,160
Xuanjing Temple is too disgusting.

680
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,160
Think about how many people are in the Jin family.

681
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,160
If it were me, I would have been scared to jump into the Jin family.

682
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,860
It's thanks to Jingyan.

683
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,160
The Jiujing sand factory is still able to hold on.

684
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
You?

685
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
Xuanjing Temple is not as good as you.

686
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,960
That's true.

687
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,360
I'm afraid that you will have to sleep for an hour.

688
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
I'll go back to my camp first.

689
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
I'll be in your care.

690
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,360
Don't worry, Noble Consort.

691
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,360
When His Majesty wakes up,

692
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,360
I'll call someone to inform you.

693
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,960
Go and find Prince Jing.

694
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,160
Ask him to invite Mr. Su to come to see me.

695
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,360
Yes.

696
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,360
Greetings to Your Highness the Prince of Ning.

697
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,160
Your Highness the Prince of Huayuan.

698
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,160
Your Highness, Noble Consort asked you to invite Mr. Su to his camp.

699
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,960
Mr. Su, Prince Jing is inviting Consort Jing.

700
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,860
Go and see if my Queen Mother is here now.

701
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,560
Greetings, Mother.

702
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,360
This is Mr. Su, who I often mention to my mother.

703
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,360
Greetings to Your Highness Consort Jing.

704
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,360
Mother.

705
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
Greetings.

706
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

707
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,360
Mr. Su, you've been through a lot. Please sit down.

708
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,360
Yes.

709
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:24,360
Mr. Su, you've been through a lot. Please sit down.

710
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
Yes.

711
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,360
Mr. Su, you've been living in the capital for more than a year, right?

712
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,360
Is it still a habit to live in the capital?

713
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,360
The capital is colder.

714
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,360
Other than that, it's still a habit.

715
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
Are you afraid of cold?

716
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
Yes.

717
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,360
Jingyan, you won't take care of anyone.

718
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,360
Have you noticed the fire in your tent?

719
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:14,360
It's cold outside the wild.

720
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,360
Your Highness, this is wrong.

721
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,360
He took good care of you.

722
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,360
Now no one dares to come to my tent.

723
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,360
It's too hot.

724
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,360
In the hunting palace, it's not like in the capital.

725
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,360
You often have to walk outside the tent.

726
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,360
If it's warm inside, it's cold outside.

727
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
I'm afraid it's even more difficult to get sick.

728
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,360
Mr. Su, you still have to be more careful.

729
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,360
I'm sure you'll be fine.

730
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
Thank you for your concern.

731
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,360
Wait.

732
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
Mr. Su, you're here with a cold.

733
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,360
You don't have to drink this tea.

734
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,360
Go get some purple ginger tea.

735
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
Yes.

736
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,360
Your Highness, you're really a good person.

737
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,360
You've been so hard on your part for so many years.

738
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,360
I'll have a cup of tea.

739
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Thank you for your consideration.

740
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Please.

741
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,360
You're not hot at all.

742
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,360
You don't know how hot it has been since the discussion.

743
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
I'm really sorry.

744
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,360
You're alright?

745
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,360
How were your lastannerings?

746
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,360
XU really needs some care.

747
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,360
That was a time to do some house custom.

748
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,360
Thank you for your consideration.

749
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,360
I set a circle.

750
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,360
KEN showed up with a couple of買 this year.

751
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,360
I'll come again with Mr. Su.

752
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,360
I think you're pale and pale.

753
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,360
You're not in a good mood.

754
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,360
You should have been patient for a long time.

755
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,360
I'm still in a good mood.

756
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
