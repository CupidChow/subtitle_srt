00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 14

2
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,720
I'm guilty.

3
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,520
I'm useless.

4
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,120
I can't help you.

5
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,840
I thought I was filthy

6
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,680
and a minimum of energy.

7
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
I never thought

8
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,300
she was crazy about its tricks.

9
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,720
She destroyed His Highness's Par's situation.

10
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,320
And raised the question here.

11
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,740
Why should you say that?

12
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,400
I should

13
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,920
pay my ê¹Œ

14
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,860
for all I want to gain punishment for.

15
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Wake up, Lan Jin.

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The King of Cheng is dead.

17
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I spent ten years fighting with Crown Prince.

18
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I finally beat him.

19
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I even had a mirror.

20
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I thought I didn't need to spend much energy

21
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
to make him fall into the East Palace.

22
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I didn't expect that my Xiao Jian Huan

23
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
would lose everything

24
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
in one night.

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It won't be him.

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now,

27
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
everything is still changing.

28
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I won't have any more tricks.

29
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I know Father too well.

30
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's too late.

31
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
From now on,

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I will be with the throne forever.

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Brother Cai,

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
this is the 60-year-old Zhuang Yuan Hong.

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I can't bear to drink it.

36
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll make you the one to drink it today.

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Here.

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Drink it.

39
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I know you're not happy.

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But what's the use of you being so used to it?

41
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Besides,

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
you should be prepared to fight this situation.

43
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Really?

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I've prepared it.

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But...

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't know what to do.

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll just wait and see.

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll wait and see.

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll wait and see.

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll wait and see.

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll wait and see.

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll wait and see.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll wait and see.

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But I still can't bear to see it.

55
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Brother Shen, you've seen it.

56
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
His Majesty has been scolding Prince Yu.

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He scolded him for making a fool of himself.

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He scolded him for being so mean.

59
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Prince Yu just said he was forced to do it.

60
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He used some of his flesh and blood.

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He showed his respect.

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He just let His Majesty say it.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
According to the private case,

64
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
they really thought it over.

65
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Prince Yu said he was forced to do it.

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He never dared to punish the throne.

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But where is the point?

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The point is not here.

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
69 lives?

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's 69 lives.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
For His Majesty,

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
it's not worth scolding.

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
For Prince Yu,

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
it's not worth scolding.

75
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No one mentioned it.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No one saw it seriously.

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
They were suspicious.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
They put it in their hearts.

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What is it?

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What is it?

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
To gather the power,

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
to kill people,

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
to make people know

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
what makes people feel bad.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
For His Majesty,

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
he doesn't care about it.

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's the bottom line

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
for the people's lives.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
If we keep it like this,

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
what will the people

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
think of it?

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What will the people think of it?

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't be angry.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What about Prince Jing?

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Since Brother Shen said it,

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I won't hide it from you.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm looking forward to Prince Jing

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
just like Brother Shen.

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Prince Yu's hand is in hatred.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If Prince Jing

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
doesn't have

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
a person

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
who can help him

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
to file a case,

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
he might not be able

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
to make it to the last step.

108
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Prince Yu and Prince Xian

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
have been fighting for years.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I have done

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
a lot of things

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
to gather the power

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and the power.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I hope Prince Jing

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
can take care of it

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
after Prince Jing's help.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's the way the court is.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's really making people

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
feel cold.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're wrong.

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The more the court is like this,

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
the more we can't

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
feel cold.

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We're all in the same boat.

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Although we can't

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
do anything

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
for some things,

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
there's a feeling

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
of sacrifice

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
for the people.

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's stronger than

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
the food and food.

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Jing is fine.

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The case has been investigated.

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He's been in a lot of trouble.

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He's been in a lot of trouble.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll make him up.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't worry.

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What's wrong?

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Jing Yuan is in a lot of trouble.

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm still in good health.

142
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
His Majesty is too kind.

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm still

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
not as good as him.

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What are you talking about?

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Jing Yuan is rewarded

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
by him.

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He earned it by himself.

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm not a liar.

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Since I'm good at it,

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll let him

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
be rewarded.

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
All right.

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I know

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
you're afraid now.

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm not a liar.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's not your fault

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
to say that.

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Jing Yuan is

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
too straightforward.

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He's handsome.

162
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He knows I don't like him.

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He's a good man

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
for the case.

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He's still a good man.

166
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
more peaceful

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
than the

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
new plans.

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Jing Yuan is

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
very kind.

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Please forgive me.

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I didn't expect

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Xuan Jing Si

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
would be so bold.

176
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So I didn't have to

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
put up with it.

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Otherwise,

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'd have

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Su Zhe

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
get involved in it.

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's not good.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I can really

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
create a

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
evidence

186
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
to make Jing Yuan

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
feel guilty.

188
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Su Zhe

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
is the one

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
who often talks

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
in the harem.

192
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
He's the one

193
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
who beat

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
the master of the north Yan

195
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
with three kids.

196
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's him.

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What?

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He's so

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
famous in the harem.

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I've never heard of him

201
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
before.

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But they're not

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
close.

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Then

205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
how can I

206
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
drag him in?

207
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You're a nine-star.

208
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Of course you don't know.

209
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Su Zhe

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
is really

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
famous.

212
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He's not a long-time loser.

213
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
There are only

214
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
talented people in the world.

215
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He's a genius.

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He's a genius.

217
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I heard that

218
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
many people

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
have been

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
in the capital.

221
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Jing Yan

222
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
can't

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
have a lot of

224
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
connections with him.

225
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Xia Jiang

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
is the kind of person

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
who has connections.

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I want to make him

229
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
his colleague.

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If Xia Jiang

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
really doesn't like Jing Yan

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
then it's good

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
to come to Jing Yan directly.

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
He's so busy.

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
He's not even a colleague.

236
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're really a woman.

237
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What's Jing Yan's identity?

238
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
She's the King of the Seven Pearls.

239
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What about Xia Jiang?

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Although she's not

241
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
the same as the King of the Seven Pearls,

242
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
she doesn't have my order.

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Can she go to

244
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Jing Yan?

245
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Can she do anything?

246
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Then...

247
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Then Mr. Su...

248
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Compared to Jing Yan,

249
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Su Zhe is different.

250
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He's a civil servant.

251
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He's weak.

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He's not strong either.

253
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
If I were to enter Xuanjing City,

254
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
wouldn't I be

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
in the middle of the river?

256
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
If that's the case,

257
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
then Mr. Su

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
wouldn't have been

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
killed by the King of the Seven Pearls?

260
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't know how he's doing.

261
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I didn't ask.

262
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I thought I wouldn't be able to go there.

263
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Su Zhe

264
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
is a guest of the court.

265
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I naturally want to serve him

266
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
so that the world can understand

267
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
that the court doesn't have a heart to take care of the wealth.

268
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Even His Majesty said that

269
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
he's not a mortal.

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Mr. Su,

271
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
he's a man of the sword.

272
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Jing Yan

273
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
is too stubborn.

274
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Tell Jing Yan

275
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
to let him go and ask for help.

276
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I heard

277
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
that the one who always

278
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
ran to the Imperial Court

279
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
was Qin.

280
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Your Majesty,

281
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
as long as Jing Yan

282
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
is loyal to the court,

283
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
although he should be in the capital,

284
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
he doesn't have to be so reckless.

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Jing Yan

286
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
is he just a prince

287
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
who wants to be the King of the world?

288
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Go.

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You may leave.

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Someone asked me to visit you.

291
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Are you okay?

292
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,200
Greetings, Big He!

293
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Xia Jiang is your beloved disciple.

294
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But you're like a chess,

295
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
and the grudges among these

296
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
really are commerical.

297
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm a martial arts person

298
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and I know why

299
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I have insists on comforting you.

300
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Just I hope

301
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
that you can come up to my place as soon as possible.

302
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I believe that General Nie is in heaven.

303
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't want to see you continue to be so suspicious.

304
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
How is my brother and brother?

305
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The fire was not on that day.

306
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We can't say that he is Xia Jiang's accomplice.

307
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Xia Chun's crime will be more serious.

308
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And some other crimes.

309
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But it's not too serious.

310
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Then...

311
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What about him?

312
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He is the criminal.

313
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He has committed a crime

314
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
that is not serious.

315
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
He is the most worthy one.

316
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Don't think about it.

317
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I will not blame you.

318
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I have no heart.

319
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Where else can I blame?

320
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You don't need to worry.

321
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
There is no other meaning to this.

322
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's not that I doubt that Jingyan is ambitious.

323
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's good that you understand.

324
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I will not be so suspicious.

325
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I will not be so suspicious.

326
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I will not be so suspicious.

327
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I know.

328
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You have been in a bad mood these years.

329
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
There was a crown prince before.

330
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Now there is a prince.

331
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So you have never thought about it.

332
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But now

333
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
you should think about it.

334
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Jingyan.

335
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I am not in the court to be a party.

336
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I am just a public official.

337
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I like him.

338
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Is he in his own house?

339
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Or does he want to have someone?

340
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
This time he is in the trap of the trap of the trap of the trap.

341
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Isn't it because

342
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
he needs someone to do something for him?

343
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Your Majesty loves our mother and son.

344
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I understand.

345
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I will tell Jingyan about it.

346
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But this child is the one

347
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
he doesn't like the most.

348
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I think you know it.

349
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
If he can't listen to me

350
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I will punish him.

351
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
This child.

352
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Enough.

353
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's not a big deal.

354
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I will tell Jingyan about it.

355
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I will tell Jingyan about it.

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I will take care of him.

357
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
By the way, you are all well-behaved.

358
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You haven't seen each other for a few days.

359
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I will let him come here in the next few days.

360
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You can help me to comfort him.

361
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What do you mean?

362
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I am a child of a little tiger.

363
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I have to hold him for a few more days.

364
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Besides,

365
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
His Majesty is a father.

366
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
He is a prince.

367
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Besides,

368
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
he is a good man.

369
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
He is also a good man.

370
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
If he really wants to complain

371
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I will be the one to blame.

372
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Jingyan's brother is with you.

373
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
He makes me really like him.

374
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I just thought about it.

375
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Didn't you say that you are not good at

376
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
building a palace?

377
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Let's let Jingyan bring him to the factory in the spring.

378
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There are not many officials

379
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
who are outside the palace.

380
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And my Yunzhun.

381
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You can find a time to bring him here.

382
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You can find him here.

383
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
In the spring of March,

384
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
His Majesty wants to take me with him.

385
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Who else can I take you with?

386
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes, I will.

387
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
General Ye is so blind.

388
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Before the truth is revealed

389
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
you have to take care of it.

390
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
There are still people outside.

391
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I need to take care of them.

392
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Please tell Mr. Su and Prince Jin

393
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
that they will return the justice.

394
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Before that,

395
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
they are at the place of the imperial edict.

396
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I can still support them.

397
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Please tell them

398
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
that I will come here

399
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
and help them

400
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
soon.

401
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I can still support them.

402
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Please don't worry about me.

403
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't worry, Madam.

404
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I will bring this case.

405
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The Prince of Jing has decided to investigate the case.

406
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He will not let it be.

407
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Although General Nie is not in a good mood,

408
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
he is the cause of this case.

409
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
If we can't reveal the truth,

410
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I believe General Nie's order will not be revealed.

411
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I will take it.

412
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Commander Meng,

413
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
did you solve the poison you put into the poison?

414
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What poison?

415
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't believe it.

416
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't believe it.

417
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I have to worry about you these days.

418
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Don't mention it when things are over.

419
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Get up.

420
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yes, Your Highness.

421
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Jingyin,

422
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
sit down.

423
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Mother is so mysterious.

424
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Did something happen?

425
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Sit down first.

426
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I have been in the palace for a few days.

427
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I have been very alert and alert.

428
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I have a lot to tell you.

429
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I also want to hear you tell me

430
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
about what happened outside.

431
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But before that,

432
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I have something to tell you.

433
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I have to tell you.

434
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I have something to tell you.

435
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What is it?

436
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I have a confession.

437
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I think it will be better for you to hear it.

438
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

439
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

440
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Be careful.

441
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If you take my words,

442
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
please tell me again.

443
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yes.

444
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Here, drink the medicine.

445
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Wasn't it better yesterday?

446
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Why is it like this again?

447
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What do you mean?

448
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's better.

449
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I have never seen him before.

450
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Let me see.

451
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I will come again in half an hour.

452
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You don't have to cry in advance.

453
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I am here.

454
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I can't take your photos.

455
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Doctor Yan,

456
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
can you close the door again?

457
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You can't see anyone else.

458
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I can't see anyone.

459
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
He can wake up in a few days.

460
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You just let 100 people in.

461
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You can't say a word to him.

462
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It doesn't matter if you close the door or not.

463
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What are you talking about?

464
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You are from Xiajiang.

465
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It's okay.

466
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I obey the order of Princess Xuan Ji.

467
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I obey the order of Xia Shouzun.

468
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So you mean

469
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
the people who are sent by Mr. Su

470
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
and the people who are crying

471
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
to Prince Jing

472
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
are all from Xiajiang?

473
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Take him down.

474
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yes.

475
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
This situation

476
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
is not difficult to break.

477
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
It's just that the concern is in the wrong.

478
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Xiajiang is not in your shoes.

479
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's not just my shoes.

480
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
There is a limit to your heart.

481
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
For Mr. Su,

482
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I don't want to be in your shoes.

483
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I don't want to be in your shoes.

484
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I don't want to be in your shoes.

485
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I don't want to be in your shoes.

486
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I don't want to be in your shoes.

487
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
For Mr. Su,

488
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I am very fond of

489
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
his talent

490
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
and his talent.

491
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I still think he is a model.

492
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I can't trust him completely.

493
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
There is a limit to your heart.

494
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Of course, there is a limit.

495
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Xiajiang can enter the house with a lot of effort.

496
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's not enough to be a monster.

497
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I am not as good as mother

498
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
as the people in the world.

499
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I didn't know the truth at that time.

500
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But it's much more calm than me.

501
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I am more confident

502
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
than Mr. Su.

503
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Of course, I know.

504
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
He will not

505
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
do such a thing.

506
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I will not do it.

507
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
What did mother say?

508
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I mean

509
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
since you have already misunderstood

510
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
what are you going to do?

511
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Of course, I will go to Mr. Su's place.

512
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Open the door.

513
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Open the door.

514
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Open the door.

515
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Your Highness.

516
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I didn't know this.

517
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You are also a man of courage.

518
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You have no talent and conscience.

519
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
When Xiao Qin Yan got involved,

520
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
he didn't need to be a master.

521
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
He was a master.

522
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
He was a master.

523
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
He was a master.

524
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
He was a master.

525
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
He was a master.

526
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
He was a master.

527
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
He was a master.

528
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
He was a master.

529
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
He was a master.

530
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
He was a master.

531
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
What?

532
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
What?

533
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I am going to Mr. Su's place.

534
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Your Highness.

535
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
It's a big snow.

536
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
He came from Mr. Su's place

537
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
to persuade me.

538
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It's a big snow.

539
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It's a big snow.

540
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Let's move.

541
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Let's go.

542
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Let's go.

543
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Let's go.

544
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Let's go.

545
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Let's go.

546
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Let's go.

547
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Let's go.

548
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Let's go.

549
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Please forgive me.

550
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I can't see the guest.

551
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Tell me what do you want.

552
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Mr. Su, please forgive me.

553
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,200
What's wrong?

554
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Is Xuanjing Temple in any condition?

555
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,200
Maybe.

556
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
But after entering the East,

557
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,200
the master's health has been not very good.

558
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,600
Moreover, last time,

559
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
he was in the Prince of Jing's Mansion and had a cold.

560
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,800
Although he was under pressure,

561
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,800
he still needs to be able to get out of the house.

562
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,600
Since His Highness is here,

563
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
he is only here to visit you.

564
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,800
It's not a big deal.

565
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,200
Since you are sick,

566
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,600
you should go and ask the Empress.

567
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,600
Open the door!

568
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,600
Master Yin!

569
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Your Highness,

570
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
how is he now?

571
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,600
Why is Commander Wang so anxious?

572
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
He was in Xuanjing Temple.

573
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,400
He was placed in a huge,

574
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,280
poisonous,

575
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
you don't know?

576
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
You mean, Mr. Su?

577
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,400
Of course, I'm talking about him.

578
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,800
After the poison was cured,

579
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,080
he will definitely be

580
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,000
in a coma within seven days.

581
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,600
I've already checked the spring,

582
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,200
and I've also searched the whole Xuanjing Temple.

583
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,800
I still haven't found the antidote.

584
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Let's ask Dr. Yin.

585
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
What else can we do?

586
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:20,720
bos

587
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Your Highness

588
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,200
I can only ask Xia Jiang for the antidote.

589
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,200
But Xia Jiang will not...

590
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,200
I want to go with you.

591
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Go together.

592
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,200
What should we do now?

593
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Prince Yu is still outside.

594
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,200
I haven't defeated the enemy.

595
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Prince Yu locked himself in the mansion and closed the door.

596
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
He is also unprotected.

597
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,200
I'm afraid he can't bear it.

598
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,200
The Bai Clan only wants to die.

599
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,200
He wants to turn around.

600
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,200
But there is still a chance to let him save me.

601
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
What chance?

602
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Three months.

603
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Three months.

604
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
Three months.

605
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,200
You are so smart. You can understand it in detail.

606
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,200
In the past few months, Prince Yu must be punished.

607
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,200
He will be punished in front of His Majesty.

608
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,200
He can't be in a fight with Prince Jing.

609
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Please come in.

610
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,200
Prince Jing is here.

611
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Greetings, Prince Jing.

612
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Prince Yu is here.

613
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Send the food.

614
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Go.

615
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Prince Jing.

616
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Prince Jing.

617
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Why did Prince Jing offend Prince Jing?

618
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
He didn't even give him food?

619
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,200
It seems that there is nothing else.

620
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,200
It's for the sake of the money.

621
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,200
This Mr. Su's food is really bad.

622
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,200
How can you two personally come to the dungeon to see me?

623
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Doctor Yan.

624
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
You don't need to pay for that Wu Jin Wan.

625
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
I don't care.

626
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
He has the fire poison.

627
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
It's the best poison.

628
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
After Wu Jin Wan enters the body,

629
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,200
she will be punished by the lord.

630
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,200
She won't be punished.

631
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
Really?

632
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Of course.

633
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
You will be fine.

634
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
Tell me.

635
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Where is the antidote?

636
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
I won't tell you.

637
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,200
You killed me in the prison.

638
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Why didn't you?

639
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
A red-handed king.

640
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
A military commander.

641
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,200
You didn't even open the body and killed people in the prison.

642
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
You don't even think about it.

643
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,200
What will happen to the emperor who is a doctor?

644
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
I'm a slave.

645
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,200
I can't think of much.

646
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
There are three days left until Wu Jin Wan's poison.

647
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,200
I can't enter the palace.

648
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
I can't go to the court.

649
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
I'll ask you until the last moment.

650
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,200
If Mr. Su has any fault,

651
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,200
I'll kill you right away.

652
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Even your corpse is not trained for you.

653
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Okay.

654
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
For a moment,

655
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,200
you have no idea.

656
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Xiao Jing Yan.

657
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
I didn't do anything wrong.

658
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,200
We can't live without you.

659
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Where is the antidote?

660
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Prince Jin.

661
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
I'll kill you.

662
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
Last time,

663
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,200
you hurriedly went out to apologize to Mr. Su.

664
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
I forgot.

665
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,200
I asked you to bring him a new heart.

666
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Is he okay?

667
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,200
He was poisoned by Wu Jin Wan in Xuanjing Temple.

668
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
Wu Jin Wan?

669
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,200
Don't worry.

670
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
I've found the antidote.

671
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Although he is a toxic doctor,

672
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,200
he will surely have some kind of damage.

673
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,200
You should go and check it out.

674
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
This time,

675
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,200
if we can live peacefully,

676
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
we will have Mr. Su.

677
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,200
Although he didn't agree to save Wei Zheng,

678
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,200
I was angry with him for breaking the past.

679
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,200
But later,

680
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
he still refused to come to the world

681
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
and tried to get close to me.

682
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Even himself,

683
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
was in Xuanjing Temple in pain.

684
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,200
Mr. Su didn't agree to save Wei Zheng.

685
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,200
He was right to save Qin Shi.

686
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
But in the end,

687
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,200
you two still crossed this line of agreement.

688
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,200
With such a person supporting you,

689
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,200
I'm really relieved.

690
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
After Wei Zheng was saved,

691
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
Mr. Su was the one who was in charge.

692
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,200
He didn't tell me where he was in charge.

693
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
He said he still didn't know.

694
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,200
Actually, I really wanted to see Wei Zheng earlier.

695
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,200
I wanted to hear his story.

696
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Since he has already been saved,

697
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,200
you don't have to worry about this.

698
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
These years,

699
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,200
I've always been in a daze.

700
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
How did Mr. Shi die?

701
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
How did Uncle die?

702
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Did he say anything when he died?

703
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Did he have any wishes?

704
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Sometimes,

705
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,200
I can't believe that Uncle died like this.

706
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,200
When I went to the East Sea,

707
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,200
he even made a scene with me.

708
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,200
You went to the East Sea this time.

709
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,200
Please come back in half a year.

710
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
I heard that there are many pearls in the East Sea.

711
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,200
You brought some back.

712
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,200
You should at least take a big egg.

713
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
A big egg?

714
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
Don't make a scene.

715
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
I'm kidding.

716
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
I'll take a big pigeon egg.

717
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
I'll try it.

718
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
I brought back the pearl.

719
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
But it...

720
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,200
didn't even have a piece of bone.

721
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Even Ling Fu...

722
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
when we were little,

723
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
we played together.

724
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
We became close friends

725
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,200
overnight.

726
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,200
We became the same.

727
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Jing Nian, good boy.

728
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,200
As long as you don't forget Uncle,

729
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,200
he'll still be alive.

730
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,200
He'll be alive in your heart.

731
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,200
I'll be alive in your heart.

732
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,200
I'll be alive in this world.

733
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:36,200
You can't force me to lose him.

734
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,200
I'll be alive in your heart.

735
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,200
I'll be alive in your heart.

736
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,200
I'll be alive in your heart.

737
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,200
Brother Qi,

738
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,200
Ling Shuai.

739
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Uncle Xia.

740
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
I know...

741
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,200
you're watching me somewhere.

742
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
Mother,

743
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
there's nothing I can do to make me go back.

744
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,200
I can give up.

745
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,200
I'll be alive in your heart.

746
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,200
I'll be alive in your heart.

747
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,200
I'll be alive in your heart.

748
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,200
I'll be alive in your heart.

749
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,200
I'll be alive in your heart.
