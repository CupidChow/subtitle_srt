We will pass it on over to everyone.

17
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,220
Your Highness,

00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,900

to there ancient houses.

22
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,100
That is when the soldiers will join the family.

23
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,620
That family will have a victory in specific.

24
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,280
PÇ

25
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,400
Your Highness,

26
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,500
Its first enemies are Xiajiang,ried crabcles and weak people,

27
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,020
Its cause is the crimeillance of定yit

28
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,420
Its Anton rules should be Yuri's

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,820
Just Thanks This old is not the order

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:41,420

00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,200
I will do my best

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,780
Who shares roles with them

35
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,620
I will prepare to镜探 in court

36
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,500
And call everyone here

37
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,160
Some people knew

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,480
I just came back from the palace.

39
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,120
His Majesty agreed.

40
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,120
I just came back from the palace.

41
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,720
His Majesty agreed.

42
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,120
Get ready.

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,320
Yes.

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,480
I think you've made a plan.

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,320
That's right.

46
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,280
I've made a plan.

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,720
Let's go to Huozhou Prefecture to make fresh tea.

48
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,600
We'll stay at Master Qin's place for two days

49
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,880
and eat vegetarian food.

50
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,720
We'll rest for half a month.

51
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,840
We'll go to the river Tuo.

52
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,200
There's a small spiritual cliff.

53
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,680
There's a Buddha's light on the mountain.

54
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,080
We'll stay there for ten days.

55
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,480
We'll be able to see it.

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,920
Then we'll go to Fengqi Palace

57
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,600
and take the flying dragon to see the monkey.

58
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,960
That's great.

59
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,160
We haven't seen each other for a long time

60
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,600
for the name of Zhu Sha and Qing Lin.

61
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,280
We'll go there to visit them.

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,480
Don't you like eating the spicy peanuts of Aunt Lingzhen?

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,680
Before we went back to Langya Mountain,

64
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,000
we'll go get some man first.

65
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,080
Then?

66
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,920
All right.

67
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,560
According to your method,

68
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,680
it's been more than half a year since we went back to Langya Mountain.

69
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,200
What's the matter with that?

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,480
You've been so clear about it for ten days.

71
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,520
What's the point?

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,680
Trust me.

73
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,800
We'll leave like this.

74
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,400
Can we finally go back to Langya Mountain?

75
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,800
That's not the problem you need to think about.

76
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,440
Am I right?

77
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,520
All right.

78
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,760
I'll entrust myself to you.

79
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,520
After the ceremony,

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,600
we'll go out.

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,000
Then we can make a deal.

82
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,680
Since we're leaving in a few days,

83
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,640
I'll go get ready.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,840
What?

85
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,840
It's me who's going, not you.

86
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
Even if you have no relatives or relatives,

87
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,200
you don't want to take the court's order.

88
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,400
You don't have to follow me.

89
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,480
There's still a bunch of things to do.

90
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
You don't care.

91
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,480
I'll take care of it.

92
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,760
I'll take Fei Liu there.

93
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,320
You all go back to Langzhou.

94
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,040
Princess,

95
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,320
Fei Liu is still a child.

96
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,560
He won't take care of anyone.

97
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,480
Don't you have a new god?

98
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,200
The new god is not that kind of thing.

99
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,360
You don't care about him.

100
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,640
He's here.

101
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,920
The first Peking Entertainment City 949446.

102
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,080
The most exciting game on the line.

103
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
The horse is running.

104
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,040
The horse is running.

105
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,560
The reward queen.

106
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,280
The treasure of Huangjing City.

107
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,320
The rich cat.

108
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,760
The reward captain.

109
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,200
The super high salary.

110
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,200
The reward is more and more.

111
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,080
The reward chance is more and more.

112
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,400
Join us now.

113
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,640
The first Peking Entertainment City 949446.

114
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,240
Come.

115
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,920
Who are you standing here for?

116
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,440
Princess, Li Gang and I, you have to take one.

117
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,920
We're only taking one child.

118
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
And one who's not serious.

119
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,560
We don't want to die.

120
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,920
What are you thinking?

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,200
He's your master.

122
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,800
You're going to Jiang Zomeng and you're going back.

123
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,800
You dare to fight back.

124
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,240
You want to go out with us?

125
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
You're dead.

126
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,200
Not only the door,

127
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,360
but also the window.

128
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,400
Old man, go back to your wolf-dolls.

129
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
Go to work in the dream.

130
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,040
If someone follows you like this,

131
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,800
it must be a palace maid.

132
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,520
She should go there.

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

134
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,320
They're both beautiful.

135
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,480
They think I'm not serious.

136
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,080
No one follows her.

137
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,200
They don't want to die.

138
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,240
You have so many things in your dream.

139
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,960
They can't leave.

140
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,720
So,

141
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,720
you're the one who follows her.

142
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,960
Don't be ridiculous.

143
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,800
You really want to take one with you.

144
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,520
It's not convenient for you to take one with you.

145
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,360
Is it a girl's heart?

146
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,560
Fine.

147
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,080
You're taking her as a maid.

148
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,560
Don't tell me you don't like a maid

149
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,600
who's born with a young master like you.

150
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,920
Don't listen to her.

151
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,360
Don't talk to me like that.

152
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,480
It's really not a good thing.

153
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
Fei Liao.

154
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,160
I'm going to go out with your brother Su.

155
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,360
Are you happy?

156
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,560
And your brother Licheng.

157
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,560
You're so ungrateful.

158
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
Watch the fire.

159
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,760
The people's spirits are burning.

160
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,080
ож tighten fire.

161
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,560
Do not ruin these people.

162
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,840
The military situation is urgent.

163
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,000
The military capacity of the court is 17,000.

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,480
How is the equipment?

165
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,080
Your Highness,

166
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,360
the military of the Qing Dynasty

167
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,000
has about 20,000 troops.

168
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,280
The military department has prepared it.

169
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,480
It will be ready soon.

170
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,800
What about the front?

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,680
From the first report of the military,

172
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,560
I began to make mistakes in the military.

173
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,040
I have already thought of a few ways.

174
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,280
As long as Your Highness agrees,

175
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,600
I will start to implement it.

176
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,560
Don't talk nonsense.

177
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,600
Zhao Jun,

178
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,800
you should do it more closely.

179
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,560
Yes.

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,320
You should do it more closely.

181
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,160
Yes.

182
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,880
What do you think,

183
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,000
Your Highness?

184
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,120
This...

185
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,000
This...

186
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
This...

187
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Your Highness,

188
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,320
the wind and smoke are blowing.

189
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,760
It's hard to deal with them all at once.

190
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,760
I am still the main river.

191
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,000
I should send the people to discuss it first.

192
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
The main river?

193
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,280
Only the Wen Chen and the general are here.

194
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,800
The five generals are here.

195
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,480
Why did the two of us come back?

196
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,920
The war has just started.

197
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
The army of the general is the main river.

198
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
Your Highness,

199
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,280
this is not an old war.

200
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,360
But this...

201
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,960
This is only about 17,000 troops.

202
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,680
We have to face the sea, the sea,

203
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,440
the night and the night.

204
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,480
The army is really insufficient.

205
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,560
There is no insufficient army.

206
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,280
The real insufficient army is the commander.

207
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,200
As long as there is a commander of the general,

208
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,640
the army of the general can be used to make long-range battles.

209
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,360
Your Highness,

210
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,160
it is time for you to share the power of the Wei State

211
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,880
and establish the military.

212
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,560
I wonder which one of you

213
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,240
has a good reputation?

214
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,880
스� Piece is good.

215
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,400
ук보 ا ع호의 اعقولないما ож رو 시ك واتن increases the power.

216
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,680
This is when I changed my army system.

217
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,400
You know me well!

218
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,840
What is all this?

219
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,560
Han,

220
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,080
what do you think?

221
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,760
Your Highness, I have sold my old horse.

222
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,840
It's hard to take it seriously.

223
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,560
Please...

224
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,400
What about you, Lord Huai?

225
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,920
I'm also old.

226
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,040
As long as I can do something,

227
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,480
I'll do it.

228
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,560
But this is a battle for the enemy.

229
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,720
I really have a lot of strength.

230
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,120
Lord Huai, I have something to ask you.

231
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,840
Don't you have more than 700 horses in your Yulong horse market?

232
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,520
I heard that they are still based on the standard of the horse.

233
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
You said last spring,

234
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,520
you also said that you want the palace to be kneeled and the family to be buried in your horse market.

235
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,640
Lord Shen, I forgot what you said.

236
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,040
This morning, I told the管 that

237
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,960
I would let him clear all the two horses in the factory.

238
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,240
The court will surely use them.

239
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,000
Although the horse market in Weicheng is not very popular,

240
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,080
it can also be very hard to take it seriously.

241
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,680
All right.

242
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,640
What are the things that the court uses in the Lord's Manor?

243
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,160
Come down and tell Shen Zui directly.

244
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,360
The first Lord of Shangyang, the first to lead the army in Beijing,

245
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,960
is the new general of the capital, Prince of Zhenwang.

246
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,280
The court needs a quick and stable government.

247
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,880
So I...

248
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,520
Your Highness, please think twice.

249
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,920
The state affairs are not well-off.

250
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
Your Majesty, you...

251
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Your Majesty, you are in a bad state.

252
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,080
It is time for you to take the throne.

253
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,560
You must not leave.

254
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,560
Yes, Your Highness.

255
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
Your Highness, please think twice.

256
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
Your Highness, please think twice.

257
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,560
Your Highness, please think twice.

258
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
Your Highness, please think twice.

259
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,200
Your Excellency, you are right.

260
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,800
The capital of the country is the capital of the country.

261
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,600
You must not leave.

262
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Yes, Your Highness.

263
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
I understand what you mean.

264
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,800
But the land is not preserved.

265
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,240
The river is flooded.

266
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,760
The life and death of the country

267
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,760
is more important than my personal safety.

268
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,000
Your Majesty.

269
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,740
上组搞一个女友

270
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,400
空间西

271
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,320
What about you?

272
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,560
Wang Pass and she.....

273
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,940
Take care of this!

274
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,720
Jinrui!

275
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,060
Yu Jin! Why are you in so anxious?

276
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,220
I think you've heard those public news!

277
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,060
So you're going to the ice palace?

278
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,060
Exactly!

279
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,220
It seems I can't throw you away.

280
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,220
Let's go.

281
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,220
Let's go.

282
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,220
You can go and settle down here.

283
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,740
You can't go.

284
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,740
I'm not not convinced by this emperor.

285
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,260
He can't believe it at all.

286
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,260
Let me be at ease.

287
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,580
Once you leave the city,

288
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,860
the capital will be in chaos.

289
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,260
Don't you understand?

290
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,860
I don't understand this.

291
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,260
But...

292
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,260
Jian Yan.

293
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,060
Let me finish.

294
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,060
Okay, you go ahead.

295
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,660
I've arranged it.

296
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,460
Wei Zheng sent a small water station

297
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,660
to send him to Donghai as a suitable person.

298
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,060
The night is just a trap.

299
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,460
The local army is enough.

300
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,460
As for the confrontation between the south and the capital,

301
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,460
you have to go back in person

302
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,060
to face the situation.

303
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,860
To avoid the south's movements

304
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,460
and not let the imperial court

305
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,460
be under attack.

306
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,860
You understand.

307
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,060
I was originally going to do this.

308
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,460
Actually, the most difficult thing now

309
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,060
is the north.

310
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,460
This time, Tuoba Hao

311
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,460
has been on the line for 50,000 years.

312
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
The north and the north will be in trouble.

313
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,460
Their goal is to

314
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,460
make the victory

315
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,460
and negotiate with us.

316
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,460
They want to make the money

317
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,460
or to take it back

318
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,460
40 years ago

319
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,460
and give it to us.

320
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,460
The main purpose of Tuoba Hao's battle

321
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,460
is to make the prince of Qi

322
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,460
win the throne.

323
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,460
We didn't plan to fight for a long time.

324
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,460
As long as we fight together

325
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,460
and make the right move,

326
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,460
we can definitely push him back.

327
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,460
If we want to fight together,

328
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,460
the people of Nie Feng and the General

329
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,460
will be in trouble.

330
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,460
Actually, I don't understand

331
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,460
what you said.

332
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,460
But Dong Jie has already heard

333
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,460
very well.

334
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,460
If they let the two of them

335
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,460
be together

336
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,460
and then make a few good

337
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,460
and effective generals,

338
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,460
Tuoba Hao

339
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,460
will definitely not be able to escape.

340
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,460
Now the problem with the north and the south

341
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
has been solved.

342
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,460
What about the big fish?

343
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,460
Since you can't go,

344
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,460
I think...

345
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,460
No.

346
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,460
I haven't finished my words yet.

347
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,460
No matter what you say,

348
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,460
I will not let you

349
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,460
take the troops to the war.

350
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,460
What you are worried about now

351
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,460
is not just my health.

352
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,460
Didn't Consort Jing tell you

353
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,460
that I have a good doctor with me?

354
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,460
He has helped me

355
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,460
to deal with it for a while.

356
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,460
Moreover,

357
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,460
how can I

358
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,460
bear to take the risk of being forced

359
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,460
to believe me?

360
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,460
Brother.

361
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,460
Fine.

362
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,460
If it's really so,

363
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,460
you can call that doctor over.

364
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,460
If he tells me

365
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,460
that you can go,

366
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,460
I will agree.

367
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,460
I will go.

368
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,460
Now the country is in trouble.

369
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,460
The commander has always been

370
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,460
only able to win.

371
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
I have to go.

372
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,460
I will immediately enter the Eastern Realm.

373
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,460
The battlefield is in the north.

374
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,460
You have to go there

375
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,460
in case you can make it in a few days.

376
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,460
Three months.

377
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,460
I know

378
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,460
the ice and snow grass

379
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,460
can't be used for long.

380
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,460
You have cured it

381
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,460
with the ice and snow?

382
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,460
How can I cure it?

383
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,460
Who said I would use it for you?

384
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,460
I know

385
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,460
that I don't need

386
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,460
the ice and snow

387
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,460
with your medical skills.

388
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,460
If there is no such risk,

389
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,460
maybe I can be stable

390
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,460
and survive

391
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
for more than half a year.

392
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
Maybe not.

393
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,460
I can.

394
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,460
I know I can.

395
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,460
I have to go.

396
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,460
Changsu.

397
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,460
The case is over.

398
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,460
You should thank your parents

399
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,460
for considering

400
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,460
that you are not too much.

401
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,460
There are many things

402
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,460
in this world

403
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,460
that you can do

404
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,460
in order to make it.

405
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,460
Why?

406
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,460
Why are you always

407
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,460
giving up

408
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,460
when you shouldn't give up?

409
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,460
It's my choice.

410
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,460
I have been

411
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,460
a doctor for 13 years.

412
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,460
If I can

413
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,460
return to

414
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,460
Lin Shu's place

415
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,460
and go back to Beijing

416
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,460
and the battlefield,

417
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,460
that would be a lucky thing for me.

418
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,460
I don't know Lin Shu.

419
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
I have been living

420
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,460
for the rest of my life.

421
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,460
I am not Lin Shu.

422
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,460
You said it yourself.

423
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,460
Lin Shu died long ago

424
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,460
to make a dead person

425
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,460
live for three months.

426
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,460
Do you have the final solution

427
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,460
to Mei Changsu?

428
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,460
Mei Changsu's mission

429
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,460
has been completed.

430
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,460
But Lin Shu

431
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,460
has his duty.

432
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,460
Now Beijing is in a state of

433
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,460
madness.

434
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,460
There is no end to it.

435
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,460
As a descendant of Lin clan,

436
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,460
how can I not do anything?

437
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,460
Since you have worked hard

438
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,460
to find the ice blood grass,

439
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,460
you can make me three months.

440
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,460
What about three months?

441
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,460
Within three months,

442
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,460
I will definitely

443
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,460
return to the border

444
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,460
and return to Beijing.

445
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,460
After the war,

446
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,460
Jingyan can

447
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,460
re-enact the whole Beijing army.

448
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,460
The army of Liang

449
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,460
will definitely be back

450
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,460
in the time of the top.

451
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,460
I am talking about you.

452
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,460
You are the one who will be the next.

453
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,460
Once the ice blood is cured,

454
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,460
it can be used

455
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,460
to stimulate the body.

456
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,460
But at the same time,

457
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,460
it is also a poison

458
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,460
that will not be cured.

459
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,460
Once the three months have passed,

460
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,460
even the Great Luo God

461
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,460
can keep you for a day.

462
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
What should we do?

463
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,460
After all, I am Lin Shu.

464
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,460
Although it has been 13 years,

465
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,460
I am still

466
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,460
the young master of the Chi Yan Army.

467
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,460
Lin Shu!

468
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,460
I want to go back.

469
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,460
Go back to the battlefield

470
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,460
of Chi Yan Army.

471
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,460
I want to go back.

472
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,460
That is my place.

473
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,460
Okay.

474
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,460
You can choose.

475
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,460
You can give up.

476
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,460
This is all your decision.

477
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,460
You can go back.

478
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,460
Where are you going?

479
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,460
The Imperial Army

480
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,460
should not be closed yet, right?

481
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,460
I am going to the Imperial Army.

482
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,460
Chang Su.

483
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,460
I promised you

484
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,460
that I would accompany you

485
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,460
to the last day.

486
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,460
Although you are a true man,

487
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,460
I cannot be a true man.

488
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,460
When you have the military duty,

489
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,460
General Mei,

490
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,460
please take me as your real soldier.

491
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,460
I will go back.

492
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,460
I will go back.

493
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,460
I will go back.

494
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,460
You always say that

495
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,460
you do not know Lin Shu.

496
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,460
I believe that after you know him,

497
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,460
you will not be disappointed.

498
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,460
I will go back.

499
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,460
I will go back.

500
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,460
I will go back.

501
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,460
I did not lie to you.

502
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,460
I told you that

503
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,460
I am not in good health.

504
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,460
Do not hesitate.

505
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,460
I understand what you mean.

506
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,460
You are the commander of the Alliance.

507
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,460
You are the one who led the whole army.

508
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,460
It is indeed the arrangement of the Shang family.

509
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,460
But...

510
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,460
I am just following the commander.

511
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,460
I will not kill myself.

512
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,460
You do not have to worry about anything.

513
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,460
I am not worried about anything.

514
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,460
I believe that you cannot handle the battle.

515
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,460
But you know that

516
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,460
fighting and fighting are necessary.

517
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,460
If it is not for your own health,

518
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,460
and you have the strength to fight,

519
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,460
how can I be your life?

520
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,460
If I fall down at the critical moment of the war,

521
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,460
how can I treat Meng Dake?

522
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,460
How can I treat the soldiers and the people of Liang?

523
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,460
I understand everything.

524
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,460
But in the past,

525
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,460
we were all fighting together.

526
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,460
I never...

527
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,460
I only stayed here

528
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,460
to watch you leave the city.

529
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,460
Last time I saw him

530
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,460
being so beautiful.

531
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,460
I saved you so much.

532
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,460
At that time, I thought my brother Ling Shu

533
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,460
was a young general who never came.

534
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,460
He will come back soon.

535
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,460
He will be by my side.

536
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,460
When I grow up,

537
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,460
he will marry me.

538
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,460
I did not expect that this gift

539
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,460
would last for 13 years.

540
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,460
Beijing is my most familiar battlefield.

541
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,460
Da Yu is my most familiar enemy.

542
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,460
For these 13 years,

543
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,460
I have been following their movements.

544
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,460
No one will be more confident

545
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,460
than me.

546
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,460
As a soldier,

547
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,460
you must be kind to the people.

548
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,460
The one who is not in the right path

549
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,460
is Ling Shu.

550
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,460
But 13 years...

551
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,460
13 years of separation

552
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,460
is a year for you.

553
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,460
It is too difficult

554
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,460
to lie to everyone.

555
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,460
But this time,

556
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,460
I do not know when I will see you again.

557
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,460
In fact, in many people's eyes,

558
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,460
he has returned to the capital

559
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,460
and has completely become another person.

560
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,460
But in my heart,

561
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,460
he is always the most famous

562
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,460
young man.

563
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,460
He has the heart of a man who will never die.

564
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,460
I am willing to support him,

565
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,460
listen to him,

566
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,460
and let him do what he wants to do.

567

I understand.

570
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,460
What do you understand?

571
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,460

574
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,460
I will.

575
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,460
Brother Huang,

576
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,460
I have always been willing to

577
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,460
support the people

578
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,460
and the people.

579
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,460
You believe that I can do what I want

580
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,460
and be a good emperor

581
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,460
who is a great leader.

582
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,460
Please do not

583
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,460
return without a trace.

584
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,460
I will not let the throne

585
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,460
shake my spirit,

586
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,460
but I still hope

587
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,460
you can always be by my side

588
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,460
and look at me

589
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,460
and open a different

590
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,460
world to the world.

591
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,460
Okay?

592
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,460
Of course.

593
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,460
I will.

594
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,460
Don't forget me, brother.

595
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,460
You promised me

596
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,460
that you would take me

597
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,460
to the world

598
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,460
in the middle of the world

599
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,460
with your love.

600
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
You must come first.

601
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
I know

602
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,460
you are a good man.

603
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,460
I know you are a good man.

604
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,460
As long as there is

605
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,460
a fair and fair world,

606
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,460
I cannot

607
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,460
be like the ordinary man.

608
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,460
It is said that

609
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,460
the snow is falling.

610
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,460
I hope

611
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,460
we can all be like the ordinary man

612
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,460
and be safe and sound.

613
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
Brother,

614
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,460

615
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,460

618
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,460

619
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,460

How much wish will you give me?

639
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,460
Please give me back my hope.

640
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:25,460
No matter how far we go,

641
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,460
Without you, I will be a fool.

642
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,460
The wind and the sky are all over the world.

643
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,460
We will be together forever.
