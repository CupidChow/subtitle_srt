1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,820
BLOODie

2
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,160
Than

3
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,380
Don't limit my flashlight

4
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,800
OK

5
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,300
OK

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Master, why are you standing under the wolf?

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's so cold. Go in.

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Great, Ji Shen.

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Doctor Yan.

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Doctor Yan, you're so beautiful.

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You're so famous.

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Master, you're much more relaxed.

13
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Have a seat.

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Thank you, Master.

15
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
A few days ago,

16
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I was trapped between the Crown Prince and Prince Yu.

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I couldn't even breathe.

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm afraid I'm still in the case

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
after a few days.

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's the case.

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm here to see you, Master.

22
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What's wrong?

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What's wrong with me this year?

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why are you so unlucky?

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't worry, Master.

26
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I've asked you.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I just happened to be a monster on the mountain.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I was in a hurry.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I was in a bad mood.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I couldn't help myself.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I just had to go to the Imperial Court.

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm so worried.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't worry about that.

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You can go and handle it.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
As long as there's no more

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
big cases of the court's officials,

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'll be in trouble.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Master,

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
it's not good to talk nonsense.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's hard to protect yourself.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No, no, no.

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Greetings, Prince Yu.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Please have a seat.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Have a look.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
How is it?

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Jing Zhaoying is a smart man.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He's a smart man.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's been

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
trying to hide the case from me

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
for a whole day.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He sent me to the Ministry of Justice.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Good.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm relieved that

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
these cases are in your hands.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's just a report from the court.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
When I go back,

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll study it well.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No matter what,

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll have to kill Lou Zhijing.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
As long as the Ministry of Justice

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
is still in the process,

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll take your decision.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You'll have to

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
make this case a disaster

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
if you work harder.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Feels so good to

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
move just now.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I can't believe I made it.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,480
The boys are

74
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,000
sad at home next week.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Resentment

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Successfully

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Make it as quickly as possible.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,960
The Department went on a THER20194466.

79
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,720
Good job.

80
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,800
When the prince-to-be met with King Yu,

81
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,480
the little establishments in the Department

82
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,720
were so worker-like and promising.

83
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,280
This Department

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,860
work- km and training

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's Prince Yu's people.

86
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
The Ministry of Revenue, Ministry of War and Ministry of Revenue are Crown Prince's people.

87
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,400
You want to take a step back from their scum?

88
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,000
I think it's not just six steps to take a step back.

89
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,200
This should be the military report.

90
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Duke Qing is Prince Yu's people.

91
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,200
The Duke of Ning is Crown Prince's people.

92
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
The Lan Yuan Cang's case,

93
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Crown Prince lost a guard's mirror.

94
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
The Qing Emperor's case,

95
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Prince Yu's Duke Qing can't help anymore.

96
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,200
But Prince Yu may not be dead.

97
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Maybe he'll come to me to see how Duke Qing will be doing.

98
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Prince Yu is here. He's in front of the door.

99
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
You're really good at cooking.

100
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
I'll go back first.

101
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Prince Yu's people.

102
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Greetings, Prince Yu.

103
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Prince Yu, please.

104
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,200
Do you know the case of the Banzhou State?

105
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
I know some.

106
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,200
That old couple from the Yuan State had a problem with Jiang Zuo.

107
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Do you mind?

108
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,200
I didn't know that the rules of Jiang Zuo were wrong.

109
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,200
I misunderstood them.

110
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
You're so generous.

111
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
You're so generous.

112
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
This case makes me very confused.

114
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Mr. Wang taught me.

115
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
What?

116
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,200
His Majesty has decided to open the case.

117
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Father has officially sent Prince Jing to the court.

118
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
He ordered to kill Prince Jing.

119
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
He's been thinking about it.

120
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Prince Jing?

121
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Prince Jing, you're so polite.

122
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
You've been struggling outside for years.

123
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
You're not going back to the capital to rest.

124
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Why don't you go back to Jiangxi?

125
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
I can't remember.

126
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,200
You and the Crown Prince didn't object?

127
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Father has already made it clear that I don't allow the Crown Prince and I to fight.

128
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
With Prince Jing's temper,

129
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,200
he's going to accept that he's still good to the Crown Prince.

130
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Of course, the Eastern Palace won't object.

131
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
As for me...

132
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,200
You're going to avoid the Crown Prince, aren't you?

133
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
You know that Duke of Qing has been with me for a long time.

134
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,200
The case didn't have a big effect on the Crown Prince.

135
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,200
I was just worried that Prince Jing's dead heart...

136
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
would be a bad sign.

137
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,200
Isn't there a person in front of Prince Jing?

138
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Maybe you don't know what kind of person my brother is.

139
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,200
In the court, I've never seen anyone as bright and innocent as him.

140
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
I don't know who's a pervert.

141
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Sometimes, even my father can't help me.

142
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
That kind of person is not enough to make him listen to me.

143
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
So you mean...

144
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,200
I have to find a way to make Prince Jing listen to me?

145
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,200
I can't let Prince Jing go through a difficult time.

146
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
If you have any ideas to keep Duke of Qing safe,

147
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
I'm sure I can't help you.

148
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
His Majesty has sent me to the palace today.

149
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,200
I'm going to send my order to send the troops to Qing Diyan.

150
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I'll do my best to help Prince Jing.

151
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,200
I'll send my order to send my order to Qing Diyan.

152
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200
I'll send my order to the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Justice.

153
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
In the case of the court,

154
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,200
I'll send two of the top officials to the Ministry of Justice.

155
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,200
The Ministry of Justice should be on the Ministry of Justice.

156
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,200
I'll also help you to arrange the defense and the hearing.

157
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
This kind of thing?

158
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,200
It seems that the decree is delayed.

159
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,200
I haven't received the order.

160
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Have you received any orders or the decree?

161
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
I haven't received any orders.

162
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Look.

163
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,200
I'm here today to send my order.

164
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
The Ministry of Justice will send my order.

165
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Prince Jing, I'm not in your favor.

166
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,200
I'm not afraid of your order.

167
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Besides,

168
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,200
the recent cases of the Ministry of Justice have been reduced to one.

169
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Look.

170
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,200
The Ministry of Justice has just sent an order.

171
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,200
The person is not in charge of the case.

172
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,200
The case of the Ministry of Justice has also been reduced to ten.

173
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I think you're not in a hurry to do this.

174
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
How long do you plan to prepare?

175
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
You have my opinion.

176
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
It's fine.

177
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Your Highness, you're not in a hurry to do this.

178
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,200
I can only say that

179
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
there are ten thousand ways to choose.

180
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Why do you choose a dead way?

181
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,200
What do you mean?

182
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,200
You're a former king.

183
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,200
You're favored by His Majesty and have a great reputation.

184
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,200
You can have a grand ceremony with the Crown Prince.

185
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
But you forgot.

186
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,200
No matter how big your power is,

187
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
in this grand ceremony,

188
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,200
one person cannot be the enemy of His Highness.

189
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,200
That's your father, the emperor of the state.

190
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
You're wrong.

191
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
How dare I be the enemy of my father?

192
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Since His Highness is a god of the phoenix,

193
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,200
I think it's not enough to keep the official documents.

194
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
There won't be much of the money used.

195
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I can't let you wait for long.

196
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
How about this?

197
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
I'll do it myself.

198
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,200
I promise you that I'll give you the best time in ten days and half a month.

199
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
How about that?

200
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
The documents will arrive tomorrow.

201
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
I'll come back later.

202
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Think about it again.

203
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,200
How should I reply to them?

204
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Your Highness, you're right.

205
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Prince Jin.

206
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Prince Jin, I'm...

207
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Your Highness, I thought...

208
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,200
who will be the main judge for the case of Qing Emperor?

209
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Is it the Crown Prince?

210
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Is it Prince Jin?

211
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
It's not all.

212
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
It's the emperor.

213
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Why did he send the judicial agencies and the Xuanjing Bureau to investigate it?

214
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,200
Why did he come to Prince Jin to be the main judge?

215
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,200
He just wants to be the head judge.

216
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,200
He just wants to be the head judge for the current situation.

217
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
His Highness and Prince Jin have been fighting for years.

218
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
His Majesty can tolerate it.

219
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
But he can't tolerate it.

220
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
You're going to make him a state official.

221
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,200
In the case of Bingzhou, His Majesty has already made a decision.

222
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,200
If His Highness can withdraw from the court and mess with the court,

223
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,200
who will be the one to be in the end?

224
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,200
You're indeed a loyal man.

225
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
To protect a state official,

226
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
you lost His Majesty's loyalty.

227
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
You're very familiar with him.

228
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Have you ever thought about it?

229
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Is there really no other way?

230
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,200
The state official has long been unable to escape.

231
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
I'm sure you understand.

232
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
What is it?

233
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,200
At the charge of female military ourselves,

234
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,500
we are ordered to fight and wordt the State.

235
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,200
We are ordered to raise a computers to quickly kill.

236
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Please, Minister Yu.

237
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
And support the court.

238
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
What are you doing?

239
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Move!

240
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,440
Seven?

241
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,760
Seven?

242
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,040
Twelve?

243
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,100
Cookies?

244
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,200
If you feel that

245
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,720
erthing is more important for me,

246
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,220
appearances would be better.

247
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:24,900
is the only one who pressed appreciate a sure thing about you.

248
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,360
If we have to say it with JAM,

249
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,980
or if we comment on the 핵健,

250
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,540
I won't betray you with my word.

251
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,640
But in the military.

252
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,860
I missed the call for Wang Xie Yu,

253
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,560
and executed him,

254
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,220
You are so busy.

255
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,220
You are from the Marquis's Mansion.

256
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,220
You must have some other reason to do this.

257
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,220
I am a martial arts person.

258
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,220
I have no reason to do this.

259
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,220
I am not used to

260
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,220
living in the Marquis's Mansion.

261
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,220
You want to follow the order.

262
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,220
No one can force you.

263
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,220
You are a talented man.

264
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,220
You are a talented man.

265
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,220
You are a good man.

266
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,220
You don't need to say anything.

267
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,220
I want to say

268
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,220
that you can choose

269
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,220
and you can do whatever you want.

270
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,220
As long as you are willing to do this,

271
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,220
I will open the door for you.

272
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,220
I will open the door for you forever.

273
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,220
General,

274
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,220
I will take you to the camp.

275
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,220
The case of the Qing State

276
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
has been handed over to you.

277
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,220
The case has been reported.

278
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,220
Please come to take them to the mansion.

279
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,220
It is not convenient.

280
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,220
It is not convenient.

281
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,220
You are the chief of the imperial court.

282
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,220
You should report it to the court.

283
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,220
You should prepare the documents.

284
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,220
General Lie,

285
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,220
you can take the report to the court.

286
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,220
It is better to report it to the imperial court.

287
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,220
Thank you.

288
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,220
It is all for your benefit.

289
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,220
The crown prince has sent a message.

290
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,220
You have worked hard.

291
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,220
We can't be in trouble.

292
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,220
Please.

293
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,220
Yes.

294
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,220
Do you have anything else to say?

295
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,220
As you have seen,

296
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,220
His Highness has abandoned the Qing State

297
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,220
to support Prince Jin.

298
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,220
Support Prince Jin?

299
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,220
He is the emperor.

300
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,220
He is the emperor.

301
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,220
He is the prince.

302
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,220
He has a life.

303
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,220
Who dares to make him in trouble?

304
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,220
How can he need my support?

305
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,220
Prince Jin has a life.

306
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,220
Although the prime minister said it,

307
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,220
he didn't mean to make it difficult.

308
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,220
But I'm afraid sometimes,

309
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,220
he will be more relaxed.

310
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,220
It is important to get the support of the Ministry of Justice.

311
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,220
But what Su said

312
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:36,220
is a matter of the military.

313
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,220
What you said is...

314
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,220
Zi'an is just a rumor.

315
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,220
After the trial,

316
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,220
everyone will report more of this kind of safety.

317
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,220
In fact,

318
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,220
he will definitely pull more good men.

319
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,220
Prince Jin can't be taken in.

320
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,220
If His Highness can hold it in,

321
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,220
he will help him to quickly pacify

322
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,220
the opposition of all good men.

323
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,220
He will help His Majesty to stabilize the state of Genglong.

324
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,220
Then,

325
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,220
how can Prince Jin not be grateful to His Highness?

326
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,220
You mean

327
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,220
to make me hold Prince Jin?

328
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,220
I had this intention

329
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,220
when I was in the royal family.

330
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,220
It seems that you have been planning this.

331
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,220
What do you mean?

332
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,220
I'm willing to do it.

333
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,220
What can you do about losing one of the Duke of Jin?

334
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,220
From the military,

335
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,220
can two Duke of Jin

336
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,220
be more than half of Prince Jin?

337
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,220
If we can get Prince Jin's support,

338
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,220
we will definitely be able to do it.

339
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,220
But with Prince Jin's confidence,

340
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,220
I'm afraid that when we need to send him to the court,

341
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,220
he will not listen to the dispatch.

342
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,220
What's the use of sending the army?

343
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,220
Are you going to force the attack?

344
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
Where is the master?

345
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,220
Good. Let's go and see.

346
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,220
Didn't Prince Yu want to bite the mirror of the building?

347
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,220
That's good.

348
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,220
We won't give Duke of Jin a chance to think.

349
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,220
Duke of Jin has already taken the case.

350
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,220
You don't need to worry.

351
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,220
Even if Prince Yu is half of the family,

352
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,220
Xiao Jingyan will not let it go.

353
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,220
It's just that Lan Yuan's case has now reached the execution point.

354
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,220
The people's life and death of the Duke of Jin

355
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,220
will not be able to be removed.

356
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,220
The Ministry of Revenue must be out of the way.

357
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,220
Your Highness, you must hurry and push someone to the top.

358
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,220
You're right.

359
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,220
Losing the Duke of Jin

360
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,220
means cutting off my arm.

361
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,220
No matter who goes up,

362
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,220
Prince Yu will not be able to get the position.

363
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,220
Your Highness,

364
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,220
although the situation is not as good as the people's will,

365
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,220
the situation is still not as good as the people's will.

366
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,220
Your Highness, don't worry.

367
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,220
There is a possibility that the situation will be better.

368
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,220
How can I be sure of this?

369
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,220
No matter where he is,

370
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,220
you must get rid of him.

371
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,220
Since you're not forcing the attack and not making the rebellion,

372
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,220
why are you here to dispatch the army?

373
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,220
In the capital,

374
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,220
His Majesty has asked for the imperial army.

375
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,220
The Mongols have made the attack.

376
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,220
Once something happens,

377
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,220
as long as it is under control,

378
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,220
who else can make the rebellion?

379
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,220
You're right.

380
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,220
The people who Xie Yu and I were looking for

381
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,220
were indeed not enough to discuss the matter with the Mongols.

382
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,220
So, the most important thing for His Highness is to get His Majesty's approval.

383
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,220
As for the so-called military support,

384
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,220
it's just a matter of interest.

385
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,220
What's the use of listening to him like that?

386
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,220
Even if we don't tell them,

387
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,220
if one day,

388
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,220
the Crown Prince really wants to make a rebellion,

389
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,220
not just His Majesty,

390
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,220
or if he has the His Majesty's life,

391
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
according to Prince Jing's personality,

392
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,220
he'll have to wait until His Highness is sent to the rebellion

393
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,220
to make the rebellion.

394
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,220
That's true.

395
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,220
Prince Jing is very ambitious.

396
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,220
He's not a good person.

397
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,220
Of course, there's a limit to everything.

398
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,220
His Highness only needs to cooperate with the family.

399
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,220
He can be kind.

400
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,220
He doesn't need to be too courteous.

401
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,220
It seems that tomorrow,

402
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,220
I still have to ask His Highness to go to Prince Jing's manor.

403
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,220
He's far away from the court.

404
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,220
He doesn't even think about doing anything.

405
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,220
If I don't remind him,

406
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,220
maybe he doesn't know that His Highness is cooperating with him.

407
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
Please accept my bow.

408
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,220
What are you doing?

409
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,220
You're so ambitious to do this for me.

410
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,220
You should accept my bow.

411
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,220
Don't worry.

412
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,220
Since I've known the answer today,

413
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,220
I'll be in touch with my little brother,

414
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,220
if he and Xie Yu want to do something,

415
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,220
I won't agree.

416
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,220
As for Jing Yan's idea,

417
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,220
I'll be in your care.

418
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,220
You don't need to send him off.

419
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,220
If he's cold,

420
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,220
how can I let him go?

421
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,220
I'll take my leave.

422
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,220
Take care, Your Highness.

423
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,220
Please.

424
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,220
Here, Your Highness.

425
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,220
Your Highness.

426
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,220
Why did the Princess talk to Prince Yu for so long?

427
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,220
He's very well-behaved.

428
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,220
He can't deal with it.

429
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,220
He needs more time.

430
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,220
By the way,

431
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,220
I'm going to Prince Jing's manor tomorrow.

432
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,220
Prepare the gold silk dye for me.

433
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,220
It's dangerous!

434
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,220
Your Highness,

435
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,220
I've already sent the gold silk dye to Prince Jing's manor.

436
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,220
I want to give it to him as a gift.

437
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,220
But...

438
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,220
Isn't this gift too expensive?

439
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,220
Besides,

440
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,220
you're a little bit of a nuisance

441
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,220
to give a gift to a child.

442
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,220
Yes.

443
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,220
What do you think?

444
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,220
I'll give it to him.

445
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,220
Fei Liu!

446
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,220
You've been eating sweet melon for a whole day!

447
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,220
Be careful!

448
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,220
Don't eat so much.

449
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,220
Eat one every day.

450
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,220
What are you taking?

451
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,220
Come down.

452
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,220
Do you still remember Brother Ting Sheng?

453
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
Yes.

454
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,220
Tomorrow, Brother Su will take you to visit him.

455
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,220
Yes.

456
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,220
Did he give you a little silver?

457
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,220
We need to give him another gift.

458
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,220
I've prepared the gift.

459
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,220
You can give it to him tomorrow.

460
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,220
Yes.

461
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,220
Are you angry?

462
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,220
Yes.

463
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,220
You can eat two tomorrow.

464
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,220
Yes.

465
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,220
It's much better to let Fei Liu go.

466
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,220
Everyone knows the character of this child.

467
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,220
It depends on whether he's happy or not.

468
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,220
No one should notice if the gift is expensive.

469
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,220
Fei Liu is indeed the most suitable one.

470
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,220
I should hold out only this day.

471
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,220
Where do you want to go tomorrow?

472
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,220
Commandant Prince Yu,

473
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,220
why did you come in person?

474
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,720
I have a personal question.

475
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,320
I know what you're thinking.

476
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,320
Prince Jing has been here just now.

477
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,400
He wants me and people.

478
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,120
It's not that easy.

479
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,040
He's been out for too long.

480
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,560
The gate of the factory is not open.

481
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,840
It's easy to deal with him.

482
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,680
I'll beat him up with my words.

483
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,160
You beat Prince Jing up?

484
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,960
Yes.

485
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,920
Who told you to beat him up?

486
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,480
Father.

487
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,200
They're all out.

488
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,800
They're out.

489
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,560
Are you sure this time?

490
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
I'll do my best.

491
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,760
Fang Liu, look.

492
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,520
It's a gift from Ting Sheng.

493
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,440
Do you like it?

494
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,960
1 basic must-do items for younger brother.

495
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Do you like it?

496
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
No.

497
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,960
If you don't like it, it's because of your kung fu.

498
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
It's useless to wear it.

499
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,960
But it's young and weak in the background.

500
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,960
If he wears it,

501
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,960
he won't get hurt when others bully him.

502
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,960
He will definitely like it.

503
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Really?

504
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Go.

505
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,960
The Greatest of the World

506
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Episode 12

507
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
Chief, everything is solved.

508
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
No trouble at all.

509
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,960
I'm afraid they will know this time.

510
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Suzai is a place that is more difficult to find than the Duke of Ningguo's mansion.

511
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Chief.

512
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Speaking of which,

513
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,960
Suzai and Prince Jing are just behind the wall.

514
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,960
But the scene is really far away from the road.

515
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,960
It's been about half an hour since they left.

516
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,960
I'm seventeen years old.

517
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,960
My father was sent to the Imperial House to see me.

518
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,960
This is the place that the Royal Brother chose for me.

519
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
How is it?

520
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
Go.

521
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Of course, the place that Brother Qiwang chose is good.

522
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,960
I don't like you.

523
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
Even if you're seventeen years old,

524
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,960
the Royal Uncle won't let me come out to see you alone.

525
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
We are good brothers.

526
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
I'm yours.

527
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Go.

528
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Go.

529
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
It's still the same as before.

530
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
Nothing has changed.

531
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Mr. Su.

532
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Prince Jin.

533
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,960
I've seen Mr. Su.

534
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
Come on, Tiansheng.

535
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Get up.

536
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,960
Come on.

537
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,960
Brother Fei Liu.

538
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,960
Here you are.

539
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
Thank you.

540
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Gold silk soft armor.

541
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,960
This is a precious item.

542
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,960
This gift is too expensive.

543
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
Tiansheng can't be received.

544
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
What's the use of telling me?

545
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
This is from Fei Liu.

546
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,960
You want to talk to Fei Liu?

547
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
This way, please.

548
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Your Highness.

549
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
This is Mr. Su Zhe.

550
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,960
He is my friend.

551
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
We will take care of him.

552
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Mr. Su.

553
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,960
Mr. Su.

554
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,960
Zhan Ying.

555
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,960
You can handle the rest.

556
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Yes.

557
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
I'll go.

558
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,960
I'll go.

559
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
You can handle the rest.

560
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,960
Yes.

561
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
This is the ceremony.

562
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
I'll go to the study with Mr. Su.

563
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
Please.

564
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Mr. Su's name is just arrived.

565
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,960
We are in the ceremony.

566
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,960
Those kids want to see

567
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,960
what the Su Zhe looks like

568
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
in the capital.

569
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
So...

570
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,960
So you have two more steps.

571
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Please.

572
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Mr. Su, what's wrong?

573
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
Why your face is so pale?

574
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
Nothing.

575
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,960
This is just...

576
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
Nothing.

577
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
This is just...

578
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,820
味噌火纻传994466 Hoanaqun

579
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,580
These futures

580
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,460
time was a few days later than yesterday.

581
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,460
Sure,

582
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,460
Today is the winter.

583
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,460
Guards.

584
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,460
Yes.

585
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,460
Move the fire door.

586
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,460
Yes.

587
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,460
Thank you.

588
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,460
Mr. Su, please sit.

589
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,460
Okay.

590
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,460
I've always been in a bad mood.

591
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,460
I forgot you were afraid of cold.

592
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,460
So I lost my mind.

593
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,460
By the way,

594
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,460
I heard that you are very busy these days.

595
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,460
You haven't been able to visit the temple.

596
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,460
Please forgive me.

597
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,460
How did you know?

598
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,460
I heard from my mother.

599
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,460
Actually, I came today

600
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,460
to try my best for Prince Yu.

601
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,460
The case has been settled.

602
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,460
You can let go of the investigation.

603
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,460
You don't need to worry about anything.

604
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,460
I didn't plan to worry about anything.

605
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,460
You have been to the Ministry of Justice.

606
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,460
Do you still cooperate with the citizens?

607
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,460
No matter if he cooperates with or not,

608
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,460
what should we do about this case?

609
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,460
What should we do?

610
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,460
What should we do?

611
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,460
Ready.

612
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,460
Yes.

613
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,460
Brother Liu.

614
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,460
Yes.

615
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,460
This is the Yanwu factory in our mansion.

616
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,460
I have to practice three hours every day.

617
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,460
Sometimes, Prince Jing will come to me personally.

618
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,460
He is very bad.

619
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,460
Fei Liu.

620
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,460
Don't talk nonsense.

621
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,460
Uncle Meng is better.

622
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,460
How can you compare

623
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,460
with Prince Jing with the Commander Meng?

624
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,460
I am the best.

625
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,460
General.

626
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,460
Who is that?

627
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,460
I don't know.

628
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,460
What do you think about this case?

629
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,460
I have seen the evidence.

630
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,460
It's not hard to find out.

631
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,460
Duke Qing is not only a coward.

632
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,460
He is also a cook.

633
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,460
Duke Qing is the second emperor.

634
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,460
He has the right to be a servant.

635
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,460
He is a criminal.

636
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,460
He is a third person.

637
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,460
He is not a servant.

638
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,460
He is in the capital.

639
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,460
The case is not his own.

640
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,460
The situation in the Zhu family village is very serious.

641
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,460
He is a criminal.

642
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,460
The situation in the Zhu family village is very serious.

643
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,460
His secret is not true.

644
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,460
His secret is not his own.

645
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,460
It's the master of the mansion.

646
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,460
I invited him last night.

647
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,460
He came today.

648
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,460
It's not hard to find.

649
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,460
So, you invited him.

650
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,460
You can find the master

651
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,460
in the evidence chain of Xuanjing Temple.

652
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,460
You are so quick to do it.

653
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,460
You are so quick to do it.

654
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,460
I admire you.

655
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,460
Your Highness.

656
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,460
You are the iron general who was

657
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,460
killed on the battlefield.

658
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,460
Who are you?

659
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,460
He is not a criminal.

660
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,460
I am Fei Liu.

661
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,460
Fei Liu?

662
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,460
You are the one who followed

663
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,460
the leader of the Jiangzu Alliance, Mei Changsu.

664
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,460
You came to the capital together

665
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,460
and fought with Commander Meng.

666
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,460
You even defeated

667
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,460
the Fei Liu of Lord Xia Dong.

668
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,460
You are right.

669
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,460
It's me.

670
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,460
Now, we have to find the most worried situation.

671
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,460
The situation in Xuanjing Temple

672
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,460
is very difficult to deal with.

673
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,460
So, you have to deal with

674
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,460
different cases

675
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,460
to find some clues.

676
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,460
Some are criminal and some are serious.

677
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,460
They can't keep your rules.

678
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,460
In this way,

679
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,460
the good and the bad

680
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,460
always have to be guessed.

681
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,460
It's impossible to solve it.

682
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,460
You are right.

683
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,460
If we are just colleagues,

684
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,460
maybe we can't solve the problem.

685
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,460
Since Prince Yu is willing to help you,

686
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,460
don't be too proud of him.

687
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,460
If I meet the person

688
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,460
who is under his control,

689
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,460
you can choose a person who is willing to help.

690
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,460
If you let him go,

691
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,460
you can give him a reply.

692
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,460
He should have tried his best

693
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,460
to protect Duke Qing.

694
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,460
How could he use the fat meat

695
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,460
in his hand

696
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,460
to eat the hard stone?

697
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,460
You are very important to him.

698
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,460
To make me look important,

699
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,460
Mr. Cheng Meng

700
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,460
made Prince Yu abandon Duke Qing

701
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,460
and let Xie Yu throw out the horse.

702
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,460
Thank you so much.

703
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,460
What?

704
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,460
Don't you want to give me a memory?

705
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,460
Good!

706
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,460
Good!

707
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,460
I understand what you mean.

708
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,460
But I don't want people to think

709
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,460
I am standing on Prince Yu's side.

710
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,460
I don't want to stand

711
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,460
with the Crown Prince and Prince Yu.

712
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,460
Your Highness, you have been wronged.

713
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,460
You are being so polite.

714
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,460
In short, you are a little soft.

715
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,460
We can understand that.

716
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,460
I don't care about

717
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,460
the other people's views.

718
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,460
But the person should be above.

719
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,460
I don't want them to think

720
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,460
I, Xiao Jing Yan,

721
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,460
have a low head.

722
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,460
Since you are the spirit,

723
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,460
I will take your heart.

724
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,460
What's wrong?

725
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,460
Are you still cold?

726
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,460
Nothing.

727
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,460
I am a little numb on the feet.

728
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,460
I am a little numb on the feet.

729
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,460
I will just walk for a while.

730
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,460
Don't move.

731
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,460
Don't move.

732
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,460
Don't move.

733
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,460
Please don't mind.

734
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,460
This is my friend's relic.

735
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,460
He was born

736
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,460
and doesn't like strangers

737
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,460
to touch his things.

738
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,460
I am sorry.

739
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,460
The back is not heavy.

740
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,460
The Zhao's world is so peaceful.

741
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,460
How can you be so important?

742
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,460
The Zhao's world is so useful.

743
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,460
How can you be so peaceful?

744
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,460
Why are you talking to the emperor?

745
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,460
The choice is real.

746
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,460
In short, this choice is not appropriate.

747
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,460
I am lazy to argue with you.

748
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,460
Father.

749
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,460
Father, you...

750
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,460
Enough.

751
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,460
It has been more than half an hour.

752
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,460
I am tired even if you are not tired.

753
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,460
I am tired.

754
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,460
I am tired even if you are not tired.

755
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,460
I will deal with this matter later.

756
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,460
You may leave now.

757
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,460
I am leaving.

758
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,460
Your Majesty.

759
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,460
After the imperial edict entered the prison,

760
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,460
how should we make up for it?

761
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,460
But the court is in a serious state.

762
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,460
It is not appropriate for you to

763
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,460
make up for it.

764
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,460
Look at the memorials of these memorials.

765
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,460
Although there are many people,

766
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,460
there is no one who is satisfied with all of them.

767
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,460
If we continue to make up for it,

768
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,460
the government of the Ministry of Revenue will be in chaos.

769
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,460
The Ministry of Revenue has a court of trial.

770
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,460
It will be fine in a while.

771
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,460
Court of trial?

772
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,460
Yes.

773
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,460
The Emperor of the Republic of China

774
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,460
The Emperor of the Republic of China

775
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,460
The Emperor of the Republic of China

776
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,460
The Emperor of the Republic of China

777
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,460
The Emperor of the Republic of China

778
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,460
The Emperor of the Republic of China

779
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,460
The Emperor of the Republic of China

780
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,460
The Emperor of the Republic of China

781
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,460
The Emperor of the Republic of China

782
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,460
The Emperor of the Republic of China

783
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,460
The Emperor of the Republic of China

784
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,460
The Emperor of the Republic of China

785
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,460
The Emperor of the Republic of China

786
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,460
The Emperor of the Republic of China
