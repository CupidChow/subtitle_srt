00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,960
Shaى그�이션

2
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,500
Say

3
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,500
Ask

4
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,260
The

5
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,000
retreat

6
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,860
To

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What do you think, Your Majesty?

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Ni Huang,

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
this is

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
the fault of Noble Consort Yue.

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
She is a daughter of the royal family.

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's not appropriate to take the blame on her.

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You are wronged.

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Ni Huang, listen to His Majesty's plan.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And you,

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'll tell you.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Stay in the Eastern Palace.

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You'll be in the family for three months.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Study hard.

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Think about the way of Chu's army.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I won't forgive you

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
for doing these things again.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Thank you for your kindness.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Go on.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll go.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Your Majesty.

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Cheng Yuan.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Cheng Yuan.

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm here.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you know the fault?

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
How is the situation inside?

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I thank the Crown Prince.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Although the situation is full,

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I still have the power to do it.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I know the fault.

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Then let me ask you.

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How did you know

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Ni Huang was in the Zhaoren Palace

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and went to save him?

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The palace is deep.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You have never been in the Zhaoren Palace

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
since you were born.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Why did you suddenly remember

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
to go in?

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I...

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Your Majesty.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Your Highness, Prince Yu wants to see you.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Xu An.

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm here to see you, Prince Yu.

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Greetings, Father.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Mother.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What brings you here at this time?

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What's the matter?

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Father.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I asked Jingyan to come to the Zhaoren Palace.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You?

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Please come in.

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Come.

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm here to see you.

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
How did you know

65
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
something happened in the Zhaoren Palace?

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I went to the palace to see my mother

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
after the ceremony.

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I went to the Zhaoren Palace

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
from the entrance of the Puching Gate.

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I saw the Crown Prince

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
taking Sima Lei in.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Father knows

73
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
the Crown Prince is very important to him.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I will not take a look

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
at his actions.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I thought

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
the Crown Prince would take me

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
to the palace with him.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's not right.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I asked someone

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
to investigate.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The Princess was also inside.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I felt something was wrong.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You are clever.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Since you found out something was wrong,

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
you should go in and have a look.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why did you

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
call Jingyan here?

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The Zhaoren Palace is very important.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I can't take the guards

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
to force my mother to enter the palace.

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
When I was in the south,

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I saw Jingyan passing by.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I thought

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
he was a prince.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I should go in and have a look.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's better than

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
to be honest with the guards.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If there is really nothing in the Zhaoren Palace,

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I will ask for more heads

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
to ask for punishment from my mother.

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Jingyan,

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Jinghuan asked you to go in.

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You really went in.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think the speed of the day

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
is not that good.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's about the Princess.

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I have no idea.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Thanks to Jingyan,

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I was able to save

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
the Princess.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Now that I think about it,

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm really scared.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Who could have thought

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
that Noble Consort

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
would be so bold and bold.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
She would dare to order

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
to kill the prince.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Father,

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
although I didn't take the case of Jingyan

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and broke the Crown Prince,

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
she was taken by me after all.

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If you want to punish me,

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I am willing to be punished.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
All right.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You are really

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
very serious about the Crown Prince.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The Crown Prince is a general.

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He is a brother.

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I always respect him.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He has a long history of

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
doing things right.

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He is a good man.

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So...

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
All right.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I will forget about it.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't know about you.

138
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But what you said

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
is also in the process.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If anything happens today,

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I will rely on your knowledge.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is Jingyan.

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You are a general.

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You are the Crown Prince.

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You are bold and bold.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You should be punished.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Your Majesty.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Father,

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I am the one who did this.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Please forgive me.

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Jingyan,

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
although I am guilty,

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I am still grateful to you.

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Jinghuan is willing to be punished for you.

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Moreover,

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
the princess has a lot of merit.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She has done well.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
She is not a general.

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The Prince Yu is very kind.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He is a good man.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He is very bold.

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I am very proud of him.

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He is a special reward.

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He is very kind.

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He is a great man.

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I will give him a chance

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to reward you.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I thank you, Father.

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Thank you, Father.

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Prince Jin.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Prince Jin, you are so fast.

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I just got a letter from Prince Yu

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
at the nursing home.

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You are so stubborn.

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Come on.

176
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I know actually.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What does the princess know?

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I know you came to save me

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and you helped Prince Yu.

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It was Mr. Su who invited you here.

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What did Mr. Su do?

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Commander Meng told me about that.

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Commander Meng?

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Commander Meng came to me suddenly.

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He only said that you had something to do with the palace.

186
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He asked me to go and rescue him.

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I was also suspicious at that time.

188
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But I trusted Commander Meng.

189
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And the situation was too urgent.

190
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So I immediately went to the palace.

191
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How did you mention Mr. Su?

192
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I think there are some things that we need to ask Commander Meng.

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's really painful today.

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Although His Majesty has protected the Crown Prince in the end,

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
but he can let the person who is the Yueshi

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
have such a big fight,

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
it's worth our mother and son having a few drinks.

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
All thanks to the Mother's understanding.

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We have a good chance of getting rid of him.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We have a good chance of getting rid of him.

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Come.

202
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
To be honest,

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I didn't mean to ask for your permission.

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I can say that it's a reward.

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Reward?

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Please.

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You two came together today.

210
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's really a rare occasion.

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Commander Meng, do you want to talk about today?

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You can leave first.

213
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yes.

214
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I heard from Prince Jin that Ni Huang escaped today.

215
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He saved the whole of the Great Commander.

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So Ni Huang came to the palace to help.

217
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Princess, don't be like this.

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You really killed me.

219
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But Ni Huang doesn't understand.

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
How did you find out about the secret behind the harem?

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I was ordered to serve the palace.

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
How could I hide it from me

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
if I entered the palace like Sima Lei?

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Really?

225
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
With just one palace,

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I can make a clear judgment

227
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
that something will happen in the Zhao Ren Palace.

228
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's such a great opportunity.

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm afraid that the people who are investigating the new harem

230
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
are not the Commander.

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It seems that I still can't hide it from you.

232
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Although the whole family of the Empress Dowager

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
has invited the Empress Dowager to solve the matter today,

234
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
from the Princess' point of view,

235
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
she may not be the Empress Dowager's most grateful person.

236
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's right.

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Jingyan is not afraid of death.

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
In the Zhao Ren Palace,

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
the Crown Prince of the Daoist School is the one who protects her.

240
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Princess, of course, is grateful.

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But I'm begging you in front of Father and Mother.

242
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Jingyan became the one I sent there.

243
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He has the punishment of the Crown Prince.

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He's only responsible for my safety and the disaster.

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Of course, he wouldn't dare to say anything more.

246
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Mother, think about it.

247
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Is that really true?

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yes, yes.

249
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The Emperor is really smart.

250
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You know what?

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The Princess just stopped me from the palace

252
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and thanked me for a meal.

253
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You have this kind of love in front of the Princess.

254
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yunnan's house is so beautiful.

255
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You must be the one in your heart.

256
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But you never sent Jingyan.

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
How could she have come to the Zhao Ren Palace?

258
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What's wrong?

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
This is the best of the best.

260
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I've set up the first half of the game.

261
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
As for the second half,

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll have to see what you have.

263
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I've only got some news from Aunt Li Yang.

264
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
She's been looking for a job in the palace.

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
She can't be sure what's going on in the Zhao Ren Palace.

266
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What's wrong?

267
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This is a very hard thing to do.

268
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm asking Jingyan.

269
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What are you talking about?

270
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm talking about the best thing of the day.

271
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Mei Changsu.

272
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Mei Changsu?

273
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Is it related to her?

274
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Jingyan is reckless.

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
She's a good cook.

276
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
She's stubborn.

277
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How could she be so timid?

278
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
She's just a pawn.

279
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The real culprit is Mei Changsu.

280
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is what I find out.

281
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Lang Ya Ge's theory is not a lie.

282
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
This Qi Ling talent

283
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
must be caught in my hands.

284
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This is not a god.

285
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
How could he know that

286
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
the Queen is the princess?

287
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Of course not.

288
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
When I arrived at the Wuyin Palace,

289
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
she took Princess Li Yang to me.

290
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
She must be careful of the palace.

291
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But the Queen invited me first.

292
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I thought she was the worst.

293
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But she didn't want to be too embarrassed.

294
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
She invited me to the Noble Consort Yue.

295
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But she had to be treated with a big gift

296
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and thank Prince Yu.

297
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Prince Yu is a good dancer.

298
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Why would the Princess thank him?

299
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Prince Yu did a good job.

300
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
He's not afraid of the King.

301
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Moreover, the Noble Consort Yue

302
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
has successfully saved the Crown Prince.

303
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
As the Crown Prince's Crown Prince,

304
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
the Crown Prince's power is still strong.

305
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm worried that

306
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
he will find Prince Yu in the future.

307
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That's right.

308
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The Princess is so stubborn to thank Prince Yu.

309
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Prince Yu will be so envious of Prince Yu.

310
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, they don't have time

311
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
to come to the King for now.

312
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Prince Yu was very happy just now.

313
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Of course he was very happy.

314
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
His mother was forced to be praised by the Crown Prince.

315
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He sold you a lover

316
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
to protect you.

317
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He even became the great benefactor of my Yunnan House.

318
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He didn't do anything

319
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
that happened in the end.

320
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But the three words

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
turned into the greatest victory.

322
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He was so proud.

323
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Prince Yu is so smart today.

324
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It seems that there's a high-ranking person behind him.

325
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This soul water in the palace

326
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
is not for this high-ranking person.

327
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Who can be so cunning?

328
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It seems that from now on,

329
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
we won't be able to escape this high-ranking person.

330
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The storm is coming.

331
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I don't know if this secret is going to

332
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
leave a trace of the river.

333
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's raining heavily.

334
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's really not going to be possible.

335
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What brings you here?

336
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Mr. Su's talent is very good.

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's still possible to see me

338
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
in this kind of situation.

339
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You're so kind.

340
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm here to ask

341
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
what happened in the palace

342
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
that day.

343
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Isn't this matter solved completely?

344
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It is.

345
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm grateful to you for saving me.

346
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If I fight for it,

347
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yunnan's Talisman will naturally be a great victory.

348
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This is the purpose you want to achieve.

349
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Your Highness, you mean

350
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
that this matter was deliberately made by Su?

351
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I didn't say that.

352
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I care about the result.

353
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Do you think it's worth it?

354
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What kind of suggestion did you make

355
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
when you met with the Princess?

356
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I understand.

357
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You can't guarantee it.

358
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I also admire your effort and arrangement.

359
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But I want to remind you

360
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
that if this kind of situation happens again,

361
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
it should have been my wisdom.

362
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't want the Princess to be

363
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
imprisoned in the court

364
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and not to be imprisoned in the court.

365
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't want to be imprisoned in the court

366
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and to be imprisoned in the court.

367
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't want to be imprisoned in the court

368
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
and not to be imprisoned in the court

369
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and to be imprisoned in the court.

370
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I didn't expect that you would think

371
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
about how Su Mo would do.

372
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It really made me feel surprised.

373
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Since you deny it, that's good.

374
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It means you understand

375
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
that this is wrong.

376
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Your Highness, please say something.

377
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The Princess is not one of the people

378
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
who fought with the power of the court.

379
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
She killed herself in the battlefield

380
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
to keep you from fighting in the anti-China territory.

381
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
In the future, I won't allow you

382
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
to be a pawn to such a person

383
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
just because of your cooperation.

384
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Otherwise, I, Xiao Jingyan,

385
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
can't do anything with you.

386
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I understand.

387
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Your Highness, you are here today

388
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
to follow my rules.

389
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Qi Hong.

390
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yes.

391
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Have you changed the people in the Qingli Courtyard?

392
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
They have all changed.

393
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
They are all our people.

394
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The imperial decree of the Imperial Concubine Yue

395
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
was to be remitted.

396
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
No one dares to tell her about it.

397
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

398
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I will follow your rules.

399
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yes.

400
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The palace seal of the Imperial Concubine Yue

401
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
was given by the Imperial Concubine.

402
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Shall we make some arrangements

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
to make Yue Ping suffer more?

404
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I am just taking her with me.

405
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
His Majesty won't believe it.

406
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Since she has been charged with this crime,

407
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
why don't you let her suffer?

408
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Pay attention to the dignity.

409
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Don't be sad.

410
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Just leave her with the soldiers.

411
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yes.

412
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I promise to cooperate with you.

413
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You will take me as your main force.

414
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Then you must understand my bottom line.

415
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What is your bottom line?

416
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I have seen many things.

417
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I have seen the most dangerous and shameless things

418
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
they have done.

419
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The cold sword they have set up

420
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
can't even defeat the strongest.

421
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
My brother and my best friend

422
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
have all died because of this.

423
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I can't let them see me

424
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and become a person

425
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
who can't be stopped.

426
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

427
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You will never become this kind of person.

428
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't want you to understand

429
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
what is military snow

430
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and what is war wolf smoke.

431
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But some people can't hurt

432
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and some things can't be used.

433
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
If even those

434
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
who are not respected by the soldiers

435
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
in the blood battle and the battlefield

436
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
will never be your enemy,

437
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
is that clear?

438
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Please go to Anzhiyue Ping personally.

439
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I really can't bear to go.

440
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You have been raised in my palace since you were young.

441
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't know what you are laughing at.

442
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But this matter will not be delayed.

443
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You can't let Ye Ping have the chance

444
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
to beg for mercy from His Majesty.

445
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What about Jingyan?

446
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
She is going back now.

447
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
She didn't say anything.

448
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Don't worry about it.

449
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
With her temper,

450
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
she won't say anything more.

451
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Jinghuan,

452
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
no matter how much you are a military soldier,

453
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
no matter what Jingxuan does,

454
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
she will never be as good as you.

455
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's a pity that mother

456
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
can't let you become a military officer.

457
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Noble Consort Yue has been a spy for many years.

458
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Jingxuan has become a Crown Prince.

459
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That is also a good thing.

460
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
After this,

461
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm afraid they will lose their favor.

462
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Since she has been promoted to Yue Ping,

463
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
she will soon be able to move

464
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
the position of the Eastern Palace.

465
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm worried about

466
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
the imperial decree.

467
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Don't worry.

468
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
We will work hard.

469
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The Eastern Palace will be

470
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
surrounded by enemies.

471
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Now that you have Meichang Su,

472
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I have more confidence.

473
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
As you said,

474
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I will obey my own order.

475
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Since I am here today to decide the rules,

476
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
can you allow me to say a few words?

477
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Please say it.

478
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I want to deal with people like Crown Prince

479
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and Prince Yu.

480
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's not enough to rely on

481
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Your Highness' enthusiasm.

482
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The existence of Mother Su

483
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
is not to let them achieve their goals.

484
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I want to deal with them.

485
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I must be more ruthless than them.

486
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Otherwise, if we are not in a good mood,

487
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
our great cause will be in vain.

488
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Your Highness, you should know very well.

489
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I will never touch

490
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Your Highness' bottom line.

491
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I also hope that

492
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Your Highness will not

493
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
make any more guesses about me.

494
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Also,

495
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
you don't have to hide anything from me.

496
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Like Ting Sheng.

497
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Ting Sheng?

498
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
What's the secret of Ting Sheng?

499
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I only know her identity.

500
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I also know

501
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
that she is her identity.

502
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I have always been a bright person.

503
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I was afraid to take this

504
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
away from people.

505
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But how did you know?

506
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
How would I know?

507
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You don't have to tell Your Highness.

508
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
As long as you remember,

509
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I will not do anything to make you feel uncomfortable.

510
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
If you really want to harm me,

511
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
you can stop me

512
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
from knowing Ting Sheng's secret.

513
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
If you don't have someone like me,

514
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
we will be in a good mood

515
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
to deal with them.

516
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Prince Yu and Crown Prince are in a hurry.

517
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
What power do you have to deal with them?

518
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Since we have made it clear today,

519
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I hope that

520
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
you will have a firm trust in me.

521
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
But in this vast world,

522
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
the court and

523
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
many other officials,

524
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
they are not involved in the party.

525
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
For them,

526
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I ask you to...

527
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I will still use it.

528
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I will not hurt them.

529
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
The clouds are rising in the capital.

530
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Please make a decision.

531
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Thank you for your help.

532
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Please stop.

533
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Mr. Yan.

534
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Jingrui.

535
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The person who went there just now

536
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
was your brother Zhuo Qingyao, right?

537
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Impossible.

538
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
If Qingyao's brother went to the capital,

539
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
he would have been killed.

540
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
He would have been killed.

541
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He would have been killed.

542
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
If Qingyao's brother went to the capital,

543
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
wouldn't I know?

544
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Forget it. Let's go to the commander of the snow.

545
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I heard that he wants to buy a house.

546
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
He lives well. Why did he move out?

547
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Xia Dong is indeed the mayor of Xuanjing Temple.

548
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But in these days,

549
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
he has already checked the case of Duke Qing.

550
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
After he returns, Duke Qing

551
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
will be unable to get out of the prison.

552
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
If he can cut off Prince Yu's arm this time,

553
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
he will be able to get all the money from his father.

554
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I will do my best to deal with him.

555
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Duke Qing's case is successful.

556
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Although it's good,

557
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
but I was unable to find you

558
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
when Xia Dong found you.

559
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's all my fault.

560
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It's all my fault.

561
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I thought Xia Dong would only go to the Duke of Qing.

562
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I didn't expect him to investigate with Yuan Gao.

563
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Soon, we will find out

564
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
that our Tianquan Manor

565
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
is the one who escorted the old couple to the capital.

566
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's too late.

567
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
This matter

568
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
is really a bit troublesome.

569
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yue Fu,

570
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Prince Yu has been filial to you.

571
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
He has always thought you were loyal to each other.

572
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
You are not helping each other.

573
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Do you want to tell the details this time?

574
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
In case he...

575
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
No need.

576
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But this time,

577
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
we have leaked the information of the original report.

578
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
After Xia Dong returns to the capital,

579
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
you will not be able to keep the secret of the Duke of Qing.

580
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I said it.

581
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I don't understand.

582
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You haven't returned to the capital yet, have you?

583
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
What Yue Fu means is

584
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
that Xia Dong will not have the chance to return to the capital alive.

585
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Xia Dong found out the case

586
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
and got the evidence.

587
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Xuan Jing Si's actions are gone.

588
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
No matter who,

589
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
as long as the evidence and the case

590
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
are handed over to the imperial court,

591
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Duke of Qing cannot escape.

592
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
As for Xia Dong,

593
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
will he still come back?

594
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
What is the relationship between them?

595
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But because of this,

596
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
when the Duke of Qing was in the capital,

597
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
he was a big sin to the imperial court.

598
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Then let's see

599
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
who is the guilty one.

600
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Duke of Qing is the one who was the prince of the imperial court.

601
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
He is the one who was the emperor.

602
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Now His Majesty has personally checked

603
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Duke of Qing.

604
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
He dares to take advantage of Xuan Jing Si.

605
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Do you think

606
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Prince Yu can get rid of Gan Xi?

607
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Sister.

608
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
It's late.

609
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Are you still going to Prince Yu's mansion today?

610
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Sister.

611
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
When the Duke of Qing was in the capital,

612
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
he finally came back from Binzhou.

613
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I can't stand the case of Duke of Qing.

614
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But if you are the one who

615
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
is the one who is the guilty one,

616
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
then I will not be the one to blame.

617
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I will not be the one to blame.

618
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But if that person is the one who is the guilty one,

619
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
how will he be able to solve this?

620
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Father.

621
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You are looking for me?

622
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Sit down.

623
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Jingrui.

624
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Mr. Su.

625
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
How is it living in the Snow Tower?

626
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Brother Su said it's very good.

627
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
His Majesty thinks he is a guest.

628
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
He is also a guest in our mansion.

629
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You must take good care of him.

630
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But recently,

631
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Brother Su said he wanted to buy a house.

632
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
He can't live in the Snow Tower

633
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
for too long.

634
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
This person is indeed not as good as he is.

635
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
He won't live here for too long.

636
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
If he needs anything,

637
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
you must tell me.

638
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
We must do our best.

639
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Yes.

640
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Jingrui.

641
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Didn't you come out to relax?

642
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
What's wrong with you?

643
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Nothing.

644
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I just feel a little bit sad.

645
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I came back to the capital for two months.

646
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
How come I find out everything has changed?

647
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Brother Su has changed.

648
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Even my father has changed.

649
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Has your father changed?

650
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
He has been like that all the time.

651
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I am sorry.

652
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I am sorry.

653
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Is that so?

654
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
As for Brother Su,

655
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
it's hard to say.

656
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
He is a person who is not as good as he is.

657
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Although we are the noble master of the family,

658
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I think in his eyes,

659
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
we don't have the ability

660
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
to be real friends.

661
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The relationship between people

662
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
is just a cold-hearted person

663
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
who is more than a friend?

664
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You.

665
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Don't think so much.

666
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
It's useless to think about such things.

667
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Life is short.

668
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
We should have fun in time.

669
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Let's listen to the music later.

670
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I haven't been there for a long time.

671
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I think Miss Gongyu

672
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
must miss me a lot.

673
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I heard that Mr. Shi San

674
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
has also made a new arrangement.

675
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Let's go to the gallery tonight.

676
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
The first lady of the door of the door

677
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
is Yu Le.

678
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
The first lady of the door is

679
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Yu Le.

680
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The most exciting game on the line

681
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
is mahjong hula.

682
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Mahjong hula 2.

683
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
A reward queen,

684
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
money rich,

685
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
rich,

686
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
high-end,

687
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
high-grade,

688
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
rich,

689
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
a reward queen,

690
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
a reward queen,

691
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
how about the prize?

692
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Good.

693
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Master Yan asked me to accompany you.

694
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Can I not accompany you?

695
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But...

696
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
just use the light.

697
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
What do you, Lord Ye,

698
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
see at night?

699
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Who is it?

700
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Your Highness!

701
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Lord Guo, please get up.

702
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It's not that I won't help you.

703
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I've already helped those who should.

704
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
For this case,

705
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I've suppressed Zhou Fu and Du Tai.

706
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
The Ministry of Justice and the Court of Judicial Review

707
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
are more likely to protect you.

708
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
But you've got

709
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
two sources of evidence

710
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
from your own records.

711
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Your Highness,

712
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
you're all

713
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
the useless and useless

714
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
soldiers in the military.

715
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Who would have thought

716
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
that old man

717
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
would be a hero in the future?

718
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
There's still a chance

719
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
to stop the middle class.

720
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You've entered the Jiangzuo region.

721
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Where's the Jiangzuo Alliance?

722
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Enough.

723
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
The Jiangzuo Alliance always acts like this.

724
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's all because of your actions.

725
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
But who sent the report to the capital?

726
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Do we need to find out

727
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
what's going on?

728
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Is there any information?

729
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's not clear yet.

730
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Please wait a little longer.

731
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Do we need to find out?

732
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
After the report,

733
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
we've entered the Imperial Court of Judicial Review.

734
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Naturally,

735
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
it's the Eastern Palace's

736
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
who's the leader.

737
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I don't know if it's the Eastern Palace.

738
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
The problem is that the Crown Prince

739
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
has never heard of the Jianghu army.

740
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
If we don't find it out,

741
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
how can we rest assured?

742
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
But you've got

743
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
all the evidence.

744
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
We should still

745
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
put the case

746
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
under the case.

747
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You're capable of causing

748
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
even Xia Dong's own woman.

749
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You even have the face to say that

750
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
the army is your territory.

751
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
From the time he was born

752
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
to two months now,

753
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
what did Xia Dong find out?

754
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I don't know.

755
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
He has no evidence.

756
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I don't know where he is.

757
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
No matter where he is now,

758
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
he's far away from the capital.

759
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
He's not far away.

760
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It's Dong. Dong.

761
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Yujin, come here.

762
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Why are you still so afraid of him?

763
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You're already so old.

764
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
He won't be like you when you were little.

765
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Who said that?

766
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm the one who listens to Xia Dong's words.

767
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Come here.

768
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Dong.

769
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Didn't you go to Binzhou?

770
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Why are you back so soon?

771
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I thought you'd be here for at least half a year.

772
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I heard that you're going to Miaoyin's room again.

773
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
It's hard to believe that

774
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
that maid can be seen.

775
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Dong, you're so heavy.

776
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Help me to the coffin. Don't get hurt.

777
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Walk slowly.

778
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Don't be nervous.

779
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I haven't been to Miaoyin's room for a long time.

780
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Miss Gong Yu must miss me a lot.

781
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Are you okay?

782
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Can you still ride the horse?

783
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I can't ride it now.

784
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
What should I do?

785
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
If it doesn't work, they won't dare to come out.

786
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Dong.

787
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
There are two soldiers in the river and forest.

788
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Be careful.

789
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Let's go.

790
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Yun Feng,

791
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
the house of the Jin family has been arranged.

792
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Okay.

793
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
We must take the first step.

794
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yun Ji,

795
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
take Dong.

796
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Let's go.

797
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Let's stop them.

798
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Let's deal with this first.

799
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yes.

800
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Run.

801
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Dong.

802
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Dong.

803
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Dong, be careful.

804
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Dong.

805
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Dong.

806
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Dong.

807
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Dong.

808
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Thank you for coming here.

809
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I can't catch this bastard.

810
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
He is not so good at martial arts.

811
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
He is a good man.

812
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Let me see.

813
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Where is the poison you used to kill yourself?

814
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Miss Dong, you found the body in the ice-cream.

815
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Why do you make them jump?

816
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You sent a dead man to kill Xuan Jing Si's father.

817
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You are hiding behind the cliff.

818
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You don't know where to find it.

819
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Miss Dong.

820
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Jing Rui, Dong's investigation has its own way.

821
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
We can't get it.

822
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Tell me.

823
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Who sent you here?

824
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Prince Yu.

825
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I'm sorry.

826
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I'm sorry.

827
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I'm sorry.

828
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm sorry.

829
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I'm sorry.

830
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I'm sorry.

831
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I'm sorry.

832
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I'm sorry.

833
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm sorry.

834
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I'm sorry.

835
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I'm sorry.

836
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I'm sorry.

837
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I'm sorry.

838
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I'm sorry.

839
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I'm sorry.

840
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I'm sorry.

841
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I'm sorry.
