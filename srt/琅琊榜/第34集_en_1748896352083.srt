00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,000
According to Xia Dong's mood,

3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
he can't be disobeyed by his master anymore.

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
As long as he's done his duty,

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,500
we'll be half successful.

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Are you sure that Xia Dong will be back in the year?

7
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,000
He'll be back every year

8
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,000
on the mountain of the mountain near the capital,

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
General Nie Nie.

10
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Never cut off.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,500
I sent someone to investigate his recent visit.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,500
He'll be back in the capital in a few days.

13
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,500
So,

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
are you going to meet him yourself?

15
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Yes.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm afraid that others won't be able to tell him.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But I think

18
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,000
you're not good at it.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,500
What you mean is...

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,500
In Xia Dong's mind,

21
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,000
he's my master.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If you show up in front of him

23
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,500
with this identity,

24
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,000
you'll be in great danger.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,500
I'm afraid it's hard to make him happy.

26
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
After all,

27
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
he grew up in Xuanjing Temple.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He's used to being a bad person.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,500
If he goes to meet him,

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,500
I'm afraid that he'll be a party leader

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
who might not believe

32
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
that he's a true savior.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're right.

34
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm just a model of the wind and clouds.

35
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,000
If I can persuade him with my love,

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll be at least a few points.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,500
I'm just a lawyer.

38
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,000
I have no other choice.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You want to go there yourself?

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's right.

41
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
In the case 13 years ago,

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,500
Xia Dong lost his husband.

43
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,500
And I lost my brother and friend.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We both know the pain of each other.

45
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,000
In front of me,

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the old man in the police station,

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm sure that the senior officer

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and the outsider

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
will be more likely to be in a relationship

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
with him in the future.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
At least,

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Xia Dong won't suspect

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
that I saved Wei Zheng's sincerity.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're right.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll thank you for your hard work.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Thank you?

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're helping me.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why are you thanking me?

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Well...

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Well,

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
where's Fei Liu?

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Why didn't I see him?

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
One day,

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
he was in the city gate.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He must be Fei Liu.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He might be looking for a play in the backyard.

67
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Speaking of the play,

68
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Mr. Cheng Meng called for you.

69
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
The child is now in the police station.

70
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
He has already become a teacher.

71
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500
He will be going to the dormitory to live.

72
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,500
I just came to give him a few suggestions.

73
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
How can I dare to call him his teacher?

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,500
The first person to be called is Mr. Cheng Meng.

75
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
He is the first person to be called.

76
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
He is the first person to be called.

77
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
He is the first person to be called.

78
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
He is the first person to be called.

79
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
He is the first person to be called.

80
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
He is the first person to be called.

81
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
He is the first person to be called.

82
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
He is the first person to be called.

83
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
He is the first person to be called.

84
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
He is the first person to be called.

85
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
He is the first person to be called.

86
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
He is the first person to be called.

87
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
He is the first person to be called.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If you have a chance to repay me,

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
please join the Aom Shem Pu Jin Entertainment Center 94466.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Come.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't want to.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't want to.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Your Majesty,

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
last night,

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
the Crown Prince ordered to take a look at the stars on the stage.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The East and South side have the opportunity to see the children.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,500
The East Palace is in a meeting with Wei Yi.

98
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Although I am not kind,

99
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
the Heavens are like this.

100
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,500
It seems that I have learned this matter

101
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
years ago.

102
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,500
The Crown Prince is not good at the top of the world.

103
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
He is the Crown Prince who is the late King

104
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,500
who ordered to go to the Palace to see the stars in the past few days.

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
That's all.

106
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,500
I thank you, Father.

107
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,500
The Emperor has made an appointment with the Emperor

108
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,500
to invite the King of Jing to the Five Regions of the State of Xiao Jing Yan.

109
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,000
He is also involved in the construction of the palace.

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He has two royal beads and seven beads.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's all.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I thank you, Father.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What's wrong with you?

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I shouldn't have let you go to the Palace at the Five Regions.

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Although Father was jealous of him,

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
he didn't care about it.

117
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,500
He even didn't mention it in the future.

118
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Now, not only does he still have the royal beads

119
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,500
but he also has the royal beads that Xiao Jing Yan has made.

120
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,500
He even ordered me to prepare them for him.

121
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
He also asked him to bring the Crown Prince with him

122
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,500
to a double-dead memorial.

123
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
How could he do that?

124
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,500
I think that you don't need to be so angry.

125
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
If you are not angry, then you are happy.

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
If there is no Wei Zheng,

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
His Majesty's family's grace is to reward him for his merit.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It is a great favor.

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But now that Wei Zheng has such a big family,

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
His Majesty is still grateful to him.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I think that is a bit of warning.

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You mean

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Father's reputation is highly regarded by the Emperor's name.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It is to remind the King of Jing

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
that he has been working hard

136
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
to repay his kindness.

137
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Don't make a fool out of yourself.

138
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
I'm afraid that there is a reason for that.

139
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,500
This is not Father's heart.

140
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
He hopes that King of Jing can

141
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,500
not be too rash because of this.

142
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
But King of Jing's temper

143
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,500
can be smelled by two royal beads.

144
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,500
The higher the rank, the more important it is.

145
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Father's grace is to be still and to be humble.

146
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Then the anger of the Emperor

147
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,500
is of course not usual.

148
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Your Highness,

149
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
I just got news that

150
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,500
the little gold that used to help Xiao Xin escape from the palace

151
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
suddenly died of a disease.

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,500
He died?

153
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Noble Consort Wei sent someone yesterday to send her to the Inner Court.

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
She said that the lost hand had already pulled out of the palace and burned.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
How is Xiao Xin's illness?

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Xiao Xin is just a little cold.

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I will surely take good care of her.

160
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
You may leave first.

161
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Yes, Your Highness.

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Wait.

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Eat slowly. Don't get stuck.

164
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The tea flower pot?

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's not the tea flower pot. This is called the Taishi cake.

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Your Highness, Xia Dong has already entered the city.

167
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
If you insist,

168
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
do you still have doubts in your heart?

169
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If I fail this time,

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Jing Yan's future will also be over.

171
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
It was me who pushed her to the path of being the enemy.

172
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,000
But in this matter,

173
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,000
I couldn't convince her to make the right choice.

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,500
This is my fault for her.

175
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,000
What do you think about whether it's my fault?

176
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But what is the right choice?

177
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
When will you learn to be like them?

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I will ask some questions that I can't answer.

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If I am just a model, I can easily answer you.

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,500
But what is hidden in my heart

181
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,000
can never be erased.

182
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,000
In fact, it is more than anyone else.

183
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
The military's friendship is not that anyone else knows.

184
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
But Xia Jiang knows.

185
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,000
She has turned this friendship into a fatal move.

186
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,000
I know that I can be called a weapon,

187
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
but at the same time, I am also very stupid.

188
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,500
As the only model for Prince of Jing,

189
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
I should tell him

190
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,000
that if it's not for Li Wei,

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,500
the enemy will not have a back-up.

192
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
But I can't persuade her.

193
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,000
I can't persuade myself either.

194
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,000
No need.

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No need for anything?

196
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Anyway, no need.

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's not that we are not clever.

198
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Brother Su has thought too much.

199
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Whether it's right or wrong,

200
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
it's just a thought.

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,500
If it's really what you want to do,

202
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,000
then it's good to do it. Right?

203
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Yes.

204
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Don't eat too much.

205
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,000
It's a holiday today.

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There are dumplings tonight.

207
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Dumplings?

208
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hurry up!

209
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I'm hungry.

210
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
What time is it?

211
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,000
Your Majesty, it's already 7 p.m.

212
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Did you miss anything?

213
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,500
The 7th Palace, the State of Zheng,

214
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,000
the 6th Palace, and the Qinghe Palace.

215
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Thank you for your hard work this year.

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I will give the Qinghe Palace a full-fledged dance.

217
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yes.

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I will be in the middle of the school year-end.

219
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I will have a new year's note and a new book.

220
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Brother Su's clothes can't be cleaned anymore.

221
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,500
I will give the 6th Palace a full-fledged dance.

222
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Yes.

223
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Other local dishes?

224
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
There are...

225
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Please have some.

226
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes.

227
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Master is really diligent.

228
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
After the feast, he took the dishes from His Majesty and went back to practice.

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He really made us feel guilty.

230
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's true, too.

231
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Master said it was funny when he was here.

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
When he left, he went back to sleep.

233
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He took us to the big village and went back to sleep.

234
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He was so busy,

235
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
he was so busy that he went back to sleep.

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He was so busy that he went back to sleep.

237
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He was so busy that he went back to sleep.

238
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
We two men are going to spend the holiday here.

239
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Fortunately, I'm here.

240
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Let's go. I'll go with Brother Chun.

241
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Sure.

242
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,500
It's busy with work and there's no time to go down.

243
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
It's good.

244
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Brother Wei, I'll teach you a lesson.

245
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Please.

246
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Sister Loi,

247
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
it's too late.

248
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I won't be alone today.

249
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I promise, I promise, that I will bestow my youth to omega-3 too.

250
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
iv.

251
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'll bring you wine.

252
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Thank you, Madam.

253
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Come on.

254
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What's so good about it?

255
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's so good.

256
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Come on.

257
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Give me one.

258
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Give me one.

259
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Give me one.

260
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Be careful.

261
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Come on.

262
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Have some too.

263
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'll go check on the fire in the building.

264
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
When the lady gets back,

265
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
she can't cool down the fire.

266
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'll go.

267
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'll go.

268
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You were looking for the coolant.

269
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The lady told you not to serve in the night.

270
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You should rest well.

271
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't be so busy.

272
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I went to check on the fire

273
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
because I found the coolant.

274
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I only hope that

275
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I can go to the fire tomorrow morning

276
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
to give you some water.

277
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You should rest well.

278
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Don't worry.

279
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
We're here.

280
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll go.

281
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Come on.

282
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Sister.

283
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You're so smart.

284
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You're so smart.

285
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm a maid from the royal family.

286
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I joined the party in the night.

287
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So I can't stay too long.

288
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm alone in the palace.

289
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I can't see my sisters.

290
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's so easy to come.

291
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I can't even say a word.

292
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The guard asked you.

293
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Have you completed the arrangement?

294
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's not that hard.

295
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I've already completed it.

296
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Come on. Sit down, sister.

297
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I went to the palace that day.

298
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I felt sorry for her.

299
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
She told me everything.

300
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
She told me everything.

301
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
When she left,

302
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
she was so angry.

303
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If Mr. Su was there,

304
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm afraid he would turn around.

305
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I know.

306
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You just keep on the plan.

307
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You can observe the movements of the princesses.

308
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's the first time we're in a royal family.

309
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Don't worry, sister.

310
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'll do my best.

311
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What's wrong?

312
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You seem unhappy.

313
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Be careful.

314
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You're the youngest of the royal family.

315
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You were sent to the palace

316
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
since you were little.

317
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You never had the honor of being a master.

318
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You didn't have blood on your hands.

319
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So you're retreating.

320
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I advise you.

321
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
When you do something,

322
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
you can talk to me.

323
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's okay.

324
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Don't be too harsh.

325
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What do you mean?

326
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You taught me

327
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
as a daughter of the royal family,

328
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
to live for the country,

329
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
to die for the country.

330
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm not here now.

331
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But I've been

332
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
assigned to you by you and Xia Shouzun.

333
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
How can I tell you?

334
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You've been living in the palace for a long time.

335
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You don't know the nature of the situation.

336
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So you're so naive.

337
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I can't tell you

338
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
what I'm thinking.

339
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You'd better behave yourself.

340
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Master,

341
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
everything is ready.

342
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
There are few people

343
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
who can live safely

344
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
in this big night.

345
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You can move.

346
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yes.

347
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What's going on?

348
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Father,

349
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I've found out

350
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
that

351
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
not only the fire-hungry pearl

352
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
was stolen yesterday,

353
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
but also the treasure

354
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
in the other two officials' mansion.

355
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
The theft and the illegal

356
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
illegal activities

357
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
in the Pacific Ocean are the same.

358
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's rare to see

359
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
these bandits enter the capital.

360
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The guards in the patrol room

361
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
are not well.

362
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm sorry.

363
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Please rest assured.

364
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'll do my best

365
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
to make sure the criminals are safe.

366
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Get up.

367
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Thank you, father.

368
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The bandits are in the capital.

369
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I can't say it's all your fault.

370
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But now the case is solved.

371
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You can't let it go.

372
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You're always doing your best.

373
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'll

374
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
do my best to make it up to you.

375
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You've worked hard

376
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
under the age of your father.

377
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'll do as you say.

378
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Go.

379
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Master,

380
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
to catch some bandits,

381
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
the military camp is not just a court.

382
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's also full of spies.

383
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Wei Ming is too little to be a big deal.

384
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He said it's full of spies.

385
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But most of the soldiers

386
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
are not at the gate of Xuanjing Temple.

387
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
And they are

388
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
the first and most important

389
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
to be able to catch the bandits.

390
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The king is smart.

391
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
The king is smart.

392
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But the king is so arrogant.

393
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
He's so arrogant.

394
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Is he really going to do something?

395
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
He's too anxious.

396
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
He doesn't even want to wait for the year.

397
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm afraid he won't move.

398
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'll be relieved

399
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
if he moves.

400
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Xiao Jingyan,

401
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
don't think about getting my palm out.

402
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Close the door.

403
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Get up.

404
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
In all the palaces this year,

405
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
except for the empress,

406
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
no one else is as much as our Empress.

407
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Your Majesty, you're so kind.

408
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Yes. Just now,

409
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
the water was almost running out on the emperor's face.

410
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Your Highness, Prince Jing came just now.

411
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
He said that His Majesty had arranged

412
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
an important business.

413
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
He waited for you to come out of the door

414
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
and made three heads.

415
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
He's been paying you 30 years.

416
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
This child.

417
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
He's got things to do.

418
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
He's not that smart.

419
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Prince Jing is so filial to us.

420
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Your Highness,

421
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
if you need anything,

422
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'll arrange it.

423
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I'm a little sleepy.

424
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I want to rest for a while.

425
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yes.

426
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Your Highness,

427
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
please save the favor.

428
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
This is a big year.

429
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You can all go.

430
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I don't need your support.

431
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yes.

432
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Your Highness,

433
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
please save the favor.

434
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Your Highness,

435
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
please save the favor.

436
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Emort Pixie.

437
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Emortamos.

438
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
At least I haven't worn a rider skirt

439
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
yet.

440
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
sua sosa.

441
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
One can tell

442
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,540
from one's own well-being.

443
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,460
something risky.

444
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,800
I hope

445
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,580
you protect her.

446
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,540
Why didn't you move?

447
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,540
Did you really fall asleep?

448
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,540
I heard that you saved him this time.

449
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,540
What a coincidence!

450
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,540
If it weren't for me,

451
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,540
Qiu Xun Wei might not have been able to catch him.

452
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,540
Mr. Su.

453
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,540
Greetings, Marquis.

454
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,540
I'm afraid that Mr. Su didn't come to pay me a visit

455
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,540
when he was a young man.

456
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,540
You're a kind person.

457
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,540
I've gone to the door to see the mountain.

458
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,540
I have something to ask you and Yu Jing for help.

459
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,540
Me?

460
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,540
I have something to ask you.

461
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,540
I want to ask you about the most important thing.

462
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,540
Mr. Su.

463
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,540
Please come in.

464
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,540
Your Highness, you've only been sleeping for half an hour.

465
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,540
Can you solve the problem?

466
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,540
Although I'm sleepy,

467
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,540
I don't dare to sleep more.

468
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,540
I'm afraid that I'll be out of trouble in the night.

469
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,540
This is the new one from the Inner Court.

470
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,540
Your Highness, what do you think?

471
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,540
I'm getting old.

472
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,540
I'll change my clothes.

473
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,540
Your Highness, you're well-groomed.

474
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,540
How can you tell that you have Prince Jing's son?

475
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,540
Save your mouth.

476
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,540
You should wear that.

477
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,540
Yes, Your Highness.

478
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,540
I saw Consort Hui's face in the Zhengyang Palace today.

479
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,540
I'll get the new one and put it on.

480
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,540
Then I'll choose a simple one to dress up.

481
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,540
I'll go and see it later.

482
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,540
Yes, Your Highness.

483
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,540
What's wrong?

484
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,540
You haven't recovered yet?

485
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,540
I've been feeling well this morning.

486
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,540
I came to serve you.

487
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,540
I don't know what's wrong with this.

488
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,540
Sometimes, it's normal to go to the hospital.

489
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,540
Sometimes, it's normal to go to the hospital.

490
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,540
You can stay at home.

491
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,540
It's the same for me and Xiao Li.

492
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,540
I'll go with you.

493
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,540
You're the same.

494
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,540
Yes, Your Highness.

495
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,540
Your Highness, isn't it a bit too far?

496
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,540
It's not far.

497
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,540
I'll just walk around.

498
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,540
Your Highness.

499
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,540
Your Highness.

500
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,540
Your Highness.

501
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,540
Your Highness.

502
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,540
Your Highness.

503
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,540
Your Highness.

504
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,540
Your Highness.

505
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,540
Your Highness.

506
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,540
Your Highness.

507
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,540
Your Highness.

508
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,540
Your Highness.

509
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,540
Your Highness.

510
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,540
Consort Hui, don't be too polite.

511
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,540
I'm sorry to bother you to come in person.

512
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,540
I've seen Consort Jing.

513
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,540
If I knew that Jing Ting was here,

514
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,540
I'd have to wait for another hour.

515
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,540
So that you can have a good talk.

516
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,540
Sister, where are you from?

517
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,540
I've been living in this palace for a long time.

518
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,540
I've been walking for a long time.

519
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,540
I've been waiting for you.

520
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,540
Come.

521
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:20,540
Sister, this is the nightgown I made.

522
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,540
I used it for my birthday.

523
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,540
I'm a little bit tired.

524
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
I'm going to go to the toilet.

525
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,540
I'm going to go to the toilet.

526
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,540
I'm going to go to the toilet.

527
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,540
I'm going to go to the toilet.

528
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,540
I'm going to go to the toilet.

529
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,540
I'm going to go to the toilet.

530
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,540
I'm going to go to the toilet.

531
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,540
I'm going to go to the toilet.

532
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,540
I'm going to go to the toilet.

533
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,540
I'm going to go to the toilet.

534
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,540
I'm going to go to the toilet.

535
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,540
I'm going to go to the toilet.

536
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,540
I'm going to go to the toilet.

537
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,540
You're a little bit more gentle.

538
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,540
Thank you for your good news.

539
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,540
I've been feeling a little bit upset all night.

540
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,540
The imperial physician has gone and treated me for several times.

541
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,540
I can't even cure my illness.

542
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,540
The empress knows that I'm in a panic.

543
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,540
I can't do anything about this.

544
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,540
I just need to work with you.

545
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,540
Thank you for your good news.

546
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,540
The empress is really bullying my mother.

547
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,540
Shut up.

548
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,540
What nonsense are you talking about in front of Consort Jing?

549
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,540
Sister, don't blame her.

550
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,540
This child is hurting me.

551
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,540
Jingting is a filial child.

552
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,540
But the empress is the empress after all.

553
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,540
If she is gentle and calm,

554
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,540
she is our blessing.

555
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,540
If she is a miracle,

556
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,540
we can't complain.

557
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,540
We should be able to feel at ease.

558
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,540
Many things

559
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,540
make me feel troubled.

560
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,540
After that,

561
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,540
what else do you want to say?

562
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,540
Sister,

563
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,540
what I envy most about you

564
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,540
is your mood.

565
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,540
No matter what you do,

566
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,540
you can always be very calm.

567
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,540
Unlike me.

568
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,540
When Consort Jingting's father died,

569
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,540
I was in a panic.

570
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,540
Later, His Majesty was unable to give her a proper treatment.

571
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,540
But I was in a panic again.

572
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,540
Later, I was in a panic

573
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,540
because of the Princess of the Southern Chu.

574
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,540
You said that this princess of the Yi State

575
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,540
was a blessing or a goods?

576
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,540
Didn't I tell my mother

577
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,540
not to worry about me?

578
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,540
I heard that you are in a good mood.

579
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,540
When the empress is over,

580
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,540
the Princess of the Southern Chu is in the door.

581
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,540
I think you are still worried about something.

582
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,540
Of course, I am worried about my grandson.

583
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,540
His Majesty is a prince.

584
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,540
Look at the prince of the Ninth Prince.

585
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,540
He is already twelve years old.

586
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,540
But why is he so difficult to handle?

587
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,540
Only one of them is Jingxuan.

588
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,540
Only one of them is Jinghuan and Jinglin.

589
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,540
Six of them are two.

590
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,540
But there are no other half.

591
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,540
The grandson is a god.

592
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,540
It's useless to be anxious.

593
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,540
Look, our Jingyan

594
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,540
has no daughter of the Yi State.

595
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,540
I don't want to talk about her.

596
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,540
Jingyan's family is only a concubine.

597
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,540
She used to be in the capital for a long time.

598
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,540
She is now a servant.

599
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,540
His Majesty is now in the capital for a long time.

600
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,540
She is still young.

601
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,540
She will be sadder when the empress is over.

602
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,540
Let's wait and see.

603
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,540
That's great.

604
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,540
You are so good.

605
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,540
I forgot something.

606
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,540
I always thought

607
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,540
I would thank you for your servant.

608
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,540
You are so good.

609
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,540
You deserve to be a concubine.

610
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,540
She is a concubine called Xiaoqing.

611
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,540
She is...

612
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,540
Xiaoqing.

613
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,540
Are you still feeling unwell?

614
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,540
Xiaoying, I'm fine.

615
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,540
I just have a headache.

616
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,540
If you feel unwell, you should go to bed.

617
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,540
We will serve you when you come back.

618
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,540
Father, it's not easy to get rid of Mr. Su.

619
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,540
Why are you so quick to agree?

620
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,540
It's not just a promise.

621
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,540
I really want to help him

622
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,540
to do this.

623
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,540
I don't understand.

624
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,540
That's because you know

625
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,540
I never like to fight.

626
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,540
Father said that fighting is too ugly.

627
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,540
Even if you agree to help Prince Jing,

628
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,540
it's also a sin to do things you want to do.

629
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,540
But why this time...

630
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,540
This time, it's different from the past.

631
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,540
Actually, I don't like

632
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,540
Mei Changsu.

633
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,540
He is a coward.

634
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,540
He is so cruel.

635
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,540
He is sitting in front of me.

636
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,540
I can't see him clearly.

637
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,540
But this time, I am helping him.

638
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,540
I am sincere.

639
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,540
No matter what price I pay,

640
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,540
I will not give up.

641
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,540
Why?

642
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,540
Because he and Prince Jing

643
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,540
made me fight.

644
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,540
Fight?

645
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,540
It's obvious that it's a trap.

646
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,540
It's a tiger's blood.

647
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,540
But it still needs to be broken.

648
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,540
Li Bi De is so obvious.

649
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,540
But he still needs to be saved.

650
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,540
He is so stupid.

651
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,540
But he has such a coward.

652
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,540
I haven't seen him for a long time.

653
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,540
If I don't help them this time,

654
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,540
what will I have to face

655
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,540
with those scoundrels?

656
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,540
Don't worry, father.

657
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,540
I am a man of words.

658
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,540
I know what is true.

659
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,540
What is true.

660
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,540
I know nothing about you

661
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,540
just like you.

662
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,540
But I can do everything for you.

663
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,540
It means he has his own way.

664
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,540
It's a long story.

665
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,540
Prince Jing and Consort Chen

666
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,540
were close friends.

667
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,540
Prince Jing followed Prince Qi since he was young.

668
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,540
He was the ruler of the country.

669
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,540
He was loyal to Prince Qi.

670
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,540
I am worried about him.

671
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,540
But he is different from Prince Qi.

672
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,540
He has more sense of justice.

673
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,540
And he has less sense of freedom.

674
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,540
As for Prince Qi,

675
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,540
you may not remember him.

676
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,540
His smile and smile

677
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,540
are all the same as his mother's.

678
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,540
When he was young,

679
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,540
how many people were there?

680
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,540
Father, what about me?

681
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,540
Am I like my mother?

682
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,540
As for you,

683
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,540
you are like me.

684
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,540
But when you were young,

685
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,540
I didn't want you to be like me.

686
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,540
Actually,

687
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,540
I didn't forget

688
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,540
Consort Ling, Consort Chen,

689
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,540
Prince Qi.

690
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,540
I remember all these things.

691
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,540
Really?

692
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,540
What else can I remember?

693
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,540
What else can I remember?

694
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,540
Prince Qi is very patient with our children.

695
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,540
He answers every question he asks.

696
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,540
When we went out to ride the rides,

697
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,540
he took care of us very well.

698
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,540
Unlike Brother Lin Shu.

699
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,540
Brother Lin Shu is the most impatient.

700
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,540
He is from the Wumen family.

701
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,540
He will be more patient.

702
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,540
Brother Lin Shu is very patient with us.

703
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,540
He thinks we are stupid.

704
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,540
He likes him the most.

705
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,540
He always follows me.

706
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,540
I remember the most about this situation.

707
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,540
Little Uncle.

708
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,540
He was only 19 years old that year.

709
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,540
He was the one who made people think

710
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,540
he was the most patient.

711
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,540
What's the matter?

712
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,540
Prince Yu has told me.

713
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,540
If it's not important,

714
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,540
you'd better not come to this palace.

715
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,540
I'm here.

716
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,540
It's a big matter.

717
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,540
Then tell me.

718
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,540
How can you stand here

719
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,540
and tell me anything?

720
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,540
Then come with me.

721
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,540
I'm sorry.

722
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,540
I'm sorry.

723
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,540
I'm sorry.

724
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,540
I'm sorry.

725
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,540
I'm sorry.

726
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,540
I'm sorry.

727
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,540
I'm sorry.

728
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,540
I'm sorry.

729
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,540
I'm sorry.

730
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,540
I'm sorry.

731
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,540
I'm sorry.

732
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,540
I'm sorry.

733
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,540
I'm sorry.

734
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,540
I'm sorry.

735
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,540
I'm sorry.

736
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,540
I'm sorry.

737
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,540
I'm sorry.

738
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,540
I'm sorry.
