00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,000
This book, I borrowed it for two days.

3
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,600
It's just a mail.

4
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,640
If you like it,

5
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,800
take it and read it.

6
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Uncle.

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Is there any problem with that book?

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No.

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No?

10
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then what's your problem?

11
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The notes and contents of the notes used by the writer are all fine.

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What's this?

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What's this?

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I've solved the writing two times.

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I've written a letter and used it to avoid the misunderstanding.

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Avoid the misunderstanding?

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Not two words.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The names of the late mother are the same as the names of the books.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
When I'm in a hurry,

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll use the previous one to write two letters.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll use the name of the mother.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Is that really important?

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There should be no problem.

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Jin Yan doesn't know what my mother's name is.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Those two letters are not common.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Even if it's in the past,

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
she never realized that I've hidden these two letters.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Maybe she didn't notice it at all.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But...

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
why are you so nervous?

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't know

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
how many traces of the past are in the book.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I was so nervous just now.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Suddenly, I realized

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
that Jin Yan couldn't see it at all.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I think

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Prince Jin also thinks

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
you've lost your mind.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He's not worried about it.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't worry.

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's just a small matter.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's really a small matter.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Brother Meng,

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
if anything happens

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
in the Liyang Palace,

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
please tell me right away.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What have you done?

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Even if you're a fool,

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
you can't do this.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It was a innocent person,

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
but because of me...

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Little book?

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If you say that again,

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll be really angry.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're the one who has lost your mind.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're the one who has lost your mind.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You've lost your mind.

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You're the one who has lost your mind.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Go down first.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,780
You come out,

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's share the おかない的

65
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,720
报复机会多多

66
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,760
赶紧加入

67
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,940
澳门先普京娱乐场994466

68
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,920
Come!!

69
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,560
瀟公主

70
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,260
男厨的使团已经离开京城了

71
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,260
They're also worried that you're left here alone.

72
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,260
What about my brother?

73
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:07,260
You know, if I stick to you, you can't stay here.

74
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,260
I know.

75
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,260
Then how dare you show up in front of me?

76
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,260
Father said that you're a good person.

77
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,260
I've always wanted you to take Jingrui away.

78
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
Do you know why?

79
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,260
I know my son.

80
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,260
He's a kind person who's kind and loyal.

81
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,260
This thing is more important than what you think.

82
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,260
He's calm on the surface.

83
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,260
But his inner pain is not something that can be healed.

84
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:21,260
He needs time to slowly accept it little by little.

85
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,260
I hope I can spend this time with him.

86
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,260
I don't want him to go to a strange place so soon.

87
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,260
I want to see a strange father.

88
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,260
We'll treat my brother well.

89
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,260
We'll treat him very well.

90
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,260
Sister, look.

91
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
Do you know where this is?

92
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,260
It's like a back door of a rich man.

93
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,260
It's not a high-ranking official's home.

94
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,260
It's a white dress that is worthless.

95
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,260
He bought this house for only half a year.

96
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,260
But now, as long as he's in the capital and mentioned Suzai,

97
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,260
no one knows about it.

98
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,260
You're so curious about me.

99
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
What kind of person is a wonderful person?

100
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,260
He's in the capital of the world.

101
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,260
Since this Mei is the princess,

102
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,260
she's also the mastermind of Prince Yu.

103
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,260
What's the conflict between her and you?

104
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,260
You asked me to break her down.

105
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,260
Do you want to know something?

106
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,260
Please, Sister.

107
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,260
Actually, the person I asked to break her down is not her.

108
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,260
This senior officer is very difficult to deal with.

109
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,260
He's not the one who can do anything.

110
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
Then you asked me to come here.

111
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
Please, Sister.

112
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,260
Sister, look.

113
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,260
Have a look.

114
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,260
Is it clear?

115
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,260
It's him.

116
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,260
The man you said to give the dishes.

117
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,260
Is this person strange?

118
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,260
Such a big house.

119
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,260
The person who gave the dishes, water and fruits.

120
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,260
Isn't it always the same?

121
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,260
This person is called Tong Lu.

122
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,260
I have several eyes that have been broken.

123
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,260
There are a lot or less of them.

124
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,260
It's related to him.

125
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,260
Sister, think about it.

126
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,260
Even if he's met with the hero,

127
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,260
he can't be the one who can save me.

128
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,260
The recent situation in the capital is like this.

129
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,260
Okay.

130
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,260
You go tell Mr. Thirteen.

131
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,260
If Qin Ban Ruo's vitality is hurt,

132
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,260
but his strength is still there,

133
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,260
the eyes that his master left for him,

134
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,260
it's definitely not these.

135
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,260
Don't be careless.

136
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,260
Yes, Chief.

137
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,260
Anything else?

138
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,260
There's another news.

139
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,260
I heard that Young Master Xiao

140
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,260
is going to go to the south.

141
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,260
When?

142
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,260
Today.

143
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,260
I see. You go.

144
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,260
Besides, he's a seller.

145
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,260
He lives in a broken yard.

146
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,260
He's obviously a small man with a small background.

147
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,260
But even Uncle Qian

148
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,260
can't find out more about him.

149
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,260
And he's usually in a few places

150
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,260
that he's been to.

151
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,260
There's also Su Zhai.

152
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,260
I'm thinking about how he can make me feel less nervous.

153
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,260
Are you sure that Su Zhai and Hong Xiu Zhao

154
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,260
are in a relationship

155
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,260
because of the failure?

156
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,260
Uncle Qian said that Su Zhai

157
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,260
is like a common surface.

158
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,260
The internal and internal problems

159
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,260
can't be solved at all.

160
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,260
If he can get into the fight,

161
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,260
why would I have to think about you?

162
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,260
You suspect that this fellow

163
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,260
is the one who was under Mei Chang Su's control.

164
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,260
And your crisis at present

165
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,260
is caused by Mei Chang Su.

166
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,260
Uncle Qian, I'm leaving.

167
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,260
Thank you for your hard work.

168
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,260
I'll be right back.

169
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,260
I'm leaving.

170
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,260
I've always felt strange.

171
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,260
After the prince of Qi Lin's son

172
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,260
entered the jade palace,

173
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,260
there were indeed a lot of strange things.

174
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,260
The holy fruit of the jade emperor's memory

175
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,260
was mostly his merit.

176
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,260
But why was he so careless

177
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,260
in his own work?

178
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,260
The grace of the jade emperor

179
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,260
was not as good as before.

180
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,260
How could it be?

181
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,260
How could it be?

182
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,260
I heard that the jade emperor

183
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,260
was very strict in court recently.

184
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,260
Even the crown prince

185
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,260
was suppressed by him.

186
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,260
Before Mei Chang Su entered the jade emperor's palace,

187
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,260
the jade emperor had

188
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,260
two major central departments,

189
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,260
the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Revenue.

190
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,260
The emperor had the Qing State Palace.

191
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
But what does he have now?

192
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Two hands in the air.

193
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,260
A fake one, right?

194
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,260
The so-called imperial court is a threat.

195
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,260
It's just that the crown prince's position

196
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,260
was reversed.

197
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,260
The details are investigated.

198
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,260
There is no trace of a fake.

199
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,260
The person who won the jade emperor's name

200
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,260
can win the world.

201
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,260
Is it really that easy?

202
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,260
You can tell Prince Yu about this.

203
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,260
Prince Yu?

204
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,260
Since I made a mistake,

205
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,260
Prince Yu has already been very trusted.

206
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,260
Besides,

207
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,260
this Mr. Su is really too powerful.

208
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,260
Prince Yu's roots are clinging to each other.

209
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,260
He is only an outsider.

210
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,260
No one can push responsibility towards him.

211
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,260
Think about it.

212
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,260
If I say so,

213
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,260
will Prince Yu believe me?

214
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,260
Even if Prince Yu is suspicious,

215
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,260
he can't bear to ask questions.

216
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,260
With Mei Chang Su's strange plan,

217
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,260
I'm afraid that I can't be patient

218
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,260
and I will be burned to death.

219
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,260
Is it because Mr. Su is like you

220
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,260
and he doesn't want to help anyone?

221
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,260
It's for the good news of the Jiao Luan capital.

222
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,260
Please come in.

223
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,260
I'll take care of it.

224
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,260
Okay.

225
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,260
I can't guess.

226
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,260
It's not a good idea to guess.

227
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,260
Fourth Sister,

228
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,260
I know the same path.

229
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,260
I know the only place I can't get through.

230
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,260
I hope you can help me this time.

231
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,260
Fourth Sister,

232
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,260
if you can do it this time,

233
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,260
I will be more than happy to see you.

234
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,260
I will not let you down.

235
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,260
If I can't make it,

236
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,260
Fourth Sister,

237
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,260
Tong Lu is not a person who can't deal with you.

238
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,260
With your ability,

239
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,260
even if he has a kind heart,

240
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,260
you will be the one to be the one to be.

241
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,260
I'm not like the past.

242
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,260
But we have the same door.

243
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,260
We can't fight back.

244
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,260
I'll help you one last time.

245
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,260
If I can't think for you,

246
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,260
I'll have to think about it.

247
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,260
Thank you, Fourth Sister.

248
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,260
Mother,

249
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,260
take care.

250
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,260
Second Brother,

251
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,260
you'll have a hard time at home.

252
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,260
Don't worry, Brother.

253
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,260
I'll take care of mother.

254
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,260
If you have anything else to do,

255
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,260
remember that

256
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,260
the family is waiting for you.

257
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,260
Let's go.

258
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,260
Let's go.

259
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,260
The day that you said goodbye to the Princess,

260
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,260
it was here.

261
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
Yes.

262
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,260
I think that you're challenging me.

263
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,260
It's also here.

264
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,260
Now that I think about it,

265
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,260
what if it's a lie?

266
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,260
Brother.

267
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,260
Let's go.

268
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,260
Let's go.

269
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,260
Let's go.

270
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,260
Chief.

271
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,260
They're here.

272
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,260
Jingrui.

273
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,260
Jingrui.

274
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,260
It's Yan Gong.

275
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,260
It's Yan Gong.

276
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,260
It's Yan Gong.

277
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,260
Jingrui.

278
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,260
Brother, let's go.

279
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,260
Jingrui.

280
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,260
Jingrui, where are you going?

281
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,260
To the south.

282
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,260
To the capital.

283
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,260
Why go to the south?

284
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,260
You're from Daliang.

285
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
You grew up in the capital.

286
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,260
I'm not going with you.

287
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,260
Yuji.

288
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,260
Niannian received a letter.

289
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,260
She said her father was ill.

290
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,260
So she wanted to see me.

291
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,260
I've already allowed her.

292
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,260
So I should go to visit her.

293
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,260
That's it.

294
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,260
I thought...

295
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,260
What do you think?

296
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,260
I thought you were unhappy in Jinling.

297
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,260
You wanted to leave me.

298
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,260
You really just went to visit her.

299
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,260
You're not coming back, are you?

300
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,260
I'm still here.

301
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,260
I'm not coming back.

302
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,260
Jingrui, actually,

303
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,260
I've been thinking about talking to you.

304
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,260
But you've been in a bad mood.

305
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,260
You were in a bad mood.

306
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
Jingrui,

307
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,260
there are some things

308
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,260
that you should not care too much.

309
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,260
The grudge you were given last time

310
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,260
has nothing to do with you.

311
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,260
Yuji, stop it.

312
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,260
I know what you mean.

313
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,260
But how can you say that it has nothing to do with me?

314
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,260
My father, mother,

315
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,260
and my brother and sister

316
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,260
are all related to each other.

317
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,260
Besides, there are many years of friendship

318
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,260
and grudges.

319
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,260
It's not like

320
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,260
you can leave everything

321
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,260
and reveal the truth.

322
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,260
If you say so, I understand.

323
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,260
I understand.

324
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,260
You want to persuade me to be more open.

325
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,260
You want me to be

326
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,260
the Xiao Jingrui I used to be.

327
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,260
I know what you mean.

328
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,260
But Yuji,

329
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,260
it's really hard to do.

330
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,260
Just now,

331
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,260
the people around you and your wife

332
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,260
have changed.

333
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,260
Can I not change?

334
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,260
What if I do?

335
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,260
We have been changing.

336
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,260
If...

337
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,260
If you can't go back to the past,

338
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,260
it's okay.

339
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,260
Jingrui,

340
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,260
I just hope that our friendship won't change.

341
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,260
When you just learned to walk,

342
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,260
I knew you.

343
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
So you listen to me.

344
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,260
You must not forget that I am your friend.

345
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Do you remember?

346
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,260
I remember.

347
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,260
But when I saw you walking,

348
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,260
you wouldn't turn around.

349
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,260
Are you sure you already knew me?

350
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,260
How many friends do you have?

351
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,260
Age, house,

352
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
house,

353
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,260
and the same.

354
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,260
I could have known you for a lifetime.

355
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,260
But who would have thought that I would change?

356
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,260
From now on,

357
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
I can only watch the world

358
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
grow.

359
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,260
Good friends don't care about the distance.

360
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,260
Good friends are good friends.

361
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,260
Princess, Prince Jing is always like this.

362
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
You are the only one who can't get away from me.

363
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,260
You have to stay away from me.

364
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,260
Take care of yourself.

365
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
Take care of yourself.

366
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
When you miss me,

367
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,260
write to me.

368
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,260
I will.

369
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,260
You have a brother like Jingrui.

370
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,260
You are really lucky.

371
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,260
Take good care of him.

372
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,260
Okay.

373
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,260
Okay.

374
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,260
You can go on the horse.

375
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,260
I will watch you walk.

376
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,260
Mr. Su.

377
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,260
I didn't expect you would come.

378
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,260
Jingrui,

379
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,260
I am sorry.

380
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,260
I can blame Mr. Su for something.

381
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,260
My mother's past

382
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,260
is not because of you.

383
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,260
My birth is not because of you.

384
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,260
Xie Hou's ungrateful deeds

385
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,260
are all his own.

386
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,260
You didn't use the plan

387
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,260
to kill him.

388
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,260
It's not his own doing.

389
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,260
You didn't use the plan.

390
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,260
I hate you, right?

391
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,260
You are just a hand

392
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,260
to open the truth.

393
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,260
What really makes me heartless

394
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,260
is the truth.

395
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,260
I won't be angry with you.

396
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
But I made

397
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,260
the thing that happened that night.

398
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,260
I used the most cruel way

399
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,260
to reveal the truth

400
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,260
without worrying about your feelings

401
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,260
and our friendship.

402
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,260
Yes.

403
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,260
I was very sad

404
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,260
because of you.

405
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,260
But I am no longer

406
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,260
a child who thinks I am.

407
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,260
I understand.

408
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,260
People always have to take responsibility.

409
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,260
You took the important thing

410
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,260
and abandoned me.

411
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,260
It's just your choice.

412
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,260
If I was not chosen

413
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260
because of you,

414
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,260
I would be so sorry.

415
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,260
But there are

416
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
too many things

417
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,260
that can't be forgiven.

418
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,260
After all, no one has the right

419
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,260
to take responsibility for me

420
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
and take me as their savior.

421
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,260
No matter what I hope for,

422
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,260
I can't force it.

423
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,260
Jingrui,

424
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,260
since we met,

425
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,260
you have been so loyal to me.

426
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,260
But...

427
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,260
But I am so loyal to you.

428
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,260
The reason I am so loyal to you

429
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,260
is because I am willing

430
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,260
to return the same sincerity

431
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,260
to you.

432
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,260
If I am not,

433
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,260
I will not regret it.

434
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,260
Thank you for sending me off.

435
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,260
I am leaving.

436
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,260
Jingrui.

437
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,260
Although there is

438
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,260
little fairness in the world,

439
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,260
I hope you can always

440
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,260
keep this loyalty.

441
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,260
Jingrui is really the most

442
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,260
tolerant child I have ever seen.

443
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,260
The last time I gave her

444
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,260
a generous and ungrateful love,

445
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,260
maybe it was because

446
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,260
she was in pain.

447
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,260
The South is not a capital city.

448
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,260
Pass my order

449
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,260
to follow Zhu Chen.

450
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,260
Try to take Jingrui down.

451
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,260
Yes.

452
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,260
Chief,

453
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,260
it's a big day.

454
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,260
Let's go back as well.

455
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,260
Your Highness.

456
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,260
Yes.

457
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,260
It's been so long.

458
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,260
I have to go now.

459
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,260
I will be back soon.

460
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,260
I will see you around.

461
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,260
I will be back soon.

462
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,260
Bye.

463
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,260
Your Highness.

464
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,260
I am really sorry

465
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,260
for the trouble you have caused.

466
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,260
It's okay.

467
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,260
I will take care of it.

468
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,260
You are right.

469
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,260
I have to go.

470
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,260
I will see you around.

471
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,260
Okay.

472
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,260
I will see you around.

473
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,260
I have something to do with you.

474
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,260
Okay.

475
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,260
There is a wonderful place

476
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,260
to visit.

477
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,260
Do you see it?

478
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,260
Your Highness, please come this way.

479
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,260
You can go this way.

480
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,260
Wonderful.

481
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,260
It's really wonderful.

482
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,260
From here,

483
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,260
it's a good idea to have a good harvest.

484
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,260
This Taihu stone

485
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,140
can be used as a

486
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,260
father's birthday gift.

487
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,260
It's really good.

488
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,260
I dare not say anything else.

489
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,260
I have never crossed the Eastern Palace.

490
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,260
What are you going to do

491
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,260
with the gift prepared by the Eastern Palace?

492
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,260
Have you made it clear?

493
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
Yes.

494
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,260
It's a wonderful place.

495
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,260
It's a great place

496
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,260
with a great scenery.

497
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,260
Although it's a wonderful place,

498
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,260
the scenery is wonderful.

499
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,260
It's just a bit of a shame.

500
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,260
Where is Prince Jing?

501
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,260
Prince Jing?

502
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,260
Is it possible

503
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
that you have never thought

504
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,260
of going to visit Prince Jing?

505
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,260
Your Highness, you know

506
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,260
Prince Jing has always been kind to me.

507
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,260
He is very kind.

508
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,260
There is nothing

509
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,260
to be proud of.

510
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,260
I'm sure he is not generous.

511
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
He is just like the past.

512
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,260
He is just a little bit

513
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,260
of a fool.

514
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,260
Like the past?

515
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,260
Prince Jing has been with me for more than ten years.

516
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,260
You are so good at writing.

517
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,260
Why do you keep your eyes on him?

518
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,260
You have a good eye.

519
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
Look closely.

520
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,260
Prince Jing can still be like the past this year.

521
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,260
How is that possible?

522
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,260
I have lost my mind.

523
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,260
I will send someone to find out.

524
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,260
Prince Jing is really a good worker.

525
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,260
Chief, Prince Jing is a good worker.

526
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,260
Prince Jing is preparing this palace

527
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,260
for Prince Jing, right?

528
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,260
This is a gift I picked for His Majesty.

529
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,260
For His Majesty?

530
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,260
As far as I know,

531
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,260
His Majesty is a bit of a warrior.

532
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,260
But

533
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,260
I haven't heard

534
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,260
that he is also a good worker.

535
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,260
I don't think he likes it.

536
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
Since he doesn't like it,

537
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,260
why should he give it to him?

538
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,260
Shouldn't he give it to him

539
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,260
to make a name for himself?

540
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,260
He should make a name for himself.

541
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,260
But he is a cold-blooded prince.

542
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,260
Where does he get the money

543
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,260
to find out His Majesty's name?

544
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,260
Well,

545
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,260
it's over if he gives it to him.

546
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,260
This palace

547
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,260
is a palace

548
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,260
that you sent someone to choose from.

549
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,260
It's good for Prince Jing.

550
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
If he gives anything to Prince Jing

551
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,260
in the past,

552
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,260
it's fine.

553
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,260
But this year,

554
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,260
His Majesty is obviously

555
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,260
more grateful to Prince Jing.

556
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,260
If he doesn't say anything,

557
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,260
it's a big mistake.

558
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,260
But Prince Jing is always

559
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,260
very kind.

560
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,260
He is very kind.

561
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,260
This is a good gift.

562
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,260
He is a man of the palace.

563
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,260
He can give his beloved palace

564
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,260
to His Majesty.

565
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,260
That's why he is so kind.

566
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,260
He is so kind

567
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,260
to give me a gift.

568
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,260
It's really troublesome.

569
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,260
It's still the way you want.

570
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,260
Come back.

571
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,260
Ji Chen,

572
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,260
have you made the meal?

573
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,260
Zhen Ping,

574
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,260
shoot him.

575
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,260
Okay.

576
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,260
His Majesty's figure

577
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,260
is really not as good as it was.

578
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,260
You are so good at talking.

579
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,260
Where else do you have the power to talk?

580
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,260
Jing Yan,

581
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,260
this is a good work.

582
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,260
Are you willing to do it?

583
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,260
Of course I am willing to do it.

584
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,260
I am busy with the court affairs.

585
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,260
I just want you to be free

586
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,260
and relax.

587
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,260
I just didn't think

588
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,260
that this work would be too much for me.

589
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,260
I don't think about it.

590
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,260
It's good that you are free.

591
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,260
You can recover your power.

592
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,260
When you arrive at the hunting ground,

593
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,260
I will have a good time with you.

594
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,260
Father is wise.

595
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,260
I am very proud of you.

596
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,260
You all have a good smile.

597
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
You are very kind.

598
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,260
Jing Xuan's balance is very good.

599
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:19,260
And Jing Yan's work is not bad.

600
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
But Jing Huan's

601
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,260
Taihu Beast Mountain

602
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,260
is my favorite.

603
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,260
Father's balance

604
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,260
is very good for you.

605
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,260
Thank you for your compliment.

606
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,260
But the Taihu Beast Mountain

607
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,260
is so high,

608
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,260
I can't express

609
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,260
my filial piety to you.

610
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,260
I will give you another toast.

611
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,260
May you be healthy and healthy.

612
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,260
May you have a long life.

613
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,260
Okay.

614
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,260
I know

615
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,260
you all have a good smile.

616
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,260
I have a good smile too.

617
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,260
The Empress Dowager and Empress Dowager are first.

618
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,260
Today,

619
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,260
I took off my clothes.

620
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,260
But the song and dance are still in the air.

621
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,260
The banquet is not too much.

622
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,260
Drink another cup.

623
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,260
Then you can go.

624
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,260
Come on.

625
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,260
Come on.

626
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,260
Long live the Emperor.

627
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,260
Because of the smile,

628
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,260
the officials dare not act.

629
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,260
They can't be too stubborn.

630
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,260
The Emperor's birthday is really

631
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,260
a little bit of a shock.

632
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,260
You are very good at talking now.

633
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,260
I really feel

634
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,260
so calm and calm.

635
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,260
I am eating and drinking.

636
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,260
I am smiling.

637
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,260
It's just a little bit of a heat.

638
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,260
Noble Consort.

639
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,260
You are the most lively in Su's day.

640
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,260
Why don't you say anything today?

641
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,260
I saw His Majesty

642
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,260
looking at Noble Consort Jing.

643
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,260
I must be tired.

644
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,260
So I dare not talk too much.

645
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,260
Plus, I am so happy today.

646
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
I am afraid His Majesty will see the banquet.

647
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,260
What nonsense?

648
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,260
When is the banquet?

649
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,260
Come.

650
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,260
Come here.

651
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,260
Come.

652
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,260
I have lost some weight.

653
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,260
But I am not feeling well.

654
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,260
Thank you for your concern.

655
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,260
I am fine.

656
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,260
Empress is also very cautious.

657
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,260
I saw Jingxuan earlier.

658
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,260
I think he is also feeling better.

659
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,260
He is not very energetic.

660
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,260
He is too obsessed with thinking.

661
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,260
He is too obsessed with thinking.

662
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,260
The banquet is full of rascals.

663
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
I think

664
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,260
you are the only one in the palace

665
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,260
who is most suitable for the banquet.

666
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,260
Well.

667
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,260
I will take you there in the evening.

668
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

669
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,260
Come.

670
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,260
Come closer to me.

671
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,260
Come.

672
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,260
It's time to get up.

673
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,260
Your Majesty.

674
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,260
It's time to get up.

675
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,260
Your Majesty.

676
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
Your Majesty.

677
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,260
It's time to get up.

678
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,260
Oh my god.

679
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,260
Oh my god.

680
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,260
Someone come.

681
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,260
Go and get the doctor.

682
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,260
Go.

683
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,260
How is it?

684
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,260
Your Majesty.

685
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,260
I am very grateful to you.

686
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,260
I have been with you for several days.

687
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,260
I have been with you for several days.

688
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,260
Tell me the truth.

689
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,260
Is it okay?

690
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,260
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

691
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,260
It's really okay.

692
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,260
Okay.

693
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,260
Please be careful.

694
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,260
Yes.

695
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,260
Greetings to Your Highness.

696
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,260
Greetings to Mother.

697
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,260
Get up.

698
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,260
Why are you here so early today?

699
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,260
Your Majesty, you are not feeling well.

700
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,260
The princes are all in the palace.

701
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,260
But

702
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,260
I have to go to the palace.

703
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,260
I have to go to the palace.

704
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,260
I have to go to the palace.

705
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,260
The princes are all in the palace.

706
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,260
But

707
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,260
Eunuch Gao sent a letter.

708
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
He said that His Majesty is not allowed to go in.

709
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,260
He just cut his head off at the door.

710
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,260
I have seen His Majesty.

711
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,260
He is just tired from the birthday.

712
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,260
He drank more wine.

713
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,260
He is not in love.

714
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,260
He just needs to be light for a few days.

715
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,260
At present, the situation is very tense.

716
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,260
The crown prince is not out yet.

717
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,260
His Majesty is not in a big trouble.

718
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,260
I think His Majesty is still in love with Yue Guifei.

719
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,260
He is also in a bad mood.

720
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,260
Mr. Su,

721
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,260
the night in the Ninguo House

722
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,260
will be like the battle between the prince and the prince.

723
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,260
The battle is over.

724
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,260
The Eastern Palace will be in the hands of the emperor.

725
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,260
The prince will be in trouble

726
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,260
if he is in love with the prince.

727
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,260
We don't need to worry about that.

728
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,260
Leave the rest to the prince.

729
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,260
Mr. Su,

730
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,260
you are really interesting

731
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,260
when you analyze the situation.

732
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,260
What are you doing?

733
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,260
I am trying to make a sweet soup

734
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,260
with the pears of the pears.

735
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,260
I think the pears of the pears are from the Xuzhou.

736
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,260
It is said that the pears from there

737
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,260
are the most gentle.

738
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,260
It is really strange.

739
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,260
How did you know about this?

740
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,260
I borrowed a bottle of oil from Mr. Su

741
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,260
and he said that he was a good man.

742
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,260
I am not a good man.

743
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,260
I am a good man.

744
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,260
I borrowed a bottle of oil from Mr. Su.

745
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,260
It is a very boring and boring thing.

746
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,260
I remember this one.

747
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,260
What is this oil?

748
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,260
It is so interesting.

749
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,260
It is called the Japs.

750
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,260
Bring it back next time.

751
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,260
Let me have a look.

752
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,260
I will send it to you when you want to see it.

753
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,260
But it was a little late when we were in the ring.

754
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,260
I think it is his love.

755
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,260
I will return it after I finish watching it.

756
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,260
But I have to return it.

757
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,260
It is a ring.

758
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,260
Of course I have to return it.

759
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,260
You are back.

760
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,260
You are back.

761
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,260
It is late today.

762
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,260
Our manager

763
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,260
bought a house with a housekeeper.

764
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,260
He gave us a house.

765
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,260
The sound is gone.

766
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,260
Manager has paid you for the house.

767
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,260
Miss.

768
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,260
Miss.

769
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,260
Wake up.

770
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,260
Wake up, Miss.

771
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,260
What is wrong with you?

772
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,260
What is wrong, Miss?

773
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,260
I am fine.

774
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,260
I am fine.

775
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,260
Look at you.

776
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,260
You are standing up.

777
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,260
You said you are fine.

778
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,260
Where are you staying?

779
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,260
We are looking for someone to send you home.

780
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,260
Home?

781
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,260
My home is in the snow.

782
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,260
It is far from the snow.

783
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,260
You and your family

784
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,260
are coming to the capital.

785
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,260
The house is in the snow.

786
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,260
I am here.

787
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,260
My aunt is the one who is the head of my aunt.

788
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,260
Where is your aunt's house?

789
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,260
It is in the next quarter.

790
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,260
Next quarter.

791
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,260
Next quarter?

792
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,260
Next quarter?

793
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,260
Isn't it the mother of the sweet and sour chicken?

794
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,260
Pu Lu.

795
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,260
Don't go.

796
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,260
The mother of the chicken lives next door.

797
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,260
Send the girl there.

798
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,260
Yes.

799
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,260
Send her there.

800
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,260
Send her there.

801
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,260
Yes.

802
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,260
I am here.

803
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,260
I am here.

804
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,260
I am here.

805
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:08,260
It is far.
