00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,600
Sir, if you don't mind,

3
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,600
can I sign the contract?

4
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,800
Mother, Mr. Su already has a name on his body.

5
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
There's no need to...

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,800
I just signed the contract.

7
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,400
I didn't take any drugs.

8
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
There's no need to be so serious.

9
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,000
But doctors all want to see more patients.

10
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,800
Please don't blame me.

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,800
Please.

12
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
Mother.

13
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,200
Mother.

14
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,800
Mother, what's wrong?

15
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It'll be fine in a while.

16
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It'll be fine in a while.

17
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Jingyan, today,

18
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,400
have you ever felt your father's love?

19
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
I...

20
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,000
I was with my father all morning.

21
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,400
What about Mother?

22
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
She's not gone yet.

23
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,000
Then go and feel your father's love.

24
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Isn't he sleeping at the bed?

25
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
He's going to bed.

26
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
Right there.

27
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Wait for him to wake up.

28
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,200
Mother wants me to go out, right?

29
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Go now.

30
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The best game in the world.

31
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Come.

32
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The best game in the world.

33
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The best game in the world.

34
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The best game in the world.

35
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The best game in the world.

36
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The best game in the world.

37
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The best game in the world.

38
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The best game in the world.

39
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The best game in the world.

40
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The best game in the world.

41
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The best game in the world.

42
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The best game in the world.

43
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The best game in the world.

44
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The best game in the world.

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Your Highness.

46
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Stop crying.

47
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I...

48
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What's the use of crying?

49
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't want to be like this.

50
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But after all these years,

51
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I can't bear it anymore.

52
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't know how your father and mother

53
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
would see you like this.

54
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Jingyi,

55
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm fine.

56
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm just a little weaker than Changzhi.

57
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't feel anything.

58
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The poison of the fire cold

59
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
is the hand of the Seven Poisoners.

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I want to clear it.

61
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
How can I remove a layer of skin?

62
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's so simple.

63
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Have you ever said anything

64
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
to the doctor who poisoned you?

65
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He said I'm a good boy.

66
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
He won't be hurt.

67
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
How could it be?

68
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The poison of the fire cold

69
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
is the poison of the fire cold.

70
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If your father

71
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
knows that you've suffered so much,

72
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
he will be so sad.

73
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Uncle,

74
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
you used to look

75
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
like your father.

76
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Although my appearance has changed,

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm still the son of the Lin family.

78
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I must replace the Lin family with a family member.

79
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No.

80
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No.

81
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't care about anything.

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you hear me?

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Take good care of yourself.

84
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'll do what I have to do.

85
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You believe me.

86
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I can do it.

87
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No.

88
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I can't let you go today.

89
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No matter what, you shouldn't stop me.

90
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Jingyi,

91
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
if you really want to do it for me,

92
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
don't tell Jingyan who I am.

93
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We've made a step forward.

94
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I have a village.

95
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I will take good care of myself.

96
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I will take good care of myself.

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I will take good care of myself.

98
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Jingyi,

99
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
you will promise me.

100
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Is that so?

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Mother, you took me out.

102
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What did I tell you?

103
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Didn't His Highness go to greet His Majesty?

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No.

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Then why are you standing here?

106
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Why don't you go in?

107
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
My mother has never been so careless.

108
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
She's been so careless.

109
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
She's been so careless.

110
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
She's been so careless.

111
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
My mother has never been so careless.

112
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I want to know the reason.

113
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But I don't want her to worry.

114
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Please tell me tomorrow.

115
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Your Highness, you just need to know

116
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
that Consort Jing is a good mother.

117
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
She will just think that you're good.

118
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Everyone has a secret

119
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
that they don't want to know.

120
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Why do you have to save her?

121
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's a joke.

122
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I won't tell you anyway.

123
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Please forgive me.

124
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Mother didn't let you tell her.

125
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Since she found out about you,

126
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
she doesn't want you to know.

127
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
If you can't bear to wait,

128
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
please go to Consort Jing.

129
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Goodbye.

130
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
My mother has nothing to say.

131
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
She wants to talk to me.

132
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Can you not ask?

133
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
As a person,

134
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I see that mother is so annoying.

135
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
How can I not ask?

136
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I can't ask.

137
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I can't ask.

138
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I can't ask.

139
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I can't ask.

140
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I can't ask.

141
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I can't ask.

142
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Don't worry.

143
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
My mind is not related to the present.

144
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's not related to Mr. Su either.

145
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But when I met him,

146
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I was entangled with some long-distance past.

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I couldn't bear to feel any pain.

148
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Long-distance?

149
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes.

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's very long-distance.

151
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I can't bear to see you like this.

152
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Before you were born,

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
before I entered the palace,

154
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
you couldn't help him.

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Mr. Su is no longer my age.

156
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Since he's so long-distance,

157
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
how can he afford to do that?

158
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I've seen

159
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
his illness before.

160
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
After you left,

161
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I asked him some symptoms.

162
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You know,

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the medical family has always been a threat to the health of the body.

164
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So you can't hear it.

165
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Mr. Su.

166
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Uncle.

167
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I heard

168
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
you went to see Consort Jing.

169
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
How is she?

170
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
How is she?

171
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I shouldn't have gone to see her.

172
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What's wrong?

173
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I thought she could at least hold on to her in front of Jingyan.

174
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Consort Jing didn't hold on to her?

175
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Then isn't she...

176
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
She's been suspicious.

177
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I can only fight with Consort Jing now.

178
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I hope she won't ask any questions.

179
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
As I said,

180
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
you'd better listen to me.

181
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Just follow her.

182
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No.

183
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Absolutely not.

184
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Mother.

185
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you fail,

186
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
you'll be punished.

187
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Who will fail?

188
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Who will fail?

189
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Xia Jiang is not yours.

190
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Now she's in a difficult situation.

191
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
She's in the Palace of the City of Chenzhou.

192
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
She's the same as her.

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You're the son of the King and the prince.

194
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You don't have to go this way.

195
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But there's still a chance

196
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
for other ways to go.

197
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Xia Jiang is right.

198
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
If Father is in the wrong,

199
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I can stand it.

200
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I can also stand it.

201
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But that's not the case.

202
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Mother, think about it.

203
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Father is surrounded by Consort Jing.

204
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
When will he get the seal?

205
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
He'll be in danger.

206
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The imperial guards are obviously

207
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
unable to go with Prince Jing.

208
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The imperial guards and the guards

209
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
are in a lot of trouble.

210
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Prince Jing is far from me.

211
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Prince Jing is not a good match for the imperial guards.

212
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I have nothing to do with the prince.

213
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Mother,

214
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
if Father is in trouble,

215
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
what will you let me fight with Xia Jiang?

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
If there's really no chance,

217
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I can't...

218
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Even if mother is willing to fight,

219
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll give up.

220
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Will Miss Yan

221
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
let us go?

222
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Mother, don't forget.

223
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You couldn't get rid of yourself

224
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
even if Consort Chen was forced to.

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Consort Jing is looking at all this.

226
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm afraid

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Consort Jing is looking at all this.

228
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
She's still remembering.

229
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Do you still think

230
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
this woman is so kind and kind?

231
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But...

232
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But this is a conspiracy.

233
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Mother,

234
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm not trying to do this.

235
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's just a personal matter.

236
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You know I'm a child.

237
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Even if I'm bold enough,

238
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I wouldn't dare to bear the crime of being a soldier.

239
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Then,

240
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
think about it.

241
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What do you want me to do?

242
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Now, the Empress

243
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
is in charge of the capital.

244
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You just need to find

245
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
the responsibility of the capital.

246
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You can transfer the gold to the border

247
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
from Xunfang Camp.

248
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Then, I can seal the entire Jinling City.

249
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What do you want to do?

250
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The Jinling City can be used as my own.

251
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
First,

252
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
to break the connection between the Jinling City and the border.

253
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Second,

254
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
to make the soldiers of Mengzhi keep their hands

255
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
unable to become the reinforcements of the Jiuan Mountain.

256
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What do you want to do with the Jiuan Mountain?

257
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Mother, don't worry.

258
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I can do this.

259
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll do it.

260
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Pass the order of the Empress.

261
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
From today on,

262
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
all the imperial harems will be in the Jinling City.

263
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
They will be in the army.

264
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Listen to the order of the Xu Fang Camp.

265
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Pass the order of the Empress.

266
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
We will be in the army.

267
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
We will be out of the way.

268
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yes.

269
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Then,

270
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll see you in the capital.

271
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll see you in the capital.

272
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The demon has been stopped.

273
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Brother Su, you are not talking about me.

274
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I think I've seen it before.

275
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Brother Su,

276
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:38,560
since the night of the

277
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,000
Tingsheng,

278
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
the Gu family has been growing.

279
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yesterday, I was with Prince Ji.

280
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Prince Ji noticed him.

281
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He told me that

282
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
the Tingsheng is in Prince Jing's mansion.

283
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Prince Ji?

284
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yes.

285
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Come on.

286
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'll go out and have a look.

287
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Today,

288
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'll go in and have a look.

289
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Brother Ji, come with me.

290
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
General Qi,

291
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
where are you going?

292
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Okay.

293
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Mr. Li,

294
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Mr. Su,

295
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
it's a monster beast.

296
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Someone saw that monster beast.

297
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This time,

298
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
we must catch it back.

299
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You said that monster beast

300
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
came to Mount Jiuan.

301
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm sure.

302
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't know if it's true.

303
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll go and have a look.

304
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Brothers, let's go.

305
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
General Qi, I'll go too.

306
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Brother Su,

307
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
write the words of Tingsheng.

308
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'll go.

309
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What are you doing here?

310
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm fighting.

311
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
How can you be so stubborn

312
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
to get into the army?

313
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The chief left the capital.

314
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Brother Zhen and Li Duoju are not with me.

315
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm not worried.

316
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The army has already

317
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
searched the underground for the Mongolian Empire.

318
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You can be at ease.

319
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Go back tomorrow.

320
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm not going.

321
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Mr. Suan is in the capital.

322
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
There's nothing serious.

323
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Chief,

324
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
just let me stay.

325
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
No one can control you, right?

326
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But the war is over.

327
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Go back to Langzhou for me.

328
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Xu Dudu's reply is like this.

329
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Please keep it a secret.

330
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This Xu Anma is a true monster.

331
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Even if he has 50,000 soldiers,

332
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
he won't be able to fight with us.

333
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Go and arrange for it.

334
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll go with you to clean up the camp.

335
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You go with the two soldiers.

336
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Who is it?

337
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I can't explain it to you now.

338
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You hurry to escape and tell your brother

339
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
that Prince Yu wants to rebel.

340
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What are you doing?

341
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Rebellion?

342
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Someone is coming.

343
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Tong Le, this way.

344
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Go.

345
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Go.

346
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Hurry.

347
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Over there.

348
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Hurry.

349
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The back door.

350
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Come on.

351
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Catch them.

352
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Don't let them escape.

353
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Hurry.

354
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Go.

355
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Zhenniang, go.

356
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
They are here.

357
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Hurry.

358
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Go.

359
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Go.

360
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Go.

361
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Hurry.

362
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Go.

363
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Tong Le, you go first.

364
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You go first.

365
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Go.

366
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Go.

367
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Go.

368
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Come on.

369
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Zhenniang.

370
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Tong Le, you go.

371
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Zhenniang.

372
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Zhenniang.

373
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Go.

374
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
How is it?

375
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The secret passage is sealed.

376
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Where are you?

377
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's all arranged.

378
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You can leave anytime.

379
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I think Prince Yu

380
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
is not the one who came to our Su's house.

381
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The Sect Leader once told us

382
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
that Prince Yu is doing something

383
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
on the side.

384
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,800
He will eventually

385
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,000
roll us in.

386
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
So, as long as he moves,

387
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
we will leave immediately.

388
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Leave a empty house for him.

389
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
As the Sect Leader said,

390
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
when everyone is hidden,

391
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
we will come out and see

392
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
what Prince Yu wants to do.

393
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Master Li, Master Zhen,

394
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Tong Le is back.

395
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Tong Le?

396
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Tong Le.

397
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Tong Le.

398
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Tong Le.

399
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Why did you betray me?

400
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
If I were Tong Lu Yi,

401
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I would not betray you even if I die.

402
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But he didn't have the ability to do that.

403
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I really had no choice.

404
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Who is Juniang?

405
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I have never

406
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
liked someone like him

407
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
or other women.

408
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Do you know that I found out

409
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
that he is the junior sister of Qin Bai Ruo?

410
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:57,500
Zhuang, you are Prince Yu's

411
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
and he will surely think of a way to contact

412
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,500
Mount Jiu An.

413
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,500
We just need to continue

414
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
to the direction.

415
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,500
We will find the star.

416
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,500
When you are done,

417
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
it will be too late.

418
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
Tong Lu just escaped.

419
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
I have already sent people to guard the gate.

420
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
And I have sealed the way

421
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,500
to Mount Jiu An.

422
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Master, you are absolutely right.

423
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
Such a big house.

424
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Is there really nothing?

425
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
It's all in vain.

426
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
It seems that when Mei Chang Su went to the capital,

427
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
he was really ready for it.

428
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
He even brought the medicine

429
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
that saved his life,

430
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
housekeeper, doctor and saved his life.

431
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
I don't know the truth.

432
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
He clearly did not get the antidote

433
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
of the Swordless Man.

434
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
How could he cure this poison?

435
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
Master,

436
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
if Mei Chang Su can cure the poison,

437
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
will it have anything to do with the fire poison?

438
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
What did you say?

439
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
Fire poison?

440
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Stop.

441
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Stop the order.

442
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Stop.

443
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
Stop.

444
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Hurry up.

445
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,500
Wait for me.

446
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Stop.

447
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,500
Stop them.

448
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Your Highness.

449
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
What's the matter?

450
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
You are in such a hurry to look for me?

451
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
I just got a report from the capital.

452
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
Prince Yu is trying to kill you.

453
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
Impossible.

454
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
How many people are in Prince Yu's hands?

455
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
What did he kill?

456
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
The two secretaries of the imperial army

457
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
have already loyal to the empress and Prince Yu.

458
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
And the guards of the entire capital

459
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,500
have been taken over by Prince Yu.

460
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
What?

461
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Can you take these two people?

462
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
I...

463
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
The two secretaries of the imperial army

464
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
were indeed transferred after the murder.

465
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
I have no confidence.

466
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
But I believe in my illness.

467
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
They will not listen to me

468
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
if I make a mess.

469
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,300
Now the empress has been

470
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
in charge of the capital.

471
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
The imperial army has been controlled by her.

472
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
As long as the empress doesn't say

473
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Prince Yu has a plan,

474
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
the imperial army in the capital

475
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
will not resist.

476
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Even if the imperial army is controlled by them,

477
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
they will not dare to take out the capital.

478
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Did Prince Yu

479
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
use his soldiers to rebel?

480
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
Prince Yu has already transferred the imperial army.

481
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
Greetings, Prince Yu.

482
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
Greetings, Prince Yu.

483
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
It's Prince Yu's uncle, Xu An Mo.

484
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
That's the one who escaped from the imperial army.

485
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,500
He almost killed the Xu An Mo

486
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,500
with your military power.

487
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Isn't he the Crown Prince's cousin?

488
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,500
To protect him,

489
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
the Crown Prince was very angry with you.

490
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
How could he help Prince Yu?

491
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Now where else could the Crown Prince be?

492
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
The world is in a state of crisis.

493
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
People like Xu An Mo

494
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
are only right-handed.

495
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
Where else could he be?

496
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
Let's analyze the situation first.

497
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Let's go.

498
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
His Majesty ordered

499
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Prince Jing,

500
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Xiao Jing Yan,

501
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,500
colluded with the imperial army.

502
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
He was impulsive.

503
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
He was in a hurry to take over the imperial army.

504
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Prince Yu ordered

505
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
50,000 troops to be transferred.

506
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
He was too hasty to attack the Qin King.

507
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
He was in a hurry.

508
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
I came to tell you in person.

509
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
Do you still have any unfaithful intentions?

510
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
Your Highness,

511
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
I'm here to ask for a military edict

512
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
from the Imperial Army.

513
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,500
It seems

514
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
you really don't believe me.

515
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
This is the capital city.

516
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
This is Mount Jiuan.

517
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
The Qingli Army is stationed in the west.

518
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,500
But the Qingli Army is not in the war.

519
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,500
There is no special power.

520
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
The army is on the battlefield.

521
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,500
The army is not out of the city.

522
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
What can Xu An Mo do?

523
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,500
He can kill 50,000 troops.

524
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
To create the army.

525
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,500
Xu An Mo is the one who is the man of the Yan.

526
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
Of course, he can do some tricks.

527
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
But the five major leaders of the Qingli Army

528
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
have the right to take over the country.

529
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
Can you confirm that

530
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
no one is being bought

531
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
out of those five people?

532
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
The army's situation

533
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
is more clear than you think.

534
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Yes.

535
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
The army is indeed not like the past.

536
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,500
Besides the four advanced forces,

537
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,500
the Qingli Army is still a bit tough.

538
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
The whole country's Tuntian Army

539
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
is destroyed by the military forces

540
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
because of the military's desire to conquer the country.

541
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
They have already been defeated by the battlefield.

542
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
If they use it as a way to use it,

543
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
it's not a difficult task to buy a few officers.

544
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,500
Is there anyone else

545
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
who doesn't believe in Prince Yu?

546
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
Your Majesty, please give me a command.

547
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Are you still going to check the military service?

548
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
Your Majesty, please give me a command.

549
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
We can immediately send troops to Jiuan Mountain.

550
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
If it's really true,

551
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
we must report to His Majesty immediately.

552
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
We must quickly respond to it

553
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
and avoid the disaster.

554
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,500
No.

555
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
If we report to His Majesty right now,

556
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
no matter whether he believes it or not,

557
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
he will definitely return to the capital immediately.

558
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
If Prince Yu finds out

559
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
that there is no chance of being attacked,

560
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,500
he will immediately end the operation.

561
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,500
And there is still no one in the capital.

562
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
There is enough time for Xu Anmu

563
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
to destroy the evidence.

564
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,500
Why do you say that

565
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
Prince Yu is going to rebel?

566
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
How will this emperor

567
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
think about it?

568
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
A prince who just arrived

569
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
can give the imperial army a command

570
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
and pass on the message

571
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
without any reason to say that Prince Yu is going to rebel.

572
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
If Prince Yu is going to rebel again,

573
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,500
what kind of consequences will Prince Yu

574
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
face?

575
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
I don't need to say more.

576
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
We don't report to His Majesty.

577
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
What if Prince Yu and his rebels

578
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
are on their way?

579
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,500
That would be even worse.

580
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Yes.

581
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,500
We report to His Majesty and the householder will return to the capital.

582
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
If they meet again in the middle of the road,

583
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
our number of people will not exceed one in ten.

584
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,500
If we fight them,

585
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
it will be a mess.

586
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
We will be in no danger.

587
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,500
We must not act rashly.

588
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Once we are out of the war,

589
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
it will be a dead end.

590
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
But if we don't move,

591
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
we can only wait for them to return to the capital.

592
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,500
Isn't that still a dead end?

593
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
The news we got in the past

594
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,500
is useless at all, right?

595
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Of course it is.

596
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,500
It's better to keep your hands off

597
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,500
before you see it.

598
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,500
Look.

599
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,500
This is the enemy camp.

600
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,500
Tell me, where should we go?

601
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Of course it's the left side.

602
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Not at all.

603
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
The left side has a river.

604
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,500
It doesn't affect the speed of our troops.

605
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,500
If we move to the left,

606
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,500
we must move back.

607
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
The whole of Jiuan Mountain

608
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
is full of police.

609
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
The enemy camp is the closest to here.

610
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
Every day,

611
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
the army will check it.

612
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,500
It's impossible to get rid of it.

613
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,500
The Qing Lv Army is moving

614
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,500
thousands of people.

615
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,500
It's hard to act rashly.

616
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
The most important thing is a chopsticks.

617
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,500
In order to seize the time,

618
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
they can't let this police

619
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
go the other way.

620
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,500
I will send people

621
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
to find out the whereabouts of the enemy.

622
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
I just realized that

623
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,500
I lost my power.

624
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
It's okay.

625
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,500
You don't have to care about these.

626
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
I will send people to find out the whereabouts of the enemy.

627
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
The King of Yu is in danger.

628
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,500
I'm warning you.

629
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
The King of Yu is in danger.

630
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,500
The King of Yu is in danger.

631
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Hurry up.

632
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
What?

633
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Say it again.

634
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,500
The King of Yu is the Qing Lv Army.

635
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
He's been attacked by the enemy.

636
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
He's been killed by the enemy.

637
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
Kill him.

638
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
The King of Yu is in danger.

639
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,500
The King of Yu is in danger.

640
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,500
The King of Yu is in danger.

641
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,500
The King of Yu is in danger.

642
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
He's been attacked by the enemy.

643
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
He's in danger.

644
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
If Xu An Mo can

645
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
take all the weapons of the King of Yu,

646
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
there will be only three days.

647
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,500
It's a long battle.

648
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,500
You should have taken more than two or three days.

649
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,500
Three days?

650
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
You are the most important.

651
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,500
Can you come back?

652
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,500
Mother and you are all on the mountain.

653
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
I will come back even if I die.

654
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Wait a minute.

655
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,500
What are you talking about?

656
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,500
The Ji Cheng.

657
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
The most powerful Ji Cheng army

658
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
has come to the farthest place.

659
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
Fang Neng Jie is the commander.

660
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
But he...

661
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
How is this route?

662
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,500
Not bad.

663
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
But it's not good to go back.

664
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Ji Cheng army has a problem.

665
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,500
The flag is in danger.

666
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
Who will take the army?

667
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Let the war camp go.

668
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Let the army surround Qi Ru Xi.

669
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
It's okay to go to Xian Lan Lin.

670
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Let's see how the weather is.

671
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Wait a minute.

672
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
Mr. Su.

673
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
You only ask the King of Jing

674
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,500
if he can come back in three days.

675
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,500
Why don't you ask him

676
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,500
how he can go out?

677
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Now the attack

678
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
is the only way out.

679
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,500
The Qing Li army has stopped him.

680
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
You say

681
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,500
who can get out to find the army?

682
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,500
Commander Meng, don't worry.

683
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,500
I can go down the mountain from the north.

684
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,500
There is no way out

685
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,500
if it's a road.

686
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,500
There is.

687
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
There is a very dangerous road

688
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
covered by wild grass.

689
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
When I and Uncle

690
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
found out about the chaos on the mountain in the 90s,

691
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,500
there were few people in the world know about it.

692
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,500
But from Mr. Su's plan,

693
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
you obviously know about it.

694
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,500
Mr. Su,

695
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
to pick White R 7210isten

696
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
planned this by the令.

697
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
He's giving him other equipments as well.

698
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,500
White R 7210isten

699
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
people who could use the two-year-old

700
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,560
Next Yuan

701
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,500
of theDidn't know

702
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
the people of Gianluan

703
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
were very careful.

704
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,340
Let's go.

705
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,460
Commander Meng,

706
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,500
we must re-enact the defense of Mount Jiuan.

707
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,100
No matter what happens in the future,

708
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,100
His Majesty and Noble Consort

709
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,180
must be fine.

710
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,100
Yes.

711
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,020
Mr. Su, you must be fine.

712
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,620
I can't blame...

713
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,660
can I blame you?

714
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,260
You're such an buysy person.

715
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,660
I can't keep up!

716
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,180
Stop thinking about it.

717
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,420
Send aedi

718
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,100
to among the soldiers

719
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,420
out the room.

720
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,820
OK, I'll be there soon!

721
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,180
To think that

722
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,300
I've been這邊ing

723
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,340
and Druid Cozen

724
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,340
They are here to protect the king.

725
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,340
When did you get the order?

726
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,340
The rebel army is always fighting for the flag.

727
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,340
In the future, the Fifth Brother can say that

728
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,340
he will come to rescue the family and the situation.

729
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,340
He may have killed my son,

730
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,340
but my father was killed by my son.

731
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,340
That was because there was no crown prince.

732
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,340
It was according to the empress' order.

733
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,340
I am willing to serve the new emperor.

734
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,340
He is so selfish!

735
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,340
Jingyan,

736
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,340
what do you think of the rebel army?

737
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:26,340
I think it is no use to be selfish.

738
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,340
Before the rebel army was able to get the throne,

739
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,340
the commander of the alliance took the army to guard the country.

740
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,340
It will take three to four days.

741
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,340
I will go to the army to get the army.

742
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,340
I will take three days to arrive.

743
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,340
Okay.

744
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,340
I will write you a letter.

745
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,340
Father.

746
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,340
There is no military uniform.

747
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,340
It is for the army to be able to get.

748
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,340
Why is it for the army to be able to get?

749
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,340
The most recent rebel army

750
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,340
should be the imperial army of the capital.

751
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,340
Father, the rebel army came from the west.

752
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,340
And the imperial army in the capital is not in the city.

753
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,340
I will go to the capital to get the army.

754
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,340
I am afraid it will be useless.

755
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,340
The capital is already in danger.

756
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,340
Your Majesty,

757
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,340
Prince Yu is still willing to take the risk

758
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,340
and work with the Qingli army.

759
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,340
And the attack on the rebel army

760
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,340
is definitely going to be the one

761
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,340
that has taken the army and controlled the capital.

762
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,340
Mother, you are right.

763
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,340
Father, please give me the military uniform.

764
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,340
I will send the imperial army to guard the country in three days.

765
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,340
He Chen.

766
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,340
Father.

767
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,340
Qingyan,

768
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,340
the country is in danger.

769
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,340
You are the only one in the country.

770
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,340
You must not let anything happen to the capital.

771
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,340
Yes, I will not let anything happen to it.

772
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,340
Father,

773
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,340
Mother,

774
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,340
take care.

775
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,340
I promise I can go down the mountain

776
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,340
and know the army of the Qingli army.

777
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,340
I can stay here for three days

778
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,340
and eat the food.

779
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,340
But I am still worried.

780
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,340
There are only three thousand in my army.

781
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,340
Can you really hold on for three days?

782
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,340
Prince Yu and Prince Xu have already taken the army.

783
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,340
There was no retreat at that time.

784
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,340
We will definitely fight with all our might.

785
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,340
My army is facing a tenfold challenge.

786
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,340
Even if we are in danger,

787
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,340
we dare not say that we have the right to take the army.

788
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,340
If we lose, we will not be able to take the victory.

789
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,340
Because of this battle,

790
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,340
we will die in the second place.

791
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,340
The army of the Qingli army

792
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,340
will definitely fight with the rebels.

793
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,340
As the commander,

794
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,340
you must not be too much of a hero.

795
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,340
You must be careful.

796
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,340
As long as we keep our distance and keep our distance,

797
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,340
we will have a chance to survive.

798
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,340
But if Jiuan Mountain loses,

799
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,340
Prince Yu will help father to rule the world.

800
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,340
At that time,

801
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,340
the whole country will be in danger.

802
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,340
Even if he slays me as a rebel,

803
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,340
I will still be able to escape.

804
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,340
And mother and you,

805
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,340
Commander.

806
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,340
I will not be able to...

807
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,340
Now the rebels are in danger.

808
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,340
Your Highness, you have already set the trap.

809
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,340
If we can't wait for you to come back,

810
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,340
you must immediately take the army to the capital.

811
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,340
It is good to lead the world to fight with the Qingli army.

812
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,340
You must not let Prince Yu get it.

813
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,340
I believe that Consort Jin,

814
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,340
Commander Meng,

815
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,340
and the seven thousand soldiers that you have been chasing,

816
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,340
will definitely agree to believe in me.

817
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,340
In three days, we will see the Ji Cheng army.

818
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,340
Please take care of the mountain.

819
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,340
Don't worry, Your Highness.

820
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,340
I will definitely come back.

821
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,340
I will not be able to...

822
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,340
I will not be able to...

823
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,340
I will not be able to...

824
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,340
I will not be able to...

00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,340
I will not be able to...

00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,340
I will not be able to...

827
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,340
I will not be able to...

828
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,340
I will not be able to...

829
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,340
I will not be able to...

830
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,340
I will not be able to...

831
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,340
I will not be able to...

832
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,340
I will not be able to...

00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,340
I will not be able to...

834
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,340
I will not be able to...

835
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,340
I will not be able to...

00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,340
I will not be able to...

838
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,340
I will not be able to...

839
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,340
I will not be able to...

840
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,340
I will not be able to...

841
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,340
I will not be able to...

842
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,340
I will not be able to...

843
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,340
I will not be able to...

844
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,340
I will not be able to...
