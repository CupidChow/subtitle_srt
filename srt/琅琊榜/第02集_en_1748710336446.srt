1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,540
This is not true...

2
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,640
Episode 39

3
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,120
The letter I sent to Beiyan earlier today

4
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,920
tells that the all countries in Zhou

5
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,400
mentioned the same kind of friendship

6
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,000
I should ask Princess Ni Huang to marry

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,720
Yes

8
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,520
Except for Nantru

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,900
Ni Huang việc is the leader of the million ис Thb Arm honona

10
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,300
Therefore grandfather stayed at South Alley for nearly 10 years,

11
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,500
so he may take 100Why else.

12
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,200
he dare not refuse to ask him to marry his suzerain,

13
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,200
sang Jins why came to them further.

14
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,400
indeed,

15
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,100
yirng is banned by your majesty,

16
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,720
he goes to Langyaytes and alternate the biases.

17
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,020
Those figures,

18
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,420
who and whom can study.

19
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,260
I hard must thank your majesty,

20
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,260
and make him feel better.

21
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,260
Nihua has been in Nanjing for ten years.

22
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,260
He has been in peace.

23
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,260
Ten thousand iron records

24
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,660
are loyal to him.

25
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,460
I'm afraid that no matter how long it takes,

26
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,860
the Nanjing army

27
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,860
only knows Lord Mu

28
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,660
and doesn't know Lord Liang.

29
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,260
Is Nanjing...

30
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,260
I'm afraid that it will become a sad story.

31
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,860
Mother has been a child

32
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,260
and she has been in her sister's hands

33
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,260
and has been in charge of the construction of Lord Yunnan's mansion.

34
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,860
Nihua,

35
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,060
you should thank her.

36
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,860
Good.

37
00:03:59,260 --> 00:03:59,860
Good.

38
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,460
Commander Meng is really the first master of our Liang.

39
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,660
Good.

40
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,660
These two young men

41
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,860
are also the young generation.

42
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,060
I didn't expect that even if they come together,

43
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,460
they can't find Lord Wu in the hands of Commander.

44
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,660
Your Highness,

45
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,460
Lord Xie is overpraising.

46
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,060
It's not that I'm trying to make them suffer.

47
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,660
It's just that this time,

48
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,060
the princess is in charge of the construction.

49
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,460
Many masters come from different countries.

50
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,660
I, the eldest brother of Liang,

51
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,660
should be the one who makes the decision.

52
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,660
Commander, you're right.

53
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,660
Since it's a public competition,

54
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,260
the result will be related to our face of Liang.

55
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,060
It's really unimaginable.

56
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,260
All countries and countries come in here

57
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,460
to ask for a family.

58
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,060
The cooperation between the capital and the palace

59
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,460
must be adjusted.

60
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,660
If Commander has time,

61
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,260
can we discuss this matter

62
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,460
in my mansion?

63
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,060
His Majesty has also told me

64
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:12,440
to re-ent

65
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,040
the status and the hele

66
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,460
We have assume a Crash of-------- Berserker

67
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,520
Noische

68
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,360
Chamberlрыв

69
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,600
the

70
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:53,640
main

71
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,160
If you can marry the princess,

72
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,120
it's a dream come true.

73
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,040
His Majesty has sent Xuanjing Temple

74
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,680
to go to Binzhou in the East.

75
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,240
The Qing Palace

76
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,240
doesn't know if it can get out of this case.

77
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,160
If I can be the emperor of Ni Huang,

78
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
I'll have another chance to release him.

79
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,400
Didn't Your Highness say

80
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,280
His Majesty will give the princess a chance to be a emperor

81
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,480
in a hurry?

82
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,280
Didn't Your Highness say

83
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,640
His Majesty will give the princess a chance to be a emperor in a hurry?

84
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,440
His Majesty will give the princess a chance to be a emperor in a hurry?

85
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
What do you know?

86
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,400
Since His Majesty is not at ease,

87
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,840
the princess will stay in the south to guard the military power.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,200
Then after the princess is married,

89
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
she will stay in the capital.

90
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,640
Who can tell

91
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,360
the power of the prince's son?

92
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,160
Even Zhou Zao and all the other countries

93
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,760
are seeking a marriage.

94
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,920
I will not let this chance

95
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,840
go to waste with the crown prince.

96
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
I see.

97
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,560
I'm really confused.

98
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,920
Is there any news from Mei Changsu?

99
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,920
Mei Changsu has left Langzhou.

100
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,280
The captain is only checking his direction.

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,040
He must be caught by the crown prince.

102
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,360
I don't think so.

103
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,560
The crown prince's horse

104
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,680
is indeed behind us

105
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,760
and is in Langzhou.

106
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,760
The air is gone.

107
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Go out and play.

108
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Go.

109
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,320
I'm not going.

110
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
You go by yourself.

111
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
Don't go too far.

112
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
I'm not going.

113
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Go by yourself.

114
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
Don't go too far.

115
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Brother Su.

116
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Brother Su.

117
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
You're here alone?

118
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Where's Fei Liu?

119
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,920
He went out to play.

120
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
You...

121
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
You let him go out alone?

122
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Fei Liu is not very kind.

123
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
But he has a good temper.

124
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
He won't be in trouble.

125
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Brother Su.

126
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Do you really think Fei Liu is good temper?

127
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
Please.

128
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
Who is it?

129
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
You dare to lie in the manor?

130
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Take him away.

131
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Brother Su.

132
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Go.

133
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
Fei Liu.

134
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Stop.

135
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,920
Father.

136
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
My lord.

137
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
Commander Meng.

138
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Commander Meng.

139
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Don't.

140
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Jingrui.

141
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
What's going on?

142
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,920
I hope you can forgive me.

143
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
I hope you can forgive me.

144
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
This is my position.

145
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
I'm not very sensible.

146
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
I'm not very good at it.

147
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,920
I'll be a strict commander in the future.

148
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Mr. Su is a noble.

149
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
I'm good at calling out to you.

150
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
I'm afraid that you'll change

151
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
the habit of entering and leaving.

152
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,920
Otherwise,

153
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,920
I'm afraid that you won't be able

154
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,920
to avoid such a misunderstanding.

155
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Thank you, my lord.

156
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
I'm very grateful.

157
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Commander Meng, you did it yourself.

158
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
I'm really sorry.

159
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
What?

160
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
I just saw this little brother

161
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
being very good at it.

162
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,920
He was playing around in your mansion.

163
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
You're not good at

164
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,920
the guards in the manor.

165
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
So you can't help him.

166
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Since it's a misunderstanding,

167
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
we'll all be in a hurry today.

168
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Who is this gentleman?

169
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
I'm Su Zhe.

170
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
I'm from the same family as Mr. Xiao.

171
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
I'm here to help him.

172
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
You're a good man.

173
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,920
I'm not very good at it.

174
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
I'm sure you can

175
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
get his guards.

176
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
I'm sure you can get your guards.

177
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
I'm not good at it.

178
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,920
I'm just a little bit worried.

179
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
I just got saved by chance.

180
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
He stayed with me

181
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
just to repay his kindness.

182
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
So that's the case.

183
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,920
The world is really a mess.

184
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,920
I'm very grateful today.

185
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
Commander, please come in.

186
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,920
Commander,

187
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
please come in.

188
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Commander, please come in.

189
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Brother Su.

190
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,920
Brother Su.

191
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,920
Brother Su,

192
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
What's this?

193
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,920
These mysterious seals

194
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,920
Are from Albania.

195
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Well,

196
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:57,280
from the

197
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,520
Nahunintou

198
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,520
II

199
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:15,160
sure

200
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,160
I'm afraid we won't be able to handle this trouble today.

201
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Disgusting!

202
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,160
Yes. That Commander Ming is so annoying.

203
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
What did you say?

204
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Mei Cheng Su lives in your house?

205
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
The Langzhou direction is coming.

206
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
The people of the martial arts world

207
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
will not be the martial arts world.

208
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Jing Rui is also called Brother Su.

209
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
It must be him.

210
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,160
We are looking for him everywhere in the Eastern Palace.

211
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
He has already entered the capital.

212
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,160
This person's style of acting is indeed extraordinary.

213
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,160
Then what is the use of this step?

214
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
It's not hard to understand.

215
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Your Highness and the Eastern Palace are all so sure of him.

216
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,160
How can he be able to resist the martial arts world?

217
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
Instead of accepting the招攬 without any difficulty,

218
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,160
it's better to take the initiative to take the first step.

219
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Mei Cheng Su's suggestion is obvious.

220
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
We need to inquire more.

221
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
Well, you arrange it.

222
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
I will ask Her Highness the Empress to see him first.

223
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,160
This person entered the capital at the critical moment.

224
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,160
The Emperor's son,

225
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,920
was in the house where the

226
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,160
house of the Emperor was living.

227
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Is this person really a kind person?

228
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Or is he just an imposter?

229
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,160
It's really hard to understand.

230
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
If he is a kind person,

231
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
then it means that

232
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
he already knows that you are my person.

233
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
He will return to the palace.

234
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
If he is imposter,

235
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,160
then it's possible that he will return to the Prince of Yu.

236
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
He is very anxious.

237
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
He will have the power of the martial arts world.

238
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,160
If this person is the Prince of Yu,

239
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
then His Highness and I

240
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,160
are sure that we will be able to handle him.

241
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
What do you mean?

242
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
We must have the skill to handle him.

243
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
If we can't get him,

244
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
we must not listen to the Prince of Yu.

245
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,160
We must remove him immediately.

246
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
We must be brave and patient.

247
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
This is a dangerous situation in Binzhou.

248
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
You are used to coming here alone.

249
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
You must be careful.

250
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
Xuanjing Temple's progress and failure

251
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
is always a secret.

252
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
This time, it's better.

253
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160
It seems that we have already known about the whole of the city.

254
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,160
It will be hot.

255
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,160
It may be dangerous to go out.

256
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,160
But you cannot be too cautious in the capital.

257
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
The Prince of Yunnan's Mansion is a very wealthy person.

258
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
He has been lost for many years.

259
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,160
How can you be so unwell in this mess?

260
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,160
I have been running to the battlefield since I was 17.

261
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,160
I have lost my daughter for 10 years.

262
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
No matter what mess,

263
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,160
I must be able to swallow it.

264
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
Princess.

265
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Prince Jin, you are so busy.

266
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
You must want to return to the camp.

267
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,160
Yes.

268
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,160
These years, you have been abandoned for a long time.

269
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,160
You have been struggling in the battlefield.

270
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
It's really hard for you.

271
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Princess, is this a monster?

272
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
No.

273
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,160
Xuanjing Temple's decree to go to Binzhou to investigate the case.

274
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,160
I will send you the message.

275
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Investigate the case?

276
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
It won't be a violent case again, right?

277
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
I still have to go to the camp.

278
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
It's been 10 years.

279
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,160
You still don't talk to Prince Jin?

280
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,160
You have seen his face.

281
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Xuanjing Temple investigated the case of Chiyan.

282
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
The evidence is very accurate.

283
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,160
But he still doesn't believe that Ling is a traitor.

284
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,160
And he still doesn't believe that Ling killed my husband Nie Feng.

285
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
What can I say to him?

286
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,160
You don't believe me either?

287
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,160
I know you believe in your brother Ling Shu.

288
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,160
But he was only 19 years old at the time.

289
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,160
He must follow his father.

290
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,160
It's a pity that he misunderstood your loyalty.

291
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,160
No matter what, Prince Jin has his own style.

292
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
If not for this,

293
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,160
he would have been in the bloodline for years.

294
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,160
He wouldn't have been able to obtain a prince.

295
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
It's late. I should go.

296
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
Take care.

297
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,160
You can't enter the palace without the token.

298
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
I have sent someone to return to the camp.

299
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Please wait here.

300
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
I understand.

301
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Father, look.

302
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,160
This time, it's a great opportunity.

303
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,160
Although it's a famous work, it's also very valuable.

304
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,160
It's definitely worth it.

305
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Your Majesty, Prince Jin asks to see you.

306
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,160
What are you looking at?

307
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,160
Didn't you see that His Majesty is busy?

308
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Let Prince Jin wait outside.

309
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,160
Yes.

310
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,160
It's been more than an hour.

311
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,160
You must see His Majesty today.

312
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
Last time, I went back to the capital.

313
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,160
I went back to my home before I entered the family.

314
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Your Highness, you have been in the palace for three months.

315
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,160
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,160
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
I'm sorry.

318
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,160
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,160
I'm sorry.

320
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
I'm sorry.

321
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
I'm sorry.

322
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Your Majesty.

323
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
Prince Jin is still in the palace.

324
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
Don't you want to summon him?

325
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Look, I forgot about this.

326
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
summon him in.

327
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Summon Prince Jin.

328
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
Summon Prince Jin.

329
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
Summon Prince Jin.

330
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Summon him in.

331
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Summon Prince Jin.

332
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Summon Prince Jin.

333
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,160
I'm from the West camp to the capital.

334
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
I'm going to report to the capital.

335
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,160
Okay.

336
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Jin Yan, you're so crazy.

337
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,160
You even wear a fake dress.

338
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Don't you know that you're here to see Father?

339
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
Why don't you go back and greet him?

340
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Do you still have Father in your eyes?

341
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
I'm in the West camp to receive Father's decree.

342
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
I must enter the capital in three days.

343
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,160
I'll be back soon.

344
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
I'm not ready to leave.

345
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Jin Yan, I'm asking you.

346
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
I'm asking you for your own good.

347
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,160
You're still so stubborn.

348
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
You're still polite.

349
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Jin Yan is always like this.

350
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,160
Why do you have to fight him in front of Father?

351
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,160
Okay, okay.

352
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
What are you looking at?

353
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
You're a good employee.

354
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,160
But you don't look like a good person.

355
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,160
You're just a good employee.

356
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,160
You don't change.

357
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,160
I'm here to teach you.

358
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
Okay, I'm going back.

359
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
I'm leaving.

360
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
What a coincidence.

361
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Why hasn't Jin Yan come back to the palace?

362
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
I'm sorry.

363
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Five days after the emperor's arrival,

364
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,160
Prince Jing's medical record can be allowed to enter the palace.

365
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
It's still in five days.

366
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,160
You'd better bear with it.

367
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,160
Prince Jing always smiles.

368
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,160
As long as he gets the chance, he'll definitely enter the palace.

369
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
Careful.

370
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,160
What can I do for you?

371
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,160
I've already prepared the needle and thread for Jin Yan.

372
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,480
I'll send her off.

373
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,240
Yes, Your Highness.

374
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,800
Brother Su, you're not tired, are you?

375
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,160
I'm fine.

376
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,160
Young Master and you are finally back.

377
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,000
The Noble Lady has been waiting for half an hour.

378
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,680
She's waiting in the front hall to see you.

379
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,640
What Noble Lady?

380
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,880
Her Highness the Empress and Princess Ni

381
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,800
came to the Palace to reward the flowers.

382
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,480
The Princess's Highness is with her.

383
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,560
She talked to you.

384
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,680
She said she wanted to see you.

385
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,880
Please go ahead.

386
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,720
Sir, please.

387
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
You arranged it?

388
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,520
It's my mother's guest.

389
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,440
Why should I care?

390
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,600
My mother hasn't even seen you.

391
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,520
How could she talk to you?

392
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,680
How could I know?

393
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,720
Brother Su, I'll go back to the Luoxiu Palace with you.

394
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
You should go back to the Noble Lady.

395
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,920
Just say that you have a good friend and a good old friend.

396
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,760
You can't be a stranger.

397
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,480
Please.

398
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,480
Brother Su, what are you doing?

399
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,160
You're sitting here all day.

400
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,040
You're not an ordinary person.

401
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,960
You can't just say you want to see me.

402
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,840
You can't just say you don't want to see me.

403
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,000
I want you to come to the Palace.

404
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,400
I just want to rest.

405
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,640
Then, I'll keep my promise

406
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,920
until I'm free.

407
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,120
I know that

408
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,600
you're always

409
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,280
hardworking in the House of Marquis Li.

410
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,960
I haven't helped you much.

411
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,720
But no matter what,

412
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,040
I can't treat my friends like this.

413
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,840
Brother Su, it's serious.

414
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,080
Her Highness the Empress just wants to see Mr. Su.

415
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,200
It's not like she has anything else.

416
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,320
She just wants to see you.

417
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,000
If she hadn't known that Mr. Su

418
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,160
is a traitor,

419
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,280
what would Her Highness the Empress do

420
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,160
without her permission?

421
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,040
And,

422
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,160
when she received the letter,

423
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,400
Her Highness the Empress was so upset

424
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,280
that she asked Prince Yu to take the blame.

425
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,840
How could you let Mr. Su treat her?

426
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,160
Moreover,

427
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,000
if Her Highness the Empress

428
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,640
has any common favors and favors,

429
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,160
you can let Mr. Su take them or not.

430
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,880
You can't just let your friends

431
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,760
and your friends go to the Palace.

432
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,280
It's not what you want.

433
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,360
Xie Bi,

434
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
I can't help you today.

435
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,720
Brother Su.

436
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,160
Please.

437
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,760
Please.

438
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,800
Please don't blame Xie Bi.

439
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,240
She is the son of the Duke of Ningguo.

440
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,240
She will be in the court.

441
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,760
So Xie Bi

442
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,360
is doing this for Prince Yu?

443
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,600
The Crown Prince of the Palace

444
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,040
has been with Prince Yu for many years.

445
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,760
He has known each other for many years.

446
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,240
Although my father is a high-ranking official,

447
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,000
he has the authority to guard the capital.

448
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,800
But he is always idle and idle.

449
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,080
He is always idle.

450
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,120
What's strange is that

451
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,880
Xie Bi is like Prince Yu.

452
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,560
He is not so stubborn.

453
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,040
The situation in the capital is so chaotic.

454
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,960
The prince of Xie family is involved.

455
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,400
The Duke of Ningguo can keep his idle.

456
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,840
It's so rare.

457
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,280
Yes.

458
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,560
Fortunately, my father can be loyal to the government.

459
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,080
I am also very happy.

460
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,560
100 years of residence

461
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,640
Hurry up!

462
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,720
Your cooks

463
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,200
have great aura.

464
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:28,920
過去

465
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,040
It looks cloudy,

466
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,040
Morke,

467
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,520
without the approval of the adviser,

468
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,400
I will help without Bers ICICLA

469
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,560
to get married.

470
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,200
Welcome a true official who is not realize

471
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,720
of ancestors in the속over of the emperor.

472
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,760
five

473
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,960
Seven Healthcare Prince

474
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,080
Not alleys haven't come yet

475
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Come on, Fei Liu.

476
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
This one.

477
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
Good for you.

478
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,720
I'll wait for you outside the city.

479
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,720
You can go there and beat Fei Liu.

480
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Today is the first day of the dance.

481
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
His Majesty will show his face to the King.

482
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
You should go there.

483
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
It's just a walk.

484
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
What do you mean?

485
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Come on.

486
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Besides,

487
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
the first day of the dance

488
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
is not as hot as it looks.

489
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
We can just go there after lunch.

490
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
That's right.

491
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,720
Next round.

492
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,720
East Sea Night Fist.

493
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720
Night Fist for me.

494
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,720
Night Fist for me.

495
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Night Fist for me.

496
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Good.

497
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Good.

498
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
Good.

499
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
What is this?

500
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
What is this?

501
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
Don't you know how to choose?

502
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
Hurry up.

503
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
Go down and beat the police.

504
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
Please calm down, Your Highness.

505
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
Today is the first day of the dance.

506
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
There will be some mistakes.

507
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
Yijing.

508
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Who is that?

509
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,720
He is the King of Yunnan City,

510
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,720
King Mu Qing.

511
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,720
Sister Ni Huang is very worried

512
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
about her marriage with the dance.

513
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
I'm afraid she is not the Princess.

514
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,720
But this King.

515
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,720
The King of Mu family is very kind.

516
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,720
He is very polite.

517
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
Good.

518
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
Your Highness,

519
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
I'm bored.

520
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
I want to go out for a walk.

521
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,720
I think you can't sit down.

522
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
Good.

523
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

524
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Your Highness.

525
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
Jingrui,

526
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
are you attending the meeting?

527
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Why don't you give me a bow?

528
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Is this one...

529
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,720
Is it for bow?

530
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,720
This one is Mr. Su.

531
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Yes.

532
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
It's really a beautiful and elegant place.

533
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
Jiangzuo is 14 states.

534
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
It's been a long time since it's been so peaceful.

535
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,720
Thanks to the great emperor,

536
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,720
I have been trying to report to His Majesty

537
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,720
to give the great emperor a reward.

538
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
I'm afraid the great emperor is very kind.

539
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
He doesn't have any feelings for it.

540
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,720
I'm afraid he can't move.

541
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
I'm a little bit worried.

542
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,720
It has nothing to do with the great emperor.

543
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,720
I'm afraid you misunderstood.

544
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,720
That's right.

545
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,720
Mr. Su is Mr. Su.

546
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,720
Why are you so shy?

547
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
I heard you are weak.

548
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Don't stand there.

549
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
Mr. Su, please sit.

550
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,720
Mr. Su has come to the capital.

551
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
He is here to recuperate.

552
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,720
I don't know where he has been.

553
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,720
He has been to almost every place.

554
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Luo Shijie, Qingyuefang, Shangxu City.

555
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,720
Where else?

556
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,720
Those are all places you like to play.

557
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,720
Mr. Su is very emotional.

558
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Why is he going to these places?

559
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,720
Mr. Su, the capital is beautiful.

560
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
It's a pity that

561
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,720
most of the people are surrounded by the royal forest.

562
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
If Mr. Su is interested,

563
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,720
why don't you take this token?

564
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,720
It will be very convenient to use it in the future.

565
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
This is...

566
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,720
This is a token that has been covered by the great treasure.

567
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,720
The crown prince is very skilled.

568
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
That's good.

569
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,720
It will be convenient for me to enter and exit the palace.

570
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,720
By the way,

571
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,720
I heard that Mr. Su used to listen to Mr. Li Chong's talk in the past.

572
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,720
I just collected the basic master's manuscript here.

573
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
I don't know if you...

574
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Which book?

575
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Any theory?

576
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,720
Yes.

577
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
Yes, yes, yes.

578
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
It's in my library.

579
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
If you are interested, just come to my house.

580
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,720
No one will dare to stop you.

581
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
Qinghuan,

582
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
you are too petty.

583
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
It's just a basic book.

584
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Since Mr. Su likes it,

585
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
I will give it to Mr. Su.

586
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,720
I will also let Mr. Su go to your mansion.

587
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,720
If you really don't want to,

588
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,720
you can just use this basic book.

589
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Just open it up.

590
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,720
I will buy it and give it to Mr. Su.

591
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,720
I am worried that Mr. Su won't accept it.

592
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,720
If Mr. Su is filial,

593
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,720
I will be the emperor.

594
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
Since you are the real treasure,

595
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
how dare you steal my love?

596
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,720
What do you mean?

597
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,720
With Mr. Su's name,

598
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
if Mr. Su is still alive,

599
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,720
he will be your first disciple.

600
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
This basic book is about Mr. Su's hand.

601
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,720
That's really not enough.

602
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,720
But these books

603
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,720
are all priceless

604
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
in Mr. Su's eyes.

605
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,720
What Mr. Su said just now

606
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,720
is a good example of Mr. Su's responsibility.

607
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
You...

608
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,720
How can you talk to Mr. Su like that?

609
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,720
You are too rude.

610
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
Your Highness.

611
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
What's the matter?

612
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
The Empress Dowager has a decree.

613
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
Your Highness.

614
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
The children you like

615
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
have come to the palace to greet you.

616
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
Is that all?

617
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
They are all good children.

618
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
Ask them to come in.

619
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,720
Yes.

620
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Please wait.

621
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Please come in.

622
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
The palace is open for all.

623
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,720
Please come in.

624
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
We need to meet an old lady.

625
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
If she asks you,

626
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
you can promise

627
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,720
that you won't take your hand.

628
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,720
She will give you the key.

629
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,720
She is the most noble old lady in the world.

630
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
You have to be weird.

631
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Listen to her.

632
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Please.

633
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,720
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

634
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Greetings to the Empress Dowager.

635
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
Greetings to the Empress Dowager.

636
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,720
May you live a long life.

637
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,720
Good.

638
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,720
Get up.

639
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
Good.

640
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,720
Who is this child?

641
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,720
Your Highness.

642
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,720
I just came here to greet you.

643
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
I look so pretty.

644
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,720
Don't you remember me?

645
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,720
You came here two days ago?

646
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,720
What about you?

647
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,720
Who are you?

648
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
Your Highness.

649
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Grandmother.

650
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
This is my child Jing Rui.

651
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,720
The one who was born on the mountain of Rui.

652
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,720
It's Rui.

653
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,720
Are you married?

654
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
Not yet.

655
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
You have to be careful.

656
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
Yes.

657
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Grandmother.

658
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Do you remember me?

659
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Grandmother.

660
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,720
This is my brother's child, Yu Jin.

661
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
He has no rules.

662
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,720
It's Jin.

663
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
Are you married?

664
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Yes.

665
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,720
Good.

666
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Do you have a child?

667
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Not yet.

668
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,720
You have to be careful.

669
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Yes.

670
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
What about you?

671
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
Who is your family?

672
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,720
This must be Mr. Su Zhe.

673
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
Her name is Su Zhe.

674
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
Get up.

675
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Get up.

676
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Come to me.

677
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,720
Uncle.

678
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,720
Come.

679
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,720
Come to me.

680
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Come.

681
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Uncle.

682
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,720
You are thin.

683
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,720
Mr. Su is the world's largest wealth.

684
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,720
Only you can meet the Empress Dowager.

685
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
You can call her Su.

686
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,720
You can call her Mr. Su.

687
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,720
Come, Uncle.

688
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,720
Eat.

689
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,720
This is your favorite.

690
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,720
Come.

691
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,720
Come here.

692
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
Come.

693
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Come here.

694
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,720
Your Majesty.

695
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,720
You are both good children.

696
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,720
When will you get married?

697
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
It's all our fault.

698
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,720
The Empress Dowager made us confused.

699
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,720
I'm confused?

700
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Grandmother.

701
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
The princess is still single.

702
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
She hasn't chosen yet.

703
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,720
You are not the one who is with the child.

704
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
She hasn't chosen yet?

705
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,720
You two

706
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,720
have already made a marriage.

707
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,720
Your Majesty.

708
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
The Empress Dowager

709
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
doesn't need to say it so clearly.

710
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
The Empress Dowager will forget it.

711
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,720
It's important to be happy

712
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
with our old lady.

713
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
You two...

714
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
Grandmother has been sitting for a long time.

715
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
She is tired.

716
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
Take a pill.

717
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,720
Yes.

718
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,720
The Empress Dowager, the Empress Dowager.

719
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,720
We will leave now.

720
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
Yes.

721
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
Su.

722
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,720
You are leaving?

723
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
Uncle.

724
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
The Empress Dowager is leaving.

725
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
You are all leaving.

726
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,720
It's good that you are on the way.

727
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,720
The Crown Prince and Prince Yu

728
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
are not waiting for the child.

729
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
Go back and calm down.

730
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
Yu Ji.

731
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
What is this place?

732
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Be careful.

733
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,720
Mr. Su, please wait.

734
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,720
Princess.

735
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,720
Sister Ninhua.

736
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
Sister Ninhua.

737
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,720
Sister Ninhua.

738
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
Sister Ninhua.

739
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Sister Ninhua.

740
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
But we will leave now.

741
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
Jin Rui.

742
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,720
Let's go.

743
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,720
Fei Liu.

744
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,720
Let's go.

745
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,720
Take care.

746
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,720
What can I do for you?

747
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,720
The room is too messy.

748
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,720
It's not suitable for a man like me.

749
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,720
The wind is cool.

750
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,720
If Mr. Su doesn't mind,

751
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,720
can you come with me?

752
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,720
The room is warm.

753
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720
I think you are in a bad mood.

754
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
I am sorry.

755
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
I hope you can forgive me.

756
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,720
If I say that

757
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
I don't mind,

758
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
will Mr. Su think

759
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,720
you are so lucky?

760
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
No.

761
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
If it's normal,

762
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
I am afraid that your palm will be gone.

763
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,720
You are so thoughtful.

764
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
You are willing to be with me?

765
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,720
Don't you worry

766
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,720
that the Crown Prince and Prince Yu are worried?

767
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,720
I have come to the capital to recuperate.

768
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,720
I won't leave in a short time.

769
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
I won't let those two

770
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
be patient.

771
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,720
It's not a bad thing.

772
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,720
The world is big.

773
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
The world is far away.

774
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,720
I am afraid that

775
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,720
the world is far away.

776
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,720
Mr. Su chooses

777
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,720
the most lively and

778
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,720
most busy place in the capital.

779
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,720
If you don't have any

780
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,720
intention to pursue fame,

781
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,720
who will believe you?

782
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Liang Jing is a good person.

783
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,720
Liang Chen is a good person.

784
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,720
I am also a good person.

785
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,720
I have some merits.

786
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
What do you think?

787
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,720
Since that,

788
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,720
Mr. Su will

789
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,720
choose

790
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,720
the two most lively places

791
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
in the capital.

792
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,720
The King's Mansion

793
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,720
is always a quiet place

794
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,720
for the court.

795
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,720
It's never too far away

796
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,720
from the capital.

797
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,720
Why

798
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,720
do you think

799
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,720
you are so interested

800
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,720
in Su's future?

801
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,720
You are making trouble again?

802
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,720
Look at you.

803
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,720
You are so stupid.

804
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
You are going to kill me.

805
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,720
I will teach you a lesson.

806
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,720
I will teach you a lesson.

807
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,720
I will kill you.

808
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
I will kill you.

809
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,720
I'm a little worried about you.

810
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,720
I'm afraid you'll be fine.

811
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
I'm not worried about you.

812
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,720
I'm just worried about you.

00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,720
