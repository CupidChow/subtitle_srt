Episode 16

2
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,520
Your Highness,

3
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,400
Commander Wen found a secret chamber.

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,440
High...

5
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,720
your highness

6
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,980
looks like my doublekunsheng webinar is illiterate

7
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,480
meanwhile badly hit and computation

8
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,560
met your room seco

9
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,940
lang I thought she placed in a room

10
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,580
how come edict塗里看着看着

11
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,300
list in the middle to the noise

12
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,720
what, the emperor has such a secret anconro

13
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,080
you're right

14
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,660
it has strange reason

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What?

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,780
A while ago, Jiang Zuo Meilang

17
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,080
renovated his house.

18
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,080
I was lucky enough to visit him.

19
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,080
He also has a secret room like yours.

20
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,880
The layout is closely related to your...

21
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,880
...big house.

22
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,880
I don't know if it's a coincidence or...

23
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,880
What do you want to say?

24
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,880
I helped him choose Mr. Su's house.

25
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,880
I know the location of that place best.

26
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
The mansion is in the Qizhen room.

27
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
The mansion is in the Changzhi room.

28
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,960
The two houses are in the same room.

29
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,960
But actually...

30
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,960
It seems that you came to my mansion today...

31
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,960
...not to save the king.

32
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,960
You came here to find the broken wall.

33
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,960
No, no.

34
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
I just suspect...

35
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
...that you want to prove it.

36
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,960
What about after that?

37
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,960
Have you already started to take the enemy...

38
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,960
...and fight for the position of the heir?

39
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Even if I say no,

40
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,960
I'm sure that you won't believe it.

41
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,960
If so,

42
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,960
I'm willing to help you.

43
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
Why?

44
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Maybe because Jiang Zuo Meilang chose you.

45
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,040
I think you're more likely to win.

46
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Maybe because...

47
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,040
...than the crown prince and Prince Yu,

48
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,040
my old friends...

49
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,040
...who are still alive and not alive...

50
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,040
...want to win.

51
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,120
So...

52
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,120
...you want to stand in the same position...

53
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,120
...with your old friends?

54
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,120
Yes.

55
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Please believe my sincerity.

56
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Jingpin, you've been in the palace for years.

57
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,120
But you're not here to think about it.

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,120
I'm here to help you.

59
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,200
But here, you're not here to think about it.

60
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
I really think that...

61
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
...you're not here to help me.

62
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
You're cute.

63
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,200
...and you're not here to fight for the position of the heir?

64
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,200
Yes.

65
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,200
I'm willing to help you.

66
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
But...

67
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,200
...I'm willing to help you.

68
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,200
But...

69
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,200
...I'm willing to help you.

70
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,200
But...

71
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,200
...I'm willing to help you.

72
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,200
But...

73
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,280
...I'm willing to help you.

74
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,280
But...

75
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,280
...you haven't been in the court for a long time.

76
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,280
I remember that only for a year.

77
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,280
Yes.

78
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,280
Twelve years ago...

79
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,280
No. It's already been a year.

80
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,280
It's 13 years.

81
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,760
When that happened,

82
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,680
I was ordered to train in the East Sea.

83
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,640
When I left, I was still in the cold.

84
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,840
When I came back, I was in the capital.

85
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,480
Until now,

86
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,960
I don't know what happened.

87
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,840
Meng Qing,

88
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,920
you were in the army at that time.

89
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,440
Do you know anything?

90
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,120
I only know that Xie Yu should have gone to reinforce the Chiyan Army.

91
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,960
But then I found out

92
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,760
that the King of Qi and the Chiyan commander

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
were planning to collude with the Chiyan army.

94
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,640
Xie Yu reported to His Majesty

95
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,240
that after the execution of the order,

96
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,560
the Chiyan army was besieged.

97
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,960
At that time,

98
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,080
when the Xuanjing Bureau was in peace,

99
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,400
the King of Qi was killed.

100
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,000
The mother Chen Fei hated herself.

101
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,640
He was equally prudent.

102
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,760
So no one else

103
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,920
could come to fight in the reflecting act?

104
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,040
Besides this

105
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,600
famous photographer Ding Demon Zui Yu?

106
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,240
No one can stop him.

107
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,240
The night, the hope, the Consort Chen, the Lin family

108
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,240
all became the last plan.

109
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
Other than that, after you returned to the capital,

110
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,240
you had already asked for the antidote.

111
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,240
No one dared to mention the word, the word, the word, the word.

112
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Yes.

113
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
No one dared to mention it.

114
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
No one dared to mention it.

115
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
But you mentioned it.

116
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,240
There are many people who have mentioned it.

117
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,240
I don't believe that the King of Qi and Lord Chi have a plot.

118
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
No matter how long it takes,

119
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,240
we must find out the truth and return it to them.

120
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Meng Jin,

121
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,240
how many people have died in the previous life?

122
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
No one knows the result.

123
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
Will you follow me?

124
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
No matter how many people die,

125
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,240
no matter how many people die,

126
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
I will follow you.

127
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
I will follow you.

128
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
You are not going to leave me alone?

129
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
No.

130
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,240
You can't leave me alone.

131
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
I will follow you.

132
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
No.

133
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
I will follow you.

134
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
I will follow you.

135
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
I will follow you.

136
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
I will follow you.

137
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
I have been cold-hearted for a year.

138
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,240
I have been old for so many years.

139
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,240
I can't give you any compensation.

140
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,240
But Jingyan is filial.

141
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
You still have the good fortune.

142
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
What His Majesty said is true.

143
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
With Jingyan around,

144
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,240
I am satisfied.

145
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Jingyan is filial and kind.

146
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,240
As long as he is in the capital,

147
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,240
he will come to the palace to greet you.

148
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
As long as I see him,

149
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
I am happy.

150
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Jingyan is a good kid who is kind.

151
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,240
But his temperament is too bad.

152
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
To beat him up,

153
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,240
I didn't give him too many opportunities.

154
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
But don't worry.

155
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
He is my son.

156
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
I will take care of him.

157
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
I will try my best

158
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,240
to not take him out.

159
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Your Majesty,

160
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
as long as the court needs him,

161
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,240
he still needs to go.

162
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
I don't know about the outside world.

163
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
But Jingyan is a prince.

164
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,240
He is responsible for protecting the country.

165
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,240
Although Jingyan doesn't love his mother,

166
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,240
he is always in his heart.

167
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,240
If His Majesty loves him,

168
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,240
he will always be in the capital to greet him.

169
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,240
He will feel that he is not loved.

170
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
You are right.

171
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
Jingyan is a prince.

172
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
No matter how wrong he is,

173
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
he won't be mad at me.

174
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,240
Although the emperor is a father and son,

175
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
he is not too much.

176
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
He is so lucky.

177
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,240
He is like you.

178
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Long is born and old is born.

179
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
His Majesty's princes

180
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,240
are not in the same mood.

181
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,240
Jingpin,

182
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,240
what do you think of Prince Yu?

183
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,240
I think Prince Yu is not too proud

184
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
and he is very generous.

185
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,240
He is a very generous prince.

186
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
I asked you.

187
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Isn't he the same?

188
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
Please forgive me.

189
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,240
I know Prince Yu well.

190
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
I know him very well.

191
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,240
I know Prince Yu very well.

192
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
I heard from the harem once.

193
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
He said he is a prince.

194
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
The harem's wife.

195
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
She knows what she is doing.

196
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,240
These words are all spread out.

197
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Now the court is in a mess.

198
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,240
The ministers are all using her to guard the city.

199
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
She is so virtuous.

200
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,240
Isn't that the reason why His Majesty loves her?

201
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,240
Isn't it the same when the crown prince was in the court?

202
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,240
Your Majesty, please have another drink.

203
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,240
You are so heartless.

204
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
You are talking about the point.

205
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Prince Yu's situation in the court

206
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,240
is more than the crown prince's official period.

207
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
It's going to be smooth.

208
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Jingpin,

209
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
you are so heartless.

210
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
You don't care about anything.

211
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,240
I should learn from you.

212
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
I should learn from you.

213
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
I should learn from you.

214
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Don't be too busy.

215
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Go on.

216
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
Yes.

217
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Jingpin, please accept the gift.

218
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
Congratulations on your loss.

219
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
You are now the princess.

220
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
Thank you.

221
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

222
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Since the crown prince came to the palace,

223
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
he has been so kind and kind.

224
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
He asked the imperial guards to send him back to the Eastern Palace

225
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,240
and the emperor's private house to see the Empress.

226
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
He did it himself.

227
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

228
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,240
The crown prince has been sent back to the Eastern Palace.

229
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,240
But since the imperial guards are so big,

230
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
His Majesty is not going to pursue him anymore.

231
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
In the heart of our emperor,

232
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
it's the most important thing to stabilize the imperial court.

233
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,240
What can people's lives count?

234
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
The Nanchu Group is going to the capital.

235
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,240
Yes.

236
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,240
Jingrui's birthday is finally coming.

237
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,240
The Nanchu Group will be formed.

238
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
The marriage is fixed.

239
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,240
It's the blessing of the two countries.

240
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
The royal son of the emperor, Prince Yu,

241
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
will be the crown prince.

242
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,240
He will be responsible for the military affairs.

243
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,240
I will take the order.

244
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
I don't want to see you today.

245
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
I will send you a message.

246
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
It's not convenient to send the order today.

247
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,240
I will come again to greet you.

248
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Take care, Your Majesty.

249
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Take care, Your Majesty.

250
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Father has come to the Nanchu Group.

251
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,240
What's the point of the imperial decree?

252
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Jingping has been in the palace for so many years.

253
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
It's said that the emperor is old.

254
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,240
It's also a good idea to send a consort.

255
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,240
Don't worry.

256
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
Jingfei and Jingping are not different.

257
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
I didn't put it in my heart.

258
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
I mean the crown prince,

259
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
father allowed him to go back to the Eastern Palace.

260
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
He has the intention of taking revenge.

261
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
But he still continues to do it.

262
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,240
Now he ordered the Nanchu Group to be formed.

263
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
The decree is written in the name of the emperor.

264
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
It's the second time he has been in the palace.

265
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
What do you mean?

266
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
It's not easy to take the emperor with you.

267
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
No prince can do it.

268
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,240
I admire your love.

269
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,240
This time Nanchu Group entered the capital.

270
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,240
In the name of the emperor,

271
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,240
it's said that they will discuss the marriage of princess tomorrow.

272
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
But who doesn't know

273
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,240
that the emperor has already ordered the king to go.

274
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
What else is there to discuss?

275
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,240
It's all reasonable to have a marriage.

276
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,240
We should think from the rational point of view.

277
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
Nanchu is a prince.

278
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
According to our grand etiquette,

279
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,240
the crown prince should be the first to enter.

280
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
The crown prince should be the first to enter.

281
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Exactly.

282
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,240
In this case, the emperor didn't let the crown prince enter.

283
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,240
It doesn't look like he is going to be the first to enter.

284
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
But if you think that

285
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,240
this decree has already shown the prince's identity,

286
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,240
it means more than the prince.

287
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
Come on.

288
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
Brother Xuan.

289
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,240
Are you here?

290
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
Yes, I am.

291
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
I am here.

292
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,240
I am Jin Ling.

293
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Jin Ling?

294
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Brother Xuan,

295
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,240
can we do it this time?

296
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Just relax.

297
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,240
The courtiers of the court said

298
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,240
that your wish will come true.

299
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,240
This is the gift from Nanchu,

300
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,240
the minister of the country.

301
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,240
Nanchu is very good at acting.

302
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,240
He is a good actor.

303
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
How long have you been here?

304
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,240
I haven't been here for a long time.

305
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
How long?

306
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
About a year.

307
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
About a year?

308
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,240
About half a year.

309
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,240
He left Yunnan.

310
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
It's been too long.

311
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,240
Yes.

312
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
The southern center of Xi'an

313
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,240
is a small town in the south.

314
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,240
The princess has not returned to the capital for a long time.

315
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,240
It's hard to return to the capital

316
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,240
because of the rebellion.

317
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
He should go back.

318
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
But

319
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
let's not leave

320
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
two people.

321
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
Your Majesty.

322
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Your Majesty.

323
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,240
The southern center of Xi'an has just entered the capital.

324
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
His Majesty sent me back to Yunnan.

325
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,240
This time, Nanchu is suddenly in the capital.

326
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,240
His Majesty is sure to have a business.

327
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,240
If you are not in the south, how can he rest assured?

328
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
As the decree says,

329
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
the mother is just in the heart.

330
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,240
The empress dowager is reluctant to wait for her.

331
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
So let me go back

332
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,240
and leave Qing'er.

333
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,240
Is this a human system?

334
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,240
In the heart of our emperor,

335
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,240
no one is truly lucky.

336
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
Qing'er is angry.

337
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,240
The people in the house are also angry.

338
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,240
I was the one who called for her.

339
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,240
She is even more stable than them.

340
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,240
You have been alone in the house for many years.

341
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,240
You are much more stable than them.

342
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,240
But you are still worried about Qing, aren't you?

343
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,240
I will not let her be in trouble.

344
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,240
Don't worry.

345
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,240
Brother.

346
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,240
You are going back.

347
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,240
When will we meet again?

348
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,240
In the capital, Mu's Mansion is also a little bit of a crowd.

349
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,240
This yellow and white jade pendant is left by my grandfather.

350
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Even if it is a memorial, Qing'er must be convinced.

351
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,240
Today, I entrust it to my brother.

352
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
I will not forget this.

353
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,240
His Majesty just wants to make a mark.

354
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,240
There is no other meaning.

355
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,240
I am a smart child.

356
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
After you return to the camp,

357
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
take care of yourself.

358
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,240
You don't have to worry too much.

359
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
Brother Yunshu.

360
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,240
Don't you know who I am more worried about?

361
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,240
I am the one who is worried about you.

362
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Do you know who I am more worried about?

363
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
I know.

364
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,240
I really can't help thinking about leaving here,

365
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,240
leaving the capital and leaving everyone.

366
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
Let's go back to Yunnan together.

367
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,240
I am a child of the mountain.

368
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,240
I am a child of the mountain.

369
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
I am worried about being a princess.

370
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,240
I don't want you to do anything else.

371
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
I think...

372
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,240
you are just my brother.

373
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,240
I am a child of the mountain.

374
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,240
I have always hoped for this day.

375
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,240
I have always hoped that I could be your uncle.

376
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
I am a child of the mountain.

377
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
I am a child of the mountain.

378
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,240
I am a child of the mountain.

379
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
I am a child of the mountain.

380
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
I am a child of the mountain.

381
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
I am a child of the mountain.

382
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
I am a child of the mountain.

383
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
I am a child of the mountain.

384
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
I am a child of the mountain.

385
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
I am a child of the mountain.

386
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
I am a child of the mountain.

387
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
I am a child of the mountain.

388
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,240
I am a child of the mountain.

389
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
I am a child of the mountain.

390
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
I am a child of the mountain.

391
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,240
I am a child of the mountain.

392
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
Go, hurry.

393
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,240
Yes, madam.

394
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
Miss, are you okay?

395
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
Go and help Miss.

396
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Yes.

397
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Chief, everything is planned.

398
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,240
No accidents.

399
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
How is she?

400
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,240
Is she pregnant?

401
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
She must not be dead.

402
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
I'm asking about the health of the palace.

403
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,240
No big deal.

404
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
Please rest assured.

405
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Mr. Shisan,

406
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
I'm afraid that you will be in trouble.

407
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
Let Mr. Shisan take good care of her.

408
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
Yes.

409
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Sister, I still can't bear to leave you.

410
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Why don't you stop?

411
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
It's too late.

412
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
Why are you still mad at the child?

413
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
You are a young man.

414
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
I'm not sure.

415
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,240
I don't need to say anything else.

416
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,240
Thank you for coming to see me off.

417
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
Thank you.

418
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
Sister, please take care.

419
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
Thank you.

420
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
The story is about Nanjing.

421
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
Nan Chu and I have a grudge.

422
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
This Prince Ling came here at this time.

423
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
He is not happy.

424
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,240
Nan Chu and Wenxuan met the Princess.

425
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
Is Prince Ling going out?

426
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Yes.

427
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
I'm going to go to the palace.

428
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
I'm going to go to the palace.

429
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,240
I'm going to go to the palace.

430
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Is Prince Ling going out?

431
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
I'm here to see the Princess off.

432
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
You should see her off now.

433
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,240
It's okay. Go back.

434
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
This is...

435
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
It's Prince Mu.

436
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
Please forgive me.

437
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,240
We Chu people

438
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
only know that you are the Princess.

439
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,240
We don't know what Prince Mu is.

440
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
This is a big deal.

441
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
Prince Mu is really lucky.

442
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
What do you usually do?

443
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
I do embroidery.

444
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
You...

445
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
Prince Ling is so handsome.

446
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,240
I've never seen you in the battlefield.

447
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
You are not a warlord.

448
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
Are you

449
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,240
embroidery yourself?

450
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
I'm a good man.

451
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,240
I'm not a warlord.

452
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,240
Prince Mu is the head of the border.

453
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,240
But he has never been in the battlefield.

454
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,240
I'm really envious of him.

455
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
I'm telling you.

456
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,240
I won't believe my sister

457
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,240
after I die.

458
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
If you are a real man,

459
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,240
we will meet in the battlefield.

460
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,240
That's so angry.

461
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Chu Liang and the two countries are together.

462
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
There is no war.

463
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
Even if we don't go to the battlefield,

464
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,240
I won't go to the battlefield.

465
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
So this is a good thing.

466
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Prince Mu is right.

467
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Prince Ling.

468
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
Prince Mu is indeed young.

469
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,240
But he is not as handsome as he is now.

470
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
Prince Ling said that

471
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,240
he won't lead the army to the battlefield.

472
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
In the future,

473
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,240
when Prince Mu leads the army,

474
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,240
you can only embroider yourself in the room.

475
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
If you think about it,

476
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,240
I'm envious of you.

477
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,240
That's what you should do.

478
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,240
Exactly.

479
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,240
What's the trick of a monster?

480
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,240
If you have the guts,

481
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,240
we will compete.

482
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
If you think you can't do it,

483
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,240
you can just call a few of them.

484
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
There are a few of them.

485
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,240
I have the guts.

486
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Liang and the two countries are different.

487
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,240
They like the real battle and don't like the談.

488
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
Prince Ling is still a common man.

489
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
He is a little bit more than a little bit.

490
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,240
Let's cut the real battle off.

491
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
They all say that the Liang people have no style.

492
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,240
I think you two are also Prince Junya.

493
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,240
How can you learn to be so greedy?

494
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
If you don't agree,

495
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
you will be beaten.

496
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
Do you dare to do it?

497
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,240
Today, we are here to give you a ride.

498
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
We are here to fight for victory.

499
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
We are not afraid of you.

500
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,240
Why are you so mean?

501
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,240
Sister, let's go to the court.

502
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,240
We don't need to be so bold.

503
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
Young Master Xiao,

504
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,240
I have a friend.

505
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
He is a big man.

506
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
He wants to ask for a few questions.

507
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
I wonder if he can discuss it.

508
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,240
Prince Ling is really weird.

509
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,240
He has changed his target.

510
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,240
I don't know who he is.

511
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,240
I will call you back anytime.

512
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
Thank you, Young Master Xiao.

513
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,240
Yanyan, Young Master Xiao is in the capital.

514
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Come on.

515
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Your Highness,

516
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
did you see Princess Nanchu?

517
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,240
Fortunately, Father sent me to take her with me.

518
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,240
Otherwise, she would be really bad.

519
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
What do you think?

520
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
I think,

521
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,240
from the appearance,

522
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
the news about the man who was the victim of Nanchu

523
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,240
is true.

524
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,240
What about the Empress Dowager?

525
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
I just remembered.

526
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,240
Nanchu's son was indeed

527
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,240
a friend of Aunt Liya.

528
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,240
I heard that after she left,

529
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,240
Aunt Liya had asked Empress Dowager

530
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,240
to let her go with her son.

531
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,240
But why did she suddenly marry Xie Yu?

532
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
I was so confused.

533
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
Your Highness,

534
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,240
I have a news.

535
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,240
What news?

536
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,240
Last night, I saved someone in Hongxiu.

537
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
Who?

538
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,240
Niao Yinfang's palace maid.

539
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
You never know

540
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,240
what the real identity of this palace maid is.

541
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
That's great.

542
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
That's great.

543
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,240
With these silverware,

544
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
it's the perfect time to take Xie Yu.

545
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,240
I should have told Mei Changsu

546
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,240
to let her come to help us.

547
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,240
Left.

548
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,240
I've said it three times.

549
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,240
I can't hang up here today.

550
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Xiaochu.

551
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
Brother Meng, what can I do for you?

552
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
Princess Liya has gone back to Yunnan today.

553
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
I'll come and see you.

554
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
Princess Liya,

555
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,240
I've brought you the things.

556
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
Have a look.

557
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
This is the jade pendant that Master Huo dropped.

558
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,240
It's rare to see it in the palace.

559
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
It's the protective list

560
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
that you ordered.

561
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
Ten of them.

562
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
Okay.

563
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Yes.

564
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
What are you doing?

565
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,240
It's my birthday today.

566
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,240
I prepared it for her.

567
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,240
You've made up your mind.

568
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,240
Take Xie Yu out of the jade pendant.

569
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,240
This situation is not good.

570
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Everyone is in the past.

571
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
Take Xie Yu out of the jade pendant is inevitable.

572
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,240
I shouldn't have any hesitation.

573
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
What's hesitation?

574
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,240
There's a mess in the court.

575
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,240
If we want to remove it,

576
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
we'll have to go to the top.

577
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
Unfortunately, I'm too busy.

578
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,240
I can't think of a better way.

579
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,240
There's no perfect thing in the world.

580
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
Don't think too much.

581
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
Fei Liu.

582
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,240
Brother Meng.

583
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,240
Brother Meng.

584
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
The person who has the most innocent

585
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
is Jing Rui.

586
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
Unfortunately,

587
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,240
the best medicine in the world

588
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,240
is to save lives.

589
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,240
But it can't bring happiness to people.

590
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,240
I'm Xiao Jing Rui from the Nings.

591
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,240
Princess Nanchu, Yuwen Nian.

592
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,240
Please.

593
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
Please.

594
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
Please.

595
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,240
Yuwen Nian.

596
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
Yuwen Nian.

597
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,240
Is he the disciple of Yue Xiu Ze?

598
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,240
Is Yue Xiu Ze in the hands of Nanchu?

599
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
I didn't hear you.

600
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,240
Yue Xiu Ze is not a general master of the martial arts.

601
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
He is the master of Nanchu.

602
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,240
He is a noble figure.

603
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
If he comes with us,

604
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
he will be in the list.

605
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,240
Since he's not here,

606
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,240
he should be here.

607
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
The wolf-hunting master of the year,

608
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240
Yue Xiu Ze ranked 6th.

609
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,240
I heard that he has defeated

610
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,240
the top 5 gold-dolls in the ranking.

611
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,240
The next target

612
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,240
must be the sky-high mountain villa.

613
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,240
The top of the mountain.

614
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
I think he must be here.

615
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,240
He's just not here.

616
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
Yue Xiu Ze.

617
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,240
Please.

618
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,240
Mr. Xiao is a good man.

619
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,240
I have a lot of respect for the sky-high mountain villa.

620
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,240
I'm the one who defeated Mr. Xiao

621
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
in today's battle.

622
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,240
I'm not the one who defeated the sky-high mountain villa.

623
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,240
Please tell the master of the mountain villa

624
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
to make an appointment.

625
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,240
I'm the master of the mountain villa.

626
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,240
I'm the one who defeated the sky-high mountain villa.

627
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,240
I'll make a decision.

628
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
Mr. Xiao.

629
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
Yan Lin.

630
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
Let's go.

631
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
Let's go.

632
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,240
Jingrui.

633
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,240
Is it possible that

634
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
Master Zhuo and Yue Xiu Ze

635
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
have made an appointment?

636
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
My father and Yue Xiu Ze

637
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
have been in the battle twice.

638
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
Even if they have made an appointment

639
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,240
they won't be able to afford it.

640
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,240
Yue Xiu Ze is a master of the mountain villa.

641
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,240
He's not a famous person

642
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
since he joined the army.

643
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,240
It's only possible that

644
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,240
he's not a martial artist.

645
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
He's a master who wants to challenge

646
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,240
the master of the mountain villa.

647
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,240
Master Zhuo and Master Zhuo

648
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,240
have been in the martial arts world

649
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,240
for more than ten years.

650
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,240
They won't be able to afford it.

651
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,240
I'm not worried.

652
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
The evil cloud sword and my sky-high mountain villa

653
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,240
are not the same.

654
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,240
Besides,

655
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,240
Yue Xiu Ze has improved.

656
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,240
My father and I

657
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,240
haven't been in the battle for a year.

658
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
I'm just curious about this idea.

659
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
Why did he come here

660
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,240
and compete with me?

661
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,240
What's so strange?

662
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240
He's the legendary of the evil cloud sword.

663
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
You're the legendary of the sky-high mountain villa.

664
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,240
Master Zhuo has been trying to

665
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,240
compete with Master Zhuo.

666
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
Let's have a look at

667
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,240
the skill of the sky-high mountain villa

668
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,240
and how it works.

669
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,240
It's a pity that I can't

670
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,240
see the battle of the sky-high mountain villa.

671
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
I hope you can

672
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,240
understand it.

673
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,240
I will.

674
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Don't worry.

675
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
It won't take long

676
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,240
for His Majesty to return.

677
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,240
You don't have to worry.

678
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,240
Yunnan is not a world

679
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,240
that can be seen by the sun.

680
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,240
Everyone,

681
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
stay here.

682
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,240
Jingrui.

683
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,240
Sister Dong.

684
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
I heard from Commander Meng

685
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,240
that you invited him to go on a birthday party.

686
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,240
Yes.

687
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,240
I was talking to Su Zhai

688
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,240
that day.

689
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,240
Commander Meng suddenly said

690
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,240
he would come.

691
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,240
I had to

692
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,240
go to the invitation.

693
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,240
Why didn't you invite him?

694
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,240
Sister Dong.

695
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
You...

696
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,240
You want to go too?

697
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,240
I don't want to go.

698
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,240
I don't want to go.

699
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,240
I don't want to go.

700
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,240
I don't want to go.

701
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,240
I don't want to go.

702
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
I don't want to go.

703
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
I don't want to go.

704
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
I don't want to go.

705
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,240
You want to go too?

706
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,240
Sister Dong.

707
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,240
I can't go.

708
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
Sure.

709
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
Of course.

710
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
Chief.

711
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,240
Prince Yu is here.

712
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
It's been a long time.

713
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
Prince Yu is finally here.

714
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,240
Please go to the study.

715
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,240
Prince Yan, you are here.

716
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,240
Are you ready, Miss Gong?

717
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,240
I'm ready to start.

718
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
I've already packed up.

719
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
Please, Prince Yan.

720
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,240
Prince Yan.

721
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
Miss Gong.

722
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,240
You are indeed a talented person.

723
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,240
You are a guest for the birthday party.

724
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,240
You will definitely kill half of the people in the capital.

725
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,240
Prince Yan is too much.

726
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,240
Please come to pick me up.

727
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,240
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your skills.

728
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,240
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your skills.

729
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your skills.

730
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,240
No, no.

731
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,240
This kind of chance of protecting flowers is very rare.

732
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,240
Anyway, Jingrui and Xie Bi can't get me.

733
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
Prince Yan is always so busy.

734
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,240
The carriage is ready.

735
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,240
Miss Gong, please.

736
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,240
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your skills.

737
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,240
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your skills.

738
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,240
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your skills.

739
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,240
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your skills.

740
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,240
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your skills.

741
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,240
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your skills.

742
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,240
I'm sorry for the poor quality of your skills.

743
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,240
