Episode 13

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,400
Among the people I am here with,

3
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,280
these are the best in the Qing Palace.

4
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,120
They are also the masters of drug addiction.

5
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,440
Chief Mei,

6
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,800
you can do whatever you want.

7
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,480
Thank you, Master.

8
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,760
Have a good rest today.

9
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,360
I will give you a detailed review

10
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,720
of how to do it tomorrow.

11
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,640
Thanks lot.

12
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,800
Yes.

13
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,280
Soldier- tastes is great,

14
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,840
you should guess it as just one egg.

15
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,640
Cut it out,

16
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,040
you shouldn't had tried...

17
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,040
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,040
This is not a simple action.

19
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
If we don't take it seriously,

20
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,040
I'm afraid that we'll be in trouble for a while.

21
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
I've thought about it.

22
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,040
Such a dangerous action

23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040
could be done by someone.

24
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,040
If someone gets hit that day,

25
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,040
you'll say that it's the person who's the King of the Valley.

26
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Don't involve anyone else.

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
Anyway, I'm the King of the Valley.

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,040
I'm the King of the Valley, the King of the Heavenly High.

29
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
I'm the King of the Valley.

30
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
I can afford it.

31
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
They can't afford it.

32
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Why are you here, Fei Liu?

33
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
How did you come in?

34
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Burn it.

35
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Fei Liu, are you sure that you're going to burn it?

36
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,040
Why don't you let me open it and see what's written inside?

37
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
You're so cute.

38
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,040
The King of the Valley, the King of the Valley?

39
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Then you have to think of a way.

40
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Look.

41
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,040
I've burned it.

42
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Where did you go?

43
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,040
I wanted to go to Xuanjing Temple to see Wei Zheng.

44
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
But Xia Jiang blocked me.

45
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
He seemed to be unhappy with me.

46
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,040
I think at this time,

47
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Xia Shou Zun wouldn't let anyone know

48
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
that he and the King are connected.

49
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Especially his three disciples.

50
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Xuanjing Temple is a secluded place.

51
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,040
You don't want to be a pawn.

52
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Each of them is very independent.

53
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
Although Xia Jiang is the King of the Valley,

54
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,040
he can't be so bold and bold.

55
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,040
So what news do you have to tell Xia Shou Zun?

56
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,040
It's better to tell him through the four seasons.

57
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Second HD.

58
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Make it quick.

59
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Enter theلي JuliaSichung994466 throat젎ㅋㅋ

60
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,040
How did you break into fourth sister?

61
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
Is she not willing to help me?

62
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,040
All she says is that we shouldridge the tenet of kowtow loyalty.

63
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,040
If he hadn't mentioned that to Xia Jiang,

64
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,040
he'd only been mentioned in the Japanese media bubble.

65
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,040
I'd put such a Hawker in the hands of him already!

66
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,040
I know that you have a lot of troubles.

67
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,040
But Xia Jiang is too much of a person.

68
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,040
I'm no longer a bad person.

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,040
I'm also an old man.

70
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Even if he leaves, he won't betray me.

71
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,040
So please forgive him.

72
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,040
I'll give him another chance to follow my path.

73
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,040
But remember, it's all because of you.

74
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

75
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Miss Qin is here too.

76
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,040
We are all sisters. We don't need to see each other.

77
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,040
I don't know that you have business with Miss Qin.

78
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,040
You came in here so well.

79
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,040
I hope you don't mind.

80
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,040
You are the princess. You can come to my study anytime.

81
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Who will blame you?

82
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,040
If there's nothing important, I'll leave first.

83
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Please forgive me.

84
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,040
How is the palace today?

85
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Her Highness said that Consort Jing got a gift from the banquet.

86
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,040
She has been giving gifts these days.

87
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,040
But since the first day, she has been in the palace for years.

88
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,040
She has been in the palace for three days.

89
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
I don't know why.

90
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,040
What else can be wrong?

91
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,040
You are busy with your own affairs.

92
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,040
There's another thing.

93
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,040
Your Highness, let me tell Your Highness.

94
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,040
What is it?

95
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Her Highness the Empress got a secret report from the palace.

96
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,040
She said Consort Jing is in her bedroom.

97
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,040
She has set up a place for Consort Chen.

98
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
She has been in the palace for decades.

99
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
A place for Consort Chen?

100
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,040
This is a big deal.

101
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Consort Jing is really on her own.

102
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,040
She is the most important assistant of Prince Jing.

103
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Prince Jing must be very upset with her.

104
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,040
She is no longer in the position to be a law.

105
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,040
What is the plan for Her Highness the Empress?

106
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Her Highness the Empress knows that she is very resourceful.

107
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,040
She is afraid of being caught by the snakes and not being able to catch them.

108
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,040
So she ordered me to tell you

109
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,040
that we must meet outside the palace.

110
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,040
We must meet at the right time.

111
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
Good.

112
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,040
Good.

113
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,040
You don't need to worry about Her Highness the Empress.

114
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,040
I think Consort Jing will be in trouble if she doesn't die.

115
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,040
This woman is really like her son.

116
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
She is so silly.

117
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Young Master Yan.

118
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Is Prince Ji here?

119
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Yes.

120
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Prince Jing is in a hurry. Please.

121
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
That's great.

122
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,040
I have discussed all the details about the operation.

123
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,040
I have discussed it with everyone repeatedly.

124
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
To ensure that everything is fine,

125
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
I want to save the route of the operation

126
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,040
and recommend it to everyone.

127
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,040
The operation will start at 5 o'clock tomorrow.

128
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,040
Xuanjing Temple is the most secure place to stay.

129
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
After we meet outside the palace,

130
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,040
she will take you to the main gate.

131
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
Prince.

132
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Yes.

133
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,040
You take the food.

134
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
Stay outside and prepare the reception.

135
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Yes.

136
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Zheng Xuting.

137
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Yes.

138
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
You take the food and leave the place at 3 o'clock.

139
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
Yes.

140
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Tomorrow,

141
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Xia Jiang, Xia Chun and Xia Qiu

142
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
will not be in Xuanjing Temple.

143
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
You will be very successful in the beginning.

144
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,040
But even if the young master is slow,

145
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,040
you can only rush to the outskirts of the dungeon.

146
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,040
The palace will start from this moment.

147
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Remember,

148
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,040
Xia Dong will not help you.

149
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
He will only watch over you.

150
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
What you want to do is to take everything

151
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
and rush to the inner courtyard

152
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
and reach the corresponding location.

153
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Finish the mission and then rush out.

154
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
Did the poison we prepared

155
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
work at this time?

156
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
That's right.

157
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,040
At this time, I thank all the brothers of the Demon King Valley.

158
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
Xuanjing Temple has many soldiers.

159
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
The terrain is relatively narrow.

160
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,040
The poison can be used to make a huge difference.

161
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,040
You are all good at choosing the right one.

162
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Once the other has the Song Xie,

163
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
you will have the opportunity to be able to attack.

164
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Little Yu Jin,

165
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
you finally come to visit me.

166
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
You all go down.

167
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Yes.

168
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,040
I only have good things to show you.

169
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
Well.

170
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
How is it?

171
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,040
It's a new moon.

172
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Where did you get it from?

173
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Sit down.

174
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
Sit down.

175
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
Listen to me.

176
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,040
The Empress Dowager and the Empress Dowager

177
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,040
almost all the rooms are closed.

178
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,040
I found some top musicians

179
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
who came to my house.

180
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
They also came out of the county.

181
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
I thought that

182
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,040
you are the only one who can meet the Empress Dowager.

183
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,040
Your Highness, you always praise me.

184
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,040
You are a wonderful person who knows the music and the wine.

185
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Come, come, come.

186
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
Come on, drink.

187
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
Of course, I know.

188
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Your ears are always raised by the Miaoyin House.

189
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
The better the music is,

190
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,040
the more obvious it is to you.

191
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,040
What's wrong with the royal court?

192
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,040
I'm afraid that the one who has the music

193
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
in her hand is not just me.

194
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,040
Miaoyin House, Miaoyin House.

195
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
What a pity.

196
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,040
How did they steal it?

197
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
You believe it too.

198
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,040
You mean that Miaoyin House didn't steal the bandit?

199
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,040
Steal the bandit?

200
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
Which bandit did they steal?

201
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Is there a name?

202
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
Is there a crime in the Ministry of Justice?

203
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
Who is the main person?

204
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
Is there a根據?

205
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
There is no need to have a father.

206
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
Since they have wronged me,

207
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
why did the people in Miaoyin House

208
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,040
have to make a promise to avoid the crime?

209
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
It's simple.

210
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
It's a fake.

211
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,040
It's true that they offended people.

212
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,040
They offended people who couldn't afford to offend them.

213
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,040
If they don't run away, they will be killed.

214
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
No way.

215
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Who dares to be so arrogant?

216
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Your Highness, who was the one who went to arrest them?

217
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Who was the one?

218
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Who was the one?

219
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Your Highness, you don't know, right?

220
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,040
I heard it from the first and second.

221
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,040
It was a military officer who used the Dali Temple.

222
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,040
The one who ordered it was the little old man named Zhu Yue.

223
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,040
Did that Zhu Yue

224
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,040
hurt any other people?

225
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Now you understand.

226
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Zhu Yue's heart is all over the city.

227
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
Miss Gong just can't stand her.

228
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
You should hide for a while

229
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
and find a way out.

230
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,040
That's not right.

231
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
Miss Gong's heart...

232
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Why do you seem to be in a hurry?

233
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
Xiao Yu Jin,

234
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,040
did you hide it?

235
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
I...

236
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
I didn't.

237
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Your Highness, don't talk nonsense.

238
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
I'm so happy.

239
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
To be honest,

240
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,040
how is she now?

241
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,040
I really miss her.

242
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
When the time comes,

243
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
we must act quickly.

244
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
Once we get out of here,

245
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
we'll be fine.

246
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
When we get out,

247
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
the place is empty.

248
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
It's just right in front of Xuanjing Temple.

249
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
How can we say we'll be fine?

250
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
Tomorrow,

251
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
at the Taekang Da Dao,

252
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,040
the security guard will be near Xuanjing Temple

253
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
to show up.

254
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
When you get out,

255
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Xu Fang Yin will also

256
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,040
catch her in front of Xuanjing Temple.

257
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,040
When the two teams are together,

258
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
the scene will be chaotic.

259
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
You can imagine.

260
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,040
The scene will be very chaotic.

261
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
I hope everyone here

262
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,040
can leave tomorrow.

263
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Don't leave any of them.

264
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Understand?

265
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Yes.

266
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Your Highness, don't think too much.

267
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,040
Actually, I didn't hide Miss Gong Yu.

268
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,040
It's just that after she escaped,

269
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,040
she was in a difficult situation and asked me to help her.

270
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040
I was already a guard.

271
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
But she's doing well now.

272
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,040
She even made a new song.

273
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
When I gave her the gift of the New Year,

274
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
she listened to it quietly.

275
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Take me to see her.

276
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Take me to see her.

277
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
How can we say that we're old friends?

278
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
When she's in trouble,

279
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
I can't go to see her.

280
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
But...

281
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
But what?

282
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
What are you afraid of?

283
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,040
You're afraid of that pig?

284
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,040
That brat can't be put in my eyes.

285
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,040
Even if Prince Yu knows,

286
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,040
he can't be turned over because of this.

287
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,040
After all, I'm his elder.

288
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
Your Highness,

289
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,040
actually,

290
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
there's nothing to take you there.

291
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,040
It's just that Miss Gong Yu is in a deep state of depression.

292
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,040
I'm afraid she doesn't want to see you anymore.

293
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,040
What are you talking about?

294
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,040
What kind of person am I?

295
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
Can I be like those people?

296
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,040
I can't go on like this.

297
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
Let's go.

298
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Let's go now.

299
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,040
Your Highness, don't worry.

300
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,040
It's already late.

301
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
Alright, alright.

302
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,040
I can't stand you anymore.

303
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,040
I'll just take care of Miss Gong Yu.

304
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
I'll take you there tomorrow.

305
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Let's talk.

306
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Master,

307
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
the Marquis of Yan's mansion just sent someone to send a letter.

308
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
He said that he needs to know about it.

309
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
Look.

310
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
It's Yan Que?

311
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Yes.

312
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Master, what's the matter?

313
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,040
Yan Que asked me to come to the city tomorrow

314
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,040
to have a meeting with the Marquis of Yan.

315
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Tomorrow?

316
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Marquis of Yan and you

317
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
haven't been here for years.

318
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
But now that you're here,

319
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
I'm afraid that's not his purpose.

320
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
No matter what his purpose is,

321
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,040
I have to go.

322
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,040
Why?

323
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,040
He said that he has the most memorable news of me.

324
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Master,

325
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,040
does Yan Que know about the Marquis of Yan?

326
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
It's been more than ten years

327
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,040
since he's been here.

328
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,040
I'm afraid that's not his purpose.

329
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
It's not his purpose.

330
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,040
I have to go.

331
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,040
I'll go with you.

332
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
Are you ready?

333
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Yes, Master.

334
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Yu Jin.

335
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
Father.

336
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Are you ready?

337
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,040
Yes.

338
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
We can leave now.

339
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
Let's go.

340
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
Yes.

341
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Let's go.

342
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
Yes.

343
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,040
These days,

344
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
I'm impressed

345
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
by the way you played the military tactics.

346
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
I really admire you.

347
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Actually, there's no difference

348
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
between this battle.

349
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
I know the bottom line

350
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
of the enemy

351
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,040
based on the terrain of the battle.

352
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,040
And I can play the military tactics

353
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
in the process of battle.

354
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
I'm sure that

355
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
you can play the military tactics

356
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,040
based on the terrain of the battle.

357
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,040
These are the basic methods

358
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
of using troops.

359
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
Do you dare to ask

360
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,040
if Master Mei has ever been to Dagozhang?

361
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
It's a pity

362
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
that you can't

363
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,040
lead troops like this.

364
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Brother.

365
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,040
It's the first day of the day.

366
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
You're going to Mount Gu today.

367
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
I've only seen him once a year.

368
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,040
I don't want to lose him.

369
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
You know

370
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
what your intention is.

371
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
The mountain is big.

372
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
I'll add more.

373
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
By the way,

374
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
there's something

375
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
that I want to trouble you.

376
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
What is it?

377
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
I'm sorry.

378
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
I just found an important witness

379
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
in a case.

380
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
He lives in Chizang Town,

381
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
North Street.

382
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
His name is Jiaxi.

383
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
I'm afraid that he'll be around

384
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
in the future.

385
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
So,

386
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
can you please

387
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,040
take care of him

388
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
and bring him back to me

389
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
to be safe

390
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
and sound?

391
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Leave this matter to me.

392
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Don't worry.

393
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
I won't be wrong.

394
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Thank you, brother.

395
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
I'm sorry.

396
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
I'll leave now.

397
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
Let's go out together.

398
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
Okay.

399
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Your Highness.

400
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Everything is ready.

401
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
Thank you, brother.

402
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
What did brother and sister say?

403
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Let's have a toast

404
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
for Nie Feng.

405
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
My Lord.

406
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
My Lord.

407
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
My Lord.

408
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
I didn't say that you'd come today.

409
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
It's a big day.

410
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
I didn't prepare anything.

411
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
It's okay.

412
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
I just need to find a room

413
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,040
and prepare some hot tea.

414
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
I need to bring an old friend.

415
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
Yes.

416
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Brother Xia.

417
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
I can't find the Hanzhong Temple.

418
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
There are many places to go.

419
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
Brother Xia is coming here

420
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
and he's even more late

421
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
than my car.

422
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
Yan Zhi is not Yan Hou.

423
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
You should go first.

424
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
I brought you here

425
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
to kneel.

426
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Why are you following me?

427
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Hurry up.

428
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Father.

429
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Are you really going to kneel?

430
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,040
I'll kneel for two days.

431
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
My Lord.

432
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,040
I'll take my leave.

433
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,040
Father.

434
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
The baby got into a bad condition.

435
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
It was a little bit bitter.

436
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
I think Yu Jin is fine.

437
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
He's quite similar

438
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
to Yan Hou when he was young.

439
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Brother Xia.

440
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
There aren't any toys

441
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
like this when I was young.

442
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
But the children

443
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
always grow too fast.

444
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
If Brother Xia's children are still alive,

445
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,040
I'm afraid that the three of them will be similar to Yu Jin.

446
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,040
Did you ask me to stand here and talk?

447
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
How dare you!

448
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Brother Xia, you're too much.

449
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
Your Highness.

450
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
You're orderly.

451
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,040
Please find a source to enter the palace today.

452
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,040
And stay with His Majesty.

453
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Enter the palace?

454
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
Is there anything you're afraid of?

455
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
Since you want to have his help in the palace,

456
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
I'm sure you'll have his help.

457
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Is it today?

458
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
Yes.

459
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,040
The tea in the coffin is called Yi Jue.

460
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
I'll have some tea.

461
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,040
Brother Xia, please have a taste.

462
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Marquis Yan said that

463
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,040
knowing the way I've been thinking about

464
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
is like having a child.

465
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
Back then,

466
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,040
you were so eager to marry the princess of the Hua Clan.

467
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,040
You were so eager to marry her.

468
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,040
You were so eager to marry her.

469
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,040
You were so eager to marry her.

470
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
As for your wife,

471
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,040
you were so eager to marry her.

472
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,040
Although you've been married for many years,

473
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,040
you're still your own son.

474
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,040
You're still your own son.

475
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,040
You're not the wife of the Hua Clan

476
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,040
who's been married to the same family.

477
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,040
This is my family business.

478
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
Marquis Yan, please take care of it.

479
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,040
If you really don't need me to take care of it,

480
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
why do you have to come here?

481
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
I just wanted to ask you something.

482
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,040
Since you didn't tell me

483
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
where my son was,

484
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
why did you say that today?

485
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,040
I thought

486
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,040
we didn't want to tell you the truth.

487
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,040
Actually, you're wrong.

488
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
Since Madam Sun left,

489
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,040
she didn't tell anyone about his whereabouts.

490
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Really?

491
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Yes.

492
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
I think he must be very anxious.

493
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Think about it for him.

494
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,040
He saved the palace of the kingdom

495
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,040
because he was kind at that time.

496
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,040
He loved the family and loved the family.

497
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,040
But he didn't want to have

498
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,040
such a person who would be so willing to give up.

499
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
He didn't have a heart to give up.

500
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,040
Later,

501
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
he realized that

502
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,040
you two didn't have a chance.

503
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
But you didn't want to give up.

504
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,040
That's why he took the son out of the palace.

505
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,040
He hid his whereabouts.

506
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
I think

507
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,040
we should talk to him.

508
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

509
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040
Eunuch Gao,

510
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,040
how are you feeling today?

511
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
I'm fine.

512
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,040
I'm not feeling well this year.

513
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
I'm a little nervous.

514
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
I'm happy to see

515
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
the new piece of chess in Nanzhou.

516
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
Since that,

517
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
why did you invite me out today?

518
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Please listen to me.

519
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,040
When Madam Zun left,

520
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
she didn't tell anyone about her whereabouts.

521
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,040
It's true.

522
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,040
But

523
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
just five years ago,

524
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,040
she still brought me some news.

525
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
Why did she give it to you?

526
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
I'm afraid you were kicked out

527
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
because of the old people in the capital.

528
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,040
I'm the only one left.

529
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,040
Did you forget

530
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
your own handwritten letter?

531
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
What did she say?

532
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
She said she was seriously ill.

533
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
I'm afraid she didn't have much time.

534
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
I think she had a problem with her health.

535
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,040
She was so ill that she could only take one or two days off.

536
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,040
What else?

537
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,040
And Ling Lang was still in a bad mood.

538
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
He was still young.

539
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Do you think I'll believe you?

540
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
No.

541
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
Brother.

542
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,040
The letter is here.

543
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Do you believe it?

544
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
You two are brothers and sisters.

545
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
Even without the couple's feelings,

546
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,040
you should still recognize her.

547
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,040
I have one last thing to say.

548
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,040
You can keep on thinking.

549
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,040
Why didn't you tell me at that time?

550
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,040
The letter was written to me.

551
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,040
She didn't let me tell you on the letter.

552
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
So

553
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,040
did the content on the letter tell you

554
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
when and when

555
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
I decided to do it?

556
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
When I got the letter,

557
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,040
I didn't want to say anything.

558
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,040
But I suddenly wanted to say it today.

559
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,040
That's it.

560
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
Master.

561
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
Master.

562
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Calm down.

563
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
Master.

564
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Master Yan.

565
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
If I'm not mistaken,

566
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,040
Prince Jing is going to jail us today.

567
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,840
Master Bang, Shanghai maintaining master

568
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,940
Rebecca Lee, Shanghai

569
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:28,460
noodles,

570
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,620
to the Young Master.

571
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,740
It's Young Master Kang and Young Master Tang.

572
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,420
Go and bring them to Dongyue to see me.

573
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,340
Yes.

574
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,060
After you.

575
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:12,820
Go!

576
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:32,060
The most exciting game online is

577
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,460
Ma Jiang Hu Le

578
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,060
Ma Jiang Hu Le 2

579
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,660
The Queen of the Rally

580
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,260
The King of the Rally

581
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,360
The Queen of the Rally

582
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,860
The Queen of the Rally

583
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,260
The Queen of the Rally

584
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,260
The Queen of the Rally

585
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,060
The Queen of the Rally

586
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,460
The Queen of the Rally

587
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:51,160
The Queen of the Rally

588
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:57,160
The Queen of the Rally

589
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,760
The Rally?

590
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,260
Of course, it's the Rally of the Rally

591
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,660
The one who saved the King of the Rally

592
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,560
What do you mean?

593
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,060
The King of the Rally is not a bad person

594
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,560
If you hadn't taken me away from the King of the Rally

595
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,560
I wouldn't dare to do it

596
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,760
It's been a long time since I came here

597
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,760
I've been thinking about you drinking a cup of tea

598
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,760
I don't know when Marquis Yan started to do things for the King of the Rally

599
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,760
You've been pretending to be the truth these years

600
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Even I really thought you had been disobeyed

601
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Brother Xia

602
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,760
Since you thought you were a few-fold ill, you still haven't changed

603
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,760
I think for you, maybe in this world

604
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,760
You haven't decided the crime yet

605
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,760
Only the crime you didn't think of

606
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,360
But the crime of holding the crime of being a traitor

607
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,560
You have no reason to be at fault with a King

608
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,160
Xia Jiang

609
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,160
Don't you think your idea is a bit crazy?

610
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,560
Did I wrong her?

611
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,560
Did she dare not to seek justice?

612
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,060
To be honest, I was really afraid she would go back to the Rally

613
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,760
To be the father and the son-in-law

614
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,860
But I believe in the King of the Rally

615
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,860
But I won't let her down

616
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,260
As you said, the King of the Rally

617
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,760
She will

618
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,060
But think about it, she's not a fool

619
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,660
Your idea of the Rally is like a dragon's talk

620
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:58,460
I'm afraid she would be too much to do it

621
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,260
So you're the one who asked Lord Yan to leave me?

622
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,460
Maybe it's not just me

623
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,260
Master, Dong'er has already asked Xia Qiu to help him

624
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,860
I believe that these two are not helping him

625
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,660
If Xia Chun doesn't come with me today

626
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,160
You guys should have a way to lure him out of the city

627
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,060
Gao Jie is not here

628
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,060
The King of the Rally is alone

629
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,260
Maybe there's a chance of winning

630
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,860
I remember it was many years ago

631
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,360
You just made a mistake

632
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,560
Not like now, you always bring your imagination to reality

633
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,760
Why are you suddenly like this now?

634
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,460
Are we too late?

635
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,160
Or are you changing too quickly?

636
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,960
Is it really just my imagination?

637
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,560
Chun'er, explain to Lord Yan

638
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,160
Yes

639
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:26,380
Lord Yan, Lord Jing has already taken the Daoist

640
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:32,160
But these two days, Lord Jing has added two times

641
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,760
The amount of military supplies he has set up in my side

642
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:42,560
What a pity, Lord Jing has won a battle

643
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,660
I'm actually encouraging him

644
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,960
I'm going to fight him and give him a chance

645
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,060
To strengthen his confidence

646
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,160
To make him feel that he has the hope to save the people

647
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,060
Especially when he has an inner strength

648
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:48,560
Why did Xia Dong suddenly start to suspect me?

649
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,560
I still don't understand

650
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,260
But this time he's helping me instead

651
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,060
Did he help you?

652
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,660
I was originally worried that Lord Jing's confidence

653
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:17,060
I was originally worried that Lord Jing's confidence would not be enough

654
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,760
If Xia Dong had it, he could have helped him

655
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,860
I'm not fighting in the dungeon's position

656
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,660
To defend the military supplies

657
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,560
If Lord Jing wants to know something, I will tell him through Xia Dong

658
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,960
If I had a secret ally like me

659
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,460
Lord Jing would definitely feel that the plan is very smooth

660
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,760
The success has already been held in his hands

661
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,760
Are you saying that?

662
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,160
Xia Xun's words just now

663
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,660
Isn't it too exaggerated?

664
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,760
The dungeon of Xuanjing Temple is indeed a high-level strategy

665
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,360
But now, the main point of the progress is no longer there

666
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,860
If there is a hidden reason for Xia Dong's actions

667
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,960
There is a possibility of a breakthrough

668
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,160
Aren't you really not afraid that your own disciple will take someone to the dungeon

669
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,160
And put Wei Zheng away?

670
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,460
That's right

671
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,960
You are talking about a difficult topic

672
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,460
I know the disciple I taught

673
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,460
He indeed has the ability to take them to the dungeon

674
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,960
But Yan Hou

675
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,560
You think that if you break through the dungeon, you will find Wei Zheng?

676
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,160
No...

677
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,400
They must be알 Kolubel's otherwise

678
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,660
What to do

679
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,760
I can only wait like this?

680
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,760
You have your own battlefield.

681
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
It's a pity that I'm a good dungeon.

682
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,760
There's no place to hide today.

683
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,760
I'm just not satisfied with the fire.

684
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,760
I'm not satisfied.

685
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
As long as you hide from the next door.

686
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,760
Master, you haven't said that there's a fire.

687
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
Because you can't let this matter know.

688
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,760
Of course, I won't let you know.

689
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,760
Because in his heart, he doesn't care about that person anymore.

690
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,760
Maybe at this moment, you still care about him.

691
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,760
Xia Dong, since you were a child,

692
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
your west side,

693
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,760
your church, your work, you are rich.

694
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,760
But when you were caught by the fire,

695
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,760
you didn't care about where he was.

696
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
You didn't care about him at all.

697
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,760
Maybe he's standing at the door.

698
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,760
The wind is blowing.

699
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,760
The clouds are falling.

700
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,760
The world is chaotic.

701
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,760
The sky is blue.

702
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,760
Snow is melting.

703
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,760
Who believes in the fire?

704
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,760
The fire is burning.

705
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,760
The love is eternal.

706
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,760
The sword is cutting the red smoke.

707
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:19,760
No need to say.

708
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:26,760
It's not easy to throw away.

709
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:33,760
The cold heart is broken.

710
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,760
The night is falling.

711
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,760
The year is passing.

712
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:46,760
The wind is blowing.

713
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,760
The world is chaotic.

714
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,760
The world is chaotic.

715
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:00,760
The world is chaotic.

716
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,760
The world is chaotic.

717
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,760
The world is chaotic.

718
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,760
The water is not sweet.

719
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,760
Snow is melting.

720
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,760
The year was yesterday.

721
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,760
The shadow is back.

722
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,760
The wind is blowing.

723
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,760
The world is chaotic.

724
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,760
The world is chaotic.

725
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:52,760
The world is chaotic.

726
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:59,760
The world is chaotic.
