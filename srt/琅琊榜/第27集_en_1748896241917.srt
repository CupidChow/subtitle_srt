00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 14

2
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,640
Consort Qing is a doctor.

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,320
The sweet soup is very effective.

4
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,760
My spirit is much better.

5
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,560
Good.

6
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,520
Consort Qing is kind.

7
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,480
The doctors are also very skilled.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,400
But the most important thing is,

9
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,000
Your Majesty, you are lucky.

10
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,880
Look at this little man.

11
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,560
He's been well for two or three days.

12
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,640
You are so sweet.

13
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,080
Here.

14
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,760
The weather is so nice today.

15
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,240
I hope you can take a walk.

16
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,440
Your Majesty.

17
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,080
Although the fortune is good,

18
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,160
the gold in the jade is already open.

19
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,040
Why don't you go and have a look?

20
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,920
If you want to say that the jade flower

21
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,200
is still in the east, it's good.

22
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,960
That day, I saw Noble Consort Yue

23
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,040
with a bright face.

24
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,280
The crown prince's figure is also a little bit unknown.

25
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,120
I think he's already awake.

26
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,360
Your Majesty...

27
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,400
Are you going to behandle Check His Majesty?

28
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:08,680
Please tell the crown prince the nuptial hour

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,320
What are you doing here?

30
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,720
I'm not here to intend your actions.

31
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,720
You're too early to question your leave.

32
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
You don't have to inform the crown prince first.

33
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,720
I just want to go and see the flowers.

34
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,720
So that he can think more.

35
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
Yes, your highness.

36
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Greetings, your highness.

37
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
What is the crown prince doing?

38
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
He is returning to the palace.

39
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,720
His highness is inside.

40
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
You are so nonsense.

41
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Where can he be inside?

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
I asked him what he was doing inside.

43
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Your highness, I don't know.

44
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
Your highness,

45
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,720
did the crown prince send you to see the flowers?

46
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Hurry up.

47
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Yes.

48
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
Hurry up.

49
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
Stop there.

50
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
Stop there.

51
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Your highness, are you...

52
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,720
This person has always been the crown prince.

53
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,720
It's not the first time to see him.

54
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Why are you so panic?

55
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,720
I think it's your highness' surprise.

56
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
I'm afraid it's not.

57
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Let's come over.

58
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Come over.

59
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Hurry up.

60
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
Your highness.

61
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Raise your head.

62
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Let the emperor see it clearly.

63
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
You just said

64
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,720
you didn't know what the crown prince was doing inside.

65
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
Your highness, I... I'm not sure.

66
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
I'm kneeling down.

67
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,720
The most exciting game on the line is

68
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,720
Ma Jiang Hu Le, Ma Jiang Hu Le 2,

69
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,720
Shang Jin女王, Xun Bao Huang Jin Cheng,

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Zhao Caimeng, Shang Jin Chuan Zhang,

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
super high-payment rate,

72
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,720
the best-selling game of the year.

73
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
The best-selling game of the year.

74
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
The best-selling game of the year.

75
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
The best-selling game of the year.

76
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Hurry up.

77
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
The first game of the year,

78
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,720
994466, come.

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Here.

80
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Don't move.

81
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Don't report.

82
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
Go to the high station.

83
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
Come with me.

84
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Yes.

85
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Your highness.

86
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Greetings, your highness.

87
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Your highness.

88
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Come, have a drink.

89
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Come, let me serve you.

90
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
Your highness.

91
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
Take it slow.

92
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Your highness.

93
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Your feet are so warm.

94
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Your highness.

95
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Come, have a drink.

96
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Your highness.

97
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Your highness,

98
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,720
you haven't seen your highness in a few days.

99
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Thank you, Yan Wu Fang.

100
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Let me tell you.

101
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,720
Even if you have no father,

102
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
he won't see me.

103
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
He only has a prince in his eyes.

104
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Not me at all.

105
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
How could that be, your highness?

106
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager,

107
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
you have been in the royal family for half a year.

108
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
I don't dare to

109
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,720
even have a single eye.

110
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,720
He is so filial.

111
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
No wonder

112
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
that eunuch just now

113
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,720
was so weak.

114
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
It turns out that

115
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,720
he is just a fool.

116
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,720
Your majesty,

117
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,720
what did you do wrong?

118
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Your highness,

119
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
you are the one who is so naive.

120
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
I don't have any motivation.

121
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
No motivation?

122
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Listen, listen.

123
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
How could I not have any motivation?

124
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Your majesty, your majesty.

125
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Do you still think I am a prince?

126
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
How could you say that?

127
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
You are the crown prince.

128
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,720
The emperor of the future.

129
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Of course, you are the only one in my heart.

130
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
What do you know?

131
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
I have long thought about it.

132
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Father is innocent.

133
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,720
He always says that I am not good at this.

134
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Your highness, slow down.

135
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Your highness.

136
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
You are a son.

137
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,720
You have already been famous.

138
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,720
If I don't go in now,

139
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
the crime of the funeral of my wife

140
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
and the crime of the great unfilial son

141
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
will be over.

142
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
You are so naive.

143
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,720
You will make me a man.

144
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Your majesty.

145
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
Your majesty, calm down.

146
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Keep dancing.

147
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Be careful, your highness.

148
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Keep dancing.

149
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Here you are, your highness.

150
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
I am telling you.

151
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
What is the name of the witness?

152
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
What is the name of the witness?

153
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
If it wasn't for father,

154
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Prince Yu would have come to fight with me.

155
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
I am the crown prince.

156
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Can I do this?

157
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Can I?

158
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
I can't say that I am not good at this.

159
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
It's good that you are good at this.

160
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Your majesty.

161
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Your majesty.

162
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
Your majesty.

163
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Your majesty.

164
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
Your majesty, calm down.

165
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Your majesty.

166
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
Your majesty, calm down.

167
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Your majesty.

168
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
Your majesty.

169
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Calm down.

170
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Your majesty.

171
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,200
Your majesty

172
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,960
Your majesty

173
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,280
Shhh

174
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,200
You

175
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:44,860
You

176
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,120
You

177
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,480
Be careful

178
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,300
Your majesty

179
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,000
Your majesty

180
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:49,780
Your majesty

181
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,760
Be careful

182
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,180
Your majesty

183
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,880
Maud некоторAn

184
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,720
I... I'm so sorry.

185
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Did I...

186
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Did I do something wrong?

187
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

188
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
I'm old.

189
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
I'm really old.

190
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Your Majesty, you're in a hurry.

191
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,720
You have time to teach the Crown Prince.

192
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

193
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
Today's matter...

194
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,720
I have to tell you.

195
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Let's find out the truth.

196
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,720
From now on,

197
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:06,720
Fengdian East Palace will be in charge of the Ying Dynasty.

198
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
Including the Crown Prince.

199
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
Including the Crown Prince!

200
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

201
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
The Crown Prince is in a serious condition.

202
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
It's hard to make a statement.

203
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,720
Your Majesty, please make the decree.

204
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Father.

205
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Father.

206
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Your Majesty.

207
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
Father.

208
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,720
Father!

209
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Let's go back to the palace.

210
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Your Majesty.

211
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Well...

212
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Chuan Nian.

213
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Your Majesty.

214
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Get up.

215
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Father.

216
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Father.

217
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
Father.

218
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
Father.

219
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
Father.

220
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
The imperial guards have closed the Eastern Palace.

221
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
The imperial guards won't be so bold.

222
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
It must be His Majesty's decree.

223
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
What did the decree say?

224
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
No one saw the decree.

225
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Even the Commander of the Alliance said it himself.

226
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
He only said it himself.

227
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
The closing of the Eastern Palace

228
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,720
won't happen without reason.

229
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Why would he only say it?

230
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
Yes.

231
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,720
The Crown Prince, Crown Prince, and Crown Prince

232
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
were all caught up in the news.

233
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
They didn't believe it.

234
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
They only made a fuss about Commander Meng.

235
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
They had to go in

236
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
and ask the Crown Prince for a clear answer.

237
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
What's the matter with Meng Zhi?

238
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
He still wants to make a statement.

239
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,720
He said he was making a mess.

240
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,720
He just hid behind the door and didn't see anyone.

241
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Where did he hide?

242
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,720
Did he go to Tongling Manor or go home?

243
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
I'm going to see him now.

244
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Your Highness.

245
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,720
Is it not appropriate to see Commander Meng now?

246
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Why are you still pretending to be in danger?

247
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
The Eastern Palace is closed.

248
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Something must have happened.

249
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
I'm going to ask him

250
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
right now.

251
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Your Highness.

252
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Now, all the good people are in Commander Meng's hands.

253
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
They really can't find him.

254
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Then...

255
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
We can't just wait like this.

256
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,720
Go to see Her Highness the Empress.

257
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Yes.

258
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Her Highness may not know about Duan Ni.

259
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Let's go to Su's house first.

260
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
We should discuss this with Mei Cheng Su.

261
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
What's going on?

262
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
The Eastern Palace is being mobilized by the court.

263
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
The imperial guard didn't receive any instructions.

264
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
His Majesty said he was sick and didn't see anyone.

265
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
There's a rumor outside.

266
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Meng Qi.

267
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,720
The imperial guards are not small.

268
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
What's in your hand?

269
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
I don't have any.

270
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
I don't have anything.

271
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Only a mouthful.

272
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
I'll tell you the reason.

273
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
Don't say it.

274
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
Then...

275
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
I'll go to see Mr. Su from the secret passage.

276
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
You'll see him again.

277
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Why isn't he here yet?

278
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,720
You said Mr. Su didn't hear us, right?

279
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
No.

280
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
He'll be back soon.

281
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Don't be mad.

282
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
Where's Mr. Su?

283
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
He's waiting.

284
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,720
We have urgent business.

285
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
I told you.

286
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
He's waiting.

287
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Mr. Su asked you to come?

288
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Where's he?

289
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Outside.

290
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
Then...

291
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Is someone here to see Mr. Su?

292
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Who is it?

293
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Poison snake.

294
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
Poison snake?

295
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Prince Yu?

296
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
I think Prince Yu has received the news.

297
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
We have to keep it up.

298
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Let's wait a little longer.

299
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
Fei Liu.

300
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Why do you call Prince Yu a Poison Snake?

301
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
Brother Su.

302
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Brother Su told you, right?

303
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Do you know why Brother Su called him Poison Snake?

304
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
I know.

305
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,720
I know.

306
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
I know.

307
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
I know.

308
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
You actually know?

309
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Tell me.

310
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
Poison snake.

311
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Poison snake?

312
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
Who's a poison snake?

313
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
Prince Yu.

314
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Brother Su.

315
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
What are you talking about?

316
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
I didn't even hear it.

317
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Fei Liu.

318
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,720
You mean that Brother Su is very mean.

319
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,720
But he will feel very mean after he sees Prince Yu, right?

320
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
Prince Yu is Poison Snake.

321
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
What am I?

322
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Tell me.

323
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,720
What am I?

324
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Poison snake.

325
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
Poison snake.

326
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Poison snake.

327
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
Poison snake.

328
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Poison snake.

329
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
Poison snake.

330
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Poison snake.

331
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
Poison snake.

332
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
Poison snake.

333
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Poison snake.

334
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
Poison snake.

335
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Poison snake.

336
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Poison snake.

337
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
You've said so much.

338
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Are you going or not?

339
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
No.

340
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
Brother Huang said that we can't go.

341
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
We can't go.

342
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
You're so selfish.

343
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
But I've told you for so long.

344
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
It's just a game of the cow.

345
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
You're a dog.

346
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
A dog that doesn't know how to make a fool of it.

347
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
A dog that doesn't know how to make a fool of it.

348
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,720
Why don't you treat me like a human?

349
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
So what do you mean?

350
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
I'm sure I won't go.

351
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,720
Brother Jin, this dog never drinks tea.

352
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,720
He drinks water like a cow.

353
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
He doesn't only have a big dog,

354
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
but also a big water cow.

355
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720
He always knows how to make a fool of it.

356
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Make a fool of it.

357
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,720
I'm the one who doesn't drink water.

358
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Wang Xian.

359
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Wang Xian, you're late.

360
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Prince Yu came here suddenly.

361
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
I have to take care of him.

362
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
What's wrong?

363
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
What happened?

364
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
What were you talking about?

365
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Are you okay?

366
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,720
We were just talking about the water cow.

367
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,720
Fei Liu, did you talk nonsense?

368
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
No.

369
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
I told you.

370
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Princess is just kidding.

371
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
You can't learn it.

372
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
You can learn it too.

373
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
You can learn it too.

374
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Your Highness.

375
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
The princess used to come here to sit in class.

376
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,720
When we were chatting, she said that

377
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,720
you used to have a nickname called the water cow.

378
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
I was very interested in Fei Liu.

379
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,720
I was very embarrassed.

380
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
I hope you'll forgive me.

381
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
It was the princess who said that.

382
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
I thought...

383
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
What did you think?

384
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,720
I thought Mr. Su knew someone else before.

385
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
After the incident in Zhaoren Palace,

386
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
the princess was very fond of Mr. Su.

387
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
She was very fond of Mr. Su.

388
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
She said she was very mature.

389
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
I think this is nothing strange.

390
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
You're the princess.

391
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
You're very kind.

392
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
It's a good thing that people know you.

393
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,720
I thought you were a ghost.

394
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
You've been in the school a lot.

395
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
I found that you're so good at it.

396
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
You can't be so uncooperative.

397
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
You're over the wall.

398
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
No matter how far you go,

399
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
you have to do things one by one.

400
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,720
Do it in real time.

401
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
Let's talk about the official situation.

402
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,720
Yes.

403
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Yes.

404
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
The matter about the water cow has forgotten the official situation.

405
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Your Majesty,

406
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,720
you know that the crown prince is in the Eastern Palace.

407
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Prince Yu told me something.

408
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,720
I want to ask the commander about the details.

409
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,720
Please.

410
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
The King of the Western Palace

411
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
The King of the Western Palace

412
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,720
The King of the Western Palace

413
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
The King of the Western Palace

414
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
The King of the Western Palace

415
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,720
The King of the Western Palace

416
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
The King of the Western Palace

417
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
The King of the Western Palace

418
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
The King of the Western Palace

419
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,720
The King of the Western Palace

420
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
The King of the Western Palace

421
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,720
The King of the Western Palace

422
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
The King of the Western Palace

423
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
The King of the Western Palace

424
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
The King of the Western Palace

425
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,720
I'm really old, right?

426
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
Your Majesty,

427
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
think about the title of the Empress Dowager.

428
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
You know that you're not old.

429
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Why are you thinking about it?

430
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
Today's matter

431
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,720
is about me hitting you.

432
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,720
When I get out of here,

433
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
it won't be this situation.

434
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,720
But when I get old,

435
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,720
my heart is soft.

436
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,720
I don't know what you did wrong.

437
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
But I think

438
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,720
the anger that Your Majesty has for Donglei

439
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
is because of my father.

440
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,720
I'm not old enough to be old.

441
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Not old enough?

442
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Back then, back then...

443
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,720
I don't know what's wrong with me.

444
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,720
I'm still sleeping here.

445
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
I'm afraid the Empress

446
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
will look at me.

447
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,720
How could that be?

448
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,720
The Empress always comes to me.

449
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
She's the most considerate of His Majesty.

450
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
The court officials who come to see me

451
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,720
are all waiting for Her Highness.

452
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Her Highness is still watching me.

453
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,720
She wants to see His Majesty.

454
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,720
The court officials in the autumn palace

455
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,720
are all concerned about her.

456
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
The Empress is open.

457
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,720
She's not open at all.

458
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Fortunately,

459
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
you're still here.

460
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,720
I'm here to see you.

461
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
Everyone knows about the next thing.

462
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
His Majesty is going back to the palace.

463
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
Now,

464
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,720
all the messes are thrown away.

465
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,720
The Empress Dowager hasn't been here for half a year.

466
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Even if Mingjiang is under attack,

467
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
it's not like that.

468
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Besides, the Crown Prince...

469
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Mr. Su is right.

470
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
The Crown Prince will be taken away by now.

471
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
The Crown Prince always wants to get used to it.

472
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,720
He can't stand the anger of his wife.

473
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,720
He thought that if he closes the door of Changxin Hall,

474
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
no one would know.

475
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Who would know that His Majesty will suddenly come?

476
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Is the Crown Prince still the person from the Eastern Palace?

477
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Yes.

478
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Now, I'm in great position.

479
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,720
I'm worried that he won't be able to think of anything stupid.

480
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
I sent people to see him.

481
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,720
The Crown Prince is useless.

482
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,720
But I just don't know what His Majesty is going to do.

483
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
Now that the Crown Prince has lost His Majesty's heart,

484
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,720
he's just being careless.

485
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,720
But according to His Majesty's order,

486
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,720
he won't want to lose the Crown Prince immediately.

487
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Do you understand what I mean?

488
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Yes.

489
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
The Eastern Palace is in the imperial city.

490
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
The palace is currently in the palace.

491
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,720
The imperial guards are in charge of it.

492
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,720
But the palace is still in charge of the patrol.

493
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Your Highness, you must send more people to guard the palace.

494
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
And to guard the patrol.

495
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
Even if the imperial court is in chaos,

496
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
the Eastern Palace cannot be in chaos.

497
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,720
Once it's in chaos, it will cause an accident.

498
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,720
By then, it will be your responsibility.

499
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,720
We can't let Prince Yu get the advantage at this moment.

500
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Yes.

501
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,720
I don't even have a decree of justice on my hand.

502
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,720
I've talked to His Majesty.

503
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Every time I speak,

504
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
he will break my name.

505
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,720
I can only use my mouth to say yes.

506
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
But I can't.

507
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,720
Speaking of this,

508
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
you should really thank this Eunuch Gao

509
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
for his kindness.

510
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
What?

511
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
I thank him?

512
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
Why?

513
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
The Eastern Palace was sealed.

514
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
It happened suddenly.

515
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
This is our chance.

516
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
I've considered the current situation.

517
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
I've also discussed it with people.

518
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,720
Now, I want to hear what you all mean.

519
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Your Highness,

520
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,720
this is the second chance.

521
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
You must not do anything.

522
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
You should contact the court and report it immediately.

523
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
Please send the imperial decree.

524
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
It's the palace of Crown Prince Ming.

525
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Your Highness,

526
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,720
the Eastern Palace is in chaos.

527
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,720
But the Crown Prince's court is not in chaos.

528
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,720
I think the court cannot be in chaos.

529
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
What do you mean?

530
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Since the Crown Prince of the Eastern Palace is in chaos,

531
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
we should ask the Crown Prince to report it.

532
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
We should just follow the instructions.

533
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
What's wrong with that?

534
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
But the Crown Prince of the Eastern Palace

535
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
has been in chaos for so long.

536
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,720
The palace is in chaos.

537
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,720
Maybe the Crown Prince

538
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,720
has made a big mistake.

539
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,720
If we force it too hard,

540
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
it will be too late.

541
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
Your Highness,

542
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
I don't think so.

543
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
The Eastern Palace and the Imperial Prince of the Imperial Palace

544
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
have been in chaos for so many years.

545
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
If we don't step on it,

546
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
it will be too late.

547
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,720
It's a rare opportunity.

548
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,720
But we should not be too hasty.

549
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
We should be careful

550
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,720
when we make the plan.

551
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
The Eastern Palace must be alert

552
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
and alert at night.

553
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
As long as we have a chance,

554
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
we should be in a tight spot.

555
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
We should know

556
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
what happened today.

557
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,720
The court is more important.

558
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
But before we start,

559
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,720
we must be clear about the Crown Prince.

560
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
The Crown Prince's defeat

561
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,720
is our best chance.

562
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
Such a chance

563
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
will not be given again.

564
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,720
So this time,

565
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,720
we must not miss it.

566
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
Are you all clear?

567
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
Yes, Your Highness.

568
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
He interrupted you

569
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,720
because he was kind.

570
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,720
He was kind.

571
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,720
He knew his kindness.

572
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,720
He paid back his kindness.

573
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,720
Do you understand?

574
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
No.

575
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
I am a rough person.

576
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,720
Explain it clearly.

577
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
You said that Eunuch Gao

578
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
interrupted you several times today.

579
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
But it was your first time

580
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
to ask His Majesty

581
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
to send a decree.

582
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,720
He didn't interrupt you.

583
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,720
Did His Majesty understand you?

584
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
No.

585
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
Then why didn't he understand you?

586
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
Is it because you didn't explain it clearly

587
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,720
or because he was confused?

588
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
If he wanted to say that

589
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,720
who knows His Majesty the most

590
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
is not the Empress and Noble Consort Yue.

591
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720
It's not the Crown Prince and Prince Yu.

592
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
It's Eunuch Gao.

593
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
If he didn't respond

594
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,720
in a precise way,

595
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
how could he have served His Majesty

596
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
for so many years?

597
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
He is kind.

598
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Let's talk about the Changxin Hall.

599
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,720
You have asked His Majesty to send a decree several times.

600
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
But His Majesty didn't understand you.

601
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
That means

602
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
he didn't have any idea at that time.

603
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,720
He was worried that the position

604
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
would be too heavy and he couldn't return.

605
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
So he couldn't understand you.

606
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Still don't understand?

607
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,720
If His Majesty asked you to send a decree

608
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,720
to the Imperial Court and send a decree

609
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,720
to avoid the Crown Prince,

610
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
there must be a reason.

611
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,720
No matter what reason,

612
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,720
it won't be a small crime.

613
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,720
Now that the Crown Prince has been punished,

614
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,720
if it's another disaster,

615
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,720
it will be a loss.

616
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,720
So you asked His Majesty to send a decree

617
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,720
to avoid the Crown Prince's decree.

618
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,720
I didn't mean that.

619
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
I just...

620
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
I know.

621
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,720
You just want to make it easier for you to take over the Eastern Palace.

622
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,720
I understand what you mean.

623
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,720
Gao Zhan understands.

624
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
His Majesty understands.

625
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
So he didn't get angry.

626
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
He just didn't understand you.

627
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,720
But if you ask him again and again,

628
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
according to his personality,

629
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
what do you think he will think?

630
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,720
What you mean is...

631
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
I heard

632
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
that the Imperial Court was killed

633
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
and Prince Yu asked you to send a decree.

634
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
So in the Imperial Court's mind,

635
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
many people will suspect you of being a prince.

636
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
And at this time,

637
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,720
you asked for the decree to avoid the Crown Prince's decree.

638
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,720
It's really different.

639
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
His Majesty is very considerate.

640
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Gao Zhan understands.

641
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
So he stopped your painting several times.

642
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
That's a good thing.

643
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,720
Commander Meng, shouldn't you thank him?

644
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
I do.

645
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,720
I really have to thank him.

646
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
The so-called half-dragged tiger

647
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,720
can be a commander in command for so many years.

648
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,720
He must be smart.

649
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,720
Now that he's willing to be a good man,

650
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,720
it's a good thing for us.

651
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
I understand.

652
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
What should you do next?

653
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
I'll do whatever it takes.

654
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Whatever it takes?

655
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,720
What you mean is

656
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,720
to prevent us from pushing the boat

657
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,720
and to make it natural?

658
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Exactly.

659
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,720
We should never be a government official.

660
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
We should only do our own thing.

661
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
At this time,

662
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
who will be the one to make trouble?

663
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,720
I think Prince Yu can't bear to make trouble.

664
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,720
At this time, His Majesty likes to be calm.

665
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,720
He will be the one to be calm.

666
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,720
Actually, the situation in the harem is the same.

667
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
Don't worry, Mr. Su.

668
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,720
My mother is a person who's been calm lately.

669
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Consort Jin is smart.

670
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
She knows the truth.

671
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
All right, Commander Meng.

672
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
You've been missing for a long time.

673
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,720
You can't hide from me.

674
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,720
You should go out and show yourself.

675
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,720
If you need anything, just tell me.

676
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
All right.

677
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
Please have a rest, Mr. Su.

678
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,720
We'll take our leave.

679
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Bye.

680
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
What?

681
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Book.

682
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
Book?

683
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,720
Book.

684
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
Book.

685
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
What?

686
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,720
Goodbye, Mr. Su.

687
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Come.

688
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
Your Highness.

689
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,720
There are many things to do outside.

690
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
I'll take my leave.

691
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
Take care, Commander.

692
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
Your Highness, there are many books here.

693
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,720
You're the best at reading.

694
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,720
You're the best at reading.

695
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,720
Your Highness, do you remember the book you got

696
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,720
from the secret room?

697
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,720
Did you finish reading it?

698
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,720
I've read it a few times.

699
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,720
I think it's interesting.

700
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,720
If you finish reading it,

701
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,720
can you lend me two books?

702
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Why are you looking for me?

703
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
The owner of this book is Mr. Su.

704
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,720
You should lend it to him.

705
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,720
If Mr. Su agrees, I'll give it to you.

706
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,720
Agree?

707
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,720
Mr. Su has agreed long ago.

708
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,720
Mr. Su always says,

709
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,720
you should read more books.

710
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,720
All right.

711
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,720
But I'm afraid you'll have to wait for a few days.

712
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,720
This book is in my mother's room.

713
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
Why is it in Consort Jing's room?

714
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,720
What?

715
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,720
Is there anything wrong with this book?

716
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,720
No, nothing wrong.

717
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Didn't you say you wanted to read it?

718
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Now you're saying it's in Consort Jing's room.

719
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,720
I think it's a bit unexpected.

720
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,720
My mother used to travel around the palace.

721
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,720
She's been to the Great He Mountain.

722
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,720
Now she's in the palace for a long time.

723
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,720
She's busy with work.

724
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,720
So she likes to travel here.

725
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Since Commander Meng wants to see her,

726
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,720
I'll bring her back next time I enter the palace.

727
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Don't worry.

728
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Don't worry.

729
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Are you sure?

730
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
I'm not.

731
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,720
Are you sure?

732
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
Commander Meng wants to see the Emperor's room.

733
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,720
He really wants to see it.

734
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,720
Who told you to help him?

735
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,720
Why is he so sure?

736
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,720
Of course I want to see it.

737
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
Who can I help?

738
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Besides,

739
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
other than us,

740
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
do others know that

741
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,720
you came in here to say that?

742
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,720
You mean it?

743
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,720
I didn't expect Commander Meng to love reading.

744
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,720
You can ask him.

745
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Don't worry about it.

746
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,720
What?

747
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,720
I've been really into reading lately.

748
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,720
Goodbye.

749
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
I can't believe

750
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
you're reading all of these.

751
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,720
Look.

752
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
It's this again.

753
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
It's for the Imperial Concubine.

754
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,720
I'll ask the Crown Prince for the memorial.

755
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
Keep it in mind.

756
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Don't write the conclusion.

757
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
It's been half a month.

758
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,720
How can you be so arrogant?

759
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,720
You're so stupid.

760
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,720
I'm not.

761
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,720
I'm not.

762
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,720
I'm not.

763
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,720
You're so stupid.

764
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,720
Your Majesty.

765
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,720
Her Highness the Empress is here.

766
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
What is she doing here?

767
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,720
Go in first.

768
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
Yes.

769
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,720
Your Majesty.

770
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
Your Highness, come here.

771
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,720
What's the matter?

772
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
Your Majesty.

773
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Tomorrow is the day of the Mid-Autumn Festival

774
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,720
and the day of the He family reunion.

775
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,720
The feast must be held in a horse-drawn manner.

776
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,720
So I want to come and ask for your advice.

777
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,720
You're a mother.

778
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,720
You're the sixth princess.

779
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,720
You arranged the Mid-Autumn Festival

780
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
all year round.

781
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,720
It's a long-awaited matter.

782
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720
What else can I ask for?

783
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,720
This year is the funeral of the Empress Dowager.

784
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
The feast is also scheduled for the funeral.

785
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
You can sit down.

786
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,720
I'll teach you.

787
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,720
I didn't mean that.

788
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,720
I just thought

789
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,720
the Empress Dowager was the most loving son.

790
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,720
The Mid-Autumn Festival

791
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,720
is for the sake of the family reunion.

792
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,720
Of course, there's not much to do.

793
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
Now, the Crown Prince...

794
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
I dare not sit down.

795
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,720
So I can only come to Your Majesty's decree.

796
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,720
I wonder if the Crown Prince

797
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,720
will be able to stay in the feast.

798
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
You don't have to come to see him again.

799
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,720
I don't need to see the Crown Prince.

800
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,720
I'm not a good son.

801
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,720
As for the feast,

802
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,720
you're right.

803
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
The Empress Dowager went to the feast

804
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
last year.

805
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,720
The Mid-Autumn Festival

806
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,720
is a long-awaited matter.

807
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,720
It's enough for you.

808
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,720
The feast is over.

809
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
The people are all here.

810
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
You can go to the Empress Dowager.

811
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
The feast is over.

812
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
I'll obey your decree.

813
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
Here.

814
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,720
I made this with the gold needle

815
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
made in the Golden Palace.

816
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
Try it.

817
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,720
It's good.

818
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,720
The Mid-Autumn Festival

819
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
was held last year in Qingzhou.

820
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,720
Last year,

821
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
you went to the Water Ferry again.

822
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,720
This year,

823
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
you've finally been in the capital.

824
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
The feast is not over yet.

825
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,720
You and my mother and son

826
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,720
can't be together for a month.

827
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,720
What's the point of that feast?

828
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
I'm not that good.

829
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,720
I'm not that good.

830
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,720
I can't be with my mother.

831
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,720
I can't be together for a month.

832
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,720
But now,

833
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
I can come to the Mother Palace

834
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,720
to eat the moon cake made by my mother.

835
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,720
I can't do it anymore.

836
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
You're so kind.

837
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,720
You like the needle.

838
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,720
This is the needle I made for you.

839
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,720
Try it.

840
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,720
Every time I come,

841
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,720
my mother makes me

842
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,720
like a meal.

843
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,720
I'm afraid that

844
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,720
I'll be too afraid to eat

845
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,720
my own son.

846
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Besides,

847
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,720
I've been looking at you for days.

848
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,720
I've been here the other day.

849
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,720
But I didn't come

850
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,720
when Father was in there.

851
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
Luckily, Father wasn't here today.

852
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
I heard that

853
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,720
Xia Jiang Jing is coming today.

854
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
I wonder what they're talking about.

855
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
Short Laowang Army

856
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,720
All right. Don't want to lose him.

857
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,720
Have some more.

858
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,720
Right.

859
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
That peony go-tog

860
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
you've already finished

861
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
reading the memorial save for lost interest.

862
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,720
Are you willing to go back?

863
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,720
Your friend cosa' want as well.

864
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,720
Hygi centipede

865
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,460
Zirgin

866
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:25,700
Gilded

867
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,980
Nintendo

868
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:40,680
Boy

869
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:46,680
