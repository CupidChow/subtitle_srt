00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Guards.

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes.

4
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Look outside.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Is what he said true?

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And...

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes.

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It seems that we can't fight for now.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We're free to do so.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Miss Gong.

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Continue to finish your story.

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If you're done listening to the mastermind,

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
you'll feel that it's a misunderstanding.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We can use the sense of pleasure as a warning.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We can't use the words of the word.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Isn't that a good thing?

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Why did it suddenly calm down?

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why did a person run away at this time?

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you want to stop?

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If a person can do something wrong,

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
don't act rashly.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
My mother was pregnant at that time.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My father wanted to wash his hands in the golden basin.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But the leader of the killer organization

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
wanted my father to complete the last task.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's a good thing.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And the last task

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
is to help the court to find a medicine.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To kill a baby who hasn't been born yet.

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
My father and the leader of the organization were together for a month.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Finally, he was able to wait for his death.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I didn't expect that day to be so intense.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The scene was chaotic.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
My father and Ying'er were surrounded by people.

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
My father was helpless.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He hid in the woods in the mountains.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He waited for Ding'er to go in the night.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
My father and I knew the devil around the princess.

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
we killed the baby who was pregnant without any worry.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Xie Yu was very angry after coming back.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
She said she would kill him if she was wrong.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So she killed another baby than my father.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But my mother was too moved at that time.

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
My father didn't want to kill anyone.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So he had to take my mother away.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We had been away for two years.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
My father later

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
hid me and my mother in a green building.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He hid the killer in the woods.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He never came back from there.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I went to check the evidence.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
My father was killed by Xie Yu

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
after he left us for seven months.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But my father...

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Xie Yu.

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Since you didn't let him go,

58
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
why did you let Jingrui go and let him live?

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I just want to ask Princess Li Yang.

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The baby who died at that time,

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
others don't know.

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But you do know why.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So in those years,

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
you were almost in a state of madness

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
protecting that baby.

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You were almost out of the woods at night, right?

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I thought that was your first child.

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You were so scared.

69
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I didn't expect that.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Young Master Xiao has grown up.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Xie Yu killed him.

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He was so strong at first.

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He also knew that Princess Li Yang

74
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
didn't want to be involved with him.

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But the most important thing was that

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
he found that through Young Master Xiao as a cowherd,

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
he could help him

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
to establish a close relationship

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
with the Heavenly Power Manor

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
that was not low at that time.

81
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Through the power of the Zhuo family,

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
he could help him to complete

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
what he wanted to do.

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You should know this well, Master Zhuo.

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
A common son has a close relationship with him.

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You started to establish friendship and friendship.

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You gradually became a trust that you had no conditions for him.

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You could do anything for him

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
that he was willing to do.

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I thought that I was in the right place.

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I also wanted to help the Heavenly Power Manor

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
after a long time

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
to bring the entire Zhuo family

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
an unparalleled glory.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Father!

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Father!

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Father!

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Father!

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Master Zhuo will be fine.

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He just received the letter of protection.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's nothing.

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Jingrui, do you want to...

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Jingrui!

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yuexiong,

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
if you had wanted to fight in the battle

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
the next day,

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
he wouldn't have hurt the ten thousand

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and left so many years of cultivation.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't have much time.

110
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I just know that he didn't

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
have a son at the night.

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm afraid that it will affect

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
his mood when he is fighting with me.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That's why I want to challenge him at the night.

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Who would know that he is so stupid?

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There are still so many

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
of them in the future.

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yuexiong,

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
it's not your fault.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I was always wrong about people.

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I was wrong about people.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You are so proud of

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
what I said.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You are so cruel.

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What I said to you

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
is not a lie.

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The Crown Prince of Fu Bao

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
is a traitor.

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The other traitors

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
are all traitors.

131
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I promised to give you

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
a chance to kill him.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
At least, you won't

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
be killed by him.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But as long as he

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
is a little bit dissatisfied with you,

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
you will be punished.

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Kill them all.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What's the difference

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
between those

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
who are so cruel and ruthless?

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The Crown Prince of Cheng is not a thief.

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
His Majesty will understand

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
my loyalty to the court.

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

146
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Have you sent

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
the people outside the manor

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
back?

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Did Mr. Su

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
react first?

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The reason I am here

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
is to listen to you

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
and have some time.

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Of course, I have the intention.

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You have transferred the people

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
from the patrol camp.

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What's the use

158
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
of the soldiers of Prince Yu?

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I can't compare

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
with the patrol camp

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that I personally trained.

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Xie Yu!

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Although the patrol camp

164
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
is yours,

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
it's not your army.

166
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
How dare you

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
use the patrol camp in private?

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You are so bold.

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Commander Meng,

170
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
don't blame me.

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The security of the capital

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
is the responsibility of the patrol camp.

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If you don't come to my mansion,

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
why do you say

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
that I will be the first to

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
kill you?

177
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Father!

178
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Father, please think twice!

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Father!

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Xie Zhuolang's family has been together for many years.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
They are not family.

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They are family.

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No matter what misunderstanding,

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
they can't kill each other

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
like this.

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I didn't do anything.

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
How can I

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
find out

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
such a woman's thing?

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Get up!

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Father!

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Who doesn't know

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
our relationship?

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Aren't you afraid

195
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
that the world will be in trouble?

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The world knows nothing!

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Listen to me!

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Only people who are alive

199
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
have the right to speak.

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Father,

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
this is a big deal!

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Do you understand?

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Get out!

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Father!

205
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Father!

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Father!

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Qing Shuhai!

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I can't see you

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
so easily killed!

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If you want to kill them,

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
just kill me!

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You want to commit suicide?

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay!

214
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Do it!

215
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I raised you since you were little.

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You are a virtue.

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Can't I know that?

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If you really have the will

219
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
to break your own neck,

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I will kill you!

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Father!

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Father!

223
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Father!

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Who is it?

225
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Here!

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Take her away!

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Get out of here!

228
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes!

229
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Father!

230
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Father!

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Father!

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Father!

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Princess Jiang Zhang

234
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and Miss

235
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
have to go back to the backyard.

236
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The demon girl in the palace

237
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
is in the same party.

238
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Kill her!

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Kill her!

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Xie Yu?

241
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Xun Fangying?

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That man

243
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
went to Xun Fangying to get a soldier.

244
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We should stop him.

245
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Who knows Xie Yu

246
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
is so bold and bold.

247
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He is so brave.

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Your Highness,

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I think this team

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
doesn't seem to want to enter Xie's mansion.

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Xie Yu is really a very old-fashioned man.

252
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Xun Fangying is responsible for

253
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
the security of the capital.

254
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
As long as we want to get in,

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
they can stay in the house

256
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and stop us.

257
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I think

258
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
they must have started to attack.

259
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Then why don't we

260
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
hurry and get in?

261
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
How?

262
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
If we don't have Xun Fangying

263
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and we don't have any chance

264
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
to get in,

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
we can just rush in.

266
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But now

267
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
we have put a group of people

268
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
outside the mansion.

269
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We have to get in

270
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and fight with them.

271
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
There is no big action

272
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
in it.

273
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What reason

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
do you want me to

275
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
take over the palace?

276
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Be careful.

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Be careful, Miss.

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Be careful.

279
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yu Wenxuan,

280
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
are you all right?

281
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I didn't do anything.

282
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
They are not under my control.

283
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Xie Huyan,

284
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
don't blame the King.

285
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Kill!

286
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Kill!

287
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Lord Xia,

288
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
you have put the Xuanjing Temple

289
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
in the fire pit.

290
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Guess

291
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
who is the first one

292
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
to come in?

293
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Lord Xia Chun or Lord Yu's subordinate?

294
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's great.

295
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Then let's go to

296
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Ningguo's mansion

297
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and have a look.

298
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Big money,

299
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
stop talking nonsense.

300
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If you are too idle,

301
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
find a way out for us.

302
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Liu Liu.

303
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Lord Xia, follow me.

304
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
This is a secret door.

305
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We can get out of here.

306
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Liu Liu,

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
it's your turn.

308
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
There is a way out.

309
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Stop.

310
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Move.

311
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Move.

312
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Move.

313
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Brother.

314
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Brother.

315
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Jin Rui.

316
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Don't follow me.

317
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Move.

318
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Move.

319
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Move.

320
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Move.

321
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Move.

322
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Kill!

323
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Kill!

324
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Kill!

325
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Kill!

326
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Kill!

327
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Kill!

328
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Kill!

329
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Kill!

330
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Kill!

331
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Kill!

332
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Guards.

333
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yes.

334
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Bring the bow to the prison.

335
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes.

336
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Brother,

337
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
wait a minute.

338
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Aya,

339
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
why are you here?

340
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Go inside.

341
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Brother Meng,

342
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
how long can you and Xiu Xiu Zuo stay?

343
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
As long as we can't guard the palace,

344
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
we are fine.

345
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
No matter how Xie Yu is doing tonight,

346
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
we will definitely defeat him.

347
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yesterday's concubine,

348
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
today's matter,

349
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
but

350
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I have to cry for this little girl.

351
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Come on.

352
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Let's go.

353
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Let's go.

354
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Ouyang Chi,

355
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
what did you just say?

356
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Are you the official of the court

357
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
or Xie Yu's personal secretary?

358
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Your Highness,

359
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I was ordered by the court

360
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
to be the general of the imperial guards.

361
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Say it again.

362
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Brother.

363
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Can you please calm down?

364
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Don't bother him now.

365
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Where is Brother Tang?

366
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I don't know either.

367
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
He said he didn't interfere with this matter.

368
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You guys are so generous.

369
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's so bad today.

370
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Fortunately, my father doesn't know.

371
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
But even if he knows,

372
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't think he will care.

373
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
This is the first batch of goods from the Nenguo Marquis's Mansion.

374
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Xie Yu's personal secretary.

375
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
In order to get His Majesty's order,

376
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
in order to get the master's permission,

377
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
no one has to enter the mansion.

378
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We, the Imperial guards,

379
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
have a great responsibility in the capital.

380
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
If we let the people in the court

381
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
take the position of official,

382
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
that will be the real thing.

383
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Are you blind?

384
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The Xia Dong of Xuanjing Bureau is right there.

385
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The one who just put the order

386
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
was the one who put the order.

387
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I don't know if he is the one who put the order.

388
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The Xia Dong of Xuanjing Bureau is right there.

389
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The one who put the order was the one who put the order.

390
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I will go in and check if Li Zuo is the one who should be.

391
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Your Highness, don't worry.

392
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I have sent someone in to ask.

393
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The Marquis Xie said it was his personal matter.

394
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
He can handle it in the mansion.

395
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
No one has to interfere.

396
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's not personal matter.

397
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's not his fault.

398
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
If I have to go in,

399
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
you are a noble person.

400
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I dare not to offend you.

401
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
If you have to go in,

402
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
then go in.

403
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But,

404
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
the guards and men that Prince Yu brought

405
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
please forgive me.

406
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I can't let anyone in.

407
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
How dare you!

408
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
What about me?

409
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Marquis.

410
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Do you want me to go in?

411
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Marquis, the Marquis Xun's sword skills are almost there.

412
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
The order of the guards is all in the palace.

413
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Good.

414
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yan Hu is in charge of the whole county.

415
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
No one can go in.

416
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Tonight,

417
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
the people of the Zhuo family will not go in.

418
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yes.

419
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Marquis Yan.

420
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I have been standing here for a long time.

421
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I can't even see you.

422
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I thought you didn't recognize me.

423
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Marquis Yan, you are so ridiculous.

424
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I dare not forget you

425
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
even if I forget who I am.

426
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Marquis,

427
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
the general of the Xun's camp is out of control.

428
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I can't hold it any longer.

429
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Nonsense!

430
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I, the Xun's agent,

431
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
can't hold the useless soldiers

432
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
of Prince Yu's mansion.

433
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
No.

434
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
The guard is still not up.

435
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's just...

436
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Tell me.

437
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Prince Yu is not the only one

438
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
who came here.

439
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Yan Que.

440
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
What is he doing here?

441
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Go and have a look.

442
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yes.

443
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
What did you say to Commander Meng?

444
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I just asked Commander Meng

445
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
to take care of Jingrui.

446
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Jingrui is your brother and sister.

447
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
He is a good friend.

448
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You went to the back

449
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
for your own purpose

450
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and made such a big road.

451
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
The name of the talent of Qilin

452
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
is it really that reason?

453
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Mother.

454
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Commander.

455
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Thank you, sir.

456
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Ouyang Chi.

457
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You sent someone to report to me

458
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
for a while.

459
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I think Xie Yu should be here.

460
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I don't think it's hard for you.

461
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I don't think so.

462
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I don't think so.

463
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't think it's hard for you.

464
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'll tell him directly.

465
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Marquis Yan.

466
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Marquis.

467
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Prince Yu.

468
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Marquis Yan.

469
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's so late.

470
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Why are you here?

471
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Do you need to see me?

472
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
The whole mansion is on the side of the road.

473
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The whole mansion is on the side of the road.

474
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm the one who's responsible.

475
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Shouldn't you come and have a look?

476
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm a guest here.

477
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'll be nice to you.

478
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
If it's too late,

479
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I'll be living in the mansion.

480
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I don't need to worry about that.

481
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Xuanjing Temple's Xia Dong

482
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
is also in the mansion.

483
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Haven't you seen

484
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Lord Xia Chun

485
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
who's not worried at all?

486
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
If only there was

487
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Lord Xia Dong's body.

488
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm not worried.

489
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Xie Yu.

490
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Don't talk too much.

491
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Today, the mansion

492
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
is important for you to let us in.

493
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It's important for us to not let us in.

494
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Prince Yu.

495
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You mean

496
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
you want to take the soldiers

497
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
to the mansion to fight against my medical kit?

498
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
How to fight against it?

499
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Guards.

500
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Yes.

501
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Ou Yang Chi.

502
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'm here.

503
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
This is my private residence.

504
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
There's a letter from His Majesty in front of the gate.

505
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You must not let anyone

506
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
enter the mansion without permission.

507
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You must not let anyone enter the mansion without permission.

508
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Yes.

509
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Lord Yan.

510
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Please stay.

511
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Lord Ling will be fine.

512
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Lord Ling died in the hands of his father.

513
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It's hard to laugh.

514
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Since I can seek revenge from Xie Yu,

515
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
you can also seek revenge from me.

516
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I'm sorry.

517
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I'm sorry.

518
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm sorry.

519
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I'm sorry.

520
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm sorry.

521
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I'm sorry.

522
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm sorry.

523
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm sorry.

524
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm sorry.

525
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I can seek revenge from you.

526
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It's a heaven's wish.

527
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I have no reason.

528
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
If your father is still alive,

529
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'd be much faster

530
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
than the world.

531
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
But he's dead.

532
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
As for you,

533
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
you were the superior of the previous government.

534
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I'd be much faster than you.

535
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'd be much faster than you.

536
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Our family

537
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
will not seek revenge from you.

538
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Lord Zhu,

539
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I know you're hurt.

540
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
But there are a few things

541
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I still want to ask you.

542
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Go ahead.

543
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Although Xie Yu has a revenge for you,

544
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
if he doesn't do anything to you tonight,

545
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
you'll still keep a secret for him.

546
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Right?

547
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
To be honest,

548
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I don't know

549
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
how terrible the revenge is.

550
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I can't let it go.

551
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
But

552
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
if Xie Yu is dead,

553
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Qing Yao...

554
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
What will she do?

555
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
She married Xie Yu's daughter,

556
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
and she has a child.

557
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
But Xie Yu

558
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
didn't give you a chance at all.

559
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
She must kill you.

560
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Xu Fang Yang.

561
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Xu Fang Yang.

562
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Lord Yan.

563
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
If you insist on breaking into the family,

564
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
don't blame me for not being kind to you.

565
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I won't give you a chance.

566
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Stop!

567
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Princess.

568
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Princess Wei.

569
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I know you're doing this

570
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
for Prince Yu.

571
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
But

572
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I've made a mistake.

573
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It's a big trouble.

574
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I really don't want to be involved again.

575
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm sorry.

576
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'm sorry.

577
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm sorry.

578
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'm sorry.

579
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'm sorry.

580
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I'm sorry.

581
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm sorry.

582
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm sorry.

583
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Do you think you can get away from me?

584
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You know what?

585
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Xie Yu won't kill you.

586
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
She won't let you go.

587
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Only if she gets away from you

588
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
can she protect her family.

589
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
But

590
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
even if you're guilty of

591
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
breaking into Xie Yu's family,

592
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
you can still be a good person.

593
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But as a criminal,

594
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
it's impossible to get away from her.

595
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Princess Wei.

596
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
If you keep me alive

597
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
and let us get back

598
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
the baby that Ya'er was born,

599
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I'll repay you.

600
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
There's always a great sin.

601
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I'll bear it alone.

602
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Father.

603
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Father.

604
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Qingya,

605
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
don't say that again.

606
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
We can't let this go.

607
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Do you understand?

608
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I'll take care of it.

609
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I can't let this go.

610
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Do you understand?

611
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's all my fault.

612
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I've implicated you.

613
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Be careful.

614
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
그렇게

615
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I think that we all have got more

616
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
strict with people like her.

617
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,500
But

618
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,000
how do we know

619
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
the real reason

620
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,500
that they won't be

621
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
jealous woman?

622
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,000
Three words.

623
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,360
Would you tell someone

624
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
if you're serious about

625
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
killing herself?

626
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I have no way.

627
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Aunt.

628
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
Li Yang.

629
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm here.

630
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,920
Don't interfere.

631
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,920
Let the door open.

632
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,000
Let them in.

633
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Li Yang.

634
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,040
Aunt.

635
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,040
Princess Jiang.

636
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,640
Let them in.

637
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Li Yang.

638
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
You really want to do this?

639
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
For...

640
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
For Jingrui.

641
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You really want to abandon me?

642
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Jingrui.

643
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
This time, I'm going to kill you.

644
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I've been thanking you for so many years.

645
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You're the only one who's been thanking me.

646
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Jingrui.

647
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Jingrui.

648
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Jingrui.

649
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Jingting?

650
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
What's wrong with the secret?

651
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
The secret is over.

652
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Everything should be over.

653
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Jingye.

654
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Jingye.

655
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Jingye.

656
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Jingye.

657
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Jingye.

658
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Jingye.

659
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Jingye.

660
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Jingye.

661
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Jingye.

662
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Are you okay?

663
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I'm fine.

664
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Why are you here?

665
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Can I not come here?

666
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Go back with me.

667
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Jingye.

668
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
But Jingrui...

669
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Go home.

670
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Junior sister.

671
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
What happened tonight?

672
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Why did it happen?

673
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You can't say more.

674
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You can't say more.

675
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
It's been a long night.

676
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
But I don't know why.

677
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I always feel like a pawn.

678
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Commander Meng.

679
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
What do you think?

680
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I'm fine.

681
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
The big money is a good hand.

682
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Since someone said you were bad,

683
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
it's a joke.

684
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'm sorry.

685
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'm not good.

686
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
If you have time,

687
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
you can try.

688
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
But you always

689
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
are interested in your own case.

690
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
You don't care about others, do you?

691
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
You're right.

692
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I only care about my own case.

693
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
In front of the閒 matter,

694
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I always pretend to be a dragon.

695
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So I ask Mr. Su

696
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
to tell you about it.

697
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Don't come to me

698
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
about anything tonight.

699
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Don't waste his energy.

700
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I always say that.

701
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Moreover,

702
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
you're a smart man.

703
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
When will he ever trouble you?

704
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm afraid that

705
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
he's in the mansion of a noble man.

706
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm afraid he's in the dark night.

707
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
He's in the dark night.

708
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Don't worry.

709
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I have something to do.

710
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I won't be mad.

711
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Come here.

712
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Let me ask you.

713
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Did your father

714
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
ask you to take Jingrui with me?

715
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
He's my brother.

716
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
My father misses him a lot.

717
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Listen to me.

718
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
When he escaped,

719
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
we once said

720
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
love is a wish.

721
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
There's no regret.

722
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Since you can't control yourself,

723
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
why bother to let others have it?

724
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I understand your intention.

725
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
But Jingrui has already become a year old.

726
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
He decides what to do and what to do.

727
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I can't force anyone

728
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
to marry him.

729
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I...

730
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
You go.

731
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
My lady.

732
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Go.

733
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Go.

734
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Jinghuan.

735
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Come here.

736
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Aunt.

737
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Your Highness.

738
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I'm asking you.

739
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Are you going to take Zhuo's family with you?

740
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Xie Yu is a royal family.

741
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Although she's a royal family,

742
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
the law is still there.

743
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
She can't be so evil.

744
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm afraid Zhuo's family...

745
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
You don't need to say more.

746
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I know what you're doing.

747
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
If you promise me something,

748
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
His Majesty won't talk to you

749
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
and he won't bother you.

750
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Aunt, please tell me.

751
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
First,

752
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I won't give you a chance.

753
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Okay.

754
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Second,

755
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I'll take Zhuo's family with me.

756
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
If you promise me something,

757
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I'll be happy

758
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
if you tell me something.

759
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'll do it.

760
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
If you want to give me a chance,

761
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I'll take it.

762
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I'm not talking about now.

763
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
You'll definitely

764
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
put Zhuo's family in your hands.

765
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'll never do that.

766

why do you need to do something?
