00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 14

2
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That is the place where the emperor was imprisoned.

3
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Go and have a look.

4
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The emperor is misunderstand.

5
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:53,000
a descendant to the powers

6
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,360
Nailed it!

7
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,900
Don't worry

8
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:48,960
The testament

9
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,720
Yes.

10
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,680
I've already made up my mind.

11
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,120
I must do it.

12
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,720
Today, I'm not telling you to discuss.

13
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
I'm just asking you to deal with it.

14
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,720
Your Highness, I'll be responsible for your decision.

15
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,680
I want to re-examine the treasonous case

16
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,200
13 years ago.

17
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,400
Re-examine it.

18
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,480
Re-examine it.

19
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,760
Re-examine it.

20
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,880
Re-examine it.

21
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,960
Re-examine it.

22
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,280
Re-examine it.

23
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,560
Re-examine it.

24
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,000
Re-examine it.

25
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,520
Re-examine it.

26
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,320
Re-examine it.

27
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,880
The blood of the emperor

28
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,040
and the ink on the stone

29
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,400
will be the ink.

30
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
I won't let it go.

31
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,000
Are youORE

32
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,600
sure that you already want to re-examine it?

33
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,140
Family tricked from me and asked me to arrive in Whirajia.

34
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,500
But now I have to get to your place.

35
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,560
OK.

36
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,440
He's fine usually.

37
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,800
bye bye.

38
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,180
See youおい儿.

39
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,340
Bye.

40
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,160
Go.

41
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,700
The old see is just for fun.

42
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,460
Stay there safe and sound.

43
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,620
See you at Zingrin Airport.

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,340
You're different from Jingrui.

45
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,040
You're very less like the general.

46
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,960
This place is full of silver and map.

47
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,460
You can find it on the way.

48
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,460
Take it.

49
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,660
Qianzhou, the road is rocky.

50
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,960
It's a place where the imperial guards are.

51
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,460
I'm really worried about you.

52
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,460
No matter how far the road is, I'll go.

53
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,460
I'll go.

54
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,460
I'll go.

55
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,920
No matter what she did,

56
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,420
she gave birth to me.

57
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,420
Now she's dead.

58
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,220
I think what I can do is

59
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,420
to take her back to the sea.

60
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
I thought you were a little girl.

61
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,420
You really wanted to see you.

62
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,920
I didn't expect that after so many things happened,

63
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,420
you became the strongest child by Princess.

64
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,920
My brother is not here.

65
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,420
My mother is not here to take care of me.

66
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,920
If you have time,

67
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,920
help me take care of her.

68
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Don't worry.

69
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,880
Take care of yourself.

70
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,880
I'm going.

71
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Let's go.

72
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,380
Good luck!

73
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,380
Xie Bi has left the city.

74
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,380
Yes.

75
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
Take care of her on the way.

76
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,880
After all, she's a innocent child.

77
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,380
Yes.

78
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Did you find out anything?

79
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Not yet.

80
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Qian Zhou Mountain is far away.

81
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,920
I don't know how much pain she's going to suffer.

82
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Second Young Master is very serious.

83
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
She won't be in trouble.

84
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Who are you?

85
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
You are assassins!

86
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
Move!

87
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,920
Protect Princess Zhang!

88
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Who are you?

89
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
Let her go!

90
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Don't let her run!

91
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Jing Rui.

92
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
What are you doing?

93
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
I'm going to kill you.

94
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
I'm going to kill you.

95
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
I'm going to kill you.

96
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
You're back.

97
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Mother.

98
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Are you okay?

99
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
Good!

100
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,920
If the patient can be like you,

101
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
she'll work hard and work hard.

102
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
She's much better than others.

103
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Come on.

104
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Let me check.

105
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
You ask Chang Su?

106
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Does he sleep?

107
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,920
I don't understand.

108
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
I don't understand.

109
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
I don't understand.

110
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Okay, okay.

111
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Come on.

112
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,920
I still don't understand.

113
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,920
But I think you're not asking about Chang Su's health.

114
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,920
You're asking about the situation of Mrs. Nie in the prison, right?

115
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
I'm smart.

116
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
You don't have to worry about Chang Su's health.

117
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
Mrs. Nie's problem is not about me.

118
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
I'm only concerned about you.

119
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
The situation is getting better.

120
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,920
But you can't work too hard now.

121
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Go to bed.

122
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Listen to me.

123
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
Mr. Lin.

124
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Are you still here?

125
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
Thank you.

126
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
What are you shouting?

127
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Found it.

128
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Found it.

129
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
What?

130
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
We found the ice-cream grass.

131
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
We just sent it from the East Sea.

132
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
There's no damage.

133
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
We used a glass bottle to pretend it.

134
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
Be careful.

135
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,920
It's not broken.

136
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Have a look.

137
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
Right.

138
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
That's right.

139
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
It's ice-cream grass.

140
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
That's good.

141
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
I'll go and check.

142
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Okay.

143
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
I'll go and check.

144
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Okay.

145
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
I found the medicine.

146
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
When are you going to start?

147
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Right.

148
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
What are you going to start?

149
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
The Old Master.

150
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Wei Zheng.

151
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
I really don't want you to be disappointed.

152
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Ice-cream grass is a rare medicine.

153
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
You can find it in the pharmacy.

154
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
It seems you've spent a lot of money.

155
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,920
But who told you?

156
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,920
The ice-cream grass is useful to the doctor.

157
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
It's the Old Master?

158
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
Mr. Lin.

159
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
What did you say?

160
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
What's the matter?

161
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
The Old Master told me

162
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,920
that ice-cream grass can be used to cure the cold.

163
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,920
You can't use it, right?

164
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Yes.

165
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
If you can't use it,

166
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
even if the Old Master is out of the hospital,

167
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
I can still find it.

168
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
When did my father tell you about the ice-cream grass?

169
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
That year.

170
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
I ordered to go out with the Old Master.

171
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
We were on the fake board.

172
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
He had a drink and talked to us.

173
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
He said there was a mark in the wolf's tooth.

174
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,920
He said ice-cream grass can cure the cold.

175
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,920
But he didn't admit it when he woke up the next day.

176
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,920
He said it was the fox's mouth.

177
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,920
Maybe it's the fox's mouth.

178
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
How is that possible?

179
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,920
I've seen it in the wolf's tooth book.

180
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,920
There's really a book.

181
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,920
And there's a mark on the book.

182
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
There's a picture on it.

183
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
It's the same as the one.

184
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,920
When did you read it in the wolf's tooth book?

185
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
I...

186
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
I...

187
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
There's a mark on the book.

188
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
But since there's a kind of medicine

189
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
that can cure the disease,

190
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,920
why haven't I told you

191
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
for so many years?

192
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,920
I asked you to find it.

193
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Jingrui,

194
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
if you come back earlier,

195
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,920
the fox has already gone to Qianzhou.

196
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
I know.

197
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
He's recovered.

198
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
He'll be back soon.

199
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Before he comes back,

200
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
I'll stay with you.

201
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
I'll be back soon.

202
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,920
Okay.

203
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
I'll see you later.

204
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Bye.

205
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Bye.

206
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Bye.

207
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
Bye.

208
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
Jingrui,

209
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
that assassin last night,

210
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,920
why did he kill me?

211
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
I'm already

212
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,920
a person with no family now.

213
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
Who wants me to die?

214
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,020
No matter what you decide,

215
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,520
have to give me your problem.

216
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,160
If I don't use your word for nothing,

217
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,400
I'll have penalties from now on.

218
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,320
Please forgive me.

219
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,860
OK.

220
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,020
Maybe...

221
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,880
that's why...

222
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,920
I won't show anyone this book.

223
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
I won't show anyone either.

224
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
I don't want to know what you've done before.

225
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
I know best.

226
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,920
I know why I promised to help her with this book.

227
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,920
It's just because of her hope that she wants to save her life.

228
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
I don't want to know the contents of it.

229
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
I don't want to know the contents of it.

230
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
I don't want to know the contents of it.

231
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Jingrui, do you want to see it?

232
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Mother's safety is the most important.

233
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,920
If you want to know how to deal with those who have been involved in the operation,

234
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,920
if you don't want to know the contents of it,

235
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,920
then you can see it yourself.

236
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
No.

237
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
If you want to see it, then you can see it together.

238
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,920
If it's a long-term wound,

239
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,920
then it's better for both of us to bear it alone.

240
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
I don't want to know the contents of it.

241
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
I don't want to know the contents of it.

242
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
I don't want to know the contents of it.

243
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
I don't want to know the contents of it.

244
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,920
I don't want to know the contents of it.

245
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
I don't want to know the contents of it.

246
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,920
I don't want to know the contents of it.

247
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
I don't want to know the contents of it.

248
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
I don't want to know the contents of it.

249
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
I don't want to know the contents of it.

250
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
I don't want to know the contents of it.

251
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,920
I've thought about all of these.

252
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
But there are still some records on the ancient books.

253
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
The ice and blood grass are all in the blood.

254
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Someone has been living for a lifetime.

255
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,920
It's hard to find a place to live.

256
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,920
I think maybe the young master doesn't want us to risk it.

257
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
So you can't tell me.

258
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,920
You really know how to guess.

259
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,920
He doesn't let us say.

260
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
You think my father and I are like you?

261
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Master Lin.

262
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
I haven't finished yet.

263
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
That's why I don't say.

264
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
It's because it's useless.

265
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,920
Since it's useless,

266
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
why do you have to say it out?

267
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
It's so hard to think about it.

268
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
How could it be useless?

269
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
It's really a good thing.

270
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
It's a good thing.

271
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
How do you know it?

272
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
I don't know.

273
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
But I think you know it.

274
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,920
Okay.

275
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
You guys listen carefully.

276
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
The law is in another book.

277
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920
It's useless to read it.

278
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,920
It requires ten people with perfect strength,

279
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,920
and a lot of people with perfect blood.

280
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
And a new blood.

281
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
After a new blood,

282
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
the patient can recover.

283
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
But in the process of ten people,

284
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
it's not just painful.

285
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
And they will eventually die of blood.

286
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Just put it simply.

287
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,920
It's ten times faster to take the ice and blood grass to save people.

288
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
But we can...

289
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,920
You don't have to tell me you're willing to do it.

290
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
If you want to find ten people

291
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
who are willing to kill Changsu,

292
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
it's not hard at all.

293
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
But have you thought about it?

294
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Is Changsu willing to do it?

295
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Mr. Lin,

296
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
can you do it secretly?

297
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
No.

298
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
You know it's a secret.

299
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,920
The two states must be absolutely focused and clear.

300
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
No one can be careless.

301
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,920
You can even say that the patient is active.

302
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
You can say that the patient is active.

303
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,920
And the ten people are dying of blood.

304
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,920
You all know Changsu best.

305
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
If he does it,

306
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
it's better to kill him.

307
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
The person who was cured of the poison a hundred years ago,

308
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
is the one who took ten people

309
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,920
who are willing to give their lives to him.

310
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
He is alive,

311
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,920
but he lost the moral of the new pearl.

312
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,920
The moral of life will be lost if he gets it.

313
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,920
You know very well

314
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,920
which day Changsu will choose.

315
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
Why?

316
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Why do you only think that the person who lives his life is alive?

317
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
But someone who is clear and righteous in heart

318
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
is going to die.

319
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,920
It's so cruel to make such a choice in heaven.

320
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,920
Is it not fair to have two people in the world?

321
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Why is it not fair?

322
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
In the eyes of the world,

323
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
life and death are great things.

324
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
But the world is big and the world is busy with the world.

325
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
The life of the living is not the same.

326
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
How long can one live?

327
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
What's the decision?

328
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
The person who was cured a hundred years ago

329
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
was alive,

330
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
but what he lost

331
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,920
is not something more important than life, right?

332
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,920
My praise will be second.

333
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,720
He owes day after day the whole world is conviction,

334
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
holding a statue as Buddha.

335
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
If you really understand what his heart is,

336
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,920
just forget about this and beg farewell.

337
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
If he is still alive

338
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,920
and doesn't want to push me further,

339
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,940
Please say again.

340
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,280
No!

341
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,880
Jingrui, you can't go.

342
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,240
This case gained its justice

343
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
What do you want to do?

344
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
What can you do?

345
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,240
Mother, I don't know what I can do.

346
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,240
I just know that I can't do anything

347
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,240
to face this kind of truth.

348
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Jin Rui, you don't know.

349
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
You don't know how much he hates you.

350
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Back then, no one was in the harem.

351
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
But he didn't listen.

352
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
He didn't listen.

353
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
Sister Jingyang,

354
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,240
Consort Chen,

355
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
Prince of Qi, Jing Yu.

356
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
When I saw them die,

357
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
I knew

358
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,240
he had the most cruel and cruelest death in the world.

359
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
That's because he didn't listen to the truth.

360
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
He thought...

361
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,240
You don't understand!

362
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
This is the biggest evil in his heart.

363
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Whoever dares to touch it,

364
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,240
will be punished for his high and high rights.

365
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,240
There will be no good in this.

366
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
Think about it.

367
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
Mr. Li Chong,

368
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
the Grand Tutor, the Prince of Ying,

369
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
who is not the one who clearly states that the world is full of people,

370
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,240
but the result?

371
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,240
No one can stop the heart of a cold-hearted emperor.

372
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Jin Rui,

373
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
can you still tell the world

374
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,240
what the Emperor has done?

375
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,240
Mother,

376
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
we didn't see anything, did we?

377
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
The truth is in my head.

378
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,240
It's like we've never read this book, right?

379
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
A generation of the late king,

380
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,240
a generation of the famous,

381
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,240
70,000 souls,

382
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,240
many people's clear and ideal in their hearts,

383
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
just like this,

384
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
just like this,

385
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
buried in the world.

386
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
Jin Rui,

387
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
I know Mother's thoughts,

388
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
but the truth is the truth.

389
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
Maybe we can't change

390
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,240
all the black and white that has been stolen,

391
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,240
but at least,

392
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,240
we can't be the helpers of the hidden ones.

393
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
But you can't do it.

394
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
You've spent more lives

395
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
than the lives of the people in the White House.

396
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,240
You can't do anything.

397
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,240
Jin Rui,

398
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
you're my child,

399
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,240
my flesh and blood.

400
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,240
I can't just watch you die.

401
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,240
But Mother,

402
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,240
someone has already stolen this book.

403
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,240
We can't be the helpers of the hidden ones.

404
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,240
We can't be the helpers of the hidden ones.

405
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
I can't do anything,

406
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,240
but for you,

407
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,240
I won't be the helpers of the hidden ones.

408
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Let's hand this book

409
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
to the crown prince.

410
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Mother said,

411
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Prince of Jing?

412
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
Yes, Prince of Jing.

413
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Jingyan has taught me

414
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
that there is no source

415
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
between brothers.

416
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
And Lin family's little books.

417
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,240
They are best friends.

418
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
If anyone

419
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
really wants to be the helpers of the hidden ones,

420
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
then Lin family's wish

421
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,240
will be granted.

422
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Princess,

423
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
the letter from the Eastern Palace is here.

424
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,240
I've talked to Marquis Yan.

425
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,240
He's absolutely fine.

426
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Marquis Yan is just a choice.

427
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
It's the best way to

428
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,240
make Princess Liyang's appearance.

429
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
Are you going to the Eastern Palace tomorrow?

430
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Yes.

431
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
Before we discuss something,

432
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
I want to tell Jingyan.

433
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
Yes.

434
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Dr. Wang.

435
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,240
Why are you talking to me so early this morning?

436
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,240
There are alreadyately 18 bottles of load tonight.

437
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,240
The Qingming people of the world can soon be reborn.

438
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Why do you have to say that?

439
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,240
You can't be the same as before.

440
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Even if this case is completely broken,

441
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,240
I can only admit that I didn't sing.

442
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,240
I can't turn back to the forest.

443
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Why is that impossible?

444
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,240
As long as you are wise and wise,

445
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
you can definitely get back to your original identity.

446
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
If anyone dares to do anything to this person,

447
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
Listen to me first.

448
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,240
Everyone knows what kind of person Su Zhe is.

449
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,240
As a ghost,

450
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
he is a ghost.

451
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
Although he has the power to take power,

452
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
he is not a righteous man.

453
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
But...

454
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
Jingyan,

455
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,240
the problem is the ending for me.

456
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
But to you,

457
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
everything just started.

458
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
What should we do?

459
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,240
You are the future emperor.

460
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,240
You must clear your nose,

461
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
strengthen your people,

462
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,240
and make a big change in the history of the past decades.

463
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,240
You must give the world a clear and honest rule.

464
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
If you want to achieve this goal,

465
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,240
you must have a perfect start.

466
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
The King and the Queen of the forest are still alive.

467
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,240
They also hope that in the people's heart,

468
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,240
you are a friend and a friend.

469
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,240
You are a princess without a single word.

470
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
I can do it.

471
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
I believe you can do it.

472
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
So,

473
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,240
you must not have such a plan.

474
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
Otherwise, the world will misunderstand you.

475
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
They think that you like to control the whole world.

476
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,240
That's why they are our first priority.

477
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,240
But this is not an explanation.

478
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,240
I have been in the capital for a long time.

479
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
The two years of the feud between the two great families

480
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,240
have nothing to do with me.

481
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Moreover,

482
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
my hometown is already under construction.

483
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
I don't have any traces of the past.

484
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,240
If I only have you two to testify,

485
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
I will say that I was the leader of the forest.

486
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,240
It is also too much of a matter of time.

487
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
It is hard to believe.

488
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
I don't want to be a coward

489
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
and make people guess

490
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,240
that the truth is hard to be revealed.

491
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,240
I will not waste my efforts for the next 13 years.

492
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,240
I will report it.

493
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,240
Young master.

494
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Mother.

495
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,240
It is because of your hard work for the next 13 years,

496
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,240
I can't let you suffer again.

497
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
If the world misunderstands you,

498
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,240
it is the world's misdeed.

499
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Why do you mind?

500
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
To be honest, I really mind.

501
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
I hope you also mind.

502
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Only by putting the world's views in your heart

503
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,240
can you understand the nature and the contract

504
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,240
and become a great ruler.

505
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Young master,

506
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,240
what you said is two things.

507
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Actually, it is not wrong to not do it back to the forest.

508
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
I have been doing the 13 years of the Meichang tree

509
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
and I am used to it.

510
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,240
Let the forest

511
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
always keep everyone's memory.

512
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,240
Isn't that good?

513
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,240
Your Highness,

514
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,240
please show me the Princess of Yang.

515
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,240
I got it.

516
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
Your Highness.

517
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,240
Aunt.

518
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
Jingrui is back.

519
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

520
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Aunt, please.

521
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
Greetings, Princess of Zhang.

522
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Jingrui, long time no see.

523
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
I didn't expect to see Mr. Su here.

524
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
When the snow wolf came out,

525
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
I knew that Mr. Su was not a loyal person.

526
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,240
Today, it seems that he really has a good sense of humor.

527
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Your Highness, thank you.

528
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
I admire you, Your Highness.

529
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,240
I have a few things to say to you.

530
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,240
I am a great person.

531
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,240
I am not afraid to do anything.

532
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
Jingyan,

533
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
I have something to discuss with you.

534
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,240
It is not convenient for outsiders to be here.

535
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
Please, Mr. Su, please.

536
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
No need.

537
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
Mr. Su is like me.

538
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,240
What can I say to you

539
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
is also possible for Mr. Su.

540
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
I think you came today

541
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,240
to leave the memorial book

542
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,240
for Lord Xie to leave.

543
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
How did you know?

544
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
I made the decision to leave the memorial book.

545
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
I think you have seen the content

546
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
written by Lord Xie.

547
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,240
I don't know what you think.

548
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
You knew the content of the memorial book long ago.

549
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,240
I know what it means.

550
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
The world doesn't know.

551
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
Princess of Zhang,

552
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
you are close to the Qin Tong family.

553
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
I don't know if you have ever

554
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,240
dreamed of this for years.

555
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
I have never dreamed of this.

556
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
I can't believe

557
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
this is the last time I have heard this.

558
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
The memorial book

559
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240

560
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240

00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240

00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
Actually, we came today

565
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
to give this memorial book to the crown prince.

566
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
Since that,

567
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
I want to help the princess.

568
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,240

588
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
Jingrui,

589
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
it was limited

590
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
till you did it.

591
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
Aunt,

592
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
since I confess to you,

593
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,240
there's absolutely one thing

594
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
you can do.

595
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,940
Everyone give a moment

596
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,460

Yeah

600
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,800
You

601
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,040
Did Yuji Song cold feelings try to be crossed?

602
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,140
What was wrong with him?

603
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,320
He just wore white and green gl오ut !

604
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,460
Both the two alternative aluminum shoes

605
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,700
got le tuned ontop of themselves

606
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,020
since she was ok with having a commonator freedoms !

607
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,680
You just got a message from Heheui...

608
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,640
You...

609
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,680
Again and again I will expose you

610
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,120
and rest you head on,

611
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,120
will swallow innocent Rutang for fear.

612
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,680
Get to husband and inte surgeries,

613
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,800
and not relationship with he Qing.

614
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,240
Take this.

615
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,360
I see.

616
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,260
Get up.

617
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,060
After you get heavily punished,

618
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,360
Zhuo will serve you as your clan has always do.

619
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,520
Handle one礼 when your Achilles's new crown.

620
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,840
Cheers.

621
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Call him, if there's something you need.

622
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,520
In a few days, it will be the day of father's birthday.

623
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,520
The royal court will be in charge of the funeral.

624
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,520
This book is Xie Yu's handwriting.

625
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,520
And aunt is Xie Yu's wife.

626
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,520
I want to greet aunt.

627
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,520
I want to help this book with the hundred-point request.

628
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,520
To bring Xie Yu to the funeral.

629
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,520
What did you say?

630
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,520
Aunt knows.

631
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,520
The most important thing in father's life is that he is highly skilled and not easy to challenge.

632
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,520
This case concerns his life.

633
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
No matter how I want to make him regret,

634
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:52,520
he will never make a mistake and leave a grave for the future generations.

635
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:57,520
So I have to create a situation where the people are suffering.

636
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,520
A situation where he is completely out of control.

637
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,520
No matter if he is willing or not,

638
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,520
he must agree to this case.

639
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,520
But this situation needs aunt's approval.

640
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,520
No, no.

641
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,520
Mother.

642
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,520
Your idea is too bold and reckless.

643
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,520
Don't worry, aunt. No matter how aunt sees it,

644
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,520
I will protect aunt's safety and won't let you get hurt.

645
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,520
If you are so stubborn, how are you going to protect me?

646
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,520
Since I have decided to leave this house,

647
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,520
I have already made a complete arrangement.

648
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,520
Father, now you are no longer the father of that year.

649
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,520
Zhi'er, you are no longer the king of that year.

650
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,520
What I want to do is to wash blood and purify the world.

651
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,520
If I don't have the back of my head, I will never have the courage to do anything.

652
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,520
Jingyan, no matter what you say,

653
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,520
you let me take this case seriously.

654
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,520
It's not a matter of my consciousness.

655
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,520
If I hate you, I will do it.

656
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,520
What's the point?

657
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
I will do it.

658
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,520
Your Highness, the Court of Judicial Review sent someone here

659
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,520
to report something to you.

660
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,520
I am sorry.

661
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
Greetings to Noble Consort.

662
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,520
Thank you.

663
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,520
Is there anything wrong with the Court of Judicial Review?

664
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,520
Consort Xian is in the palace.

665
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
She is in a bad mood.

666
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,520
She was just making fun of His Majesty.

667
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,520
She suddenly started to get angry today.

668
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,520
She said something nonsense.

669
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,520
The Court of Judicial Review was afraid

670
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,520
so they asked me to come and ask you about it.

671
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,520
Consort Yu must have missed the late King.

672
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,520
I will go and take a look.

673
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,520
Is it good that you are asking about the court of justice?

674
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,520
You already know the truth about that year.

675
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,520
But what's the point of you after they washed blood?

676
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,520
Are those dead souls not in good terms with you?

677
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,520
Are they just strangers?

678
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,520
Forget it.

679
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,520
Today, the court of justice needs great courage.

680
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,520
If Princess Chang doesn't have the true intention,

681
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,520
she will be able to turn against the plan of His Highness.

682
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,520
Let's do something else.

683
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Thank you for sending me here.

684
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,520
Zhi Er, take Prince Wang to the court of justice.

685
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,520
I have something to discuss with Mr. Su.

686
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,520
Take care, Aunt.

687
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
Jing Yan.

688
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,520
Aunt, please.

689
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,520
I am sorry.

690
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,520
I am sorry.

691
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,520
I am sorry.

692
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,520
I am sorry.

693
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,520
I am sorry.

694
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,520
I am sorry.

695
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,520
I am sorry.

696
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,520
I am sorry.

697
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,520
I am sorry.

698
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,520
I am sorry.

699
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,520
I am sorry.

700
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,520
I am sorry.

701
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,520
I am sorry.

702
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,520
I am sorry.

703
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,520
I am sorry.

704
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,520
I am sorry.

705
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,520
I am sorry.

706
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,520
I am sorry.

707
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,520
I am sorry.

708
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,520
I am sorry.

709
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,520
I am sorry.

710
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,520
I am sorry.

711
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,520
I am sorry.

712
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,520
I am sorry.

713
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,520
I am sorry.

714
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,520
I am sorry.

715
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,520
I am sorry.

716
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,520
I am sorry.

717
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,520
I am sorry.

718
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,520
I am sorry.

719
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,520
I am sorry.

720
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,520
I am sorry.

721
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,520
I am sorry.

722
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,520
I am sorry.

723
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,520
I am sorry.

724
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,520
I am sorry.

725
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,520
I am sorry.

726
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,520
I am sorry.

727
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,520
I am sorry.

728
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,520
I am sorry.

729
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,520
I am sorry.

730
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,520
I am sorry.

731
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,520
I am sorry.
