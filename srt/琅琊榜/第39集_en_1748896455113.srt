1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,820
Episode 12

2
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,520
I went to the

3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:40,920
Summer's

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
spontaneously lying in front of the

5
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,180
way then

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,920
Yes

7
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,000
So that's the limit

8
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,340
well

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I finally understand.

10
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,640
Nice hollows of steel...

11
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,800
Nice leather roofs ofifiably covered in shoes.

12
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,120
Yes.

13
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
Someone come please.

14
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,700
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

15
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,680
Your Majesty.

16
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,340
What?

17
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,080
Yang Guo has requested him to ?

18
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,200
Commander Wang brought Xia Dong

19
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,920
Yes

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,460
He has beenすご игр

21
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,160
Therefore, let it not be a hesitate

22
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,380
Let's go

23
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,460
No

24
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,900
Master, are there any anth sweats ?

25
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,080
I could find out that Xia Dong betrayed Xuan Jin Si

26
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,700
In order toается you deem it of self defense

27
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,980
iggle him to doin himself

28
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,800
Let him metal a fat cap

29
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,580
I can't tell you about this.

30
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,780
That's right.

31
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,260
In your eyes,

32
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,740
it's Xuan Jin Si's senior manager,

33
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,180
and master's beloved disciple.

34
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,620
You will definitely think

35
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,700
it's master's order.

36
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,540
His Majesty summoned Xia Dong.

37
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,900
I'm sure he found out about these details.

38
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,660
He's very suspicious.

39
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,300
He must be interrogating him.

40
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,260
Your Majesty.

41
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,160
Can you sciThank

42
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:22,900
to him?

43
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,020
I can verify it.

44
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,940
I'm so sorry.

45
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,180
Sorry.

46
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,540
I think,

47
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,740
Wei Zheng will be

48
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,820
in closeonderous condition

49
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,300
and hard-to-carry during the war.

50
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,940
Unless he makes fuel of war.

51
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,540
Otherwise, who would be so capable to take him away?

52
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,340
The result is that he has arrived at the Dali Temple.

53
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,340
Tell me.

54
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,100
Did you lead the people

55
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,940
who attacked Xuanjing Temple that morning?

56
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,340
Yes.

57
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,340
Good.

58
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,940
You played a good trick.

59
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,540
You fooled me.

60
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,540
A Xuanjing Temple that is so strong

61
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,940
was killed by the rebels.

62
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,540
No one was caught alive.

63
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,540
In the end, it was because of the patrol camp

64
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,540
that they put him away.

65
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,540
Xia Dong.

66
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,540
Prince Mu trusts you so much.

67
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,540
You are really capable.

68
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,540
I am.

69
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,540
Your Majesty.

70
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,540
Such a big thing.

71
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,540
I think Xia Dong is hard to plan.

72
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,540
He must be behind it.

73
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,540
Do you need to say that?

74
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,540
Who is he?

75
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,540
Who is he?

76
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,540
Who can support him now?

77
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,540
The most exciting game on the line is

78
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,540
The Ma Jianghu, the Ma Jianghu 2,

79
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,540
The Queen of Shangjing,

80
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,540
The Royal Capital,

81
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,540
The Royal Capital,

82
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,540
The Royal Capital,

83
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,540
The Royal Capital,

84
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,540
The Royal Capital,

85
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,540
The Royal Capital,

86
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,540
The Royal Capital,

87
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,540
The Royal Capital,

88
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,540
The Royal Capital,

89
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,540
The Royal Capital,

90
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,540
The Royal Capital,

91
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
The Royal Capital,

92
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,540
The Royal Capital,

93
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,540
The Royal Capital,

94
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,540
The Royal Capital,

95
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,540
The Royal Capital,

96
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,540
Can't you tell?

97
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,540
Where is Wei Zeng?

98
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:46,540
You took him away

99
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,540
What?

100
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,540
Wei Zeng is a man who has eyes.

101
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,540
Naturally he is Wei Zeng's revenge.

102
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,220
He's been a dog for so many years.

103
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,180
I will never let him live another day.

104
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,180
You...

105
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,740
He was a dead criminal.

106
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,220
Do you know that?

107
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,780
Wei Zheng is just a father.

108
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,140
He's not the mastermind.

109
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,260
Besides, His Majesty is so fond of Prince Jin now.

110
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,140
If he keeps his word,

111
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,380
I'm afraid His Majesty will do something wrong.

112
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,700
So I only have to guard the wall.

113
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,700
You...

114
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,980
You're still going to Prince Jin at this time?

115
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,980
Who's going to teach you a lesson?

116
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,780
I did all these things.

117
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,500
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

118
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,940
Please don't blame me, Your Majesty.

119
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,340
You did all this?

120
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,660
What?

121
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,300
You can hide the Wei Zheng from Xia Jiang

122
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,340
and transfer him to the Dali Temple?

123
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,860
Can you do it on purpose?

124
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,500
To get rid of Xuan Jing Temple?

125
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,140
You can do it on your own

126
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,140
and pretend to be a demon.

127
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,340
Xia Dong.

128
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,340
The first key to Xuan Jing Temple is the Central Military Army.

129
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,540
What about you?

130
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,140
You're all on the same page!

131
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,660
Brother, don't be angry.

132
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,140
Don't be angry.

133
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,540
No matter what,

134
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,900
it's clear.

135
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,740
Even if it's a big deal,

136
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,980
you're the one who's going to get hit this time.

137
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,540
Or Jing Yan will be in great trouble.

138
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,100
His temperament is not soft.

139
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,420
He's in great trouble.

140
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,100
He'll be thrown into the trap by others.

141
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,980
How could he do such a thing?

142
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,100
How could Jing Yan be in great trouble?

143
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,260
But Xia Dong has been living alone for years.

144
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,020
He's been in trouble.

145
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,060
Please let him be a good man.

146
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,020
I can't punish him now.

147
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
Meng Zhi.

148
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,900
Chen Zai.

149
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,140
You're the one who led the army.

150
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,100
You're the one who sent Xuan Jing Temple to the subordinates

151
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,500
and asked for the imperial decree.

152
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,980
If you dare to act rashly,

153
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,900
I'll kill you!

154
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

155
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,820
Your Majesty.

156
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,980
After Xuan Jing Temple is sent to the capital,

157
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,340
I will definitely ask for your permission.

158
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,740
But you'll never see me.

159
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,580
How could you do such a thing?

160
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,340
Take Xia Jiang and Xia Dong

161
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,540
to the prison.

162
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

163
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,860
I'm afraid you'll be confused.

164
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,860
I'm afraid you won't protect me.

165
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,860
It's okay if he doesn't.

166
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,780
I'm afraid he'll be in trouble.

167
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,140
His Majesty is very worried.

168
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,060
He's always like this.

169
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,940
His Majesty thinks that

170
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,540
he's the one who's doing what he's supposed to do.

171
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,540
That's why he's so stubborn.

172
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,300
In that case,

173
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,260
the whole thing has changed

174
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,060
in His Majesty's eyes.

175
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,620
If it's just because Xia Dong led the army to the prison,

176
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,380
it's not a good idea.

177
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,820
I can't explain myself.

178
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,740
I'm just following the plan.

179
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,380
His Majesty believes in me

180
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,540
and he trusts Prince Jing.

181
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,260
Master,

182
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,460
is there another Meichang Su?

183
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,860
Meichang Su is so stubborn.

184
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,660
I can't let him have the chance to talk to His Majesty.

185
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,660
What do you mean?

186
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,100
After the news of Xia Dong,

187
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,900
he'll be asking me to ask him.

188
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,340
Even if someone asks for Meichang Su,

189
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,100
it won't be easy.

190
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,100
We must do it now.

191
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,540
I'll go first.

192
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,540
Come with me.

193
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,300
Remember,

194
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,100
follow Xuanjing Temple and all the channels.

195
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,900
Don't let them get in.

196
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,860
Yes, sir.

197
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,100
Go.

198
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,500
Go down.

199
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,700
Yes, sir.

200
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,700
It seems that

201
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,220
Master Xia's face

202
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,980
has changed his mind.

203
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,940
I can't help it, Mr. Su.

204
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,540
He's been sending me off for a long time.

205
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,340
Xuanjing Temple's situation is not good.

206
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,900
Don't worry, sir.

207
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,900
I'm so당ious.

208
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,620
I won't let you stand in the way.

209
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,940
Your Excellency Xi Polo,

210
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,100
you always depends on the teacher.

211
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,380
You look after your passion step by step,

212
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,940
have you ever axis it?

213
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,460
Kapit rock kill all.

214
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,980
One cannot do anything antony one's value in one's words.

215
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,220
In the past,

216
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,260
Xia Dong is the same as you ha dress as that of a d 감사합니다.

217
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,140
I thought that the mission is like a mountain,

218
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,260
and it cannot be resisted.

219
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,140
But why has it changed now?

220
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,740
You mentioned this.

221
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,940
I just want to delay the time.

222
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,140
But the situation is changing.

223
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,260
Please forgive me.

224
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,340
I can't talk to you anymore.

225
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,620
My Lord.

226
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,900
The Dragon word is changed.

227
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,940
Do you also not wish to know?

228
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,980
The谁が is lost.

229
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,060
The sword is broken.

230
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,060
The someone ofecd has lost.

231
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,780
The sword is broken completely.

232
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,780
Be careful.

233
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,260
This place is the Xuanjing Manor of the Crown Prince's family.

234
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,820
I am also the chief of the imperial family,

235
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,420
the only Marquis of the same family.

236
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,500
Even if His Majesty orders you to come and summon me,

237
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,300
you can't be so reckless.

238
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,500
You're wrong.

239
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,260
His Majesty didn't order me to summon you.

240
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,260
As His Majesty ordered,

241
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,260
you are so unprofessional.

242
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,260
Do you want to rebel?

243
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,260
The chief of the family said that he would rebel.

244
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,260
But you really gave him a chance.

245
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,260
Meng Zhi, what do you want?

246
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,260
Your Majesty, you are ordered to come and summon Xuanjing Manor.

247
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,260
All the people and people will be summoned.

248
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,260
It's impossible.

249
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,260
It's impossible.

250
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,260
His Majesty is always being summoned by the people.

251
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,260
He will summon me to the Imperial Palace.

252
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,260
He can't be summoned directly.

253
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,260
You are the one who ordered me to summon His Majesty.

254
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,260
You are the most ungrateful one.

255
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,260
This is a serious matter.

256
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,260
You have no intention to listen to me.

257
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,260
But it's because Xia Dong has been released from the manor.

258
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,260
How can it be a serious matter?

259
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,260
Your Excellency, you don't understand.

260
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,260
It's okay.

261
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,260
There is something in prison that makes you think.

262
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:32,260
Brother Chun, Dong'er is my sister.

263
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,260
He will never betray the people.

264
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,260
I must listen to him.

265
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,260
You and my sister have too much to listen to.

266
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,260
You will be in trouble.

267
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,260
Chu Simei Changsu is the commander of the family.

268
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,260
You can't be so bold.

269
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,260
Brother, go and talk to him.

270
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,260
My Lord.

271
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,260
My Lord.

272
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,260
What's the matter?

273
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,260
My Lord, something is wrong.

274
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,260
The imperial guards are all in the imperial palace.

275
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,260
They are all under the command of the whole family.

276
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,260
They are ordered by His Majesty to investigate the situation.

277
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,260
What? Where is the commander?

278
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,260
The commander has been taken by Commander Meng.

279
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,260
Master.

280
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,260
My Lord.

281
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,260
You are really loyal.

282
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,260
At this time,

283
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,260
you still don't want to finish Master's order.

284
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,260
If you let me go to prison alive,

285
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,260
I'm afraid I will be dead.

286
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,260
You.

287
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,260
It's not fun.

288
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,260
The imperial guards are very strict.

289
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,260
I can't find out more information.

290
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,260
I just know

291
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,260
His Majesty doesn't even want to summon Xia Jiang.

292
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,260
He just took Xia Yu.

293
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,260
Why does he even call Xia Jiang?

294
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,260
I can't figure out

295
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,260
where the problem is.

296
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,260
How can I let Father handle it?

297
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,260
My Lord.

298
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,260
Now,

299
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,260
maybe we can only make it through.

300
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,260
After all,

301
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,260
Xia Jiang has been in charge of this since the beginning.

302
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,260
His Majesty didn't

303
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,260
go in there.

304
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,260
Even so,

305
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,260
Xia Jiang may not be so good.

306
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,260
He dares to take me out.

307
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,260
Moreover, that day,

308
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,260
before the imperial guards met,

309
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,260
I forced Xia Jiang to break into the capital.

310
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,260
How could Father not see it?

311
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,260
It's only now that I want to withdraw.

312
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,260
I'm afraid it's not easy.

313
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,260
What should I do?

314
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,260
Brother Huang.

315
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,260
Brother Huang.

316
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,260
Although I'm worried about today,

317
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,260
it's not that I have to deal with it right away.

318
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,260
I'll talk to you later.

319
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,260
I think you're tired, Brother Huang.

320
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,260
You should go back to the harem and rest.

321
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,260
I'll take my leave.

322
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,260
Wait a little longer.

323
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,260
Stay with me for a while.

324
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,260
When the imperial guards come back,

325
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,260
listen to what Xia Jiang said.

326
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,260
Yes.

327
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,260
Your Majesty.

328
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,260
Minister of Justice of the Ministry of Justice, Cai Quan,

329
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,260
Minister of Revenue of the Ministry of Revenue,

330
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,260
Shen Zui,

331
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,260
is outside the palace.

332
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,260
He said he has something to report to Your Majesty.

333
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,260
What's going on between these two?

334
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,260
It's only the 16th of the month.

335
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,260
They're going to the palace for a meeting.

336
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,260
Is there anything urgent?

337
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,260
Shen Zui is fine.

338
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,260
Minister Cai is a very famous person.

339
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,260
But he can't wait for a few guests

340
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,260
if he has something to do.

341
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,260
Brother Huang, why don't you

342
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
let them in?

343
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,260
If there's nothing urgent,

344
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,260
you can just scold them.

345
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,260
You'll be angry.

346
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,260
You're talking nonsense and fighting.

347
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,260
They're both the second-hand officials of the court.

348
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,260
How can you scold them?

349
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,260
Let them in.

350
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,260
Yes.

351
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,260
I, Cai Quan,

352
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,260
greet Your Majesty.

353
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,260
Wake up.

354
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

355
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,260
It's not over yet.

356
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,260
You two are in a hurry.

357
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,260
What's the hurry?

358
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,260
Your Majesty,

359
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,260
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,260
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,260
I'm sorry.

362
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,260
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,260
I'm sorry.

364
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,260
I'm sorry.

365
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,260
I've been investigating a case recently.

366
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,260
It's related to the private kitchen

367
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,260
of the Ministry of Revenue last year.

368
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,260
I think it's necessary

369
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,260
to report it to His Majesty.

370
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,260
Private kitchen?

371
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,260
That's the private kitchen

372
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,260
that the late king and the former minister

373
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,260
of the Ministry of Revenue

374
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,260
colluded with the one

375
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,260
in the northern palace.

376
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,260
Isn't this thing

377
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,260
already clear?

378
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,260
The Crown Prince was punished

379
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,260
for this.

380
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,260
What?

381
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,260
Are you still not done with the report?

382
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,260
The private kitchen

383
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,260
was personally handled by Minister Shen.

384
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,260
It's clear that the late king

385
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,260
and the former minister of the House

386
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,260
should be punished for the crime.

387
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,260
It's also a shame.

388
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,260
I'm not saying that he made a mistake.

389
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,260
I'm pointing out

390
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,260
the explosion of the private kitchen.

391
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,260
Explosion?

392
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

393
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,260
The private kitchen was reported today.

394
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,260
There were over 100 people dead.

395
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,260
60 people were in the private kitchen.

396
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,260
The people were in pain.

397
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,260
I think His Majesty

398
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,260
has also taken the risk.

399
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,260
Isn't this thing

400
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,260
already been handled?

401
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,260
The people have been relieved.

402
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,260
Is there anyone

403
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,260
who is still not satisfied?

404
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,260
At that time,

405
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,260
everyone thought it was an accident.

406
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,260
It was because of the explosion

407
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,260
that the private kitchen was not on fire.

408
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,260
I recently found out that

409
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,260
it wasn't an accident.

410
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,260
It wasn't an accident?

411
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,260
Is there anyone who deliberately did it?

412
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,260
I have a statement to make.

413
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,260
Your Majesty, please take a look.

414
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,260
Your Majesty, please calm down.

415
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,260
Your Majesty,

416
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,260
at first,

417
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,260
I was not able to get a concubine

418
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,260
because of other cases.

419
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,260
In order to reduce the crime,

420
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,260
I was willing to report to the private kitchen

421
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,260
for the crime.

422
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,260
I was able to investigate it.

423
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,260
The people who were involved

424
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,260
were getting more and more.

425
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,260
The truth is getting more and more clear.

426
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,260
My statement

427
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,260
is close to the number of people

428
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,260
who were involved.

429
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,260
I have decided to believe it.

430
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,260
Actually, until now,

431
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
I knew I had never found out the truth.

432
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,260
But since I was involved

433
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,260
with the officials of the same level,

434
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,260
I couldn't move.

435
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
So today,

436
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,260
I would like to ask Mr. Shen to come in.

437
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,260
Please make sure that

438
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,260
the court is not in a hurry

439
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,260
to investigate and make a decision.

440
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,260
I hope that

441
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,260
you can make a quick announcement.

442
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,260
The Court of Judicial Review, Zhu Yue.

443
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,260
Well,

444
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,260
all the witnesses and the officials

445
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,260
have pointed out Zhu Yue.

446
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,260
But there is a motive in the matter.

447
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,260
As the Court of Judicial Review,

448
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,260
why did he order

449
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,260
the private kitchen to be reported?

450
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,260
Your Highness, Zhu Yue is the emperor of the royal family.

451
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,260
And the private kitchen is the king of the county.

452
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,260
Today,

453
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,260
he has reported the people's complaints.

454
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,260
He is only pointing out the king of the county.

455
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,260
Who is the one to take advantage of it?

456
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,260
What are you talking about?

457
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,260
It's all a mess.

458
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,260
But this matter is a big crime.

459
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,260
You can't be too serious, brother.

460
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,260
I think it's better

461
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,260
to ask Zhu Yue to come in.

462
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,260
You can ask him yourself.

463
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,260
You are so stupid.

464
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,260
I am not stupid.

465
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,260
From the private kitchen, Zhu Yue,

466
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,260
the Court of Judicial Review,

467
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,260
to the private kitchen,

468
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,260
the whole capital, Xiajiang,

469
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,260
it looks like a mess.

470
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,260
But in fact,

471
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,260
it's clear.

472
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,260
Your Highness, you mean

473
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,260
the former king of the county,

474
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,260
the current king of the county,

475
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,260
is the king of the royal family?

476
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,260
No way.

477
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,260
We are all close friends.

478
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,260
How could we be so sincere?

479
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,260
And Jingyan.

480
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,260
Jingyan is the general of the county.

481
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,260
It should be related to Jinghuan.

482
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,260
You are talking about the key.

483
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,260
There is nothing to worry about.

484
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,260
I can explain

485
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,260
everything else.

486
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,260
But this Xuanjing Temple,

487
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,260
the imperial dynasty,

488
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,260
the independent party,

489
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,260
the Xuanjing Temple of the emperor,

490
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,260
Jingyan can also hide from me

491
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,260
for the king of the royal family.

492
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,260
I can't tolerate it.

493
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,260
Gao Zhen.

494
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,260
Yes.

495
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,260
Send the edict.

496
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,260
Let's go to the palace.

497
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,260
Mr. Su, are you okay?

498
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,260
I'm fine.

499
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,260
I've heard your blessing.

500
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,260
I've been living in Weichang Su for a long time.

501
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,260
Weichang Su.

502
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,260
Seven days.

503
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,260
Remember this clearly.

504
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,260
Only seven days.

505
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,260
What seven days?

506
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,260
What is he talking about?

507
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,260
Mr. Su looks like this now.

508
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,260
I'm afraid he can't live for seven days.

509
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,260
I still have to say

510
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,260
that if he dies,

511
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,260
nothing will be left.

512
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,260
You can't win.

513
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,260
What do you mean?

514
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,260
Commander Wang.

515
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,260
Ask Prince Jin for me.

516
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,260
He saved Wei Zheng and Zhelemei Changsu.

517
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,260
He's such a good buyer.

518
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,260
What is he talking about?

519
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,260
You can trust me.

520
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,260
Weichang Su.

521
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,260
What do you mean?

522
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,260
I'm here to see my father.

523
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,260
What can I do for you?

524
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,260
You're not alone.

525
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,260
Look at this.

526
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,260
What is this?

527
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,260
Father, I'm wrong.

528
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,260
I know nothing about Xuanjing Temple.

529
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,260
Jinghuai.

530
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,260
Look at this memorial.

531
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,260
Maybe it has nothing to do with Xuanjing Temple.

532
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,260
Father.

533
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,260
I'm wrong.

534
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,260
Prince Yu.

535
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,260
I sent these memorials to Your Majesty.

536
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,260
The memorial is only for Zhu Yue.

537
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,260
It's not related to you.

538
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,260
Why do you want to blame me?

539
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,260
Father.

540
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,260
These memorials are not for me.

541
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,260
But everyone knows that Zhu Yue is my brother.

542
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,260
He sent me here.

543
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,260
Father, you should have known.

544
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,260
Prince Yu.

545
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,260
You mean you can take care of Zhu Yue?

546
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,260
These are all the evidence.

547
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,260
How can I believe it?

548
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,260
Zhu Yue is always a criminal.

549
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,260
This is a crime.

550
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,260
I'm afraid it's more likely that he's wrong.

551
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,260
Your Majesty.

552
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,260
I don't dare to say that he's wrong.

553
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,260
But I think it's his personal fault.

554
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,260
It's not his fault.

555
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,260
If he's wrong, he'll be punished.

556
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,260
I ask Your Majesty to be safe.

557
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,260
After the court hearing on the 16th of the month,

558
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,260
I'll summon the three secretaries to the Hall of Fame.

559
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,260
We must find out the truth.

560
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,260
And let Zhu Yue know.

561
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,260
You said Zhu Yue is wrong.

562
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,260
So you don't mean the three secretaries will be the Hall of Fame?

563
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,260
Zhu Yue is only a witness.

564
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,260
I don't mean to say that he's a witness.

565
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,260
But although he's a secretaries,

566
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,260
no one knows that he's the main witness.

567
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,260
I heard that he's a criminal.

568
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,260
He's always been a criminal.

569
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,260
Zhu Yue is timid.

570
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,260
I'm worried...

571
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,260
Your Majesty.

572
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,260
If Prince Yu is worried,

573
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,260
you can listen to him.

574
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,260
I'll do my best to make it.

575
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,260
Your Majesty, please make sure the three secretaries are the Hall of Fame.

576
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,260
I'll do my best.

577
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,260
Yes.

578
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,260
What?

579
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,260
I asked you to be the witness.

580
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,260
You're so worried.

581
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,260
I'm not worried.

582
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,260
If Father wants me to go,

583
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,260
I'll do it myself.

584
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,260
You're still so stubborn.

585
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,260
I've been so worried about you these years.

586
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,260
I'm afraid that you'll be in trouble.

587
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,260
You're so stubborn.

588
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,260
You think I'm old-fashioned?

589
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,260
You can't even stand my Xuanjing Temple.

590
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,260
What can I do?

591
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,260
I...

592
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,260
Xiao Jinghuan.

593
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,260
I really despise you.

594
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,260
You're so clean.

595
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,260
You're just like Xuanjing Temple.

596
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,260
Right?

597
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,260
Father is a spy.

598
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
I dare not force you.

599
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,260
But Xuanjing Temple...

600
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,260
I really don't have any.

601
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,260
Please let me know.

602
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,260
I'm sorry.

603
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,260
I've already called for you.

604
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,260
You're still forcing me.

605
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,260
How dare you make me know?

606
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,260
You really want to find out the truth?

607
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,260
Can you stand it?

608
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:39,260
Brother, you're so petty.

609
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,260
Those tricks in the dormitory.

610
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,260
I'm just a blind eye.

611
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,260
You're over the top.

612
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,260
Who knows that you're a pervert?

613
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,260
Now you're even deceiving me.

614
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,260
If you continue like this,

615
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,260
who else will you be?

616
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,260
Speak.

617
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,260
Is Zhu Yue's relationship with you enough?

618
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,260
If you keep talking like this,

619
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,260
I'll never forgive you.

620
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,260
I really don't know what happened to Zhu Yue.

621
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,260
I have nothing to do with what happened to Xia Jiang.

622
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,260
I just pushed him out of the hall.

623
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,260
I helped him a few times.

624
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,260
He's so clean.

625
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,260
Even Xia Jiang thought you were the new emperor

626
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,260
who helped you in advance.

627
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,260
But you're in this state.

628
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,260
It's said that you're the most like me in the royal family.

629
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,260
But look at you.

630
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,260
You dare to act like you're not.

631
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,260
You're a little like me.

632
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,260
A little like me.

633
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,260
Your Majesty, please calm down.

634
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,260
Please calm down, your Majesty.

635
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,260
I think we should let Jing Huan go.

636
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,260
Maybe there's another reason for this.

637
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,260
Where's the kent?

638
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,260
I beg your Majesty to allow the three-dimensional spirit to be in the kent.

639
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,260
I'll do it.

640
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,260
Father, I'm sorry.

641
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,260
The three-dimensional spirit is big.

642
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,260
Once the spirit is in the kent, it will be exposed.

643
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,260
If it's a murder of the royal family,

644
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,260
I'll kill myself.

645
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,260
If that's the case,

646
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,260
I'll do it.

647
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,260
But please understand.

648
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,260
I always make mistakes.

649
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,260
I never dare to be disrespectful to my father.

650
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,260
I just beg for your protection.

651
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,260
Cai Qing,

652
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,260
I'll order the imperial decree

653
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,260
to remove Zhu Yue's position.

654
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,260
Without the identity of the royal family,

655
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,260
love can be interrogated at will.

656
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,260
But I don't need to use the three-dimensional spirit.

657
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,260
Your Majesty,

658
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,260
do you mean I should take care of this case?

659
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Yes.

660
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,260
This case can be considered as a case of Zhu Yue.

661
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,260
It's enough to calm the people down.

662
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,260
I thought it's unnecessary to chase after him.

663
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,260
For this case,

664
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,260
I didn't even have a good time.

665
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,260
It's really hard.

666
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,260
It's a matter of time.

667
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,260
Come.

668
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,260
I understand.

669
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,260
Chief!

670
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,260
Chief!

671
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,260
Chief!

672
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,260
Chief!

673
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,260
Come.

674
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,260
How is Wei Shang?

675
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,260
General Wei is safe in the Mu's Mansion.

676
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,260
No one is missing.

677
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
Where is Chief Su?

678
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
The people from the Yangtze Valley have all been sent out of the city.

679
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,260
Let Lord Jian take the day off today.

680
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,260
Let's rest for a while.

681
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,260
Yes.

682
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,260
And tell Commander Meng.

683
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,260
Dong Jie will stay in the old town for a while.

684
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,260
Let him take good care of him.

685
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,260
Shut up!

686
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,260
Say another word.

687
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,260
Do you believe I'll kill you?

688
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,260
Brother Cai!

689
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,260
Lord Cai!

690
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,260
Cai Quan!

691
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,260
Wait for me!

692
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,260
What's the use of you being like this?

693
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,260
Don't you have any habits?

694
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,260
Can you have any habits?

695
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,260
You...

696
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,260
This is not a place for you to be.

697
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,260
You're not a person.

698
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,260
You're a person.

699
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,260
This is not a place for you to talk.

700
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,260
Let's go out first.

701
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,260
Brother Shen.

702
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,260
After you leave the palace,

703
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,260
go to the bar with me and have a drink.

704
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,260
What bar?

705
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,260
Go to my house.

706
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,260
We'll be there anyway.

707
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,260
Alright.

708
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,260
Your Majesty.

709
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,260
The military police has already checked the area.

710
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,260
Xia Jiang, Xia Chun, Xia Qiu.

711
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
They have already sent the guards to the prison.

712
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,260
As for the young master,

713
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,260
the guards and the guards

714
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,260
are all under the command of the imperial guards.

715
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,260
Listen to your Majesty's words.

716
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,260
What do you mean?

717
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,260
You still don't want to admit your crime.

718
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,260
You've been demanding for your life.

719
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,260
This is Xia Jiang's duty.

720
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,260
You can't admit your crime until the last moment.

721
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,260
If he's a good man,

722
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,260
it's strange that he's a criminal.

723
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,260
Your Majesty.

724
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,260
Xia Jiang has been demanding for his life.

725
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,260
Xia Dong insisted that

726
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,260
he did it on his own.

727
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,260
Chun Cui is not involved in the revenge on Wei Fu.

728
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,260
Do you think

729
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,260
he's trustworthy?

730
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,260
You...

731
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,260
You're too simple.

732
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Xia Dong's words

733
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,260
are only your words.

734
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,260
Don't you think

735
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,260
if he really did it on his own,

736
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,260
and killed him in prison,

737
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,260
why would he pretend to be a criminal

738
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,260
and take him out?

739
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,260
Besides,

740
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,260
Prince Ji saw

741
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
that they were giving Wei Zheng a good time.

742
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,260
Is this a revenge?

743
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,260
It's obvious that he doesn't want to die.

744
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,260
But this is what

745
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,260
Xia Dong did.

746
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,260
He's afraid that Wei Zheng

747
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,260
would have died long ago.

748
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,260
That means

749
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,260
Wei Zheng might have been locked up

750
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,260
by Xuan Jing Si in some place?

751
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,260
I think so too.

752
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,260
I think

753
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:07,260
he still wants to write a few articles about Wei Zheng.

754
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,260
For example,

755
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,260
he secretly

756
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,260
put him in a place

757
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,260
that Prince Jing was in charge of.

758
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,260
He sent people to search him out.

759
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,260
In this way,

760
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,260
he's the most serious criminal in the world.

761
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,260
He's even more serious than the criminal.

762
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,260
This is too vicious.

763
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,260
How could he be so involved?

764
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,260
This...

765
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,260
This...

766
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,260
Brother, you're so wise.

767
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,260
You'll understand in a second.

768
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,260
I'm a fool.

769
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,260
I can't...

770
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:43,260
I can't think of such a place.

771
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,260
It's because you don't know Xia Jiang.

772
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,260
I know his tricks.

773
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,260
I used to think

774
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,260
he wouldn't lie to me.

775
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,260
So I didn't have much power.

776
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,260
Now I think about it.

777
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,260
It's really shocking.

778
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,260
If Wei Zheng is still here

779
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,260
and is in Xia Jiang,

780
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,260
that's a great idea.

781
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,260
We'll talk about Xia Jiang.

782
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,260
Then we'll know the whereabouts of the criminal.

783
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,260
It's useless to talk about Xia Jiang.

784
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:21,260
He won't hand Wei Zheng over.

785
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,260
Why?

786
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,260
You're so simple.

787
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,260
You're still thinking about it.

788
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,260
Xia Jiang is going to be a criminal now.

789
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,260
Jing Yan is going to be a criminal.

790
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,260
If he hand Wei Zheng over,

791
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,260
it means he's guilty.

792
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,260
Yes.

793
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,260
It's a big crime to thank the prince.

794
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,260
If he hand Wei Zheng over,

795
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:57,260
it means he's guilty.

796
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,260
It's a crime to thank the prince.

797
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,260
Xia Jiang is too suspicious.

798
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:09,260
Tell him I don't want to see him.

799
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,260
Let him think about it.

800
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,260
After he's done,

801
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,260
give him a letter.

802
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,260
Yes.

803
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,260
You can leave.

804
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,260
I'll take my leave.

805
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,260
I'll leave.

806
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,260
Your Majesty.

807
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,260
Do you want to go to the nursing home?

808
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,260
I'm only asking for your help.

809
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,260
Yes.

810
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,260
Your Highness.

811
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,260
How is it?

812
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,260
Don't worry.

813
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,260
Everything is settled.

814
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,260
Nothing more.

815
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,260
I'll go to the nursing home.

816
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,260
Nothing more.

817
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,260
Where's Mr. Su?

818
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,260
Mr. Su has been taken back to the nursing home.

819
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,260
Is he injured?

820
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,260
Mr. Su was trapped in Xuanjing Temple for three days.

821
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,260
Xia Jiang must have taken care of him.

822
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,260
He went to the nursing home at night.

823
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,260
I sent someone to ask him about it.

824
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,260
Mr. Su is so mysterious.

825
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,260
Everything is settled.

826
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,260
After the palace is built,

827
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,260
it's only two hours.

828
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,260
The order to seal Xuanjing Temple is here.

829
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,260
Mr. Su knows His Majesty well.

830
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,260
His Majesty can tolerate Prince Yu,

831
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:33,260
and he can do everything he wants.

832
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,260
He can also tolerate Xuanjing Temple.

833
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,260
He can do anything he wants.

834
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,260
But he can't tolerate it.

835
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,260
They are together.

836
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,260
This is what His Majesty thinks.

837
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,260
His Majesty is so ungrateful.

838
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,260
He doesn't even give Xia Jiang a chance to be with him.

839
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
He doesn't even take Xia Yu.

840
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,260
He has no mercy.

841
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,260
You know,

842
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,260
Xia Jiang is...

843
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,260
His Majesty's loyalty to him

844
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,260
is unparalleled.

845
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,260
He can't help but think about it.

846
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,260
He is just like that.

847
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,260
What do you think?

848
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,260
In the past,

849
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,260
he was not a kind of grudge

850
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,260
to Prince Qi and Uncle Xiang.

851
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,260
The palace is built

852
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,260
