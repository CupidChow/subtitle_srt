00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Hurry up!

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's coming!

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hurry up!

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hurry up!

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hurry up!

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
3,000 to 50,000.

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We don't have enough troops and weapons.

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The camp is located in the grassland.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The horses are safe and sound.

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We can't guard them.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If the king forces the horses to attack,

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
we will lose the battle.

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What do you mean?

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The people of the Fairy Palace will be in trouble.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The 5000-men army of the Fairy Palace

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
will be in danger of the battle.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We must take the advantage of our strength

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and attack the troops.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Go!

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Go!

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Go!

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Go!

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Go!

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Go!

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Go!

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Go!

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Go!

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Go!

30
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The Fairy Palace is located in the grassland.

31
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The Fairy Palace is located in the grassland.

32
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The most exciting game of the game is

33
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
the horse race.

34
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The horse race is 2nd place.

35
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The Queen of the Rally,

36
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
the Queen of the Rally,

37
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
the Queen of the Rally,

38
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
the Queen of the Rally,

39
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
the Queen of the Rally,

40
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
the Queen of the Rally,

41
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
the Queen of the Rally,

42
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
the Queen of the Rally,

43
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
the Queen of the Rally,

44
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
the Queen of the Rally,

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
the Queen of the Rally,

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
the Queen of the Rally,

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
the Queen of the Rally,

48
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
the Queen of the Rally,

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
the Queen of the Rally,

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the Queen of the Rally,

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
the Queen of the Rally,

52
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the Queen of the Rally,

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
the Queen of the Rally,

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the Queen of the Rally,

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
the Queen of the Rally,

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
the Queen of the Rally,

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,960
the Queen of the Rally.

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Go!

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Go!

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Her Majesty!

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Her Majesty!

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Her Majesty!

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Her Majesty!

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Her Majesty!

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Her Majesty!

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Her Majesty!

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Her Majesty!

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Her Majesty!

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Her Majesty!

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Hit!

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Everything is relieved!

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Her Majesty!

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Your Highness, Moji, no matter how he is, there are only three thousand soldiers.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,500
And I, the late Emperor, have five thousand soldiers.

75
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's re-enact the flag and take down the camp.

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No.

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Order!

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We'll take the camp.

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We'll take the camp?

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Then they'll have one more day to store the camp.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Maybe there'll be some other changes.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I have my own plan.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll send a quick message to the army.

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We'll have to advance to the army.

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We must not be in the camp tonight.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We must not be in the camp tonight.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We must arrive before noon tomorrow.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Chief, Commander Meng is really good at using his weapons.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The army's first-class camp is very fast.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
As you said, the army's morale is unstable.

91
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There's no fighting.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
After the first-class camp is defeated, the King of Yu will be on the battlefield.

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We have no plans to advance to the army immediately.

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
After this battle, the King of Yu will not dare to attack the camp.

95
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We'll have one more day.

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The King of Yu will not wait.

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This must be his plan.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think he'll send troops to surround us.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Chief Meng, before you leave,

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
you must not let them do anything to you.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hurry up!

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hurry up!

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The army is coming!

104
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hurry up!

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The King of Zhao and the royal family are now with His Majesty.

106
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The camp is under the control of the King of Yan.

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We'll split up and follow the guards.

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yu Jin.

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Your Highness.

111
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You're the first to attack the soldiers and guards in each of the houses.

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Report to Mr. Su.

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes, Your Highness.

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I knew that this day would come.

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Jing Huan is the son of Ling Long.

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Perhaps, the situation is not as bad as His Majesty thought.

117
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But the army is still in the way.

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's much worse than the King of Qi.

119
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's even worse!

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
How is it outside?

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The army is in the snow.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Chief Meng is with us.

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

124
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm not worried about the fact that you're here.

125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Mr. Su.

126
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why are you not in the palace?

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What are you doing down the mountain?

128
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I want to go to the battlefield to kill the enemies.

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're still young.

130
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The King of Jing is very kind.

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm a man.

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I should be born as a man.

133
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay.

134
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll set up a mission for you.

135
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Okay.

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Listen to the imperial decree.

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes.

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I order you to go to the hunting palace.

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
To protect the royal family and the safety of the royal family.

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You must not be wronged.

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If you fail, you will be punished.

142
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes.

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Sister Gong Yi.

144
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes.

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Hurry.

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's go.

147
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hurry up.

148
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hurry up.

149
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's go inside.

150
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Hurry up.

151
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Run.

152
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
Nothing!

153
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,740
elas

154
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The damage of the Qingli Army must be small.

155
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
After this battle, the army of the Qingli Army

156
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
will have at least three or four thousand.

157
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We've done all the work that the hunters can do.

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The battle of the dead is not a miracle.

159
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Only the dead.

160
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What?

161
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The camp is gone.

162
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
They've all gone to the hunting palace?

163
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yes.

164
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The Xia Konging is hiding the firecrackers everywhere.

165
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The King of Shang is very cruel.

166
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
The hunting palace is a difficult place to guard.

167
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But there is no way to retreat.

168
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Xiao Jingyan should understand

169
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
that it's hard to retreat for a few days.

170
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Unless

171
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
he has sent someone to move the soldiers.

172
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The closest Ji Cheng Army

173
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
will be here at least two days.

174
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
They will be here at least four days.

175
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Even if Ji Cheng Army comes to reinforce,

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
they will be here in the day after tomorrow.

177
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No matter what, we must take down the hunters.

178
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yes.

179
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Father.

180
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I can't wait for the day

181
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
when I can't go to the hunting palace.

182
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You all are trying to force me.

183
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I wonder if you can

184
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
come back before the wedding.

185
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I will never fall

186
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
until the last moment.

187
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No one can fall.

188
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Close the gate.

189
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Brother Su.

190
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I will call all the people who can use the kill.

191
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Let them stay in the palace.

192
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
There are many people here.

193
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
They have never seen the blood.

194
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Are you sure you want to stay outside?

195
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Do you want me and a bunch of old men to stay inside?

196
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Fei Liu.

197
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Follow brother Yuting.

198
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I will go with you.

199
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Fei Liu.

200
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Follow brother Yuting.

201
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Brother Su.

202
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Take good care of my father.

203
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Brother Su.

204
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Brother Su.

205
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Brother Su.

206
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
150 steps.

207
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
100 steps.

208
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Fire.

209
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
There is a gun.

210
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I have a gun.

211
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Take the people out.

212
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yes.

213
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Uncle Wang.

214
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Uncle Wang.

215
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Uncle Wang.

216
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Are you all right?

217
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Brother Su.

218
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Hurry up.

219
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Hurry up.

220
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Come inside.

221
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Close the gate.

222
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Close the gate.

223
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Hurry up.

224
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Close the gate.

225
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Hurry up.

226
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Everyone, get out of the way.

227
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Hurry up.

228
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Hurry up.

229
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Hurry up.

230
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Hurry up.

231
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Hurry up.

232
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Hurry up.

233
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Hurry up.

234
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hurry up.

235
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Hurry up.

236
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Hurry up.

237
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Hurry up.

238
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Close the gate.

239
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Close the gate.

240
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Close the gate.

241
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Close the gate.

242
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Close the gate.

243
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I got it.

244
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I got it.

245
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I got it.

246
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I got it.

247
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Jing Yan.

248
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Are you not here yet?

249
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

250
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Jing Yan will come.

251
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
He will definitely come.

252
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
If the rebels attack us,

253
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Prince Yu will...

254
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Will he do anything to us?

255
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Shut up.

256
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
How could he come in here?

257
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
How could he do anything to us?

258
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
He is too loyal.

259
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
He is too devoted.

260
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Take this.

261
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Use your strength.

262
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yes.

263
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Go.

264
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Don't fire.

265
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Don't fire.

266
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Hurry up.

267
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Why can't you get through?

268
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Why can't you get through?

269
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
The real hunter is the last one to meet the line.

270
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Of course not.

271
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Even if we break through the gate,

272
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
we still have to go through the gate.

273
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
If we break through the gate,

274
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
we still have our own body.

275
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
As long as we can survive,

276
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
we will be able to fight.

277
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Go.

278
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Your Majesty.

279
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I have a sword with me.

280
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Your Majesty used to have a sword.

281
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Isn't that right?

282
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Your Majesty.

283
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The golden chicken of the human world.

284
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
The heart.

285
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
The heart.

286
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I...

287
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I will kill you.

288
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Your Majesty.

289
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Your Majesty.

290
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Your Majesty.

291
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Your Majesty.

292
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Your Majesty.

293
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
The soldiers of the General's Army.

294
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yes.

295
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
The Great Qi Wu Qi.

296
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
The last bullet of the Great Qi Wu Qi.

297
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The first enemy.

298
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
We will break through the gate.

299
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
We will kill the Great Qi Wu Qi.

300
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Who wants to kill you with me?

301
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
We want to kill you.

302
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
We want to kill you.

303
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Kill.

304
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Kill.

305
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Kill.

306
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Kill.

307
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Kill.

308
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Kill.

309
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Kill.

310
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Kill.

311
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Kill.

312
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Kill.

313
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Kill.

314
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Kill.

315
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Kill.

316
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Kill.

317
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Kill.

318
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Kill.

319
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Kill.

320
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Kill.

321
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
The reinforcements are here.

322
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Sister Ni Huang!

323
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Yu Jin!

324
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Is Mr. Su okay?

325
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Everyone is fine.

326
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
He's fine.

327
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
He's fine.

328
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
He's fine.

329
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
He's fine.

330
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
He's fine.

331
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
He's fine.

332
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
He's fine.

333
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
He's fine.

334
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Is everyone okay?

335
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Everyone is inside.

336
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Ni Huang is coming!

337
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Please open the door!

338
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Ni Huang?

339
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It's Ni Huang!

340
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Open the door!

341
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Let the princess in!

342
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
The grandmothers are here.

343
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
The king is here.

344
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The grandmothers are here.

345
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Please open the door!

346
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Let the princess in!

347
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Open the door!

348
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
This is Ni Huang's uncle.

349
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
His majesty is fine.

350
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You're panicking?

351
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Why are you here?

352
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Fortunately, the place is not far from the mountain.

353
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Your Highness, Prince Jian sent someone to report to you.

354
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I'll lead the troops to the guards' office first.

355
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I'll ask for backup.

356
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
The imperial guards will arrive soon.

357
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Now Prince Jian is cleaning up all the rebels.

358
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
When the situation is safe,

359
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I'll come to your office to pay my respects.

360
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's too late!

361
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I'll have to run away from here.

362
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
How is that possible?

363
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I have five brothers.

364
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
They only have three thousand gold coins.

365
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
How is that possible?

366
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
How is that possible?

367
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Your Highness!

368
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Your Highness!

369
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
They've come in!

370
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
What did you say?

371
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Your Highness! Your Highness!

372
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Your Highness!

373
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Five brothers! You've already left without a trace.

374
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Think about it.

375
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,780
Devour

376
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,320
Is choices onik un pielary?

377
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Aunt Maria.

378
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,940
Take him to the back Jovent casos.

379
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,440
Ask the jewellerychuss person to take care.

380
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,940
OK.

381
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,640
Slowly.

382
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:44,160
you are a teenager 4 all

383
00:36:44,160 --> 00:37:04,100
President will kill ok

384
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,140
The dead will stay.

385
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,540
His life

386
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,580
is 3 times greater

387
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,040
Thank you.

388
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,040
I'll take you to rest.

389
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,040
I'll handle the rest.

390
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,040
Your Highness.

391
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,040
Although it's dangerous,

392
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,040
but after this,

393
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,040
no one

394
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,040
can stop the outside world.

395
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
I'm Xiao Jing Huan.

396
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,040
The Ji Cheng Army came to protect me.

397
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,040
Please take back the military uniform.

398
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
I'm sorry.

399
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,040
Thank you for your hard work.

400
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
How is she?

401
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
She's fine.

402
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,040
You've shed so much blood.

403
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,040
You're still fine.

404
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
As long as Father and Mother are well,

405
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,040
I'm not a big deal.

406
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,040
Before the rebellion,

407
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,040
you can be the one to take back the Ji Cheng Army.

408
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,040
This rebellion must be done

409
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,040
by all means.

410
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,040
I won't let it go.

411
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,040
I'll obey.

412
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,040
You must be

413
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,040
in a hurry to stop the night.

414
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040
Let the doctor take the wound.

415
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,040
Have a rest.

416
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,040
There are many things to do outside.

417
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,040
I'll rest after the food is done.

418
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
How is my son?

419
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,040
When I came,

420
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
the hunting was already at its peak.

421
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,040
The imperial guards and the officials were all dead.

422
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
The war was in three days.

423
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,040
The wound was severely damaged.

424
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,040
I brought the food to the commander.

425
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,040
After the food was done, I gave it to Father.

426
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
Jing Huan, that traitor.

427
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,040
Where is he?

428
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
I've been suppressed.

429
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,040
If Father wants to improve,

430
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
I'll immediately ask people to suppress the attack.

431
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,040
No.

432
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,040
I'll go personally.

433
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,040
Go.

434
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,040
Your Majesty.

435
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
Your Majesty.

436
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,040
Your Majesty.

437
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
You're so selfish.

438
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,040
You're so selfish.

439
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,040
I thought you were a good man.

440
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,040
But you're still so stubborn.

441
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,040
You're just a useless fool.

442
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,040
I didn't expect your son to be so ambitious.

443
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,040
You're so stubborn.

444
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,040
You're just a coward.

445
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,040
You're just a coward.

446
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,040
You're just a coward.

447
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,040
Son.

448
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,040
I...

449
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,040
I've been blind for so many years.

450
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,040
I've been blind for so many years.

451
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
Father.

452
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,040
You've been blind for so many years.

453
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,040
It was the princess who was blind for so many years.

454
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
What are you talking about?

455
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,040
I'm the most similar prince to you.

456
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,040
In fact,

457
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,040
I think...

458
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,040
after you used Princess Linglong,

459
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
the country was not enough for you.

460
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,040
You should have killed that prince.

461
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
That's what you're talking about.

462
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,040
You're so stubborn.

463
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,040
You're so stubborn.

464
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,040
Am I right, Father?

465
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,040
I'm sorry.

466
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,040
I'm sorry.

467
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,040
I'm sorry.

468
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,040
I'm sorry.

469
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,040
I'm sorry.

470
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,040
I'm sorry.

471
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,040
I'm sorry.

472
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,040
I'm sorry.

473
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,040
I'm sorry.

474
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,040
I'm sorry.

475
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,040
I'm sorry.

476
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,040
I'm sorry.

477
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,040
I'm sorry.

478
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,040
I'm sorry.

479
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,040
I'm sorry.

480
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,040
I'm sorry.

481
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,040
I'm sorry.

482
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,040
I'm sorry.
