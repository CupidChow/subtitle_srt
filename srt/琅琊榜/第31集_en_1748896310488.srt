00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's not easy to deal with Prince Jing with Wei Zheng.

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's hard to deal with Mei Chang Su.

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Unless...

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Unless Prince Jing doesn't want to listen to Mei Chang Su's advice.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Since that's the case,

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
then we must first make Prince Jing

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
not believe in Mei Chang Su.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No need to discuss.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You must listen to it.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You must listen to it.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Doctor Yan, I listen to you whenever you say anything.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But at least you give me some time to clear my mind.

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I...

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What are you doing?

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You can't do anything.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You have to close your eyes, take medicine and sleep.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No one can see you.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Doctor Yan, I...

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Doctor Yan, I...

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Chief, it's not as important as being in a good health.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's just for three days.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There are 13 of us, Li Gang and I.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Prince Jing hasn't returned to the capital.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
His Majesty will go to the Imperial Palace to guard the Empress Dowager tomorrow.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There won't be any big trouble in the palace.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can rest well.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Look, nothing is wrong.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Look.

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You want to hear it?

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Look.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay, I'm going to sleep.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, go to sleep.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay.

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Go.

36
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hurry up!

37
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hurry up!

38
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Chief Zhao, are you okay?

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Chief Ge!

40
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Chief Ge!

41
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Chief Ge!

42
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Chief Ge!

43
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This must be General Wei.

44
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're well.

45
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The Demon King's Valley is in a hurry.

46
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
How dare you ask for punishment?

47
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're going to arrest the court's official.

48
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
General Wei, you don't have to be so stubborn.

49
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The Demon King's Valley is a great city.

50
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The Yun's world is also a great city.

51
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If you don't have any proof,

52
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I, Xuan Jing Si,

53
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
won't be able to offend you easily.

54
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It turns out that you're the one who's called Xuan Jing Si who's a god.

55
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Do you dare offend anyone in the world?

56
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Xuan Jing Si has a sharp method.

57
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But he doesn't do anything that can be done by the court.

58
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
General Wei, you were also a very good person.

59
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You didn't have to be so ignorant.

60
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You have to confirm your identity.

61
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's not hard to come up with this.

62
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What do you want?

63
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
General Wei is a smart person.

64
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You should know that I only want you.

65
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You're still alive.

66
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
As long as you're willing to help me,

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I can let you go.

68
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Anyway, if you want to live a life-long life,

69
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
then you can only live with these people.

70
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You can't live a life without them.

71
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Young Princess, don't listen to her nonsense.

72
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We can get out of here.

73
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
General Wei, you're very wise.

74
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I will not let you down.

75
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Let go of me.

76
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let the brothers of the Demon King go first.

77
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hurry up.

78
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We're just going to leave like this?

79
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Are we still humans?

80
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes.

81
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We're not leaving.

82
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes, we're not leaving.

83
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What are we going to do with the funeral?

84
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't worry.

85
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We'll go to the funeral.

86
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We'll go to the funeral.

87
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What funeral?

88
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Old Xin, you understand.

89
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Hurry up and go back.

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't let the princess go.

91
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hurry up.

92
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Young Princess, you must hold on.

93
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We'll come back to save you.

94
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hurry up.

95
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We must not give up.

96
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
All of you, go with me.

97
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You really are touching.

98
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
These people are not afraid of General Wei's loyalty.

99
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
They are not afraid of General Wei's loyalty to Old Master.

100
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Come on.

101
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Take good care of General Wei.

102
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes.

103
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Put your eyes on me.

104
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm afraid General Wei would rather die alone.

105
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He must protect some people.

106
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We must send him alive to the capital.

107
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Commander, it's not convenient for the chief.

108
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Don't say that.

109
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Li Gang told me.

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But tomorrow, I'll ask Peitong to go to Wei Mountain.

111
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
To guard the imperial guards for the Empress Dowager.

112
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And come back to the capital.

113
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
At least five days.

114
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I won't go to see him.

115
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm not worried.

116
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay.

117
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Please.

118
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Commander.

119
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Commander.

120
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Tell me the truth.

121
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What happened to him?

122
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He was killed.

123
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He was killed.

124
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He was killed.

125
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Why did he die in a short time?

126
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Commander, don't worry.

127
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's just a sign of danger.

128
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He will be fine.

129
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We must wait for him to come back from Wei Mountain.

130
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Then he can wake up.

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You take care of him.

132
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Remember.

133
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If something happens,

134
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
no matter what happens,

135
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
you must send someone to inform me.

136
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yes.

137
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You send the emperor to the capital.

138
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It must be bad.

139
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Go back and rest.

140
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Why do you have to follow my rules?

141
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I just want to pass on my mother's message.

142
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's not for the rules.

143
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Leave.

144
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'll go with the emperor.

145
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll talk to him.

146
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes.

147
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Is there anything?

148
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
There is.

149
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I need your help.

150
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's not hard.

151
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But later,

152
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'll go with my mother.

153
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What?

154
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Tell me.

155
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I need to go out.

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I want to ask mother to go to the imperial palace.

157
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
To find out the precious medicine.

158
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
To find out the imperial palace?

159
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What do you want to find out?

160
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I don't want to find out anything.

161
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I can't find out anything important.

162
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I just want to ask mother

163
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
to go to the imperial palace

164
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
to find out the medicine.

165
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The imperial hospital will have people

166
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
who can find out the precious medicine.

167
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
They are strong and strong.

168
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They are harmful to the human body.

169
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Mother is saying that

170
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
she is using it as a means

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
to hurt the body.

172
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
She will take it and interrogate it.

173
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If I can really

174
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
simply take care of the imperial concubine,

175
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can still use you to teach her.

176
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm not saying that the imperial concubine is always kind.

177
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The things she uses,

178
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
the imperial palace's internal affairs and private affairs

179
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
are all her own.

180
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Even if she really

181
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
has the medicine she has to take

182
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
to the imperial palace,

183
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm afraid that

184
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
by the grace of the emperor

185
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
she won't believe

186
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
the crimes we have committed to her.

187
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Moreover,

188
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the imperial concubine

189
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
is always so impulsive in the palace

190
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
that she is always calling for the emperor.

191
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
She is saying that

192
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
she is the one who is the one who is the emperor.

193
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't even believe it.

194
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Mother, please calm down.

195
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
This is just a little bit of a difficult

196
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and a little bit of a difficult thing.

197
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't expect that she really can do anything.

198
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If she doesn't expect to do anything,

199
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
what will she do in this situation?

200
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
She is not in the palace.

201
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I can't just let the emperor

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
die without her.

203
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
She has been in the palace for the past few days.

204
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
When the emperor is back,

205
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I can't just let her go.

206
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't just let her go.

207
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What is this painting?

208
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So I just said

209
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
things are not difficult.

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But after that,

211
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
you may feel a little bit wronged.

212
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What are you planning to do

213
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
outside?

214
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I can't hide anything from you.

215
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I have some plans outside.

216
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
This one in the palace

217
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
is just a combination.

218
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
When things are done,

219
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I will explain it to you in detail.

220
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I will understand

221
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
your intelligence

222
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
as soon as I hear it.

223
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Is it really that important?

224
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's important to confess.

225
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Fine.

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Jingfei is so generous.

227
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's been a long time

228
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
since I've been uncomfortable.

229
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's good to be angry.

230
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
At most,

231
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I will be scolded.

232
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I am the master of the six palaces.

233
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You can't

234
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
do anything about it.

235
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Thank you, mother.

236
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You are so thoughtful.

237
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I know that

238
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Jingxuan is not here.

239
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
She has come here with a warning.

240
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
She has no good days.

241
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's all my fault.

242
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
If I had the heart of the emperor,

243
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I would have been the crown prince.

244
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Mother, don't say that.

245
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
If it wasn't for your care,

246
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I wouldn't know

247
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
what kind of person

248
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I would be bullied.

249
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Don't worry.

250
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I will definitely

251
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
be angry for you.

252
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Last time Qi Hong said

253
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
that my father never

254
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
cared about my mother.

255
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Is she really

256
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
a lowly person?

257
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You have always asked me

258
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
about this past.

259
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's not that I don't want to say it.

260
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I am not sure.

261
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I just know that

262
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
your birth mother, Xiang Pin,

263
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
was a princess

264
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
who was in the palace.

265
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
After she followed your father,

266
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
she was always in the capital.

267
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Later,

268
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
when she knew that your mother passed away,

269
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
your father brought you to the palace.

270
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I have a lot of

271
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
impressions about these feelings.

272
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But it's too late.

273
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I can't figure out the meaning.

274
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
This matter

275
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
is only clear to your father.

276
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I also asked her

277
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
a few times when she was a child.

278
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But she didn't say a word.

279
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Maybe it's true that Qi Hong said it.

280
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
My mother really

281
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
didn't even want to mention it.

282
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Master,

283
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
the letter of the princess

284
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
that was just sent to me.

285
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But everything went well.

286
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You and Qiu Er

287
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
always make me worried.

288
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Master,

289
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
although she is a little impatient,

290
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
she is very considerate.

291
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
She is also very determined.

292
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Because we can't compare

293
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
to her often.

294
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Master,

295
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
did you take the new case?

296
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Why did you leave the capital so long ago?

297
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You didn't even believe me.

298
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Maybe it's a case.

299
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
She is now a independent

300
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
and well-educated person.

301
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
She didn't have to ask me

302
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
every time.

303
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
So I didn't ask much.

304
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
She was a very mature and well-educated person.

305
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
She was very well-educated.

306
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
She didn't have a good temper.

307
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But I believe

308
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
she is ungrateful

309
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
to master.

310
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
If she and master

311
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
have any problems,

312
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
please let her talk to you.

313
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I hereby

314
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
ask for your help.

315
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I beg you, master.

316
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Please don't argue with her.

317
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You are all grown up

318
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
since I was a kid.

319
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But what's the good thing about arguing with you?

320
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I am always busy here.

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't care about her.

322
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Let her stay outside for a while.

323
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Thank you, master.

324
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Doctor Yan,

325
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
is master's condition better?

326
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The situation is not too bad.

327
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I will come over tonight.

328
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I will see him better tomorrow morning.

329
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I hope something big will happen

330
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
this year.

331
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Master is sick.

332
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We need to rest for a while.

333
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What do you mean?

334
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I hope

335
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
he can be cured.

336
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I hope

337
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
he can be cured.

338
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I hope

339
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
he can be cured.

340
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What do you mean?

341
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
He has been sick

342
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
since the beginning.

343
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Doctor Zheng,

344
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
you need to be careful.

345
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yes.

346
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I found it.

347
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Your Highness,

348
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
this plant is called Huan Ge Plant.

349
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
If we use it,

350
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
it will cause blood circulation,

351
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
and it will be dry.

352
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It will cause a serious injury to the body.

353
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What did you say?

354
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You didn't use it

355
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
to cure the disease.

356
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You are so bad at the body.

357
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's not true.

358
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Consort Jing,

359
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
you have been so kind to His Majesty.

360
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But you are so cruel.

361
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
With His Majesty's trust in you,

362
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
you can cure the disease.

363
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's the worst.

364
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The effect of Huan Ge Plant

365
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
is already mentioned in the medical book.

366
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's not exactly what Doctor Zheng said.

367
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If he can cure the disease,

368
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
and it will be dry,

369
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
it's not possible.

370
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
But

371
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
you have admitted it.

372
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Why do you change your mind?

373
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I, the head of the harem,

374
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
can't tolerate

375
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
people like you

376
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
to be the military.

377
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Guards.

378
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yes.

379
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Bring Consort Jing back.

380
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I want to interrogate her.

381
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yes.

382
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Your Highness.

383
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Your Highness.

384
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Your Highness.

385
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Your Highness the Empress.

386
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You have to take me away.

387
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I will not resist.

388
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But

389
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
we have been together

390
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
for more than twenty years.

391
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
For His Majesty's sake.

392
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Why do you need it?

393
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Send the imperial decree

394
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
to the harem.

395
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Without my order,

396
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
you can't leave.

397
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes.

398
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Your Highness.

399
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Your Highness.

400
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Mother, thank you.

401
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What are you going to do next?

402
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Mother.

403
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Consort Jing has a palace.

404
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You can let her out.

405
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Let her out?

406
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The palace is more complicated

407
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
than the court.

408
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
She has to find a way out.

409
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
She has to send a letter to Wei Shan.

410
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
She can't go back to the harem.

411
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
She can seal my hands

412
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
with a book.

413
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
At that time,

414
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'm afraid

415
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
she can't even seal my hands.

416
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Mother, don't worry.

417
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I said to let her out.

418
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
She was the one who sent the letter.

419
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Your Highness.

420
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Your Highness.

421
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
What are you doing?

422
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Your Highness.

423
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm a little bit anxious.

424
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Please let me out.

425
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
No.

426
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
There are three levels of people.

427
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I can't bear to wait.

428
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I said no.

429
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Your Highness.

430
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Please let me out.

431
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Don't let me dirty this room.

432
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
There are so many people outside.

433
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I can't run around.

434
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Let her go.

435
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Go.

436
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Go.

437
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Xiao Xin.

438
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It's me, Xiao Xin.

439
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Xiao Xin from Consort Hui's palace.

440
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Come.

441
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Xiao Xin.

442
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
How did you come out?

443
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I heard that

444
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
the Empress locked the imperial palace.

445
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
She didn't let everyone out.

446
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Our Empress

447
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and Consort Jing

448
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
came to pay her respects.

449
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I heard the news.

450
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I was so anxious.

451
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
What happened?

452
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The Empress

453
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
searched the herbs in our palace.

454
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
She said she was poisoned.

455
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
She took our Empress away.

456
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I wanted to find someone to beg.

457
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I don't know who to find.

458
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Don't worry.

459
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
We need to

460
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
send a letter to Prince Jing.

461
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I haven't been out

462
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
since I entered the palace.

463
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
How can I send a letter to Prince Jing?

464
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I have a cousin.

465
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
He's a guard in the south gate.

466
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Can we find him?

467
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The imperial seal is coming.

468
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
We need to go out before Xiao Jing.

469
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Come with me.

470
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Your Highness.

471
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Everything is going well.

472
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
The palace maid is out of the palace.

473
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'll take her to Prince Jing's house

474
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
in the name of the cause.

475
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Okay.

476
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Congratulations, Your Highness.

477
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
We have good news.

478
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Is it Wei Zheng?

479
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Wei Zheng has fallen into the palace.

480
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
He's being suppressed by

481
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Xuan Jin Si's agent, Jin Rui.

482
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
There's nothing wrong with him.

483
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Your Highness, don't worry.

484
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
We need time to prepare

485
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
to take the hostage from the army.

486
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Even if the monster and Jiang Zuo Meng

487
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
are in a hurry,

488
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
they can't wait

489
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
to take action before the hostage enters the palace.

490
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Okay.

491
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Hu Yao.

492
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Your Highness.

493
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Prepare the horses.

494
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm going to see Xia Jiang.

495
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You said you were the palace maid

496
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
of Consort Jing?

497
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
General Qiu.

498
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Go and get Prince Jing's letter.

499
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Your Highness.

500
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Something happened to him.

501
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's too dangerous.

502
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Chief Yin.

503
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Someone knocked on the door

504
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
of the drug king's mansion.

505
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
What a nuisance.

506
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Why did something happen

507
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
at this time?

508
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
His Highness is not in the capital.

509
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
His Majesty is missing Wei Ling.

510
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
No matter what,

511
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
we need to send him a letter.

512
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Prince Jing is not in a good mood.

513
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
But His Majesty is in Wei Ling.

514
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
He can arrive at the palace

515
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
in four hours.

516
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Fortunately, Commander Meng is with him.

517
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
As long as we can see him,

518
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
we can inform His Majesty.

519
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Yes.

520
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
As long as His Majesty sends someone

521
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
to take the seal back,

522
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
we can save His Highness.

523
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Since you're saying that,

524
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
we can't wait.

525
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I'll go to Commander Meng

526
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
right now.

527
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'm going too.

528
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
You?

529
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
How can you be so arrogant?

530
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'll ride the horse.

531
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Besides,

532
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
how can you

533
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
do things in the palace

534
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
in front of His Majesty?

535
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm the only one who can do it.

536
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Miss Xiao Qing is right.

537
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You two should pack up

538
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
and leave together.

539
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'll go to Su's Mansion now.

540
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
There's a better way

541
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
for me to go to Su's Mansion.

542
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Let's go.

543
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Let's go.

544
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Xie?

545
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Why are you here?

546
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Chief Li,

547
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
take me to see Commander Mei.

548
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Something happened to General Wei Zheng.

549
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
What?

550
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
General Wei Zheng is dead.

551
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
He's in a bad mood.

552
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We're not even

553
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
a hundred years old.

554
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You said

555
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
that General Wei Zheng

556
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
was going to

557
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
leave Jiangsu

558
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
for ten weeks.

559
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Did you say

560
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
that I started to suspect

561
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
the connection

562
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
between Jiangsu and the Ministry of Research?

563
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I don't know.

564
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
General Wei Zheng

565
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
must be

566
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
going to the Prince of Jing.

567
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And the Chief is

568
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
working for Prince of Jing.

569
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Many people

570
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
know about it.

571
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I'll tell you

572
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
that I'll treat General Jiang

573
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
as an enemy.

574
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Of course, you'll do it.

575
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
That's right.

576
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
We've been hiding

577
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
the real face

578
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
for so long.

579
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
It's impossible for us

580
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
to find it.

581
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Then we should

582
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
tell Chief Mei about this.

583
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Our Chief

584
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
will arrive in the capital in a few days.

585
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Chief Mei is ill.

586
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
What should we do?

587
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
The First Lady

588
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
was born in Yunyang at the age of 16.

589
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
She was

590
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
the deputy general of Wei Zheng.

591
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Two people

592
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
from the Meiling

593
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
were killed by the Chief

594
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
for the life of the nine lives.

595
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It's not a normal

596
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
ruse.

597
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Even if the Chief

598
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
wakes up now,

599
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
he can't

600
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
let General Wei know.

601
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
But

602
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
with the current situation,

603
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
we don't know

604
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
if we can control it.

605
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Tomorrow,

606
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
let Mr. Tong Lu Yue and Mr. Shi San

607
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
come out.

608
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Let's discuss it.

609
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Chief Li,

610
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
General Lie of the Prince's Mansion is asking for an audience.

611
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's been an hour.

612
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
What is he doing here?

613
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Take him away.

614
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Chief, you're seriously ill.

615
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I can't see you.

616
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Besides,

617
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Consort Jing

618
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
told His Majesty

619
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
to call for an audience.

620
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's a common plan.

621
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
As long as Wei Ling

622
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
is here,

623
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
the Queen won't move.

624
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
That's good.

625
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
His Majesty is not in the capital.

626
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
If anything happens to Her Highness,

627
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
how can I tell her?

628
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Her Highness is just

629
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
a minor.

630
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Please go back.

631
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Wait for the news from Wei Ling.

632
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Since that's the case,

633
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I'll leave.

634
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
See you.

635
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
How is it?

636
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Did you burn it?

637
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I'm fine.

638
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Get up.

639
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I didn't expect

640
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
a soldier like you

641
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
to be like this.

642
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Let's go.

643
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
The most exciting

644
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
game on the line

645
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
is

646
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
the horse race.

647
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
The horse race has been won.

648
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
The gold queen,

649
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
the gold king,

650
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
the golden city,

651
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
the rich,

652
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
the gold ship,

653
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
the superior money,

654
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
the higher the reputation,

655
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
the higher the reputation,

656
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
the higher the reputation.

657
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
The gold queen,

658
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
the higher the reputation,

659
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
the higher the reputation,

660
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
the higher the reputation,

661
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
no one is in trouble.

662
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
The gold queen,

663
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
the higher the reputation,

664
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
the higher the reputation,

665
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
the higher the reputation,

666
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
she'll die.

667
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Good friend,

668
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
where do you live?

669
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,440
The back yanic.

670
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I've always wanted to help.

671
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
The back yanic.

672
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I've always wanted to help.

673
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I've always always wanted to help.

674
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I've always wanted to help.

675
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I've always wanted to help.

676
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
You don't need.

677
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I've always wanted to help.

678
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,520
So you came after him?

679
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,720
You don't have to ask.

680
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,880
I'm here to ask you to go back.

681
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,440
Go back?

682
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,080
Why go back?

683
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,440
Mr. Su means

684
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,760
you don't have to send the letter to Wei Ling.

685
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,360
There's other ways to solve this.

686
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
How?

687
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,600
Your Highness is still in the empress' hands.

688
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,800
Except for His Majesty, no one can save her.

689
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,960
Mr. Su doesn't want us to go to Wei Ling.

690
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,360
Is there any better way for him?

691
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,880
Mr. Su means

692
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,680
you have the ability to do so.

693
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,200
It's okay to suffer some grievances

694
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,920
as long as you're alive.

695
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,640
When His Majesty returns,

696
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,440
the more suffering you suffer,

697
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,640
the more the empress' crime is.

698
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,040
The more effort you put in to Prince Jing.

699
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,520
What?

700
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,280
Mr. Su, what is this nonsense?

701
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,760
How could you use Her Highness to use the bitter meat?

702
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,400
If His Highness finds out,

703
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,680
he'll be dead.

704
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,200
If you say so,

705
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,840
I don't think Prince Jing will know.

706
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,960
You've been thorough in this whole thing.

707
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,900
It's alright.

708
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,960
Miss Mo Jing, it's fine.

709
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,200
I just want to stop you and you from going to Wei Ling.

710
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,520
What better thing than to add stanzas to this bet?

711
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,520
I'll kill you.

712
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,200
When I think of my red sleeve,

713
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,880
I'm destroyed by someone like you.

714
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,560
I feel so uncomfortable.

715
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,920
I know you're loyal.

716
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,080
I know you're not afraid of death.

717
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,160
But you must know that

718
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,920
in this world,

719
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,600
there are many things that are harder to handle than death.

720
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
Bring it in.

721
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,920
Tong Lu!

722
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Jun Niang!

723
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
What are you doing?

724
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,400
This is none of his business!

725
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,440
None of his business?

726
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,360
How can your romantic relationship

727
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,120
be none of his business?

728
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
What are you doing?

729
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,040
What are you doing?

730
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,680
Don't touch him!

731
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,240
Tong Lu!

732
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,640
Tong Lu, save me!

733
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
Tong Lu!

734
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,120
Tong Lu, save me!

735
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,320
Tell me.

736
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,840
Who do you think you are?

737
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,920
It seems

738
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,800
he's not as lucky as you think.

739
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,640
Tong Lu!

740
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:21,220
RE

741
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,220
Tell me.

742
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,220
There is no room.

743
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,220
What?

744
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,220
It's Mr. Sun.

745
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,180
Urban

746
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,180
Xuan Jing Si is hunted down by Wei Zeng.

747
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,180
We will leave the city on the way to the capital city.

748
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,180
We will go around the capital city.

749
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,180
We will be busy.

750
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,180
We have no chance and time.

751
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,180
We will be late.

752
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,180
Then we will do it in the city.

753
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,180
It's not a big deal.

754
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,180
Xuan Jing Si knows that

755
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,180
before Wei Zheng enters the city,

756
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,180
we only have one chance to attack.

757
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,180
He will definitely put the heavy soldiers

758
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,180
in the gate and guard the house.

759
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,180
After we enter the city, we will be at ease.

760
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,180
We will not be attacked here.

761
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,180
Okay.

762
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,180
Then we will

763
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,180
move the soldiers in the city.

764
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,180
Okay.

765
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,180
Who?

766
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,180
Mr. Shi San, Brother Zhen.

767
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,180
Miss Gong, what happened?

768
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,180
Miaoyun House was blocked by the government just now.

769
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,180
What?

770
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,180
This is not a good idea.

771
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,180
The place we contacted has been here for a while.

772
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,180
Miaoyun House is a trap.

773
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,180
No one should notice it.

774
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,180
How could it be blocked?

775
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,180
Who is the person?

776
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,180
Prince Yu.

777
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,180
He is the member of Prince Yu's mansion.

778
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,180
I know him.

779
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,180
After he enters the city,

780
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,180
he will go to Miaoyun House.

781
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,180
The target is very clear.

782
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,180
He will go directly to Miaoyun House.

783
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,180
I am afraid that he will be hit by something.

784
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,180
Yes.

785
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,180
Zhen Ping.

786
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,180
Why don't you let Tong Lu

787
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,180
ask me to go out?

788
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,180
Instead, you yourself

789
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,180
will take the risk.

790
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,180
Tong Lu has never been here before.

791
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,180
I thought that she was sick.

792
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,180
You really didn't let her come.

793
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,180
Tong Lu?

794
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,180
Why is she Tong Lu?

795
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,180
The Miaoyun House is blocked by a good person.

796
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:11,180
The people there have been abandoned.

797
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,180
You deliberately came out to fool me, right?

798
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,180
Your Majesty, I have the power.

799
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,180
How could I dare to fool you?

800
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,180
You are the person who took the red sleeve.

801
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,180
You know the rules of our family.

802
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,180
I have been caught by you for so long.

803
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,180
Mr. Shi Sen.

804
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,180
You should have investigated it long ago.

805
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,180
You should have taken the medicine.

806
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,180
You would never have taken it to any place

807
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,180
that I know.

808
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,180
You know it very well, right?

809
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,180
I know.

810
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,180
Be careful.

811
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,180
Be careful.

812
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,180
Be careful.

813
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,180
You have been running around all night.

814
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,180
Where have you been?

815
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,180
I just wanted to get out of here.

816
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,180
I wanted to find someone to save our mother.

817
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,180
Did you find her?

818
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,180
Don't cry.

819
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,180
His Majesty didn't leave the door.

820
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,180
He came back in three or five days.

821
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,180
Our mother will be fine.

822
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,180
Your Highness.

823
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,180
I have stopped the people sent by Prince Jing's Mansion.

824
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,180
I have said everything I should.

825
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,180
Where are they?

826
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,180
That maid was caught in the palace

827
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,180
and locked up with Consort Jing.

828
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,180
I was taken to the court by that maid.

829
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,180
I was thrown into the backyard.

830
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,180
Okay.

831
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:45,180
Let's see what they will do.

832
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,180
His Majesty will be back in the capital tomorrow.

833
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,180
Have you done anything to Consort Jing?

834
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,180
Did you let me keep her?

835
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,180
I have bought all the hidden threads.

836
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,180
It's no use to Consort Jing.

837
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,180
Just let her go.

838
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,180
When Father returns to the palace,

839
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,180
Consort Jing will be sure to report to the court.

840
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,180
Mother only needs to make a decision.

841
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,180
The imperial physician has to make sure that the medicine is in place.

842
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,180
In order to make Father's body safe and sound,

843
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,180
he will interrogate Consort Jing at once.

844
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,180
Anyway, she is fine.

845
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,180
Father is not in a hurry.

846
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,180
She is not in a hurry to deal with the Empress

847
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,180
because Consort Jing is in a bad mood.

848
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,180
Then...

849
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,180
What about the imperial physician?

850
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,180
When she is doing this,

851
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,180
she will know what will happen.

852
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,180
She has prepared for it.

853
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,180
If Father really wants to get Consort Jing out of the palace,

854
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,180
just ask her out.

855
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,180
I will treat her family well.

856
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,180
You are right.

857
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,180
The plan is not in vain.

858
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,180
How much confidence do you have

859
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,180
to prepare for it?

860
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,180
Mother, don't worry.

861
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,180
Everything is ready.

862
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:51,180
I owe it to you.

863
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,180
I am sorry.

864
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,180
I am sorry.

865
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,180
I am sorry.

866
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,180
I am sorry.

867
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,180
I am sorry.

868
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,180
I am sorry.

869
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,180
I am sorry.

870
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,180
I am sorry.

871
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,180
I am sorry.

872
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,180
I am sorry.

873
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,180
I am sorry.

874
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,180
I am sorry.

875
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,180
I am sorry.

876
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,180
I am sorry.

877
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,180
I am sorry.

878
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,180
I am sorry.
