1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,680
about Qu indicates that he is ready to welcome the изolation of Immortal speaking.

2
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,980
I.

3
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,920
Finally we found the plenty of rumors being exposed.

4
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,680
What's this?

5
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,680
At the goldenLight,

6
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,560
the master eared with his Brendam?

7
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
We don't need to be too cruel.

8
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,560
We can't just fight them out.

9
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Yes.

10
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,560
The case of Chu Xin is also a matter of their own.

11
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
If we follow the martial law,

12
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,560
we can't defeat Tianquan Mountain.

13
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,560
I don't know if it's for the benefit or for the love.

14
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,560
Chuo Ding Feng has always been used as a threat.

15
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,560
Although he is a good person in the martial law,

16
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,560
he is still in the chaos of the capital.

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,560
It's not his fault.

18
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
Now that I'm in the chain of love,

19
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,560
it's not that easy for him to leave me.

20
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,560
In the end, that's his own choice.

21
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,560
He should have his own consequences.

22
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,560
But that young master Xiao...

23
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,560
It's a pity that he's so gentle.

24
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,560
I'm afraid that he will be implicated by his father.

25
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Jingrui.

26
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,560
Jingrui, you're not just a poor child.

27
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Who are you?

28
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,560
I'm Qin Daxia, the swordsman of the Ninth World.

29
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
I'm from the Jianghu.

30
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
I'd like to make some name for myself.

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,560
I'm here to visit you. Please come out.

32
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,560
You're here to challenge me?

33
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
You're talking nonsense.

34
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,560
I have a lot of things to do today.

35
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,560
If you don't dare to come out, get out of my house.

36
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,560
I'm here to challenge you.

37
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,560
The most exciting game in the world.

38
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,560
The horse race is over.

39
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
The horse race is over.

40
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,560
The reward is given to the queen,

41
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,560
the treasure is given to the golden city,

42
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,560
the rich are given to the rich.

43
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,560
The reward is given to the rich.

44
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,560
The reward is given to the rich.

45
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
The reward is given to the rich.

46
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,560
The reward is given to the rich.

47
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,560
The reward is given to the rich.

48
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
The reward is given to the rich.

49
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
The reward is given to the rich.

50
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,560
The reward is given to the rich.

51
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,560
The reward is given to the rich.

52
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,560
The reward is given to the rich.

53
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,560
The reward is given to the rich.

54
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
The reward is given to the rich.

55
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:41,160
Go out!

56
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
Who are you?

57
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,240
In the name of the king,

58
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,520
including Steel laborers.

59
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,680
He is quite elections- plaque.

60
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,400
In the rally

61
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,620
Thunder fools

62
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,380
tried to upperclass.

63
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,440
But a test case

64
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,020
was aoge,

65
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,140
immediately sent a

66
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,280
リパンピス

67
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,220
a valuations

68
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,660
that he got at the easily

69
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,260
carry failure.

70
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
This will

71
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,440
help people

72
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,900
who never

73
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,740
come skills

74
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,020
right from the beginning.

75
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,960
I'm afraid

76
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
when we combine

77
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,200
our future

78
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,720
historically

79
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
Meichang Su.

80
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Brother Luo.

81
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,720
You are the second master of our country.

82
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
No matter how powerful Meichang Su is,

83
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,440
he can't help you.

84
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,520
Although we are close to each other,

85
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,200
we can't be together.

86
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,800
You don't need to fight.

87
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,720
But in the future,

88
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,520
it's really the critical moment.

89
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,720
I have to raise Brother Zhang.

90
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,520
We are a family.

91
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,000
You don't need to be polite.

92
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,760
Master.

93
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,360
Master.

94
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,520
The nine masters who came to Zuo Dingfeng

95
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,320
have been personally handled.

96
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,040
I think they won't leave this month.

97
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,640
Where is Zuo Dingfeng?

98
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,240
Zuo Dingfeng is a master of the Ming Dynasty

99
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,680
in the Liang State.

100
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,040
We dare not be too close to him.

101
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,800
He seems to be aware of it.

102
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,320
So he has no motive.

103
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,520
I am satisfied

104
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,040
that he can calm down.

105
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,280
Sister.

106
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,120
Sister.

107
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,040
Wait.

108
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,880
It's so cold in Mount Gu.

109
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,320
You don't wear any clothes.

110
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,920
It's cold.

111
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,120
It's impossible to be colder.

112
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,360
You go to Mount Gu every year

113
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,480
to remember General Nie.

114
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,880
It's so rare to have this kind of friendship.

115
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,440
Every year, as long as you are in the capital,

116
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,840
you will definitely change the gift.

117
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,920
I also remember this kind of friendship.

118
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,600
I can't go with you.

119
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,600
I can only give you a gift.

120
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,120
Another year has passed.

121
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,960
It was 가

122
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,560
year I married you,

123
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,880
but it was practically from the spring.

124
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,560
It has not matured

125
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,400
after these last 1 or 2 years.

126
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,880
Will you recognize me

127
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,760
the next time you see me?

128
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,720
She died.

129
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,280
She died.

130
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,480
I did everything I can.

131
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,720
Who is it?

132
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,600
Thank you.

133
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Don't be so surprised when you walk.

134
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
If Doctor Yan really knows about this,

135
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
how can he be so happy about it?

136
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Mr. Su.

137
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
What a coincidence.

138
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Mr. Xia.

139
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,080
Mr. Su is sick and angry.

140
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,480
Is he too tired?

141
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,440
The doctor told me to take a walk and go back to my body.

142
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,520
This is a kind of treatment.

143
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
This is the closest to the capital.

144
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
I came here today because I was lucky.

145
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,720
I didn't disturb Mr. Xia.

146
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,600
It's not my body.

147
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,880
Everyone can come.

148
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
But...

149
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,560
This is the grave of my father.

150
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,760
There are few people here.

151
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,160
I have some accidents.

152
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,160
So this is General Nie's burial place.

153
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,400
General Jifeng is famous and my parents always support him.

154
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,720
If you were here today,

155
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,800
could you be example?

156
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,520
Please fulfill the expectations.

157
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,880
Rest well, Mr. Cheng Meng.

158
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Please.

159
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:09,160
Song'sлет

160
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,460
Li Gang

161
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,540
Master

162
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,960
Give me the wine

163
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,860
Yes

164
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,040
Grand Master

165
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:37,860
General Nie, if you'll allow me to live a peaceful life,

166
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,860
please take care of it with me.

167
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,660
Follow my instructions to come back to the galaxy.

168
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,660
Retreat!

169
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,660
Retreat!

170
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
I will go!

171
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
Retreat!

172
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,660
Retreat!

173
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,660
Retreat!

174
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,660
Retreat!

175
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,660
Retreat!

176
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,660
Retreat!

177
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,660
Retreat!

178
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,660
Retreat!

179
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,660
Retreat!

180
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,060
so forget it.

181
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,180
Zuo Qianzhu.

182
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,700
Master.

183
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,060
Mrs. N Botan aquesta

184
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,060
I am sorry for the loss of my own people.

185
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,060
Mr. Su's love for you

186
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,060
is deeply appreciated by the King.

187
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,060
I thank you for your kindness.

188
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,060
Ji Li is just a kind heart.

189
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,060
It's a big event.

190
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,060
You'd better leave the mountain early.

191
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,060
You don't want to see me suffer.

192
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,060
Are you going back to the city?

193
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,060
I haven't been there yet.

194
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,060
I heard that the ancient town in the forest is beautiful.

195
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,060
I want to go there and have a look.

196
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
It's worth a visit.

197
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,060
But I still have things to do.

198
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,060
I can't be with you.

199
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,060
Please excuse me, Mr. Xia.

200
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,060
It's hard to find the case that was killed recently.

201
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,060
Mr. Xia is suffering from it.

202
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,060
Take care of yourself.

203
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
Mr. Su, what do you mean?

204
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,060
Didn't you hand this case to Xuan Jing Si?

205
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,060
This case is really suspicious.

206
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,060
Maybe Xuan Jing Si will be interested in it.

207
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,060
The killer's method is clean and sharp.

208
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
It should be the so-called martial arts master.

209
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,060
Mr. Su, what do you think?

210
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,060
There are many capable people in the world.

211
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,060
Even the list of the Langya Pavilion

212
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,060
has to be updated every year.

213
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,060
I am also very concerned.

214
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,060
Moreover, Xuan Jing Si has no understanding of the world.

215
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,060
He is not as good as Jiang Zomeng.

216
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,060
But the most popular in the capital now

217
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,060
is Mr. Su, the master of Jiang Zomeng.

218
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,060
What do you think I should do?

219
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,060
Jiang Zomeng is always clear in the world.

220
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,060
Mr. Xia is fine.

221
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,060
But there are still some high-ranking people

222
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,060
in the capital now.

223
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,060
Mr. Xia should be more clear than me.

224
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,060
Mr. Su, you mean

225
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,060
Jiang Zomeng and Prince Yu are not related to this matter.

226
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,060
This matter is a matter of the heaven.

227
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,060
We are just talking about the matter.

228
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,060
Why do you need such a big remorse?

229
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,060
Xuan Jing Si has always been ungrateful.

230
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,060
Su Lai is just a newbie for His Majesty.

231
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,060
Since Mr. Su has already started to serve Prince Yu,

232
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,060
I should be careful when I speak.

233
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,060
Since I came to the capital,

234
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,060
I have changed a lot.

235
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,060
Now I have to go back to see

236
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,060
what I have been friends with

237
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,060
and not to care about Jing Rui.

238
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,060
Xiao Jing Rui is a good boy.

239
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,060
He always brings people with a heart of his own.

240
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,060
He is always a little bit of a hypocrite.

241
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,060
But I hope that the pure and sweet heart

242
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,060
will not change in the future.

243
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,060
Who is it?

244
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,060
Go.

245
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,060
You are really a man.

246
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,060
Your head is so tall.

247
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
You are wearing yellow hair.

248
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,060
You are so good at playing the ball.

249
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
You are even drinking blood.

250
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,060
You have seen the good people.

251
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,060
They are so cunning.

252
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,060
We are here to make up for them.

253
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,060
Didn't the return of the people start from years ago?

254
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,060
Why haven't you caught them?

255
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
Mr. Su, you know what?

256
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,060
There are many mountains and forests in the east.

257
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,060
The monster is so cunning.

258
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,060
We can't stay here all the time, right?

259
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,060
Several times ago,

260
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,060
I didn't even see a shadow.

261
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,060
This time, I finally caught up with the evil.

262
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,060
No, the people who scared me ran away.

263
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,060
The mountains and forests are so vast.

264
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,060
If we keep a beast like this,

265
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,060
it will be like a big sea.

266
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,060
No wonder it is always a harem.

267
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,060
Isn't this place called Village People's爆?

268
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,060
Shouldn't it be the one that should be taken care of by the Yamen?

269
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,060
You don't know anything.

270
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,060
The monster is so powerful.

271
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,060
The Yamen is not fast enough.

272
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,060
It's only once.

273
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,060
50 people are not even caught.

274
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
Mr. Gao has no other choice.

275
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,060
This is what we need to do in front of our prince.

276
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,060
We only need to take care of the big trouble.

277
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,060
Do you have a lot of trouble in your prince?

278
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,060
Mr. Su, I'll take my leave.

279
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,060
Take care, Mr. Xia.

280
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:44,060
Sir, why did you lie to me just now?

281
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,060
I...

282
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,060
Did I say something wrong again?

283
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,060
Yes, I know you're going to wake up.

284
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,060
It seems that Prince Jing is in a good mood.

285
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,060
Although you said those words in front of Mr. Xia Dong,

286
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,060
there is no big problem.

287
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,060
But don't say anything in the future.

288
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,060
Now Prince Jing needs to talk less and do more things.

289
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,060
You need to understand more about this.

290
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,060
Okay, don't worry, sir.

291
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,060
I'll remember.

292
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,060
Go and ask the villagers what they like to eat.

293
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,060
You set up a trap and take it out.

294
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,060
Thank you, sir.

295
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,060
Everyone in the palace has shell casos.

296
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,060
But right now,

297
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,060
they are said or killed by superficies.

298
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,060
This is my son,

299
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,060
characters, and corporate deeds.

300
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,060
I only send troops to Mmon Mbali.

301
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,060
I want to ask for time.

302
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,060
You have already come to understand that

303
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,060
Dowager Yu's relative

304
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,060
Road to Farr こ roda!

305
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,060
It's me.

306
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,060
Flyingtofb..

307
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,460
Shen Zui will become the left-wing right-wing of Prince Jing.

308
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,060
This person can't be in trouble.

309
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,660
You must keep an eye on him.

310
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,860
Yes.

311
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,660
Although the one who followed Shen Zui is Zhuo Qingyao,

312
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,860
I'm still worried that Zhuo Dingfeng will be in danger.

313
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,660
Xie Yu is always in a bad position.

314
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,660
If Zhuo Dingfeng really is in danger,

315
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,660
it's hard for someone to block him.

316
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,660
Zhen Ping,

317
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,660
you must follow Shen Zui these two days

318
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,060
to protect his safety.

319
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,060
Yes.

320
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,060
Young Master,

321
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,060
you should practice sword-making this morning.

322
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,060
Yes.

323
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,660
My Lord, my Lord,

324
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,060
how many times have I told you to come?

325
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,060
I'll go to the kitchen in the future.

326
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,460
Can we take more people with us?

327
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,460
We don't have enough people with us.

328
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,860
What can happen to the people in the capital in the daytime?

329
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,860
My Lord.

330
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,860
Okay, okay.

331
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,060
My Lord.

332
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,060
My Lord,

333
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,060
why are you here?

334
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,060
I heard that there are many underground front-stories in this box.

335
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,060
Underground front-stories?

336
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,060
You just come here with these people?

337
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,060
I didn't say I wanted to go in.

338
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
The main street is very close to here.

339
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,060
I'll just check here.

340
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,060
If you just check,

341
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,060
you can send someone else to come.

342
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,060
The people who reported to the Ministry of Revenue

343
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,060
just want to see me.

344
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,060
They won't show up if they come.

345
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,060
If they want you to come,

346
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
you really come?

347
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,060
I'm worried about the information about this report.

348
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,060
When he comes,

349
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,060
we'll get the detailed report and go back.

350
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,060
What are you worried about?

351
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,060
What's wrong with you?

352
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,060
Get out.

353
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,060
Who's there?

354
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,060
Get out.

355
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,060
Who's there?

356
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,060
Get out.

357
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,060
Hurry up.

358
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,060
Get out.

359
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,060
Who's there?

360
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,060
Guanyin is here.

361
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,060
Let's go.

362
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,060
Young Master.

363
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,060
Mr. Shen, are you all right?

364
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,060
I...

365
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,060
Thank you for your help.

366
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:56,060
Thank you for your help.

367
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,060
What did you say?

368
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,060
You lost your hand?

369
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,060
I underestimated the defense of Shen Zui.

370
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,060
The people in Prince Jing's Manor

371
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,060
have been through it.

372
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,060
They can only...

373
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,060
They can only return without a attack.

374
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,060
Is there any evidence left at the scene?

375
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,060
We'll leave it in the car.

376
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,060
We don't have any evidence left.

377
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,060
Shen Zui...

378
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,060
He's really lucky.

379
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,060
Why did you

380
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,060
have to kill Shen Zui?

381
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,060
What's the matter with him?

382
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,060
This private kitchen

383
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,060
is related to the attack

384
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,060
of the guard in front of the Ministry of Defense.

385
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,060
Shen Zui is trying to

386
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,060
kill Crown Prince.

387
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,060
He's really suspicious.

388
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,060
There must be a prince behind it.

389
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,060
Yuan Xiaohou will be re-elected.

390
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,060
He'll report to His Majesty.

391
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,060
Zhuo Xiong.

392
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,060
We don't have much time

393
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,060
to talk about this matter.

394
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,060
You mean that

395
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,060
Prince Yu is behind Shen Zui's back?

396
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,060
Zhuo Xiong.

397
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,060
Don't you believe me?

398
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,060
Brother Xie.

399
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,060
What are you talking about?

400
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,060
Since it's Crown Prince's arrangement,

401
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,060
I'll do my best.

402
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,060
Okay.

403
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,060
This is the private kitchen of Shen Zui's Manor.

404
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,060
Brother Zhuo.

405
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,060
You must remember

406
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,060
what happened.

407
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,060
Please.

408
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,060
Father.

409
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,060
You remember

410
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,060
mixes throat anduriじ.

411
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,060
So Uncle Shen

412
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,060
doesn't know

413
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,060
about our lives as well.

414
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,060
Qingodi,

415
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,060
Do you know

416
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,060
what you're deal yourself?

417
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,060
I'm just Only

418
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,060
knowing he's our minimap

419
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,060
of general concern.

420
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,060
I can't do that.

421
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,060
I don't know what's going on.

422
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,060
I just know that if we are together,

423
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,060
we can divide into black and white.

424
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,060
Do you really want to let the sword of the world

425
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,060
be the shield of the world?

426
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,060
You...

427
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,060
Dad.

428
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,060
I and your father are doing this

429
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,060
for the sake of the future of the two worlds.

430
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,060
I didn't want you to be involved in this

431
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,060
because I gave you the chance.

432
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,060
But you can't do this.

433
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,060
You can't do this.

434
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,060
If your father finds out about this,

435
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,060
I won't be able to protect you.

436
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,060
Do you understand?

437
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,060
Dad.

438
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,060
If this happens again,

439
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,060
I won't forgive you.

440
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,060
Are you okay with the injury on your shoulder?

441
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,060
I'm fine.

442
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,060
Dad.

443
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,060
Junior.

444
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,060
Master, you are finally back.

445
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,060
I'm finally back.

446
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,060
When did you come back?

447
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,060
I was told that I would be delayed

448
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,060
for two months by the date of the original date.

449
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,060
It's been a long time since Master

450
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,060
went to the East Sea to rest.

451
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,060
Why are you still delaying?

452
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,060
I didn't say that.

453
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,060
But Master also called Xia Qiu over.

454
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,060
I think

455
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,060
there must be something important to do.

456
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,060
No wonder.

457
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,060
This time, the elder brother

458
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,060
didn't come back for the New Year.

459
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,060
He went with Master.

460
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,060
Master spent a lot of time

461
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,060
in the capital

462
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,060
during the period of the dead.

463
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,060
When he comes back,

464
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,060
he will be scared to death.

465
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,060
The case that the emperor handed over

466
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
to the internal court is still

467
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,060
in the hands of the current situation.

468
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,060
But, brother,

469
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,060
you are still in a good mood.

470
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,060
Speaking of this case,

471
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,060
I heard that there has been

472
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,060
a clear witness in the Qing Dynasty.

473
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,060
The sword is very sharp.

474
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,060
Is it related to this case?

475
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,060
I have checked it.

476
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,060
This person is a general.

477
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,060
The man in the assassin

478
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,060
shouldn't be the one he did.

479
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,060
And he is a master

480
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,060
who challenges everywhere after the case.

481
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,060
If it's him,

482
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,060
wouldn't he be self-sufficient?

483
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,060
Liuli,

484
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,060
what you mean is

485
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,060
that you still suspect that you are the one who killed Jiu Ding Feng?

486
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,060
This is not like the ordinary killer.

487
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,060
But now,

488
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,060
the most powerful general in the court

489
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,060
is only Jiang Zuo Meng and Tianquan Shandong.

490
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:08,060
Then why don't you suspect Mei Changsu?

491
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,060
I'm not suspecting.

492
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,060
I'm not sure.

493
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,060
The first one I got

494
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,060
was the letter and the crown prince

495
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,060
who guarded the Xunfang Camp.

496
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,060
So,

497
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,060
Mei Changsu

498
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,060
can only be sent to the back

499
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,060
from my list.

500
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,060
If that's the case,

501
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,060
I'll go and meet Jiu Ding Feng.

502
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,060
Is Senior Brother forcing me to do it?

503
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,060
Of course, it's good that you didn't do it.

504
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
I'm sure of it.

505
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,060
Now,

506
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,060
I'll take the seal that I've been searching for

507
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,060
and let him hide.

508
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,060
As long as I can wait for the right opportunity,

509
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,060
I'll take the chance.

510
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,060
You remember it clearly.

511
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,060
The cup of the seal

512
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,060
was used by the chief to drink tea.

513
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,060
The cup of the seal is very beautiful.

514
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,060
You can't drink it with other people's wedding room.

515
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,060
Okay.

516
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,060
The water of the tea is in the purple sand lake.

517
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,060
I've already divided the amount of tea that I've made.

518
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,060
It's right here.

519
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,060
You can put these two

520
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,060
softened dishes in which position

521
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,060
you're sitting in.

522
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,060
Remember,

523
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,060
you must have two.

524
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,060
The first one is to be burned in advance.

525
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,060
Remember to put the cold one in the first place.

526
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,060
Gong Yu,

527
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,060
you're here for something.

528
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,060
It's not for you.

529
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,060
Why are you preparing these?

530
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,060
Besides,

531
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,060
I'm not hungry anymore.

532
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,060
He might not notice.

533
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,060
Even if the chief doesn't notice,

534
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,060
as long as he can feel better,

535
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,060
I'll be happy.

536
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,060
Come.

537
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,060
It's done.

538
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,060
It's done.

539
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,060
It's done.

540
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,060
Put it on the left.

541
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,060
It's done.

542
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,060
Hang it.

543
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,060
Be careful.

544
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,060
Brother Yishou,

545
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,060
is it beautiful?

546
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,060
Yes, it is.

547
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,060
Brother,

548
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,060
are you going out?

549
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,060
Yes.

550
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,060
I'm going to the temple's room.

551
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,060
Temple's room?

552
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,060
I have something to do.

553
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,060
I'm going to the temple.

554
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,060
What's wrong?

555
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,060
What's wrong?

556
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,060
I'm going to the temple.

557
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,060
I'm going to the temple.

558
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,060
I understand.

559
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,060
The night of the Shangyuan Festival,

560
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,060
you just

561
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,060
want to see me.

562
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,060
Jingrui, look over there.

563
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,060
Is it beautiful?

564
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,060
Brother Su,

565
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,060
Chief Yiduo.

566
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
There are many people

567
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,060
who come out of the temple.

568
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,060
It's good to come from the small street.

569
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,060
As long as we are on the main street,

570
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,060
we don't have to go to the temple.

571
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,060
I'll tell you the way.

572
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,060
It's normal.

573
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,060
I know this place.

574
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,060
You know it.

575
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,060
I want to come here every day.

576
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,060
Why?

577
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,060
It's not embarrassing to come here every day.

578
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,060
This is called the true color of the hero.

579
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,060
It's called Shi Fengliu.

580
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,060
Your father is usually so serious.

581
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,060
That's why he taught you so much.

582
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,060
Do you think so?

583
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,060
Go in.

584
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,060
Okay.

585
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,060
Brother Su, please.

586
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,060
Please.

587
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,060
Mr. Su, this is your seat.

588
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,060
The girl is so sharp-eyed.

589
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,060
She knows who is the guest.

590
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,060
When I came here,

591
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,060
I didn't treat her like this.

592
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,060
She is so annoying.

593
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,060
She can still treat you like this.

594
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,060
What's wrong with you?

595
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,060
I'm sorry.

596
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,060
I'm sorry.

597
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,060
I'm sorry.

598
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,060
I'm sorry.

599
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,060
I'm sorry.

600
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,060
I'm sorry.

601
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,060
I'm sorry.

602
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,060
I'm sorry.

603
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,060
I'm sorry.

604
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,060
I'm sorry.

605
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,060
I'm sorry.

606
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,060
I'm sorry.

607
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,060
Miss Gong.

608
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,060
Mr. Yan.

609
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,060
Mr. Xiao.

610
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,060
Brother Su,

611
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,060
this is the girl I often mention to you.

612
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,060
Miss Gong Yu.

613
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,060
I think

614
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,060
this is Mr. Su Zhe.

615
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,060
Where is Mr. Su?

616
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,060
He went out to see the lantern.

617
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,060
Gu Ye, you can look for him.

618
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,060
Okay.

619
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,060
If you don't want to look for him,

620
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,060
just ask him.

621
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,060
Yes.

622
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,060
Brother Qing.

623
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,060
Why are you here?

624
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,060
I'm bored.

625
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,060
You can accompany me.

626
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,060
Although I can't go to the street to see lanterns,

627
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,060
it's good to see them at home.

628
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,060
What's wrong?

629
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,060
What's wrong with you tonight?

630
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,060
Okay.

631
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,060
I have a problem.

632
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,060
I need to take a walk.

633
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,060
Are you angry?

634
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,060
I'll talk to you later.

635
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
Forget it.

636
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,060
Since my father asked you to go,

637
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,060
you can go.

638
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,060
I'll take you inside.

639
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,060
No.

640
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,060
I want to see you.

641
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,060
Brother Qing.

642
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,060
There are many people outside.

643
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,060
Be careful.

644
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,060
As Mr. Yan often said,

645
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,060
Mr. Su is a great person.

646
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,060
Mr. Su has prepared

647
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,060
the new lanterns for you.

648
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,060
Please enjoy it.

649
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:09,060
Mr. Su's new song?

650
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,060
Of course, I'll listen to it.

651
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,060
I'll listen to it.

652
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,060
Mr. Su,

653
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,060
I'm sorry.

654
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,060
I'm sorry.

655
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,060
I'm sorry.

656
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,060
I'm sorry.

657
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,060
I'm sorry.

658
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,060
I'm sorry.

659
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,060
I'm sorry.

660
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,060
I'm sorry.

661
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,060
I'm sorry.

662
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
I'm sorry.

663
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,060
I'm sorry.

664
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,060
I'm sorry.

665
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,060
I'm sorry.

666
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,060
I'm sorry.

667
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,060
I'm sorry.

668
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
I'm sorry.

669
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,060
I'm sorry.

670
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,060
I'm sorry.

671
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,060
I'm sorry.

672
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,060
I'm sorry.

673
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,060
I'm sorry.

674
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,060
I'm sorry.

675
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
I'm sorry.

676
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,060
I'm sorry.

677
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,060
I'm sorry.

678
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,060
I'm sorry.

679
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,060
I'm sorry.

680
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,060
I'm sorry.

681
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,060
I'm sorry.

682
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,060
I'm sorry.

683
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,060
I'm sorry.

684
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,060
I'm sorry.

685
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,060
I'm sorry.

686
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,060
I'm sorry.

687
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,060
I'm sorry.

688
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,060
I'm sorry.

689
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,060
I never expected

690
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,060
you would act like this.

691
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,060
You're a man with the wind.

692
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,060
Although Jin Rui doesn't usually say it,

693
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,060
she is also a musician.

694
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:52,060
Why don't you ask Miss Gong to help you with your birthday party?

695
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,060
Well...

696
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,060
I don't know why.

697
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,060
Miss Gong rarely leaves Miaoyan House.

698
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,060
She has never been to any of the house's banquet.

699
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,060
Su Moulou is busy.

700
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,060
You're welcome.

701
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,060
Young Master Xiao is a kind person.

702
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,060
He is different from others.

703
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,060
If he can be my only condition,

704
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,060
I can't go.

705
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,060
Miss Gong, if you want to come,

706
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,060
you can do anything.

707
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,060
Miss, please tell me.

708
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,060
I heard that the eldest princess has a piece of old tune.

709
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,060
If it's a tune,

710
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,060
of course I can.

711
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,060
Jin Rui, you can do it.

712
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,060
Miss Gong, I also love the person with a good tone.

713
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,060
It's not convenient to come here.

714
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,060
If you can really go to the house to play,

715
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,060
it's a great chance.

716
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,060
Good.

717
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,060
Since it's like this,

718
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,060
on April 12th,

719
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,060
please marry Miss Gong to the Ningsha House.

720
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,060
Before April 12th, please be quiet.

721
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,060
Let me do something important.

722
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,060
If Brother Su can join the house,

723
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:21,060
I think it will be a birthday that you'll never forget.

724
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,060
Let's go.

725
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,060
Stop the car.

726
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,060
Retreat.

727
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,060
Shoot.

728
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,060
Master Shen,

729
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,060
don't get hurt.

730
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,060
Please rest.

731
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,060
Thank you, Prince Jing and Mr. Su.

732
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,060
Thank you both.

733
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,060
Qing.

734
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,060
Qing.

735
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,060
Qing.

736
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,060
Qing.

737
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,060
Qing.

738
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,060
Qing.

739
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,060
Qing.

740
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,060
Qing.

741
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,060
Qing.

742
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,060
Qing.

743
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,060
How did you kill him?

744
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,060
Master Shen has a fake weapon.

745
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,060
You're right.

746
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,060
There must be a Prince Yu behind it.

747
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,060
This is not a good chance.

748
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,060
I'm afraid I can't stand it anymore.

749
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,060
Xie Yu was in the palace in chaos.

750
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,060
He was the first to be in charge of the imperial army.

751
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,060
He's the first to be in charge.

752
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,060
You can't let him win.

753
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,060
It's good that the imperial army is not the top of the list.

754
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,060
The imperial army is the top.

755
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,060
Xie Yu couldn't make any trouble these days.

756
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,060
The defense of the imperial guards is not the top.

757
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,060
The Crown Prince used a nuclear-fueling star

758
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,060
to kill the two-way master.

759
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,060
Now he's forced to attack the middle.

760
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,060
You should try to counterattack.

761
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,060
I'm waiting for you to say this.

762
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,060
Xie Yu is in a deep trap.

763
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,060
He's not strong enough.

764
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,060
He's not good enough.

765
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,060
Mr. Gaowen,

766
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,060
where should we start?

767
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,060
Your Highness,

768
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,060
the Crown Prince and the Lou Zhijing

769
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,060
opened a private kitchen.

770
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,060
A private kitchen?

771
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,060
Although the year has passed,

772
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,060
the Eastern Palace has started to guard the private kitchen.

773
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,060
But the current minister's guard,

774
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,060
Shen Zui,

775
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,060
has already collected evidence.

776
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,060
The book he's talking about has been put up.

777
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,060
But he just got on the mission.

778
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,060
The court is in a hurry.

779
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,060
The book is only for the Eastern Palace.

780
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,060
I'm afraid the imperial guard may not be able to stand it.

781
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,060
It's a rare opportunity to counterattack the Crown Prince.

782
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,060
I hope you can help Shen Zui in the secret.

783
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,060
I can't let the Crown Prince take the blame easily.

784
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,060
You're really a smart man.

785
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,060
Okay.

786
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,060
Leave it to me.

787
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,060
I'm sorry.

788
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,060
I'm sorry.

789
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,060
I'm sorry.

790
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,060
I'm sorry.

791
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,060
I'm sorry.

792
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,060
I'm sorry.

793
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,060
I'm sorry.

794
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,060
I'm sorry.

795
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,060
I'm sorry.

796
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,060
I'm sorry.

797
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,060
I'm sorry.

798
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,060
I'm sorry.

799
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,060
I'm sorry.

800
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,060
I'm sorry.

801
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,060
I'm sorry.

802
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,060
I'm sorry.

803
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,060
I'm sorry.

804
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,060
I'm sorry.
