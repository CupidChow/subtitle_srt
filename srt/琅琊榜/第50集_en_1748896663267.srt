00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Princess.

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Go.

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Princess.

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Meng Qi.

6
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You've known it all along.

7
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Right?

8
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And Wei Zheng,

9
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Meng Zhi,

10
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and Mi Huang.

11
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
They all knew it.

12
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Really?

13
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

14
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Only I don't know.

15
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Only I.

16
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Why?

17
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why didn't you tell me?

18
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
When I was young,

19
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
the blood you gave is different from others.

20
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Got it?

21
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I â€¦

22
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Um,

23
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I could only ask Mother out.

24
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I could only ask her out.

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Come, get up.

26
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Jingyan,

27
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
now,

28
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
it's still not your turn.

29
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm not going to let you go.

30
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm not going to let you go.

31
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm not going to let you go.

32
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm not going to let you go.

33
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's still not your turn to be sad.

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There are still many things to do in the future.

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You and her

36
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
can't listen to the footsteps.

37
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
She's sick.

38
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I only have one thing to say.

39
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I only have one thing to say.

40
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I only have one thing to say.

41
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
To fulfill her wish.

42
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's your wish too.

43
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
All of our people's wishes.

44
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Your Majesty,

45
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
do you want to invite Noble Consort to come and see?

46
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Xia Jiang Zhi Yan,

47
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
do you believe it?

48
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't believe it.

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's rare for you to say such a thing.

50
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why don't you believe it?

51
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Your Majesty,

52
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I've been in the palace for so many years.

53
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
At least,

54
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I've known you since I was a child

55
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and know how much you love me.

56
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If this Mr. Su is just a book,

57
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
then His Highness will never let Xia Jiang

58
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
take him to Xuanjing Temple.

59
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I forgot.

60
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
When Wei Zheng was in the palace,

61
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Wei Chang Su was taken to Xuanjing Temple.

62
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But he's a man of the past.

63
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're right.

64
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If he's a book,

65
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Jing Yan will never treat him like this.

66
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Since you've said it,

67
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
it's nothing.

68
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Don't worry.

69
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
His Highness will never let him take him to Xuanjing Temple.

70
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He really won't.

71
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's my fault.

72
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's all my fault

73
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
and the relationship between the Crown Prince and me.

74
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Xia Jiang used Uncle Lin's identity

75
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
to make us rich.

76
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's really a bad thing.

77
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm still a little bit wronged

78
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
about the Crown Prince's heart.

79
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I should comfort him.

80
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That day, I was in the palace.

81
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I asked my mother's name.

82
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I thought

83
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
if I suddenly asked her,

84
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
and didn't give you the chance to discuss it,

85
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
maybe I could find the truth.

86
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But I didn't expect it.

87
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You didn't expect

88
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
that the name of Meishi Nan really existed?

89
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Uncle Lin used to be a painter

90
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
who used to be Meishi Nan.

91
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He saved his mother as a maid.

92
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Right?

93
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No one mentioned this past.

94
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So when you really talked about that old man,

95
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I didn't expect him to be indeed the leader.

96
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You're the one

97
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
who can rely on Uncle Lin the most.

98
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Jingyan,

99
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
you must promise me

100
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
that you'll never

101
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
be wrong

102
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
when you hold on to your anger.

103
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Now,

104
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
you still can't bear to fail.

105
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But Uncle Lin

106
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
can't bear to do it anymore.

107
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Mother, don't worry.

108
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'll take care of it.

109
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Come on. Let me check.

110
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What are you checking?

111
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You must try it.

112
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Do you know what's dangerous?

113
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Of course I do.

114
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Do you have a better way?

115
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Hurry up.

116
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Come on.

117
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Go.

118
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Fei Liu,

119
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
is it beautiful?

120
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yes.

121
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What does it look like?

122
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't know.

123
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
A fear-stricken tail?

124
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Is it?

125
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Come on.

126
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What?

127
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll put this on your waist.

128
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Can you dance a fear-stricken dance?

129
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No.

130
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Come here.

131
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll do it.

132
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Come here.

133
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Come here.

134
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You're so small.

135
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You dare to run away?

136
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Come on.

137
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Come back.

138
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Help.

139
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Brother Su, help.

140
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Come here.

141
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You still run away?

142
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Brother Su, help.

143
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Brother Su, come and save me.

144
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Brother Su, help.

145
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
How is the princess?

146
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
She's fine.

147
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
She's been sleeping.

148
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
She didn't move a bit.

149
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The more nervous you are, the more annoying you are.

150
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You've been in danger for the past half of the day.

151
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Brother Su, help.

152
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Go to sleep.

153
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You can't even sleep properly.

154
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Just listen to me.

155
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Brother Su, help.

156
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Help.

157
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Sir, she didn't move.

158
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Who are you?

159
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The princess is still sleeping.

160
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What's going on?

161
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The minister of dishes suddenly checked the prison yesterday.

162
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The palace is being found.

163
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The palace is being found?

164
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yes.

165
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It was found last night.

166
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I only knew the news this morning.

167
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
When will she fall asleep?

168
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
She needs to make a decision.

169
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Sir Ling said that she had to stay two days at least.

170
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Two days?

171
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
She's changed again.

172
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Are you all right?

173
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If such a little thing

174
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
is going to let her find a way,

175
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
she'll be in danger sooner or later.

176
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's all my fault.

177
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I have to go back.

178
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Now she's been found.

179
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You're the king of the world.

180
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Both of you will be killed.

181
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What do you think we should do?

182
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Wait here.

183
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Wait for Miss Gong to go.

184
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
No.

185
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You can't go anyway.

186
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Tonight,

187
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'll break into the prison.

188
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll fight with them.

189
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'll save Miss Gong.

190
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'll be with you.

191
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
We'll be together.

192
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Even if the king of the world falls,

193
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
we can make a promise.

194
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
All right.

195
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
All right.

196
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Are you all right?

197
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Now I finally understand

198
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
why Changsu is so tired.

199
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You really can help him.

200
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Sir Ling,

201
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
if you have any other ideas, just say it.

202
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If you keep talking to me,

203
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'll sue you for the first time.

204
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm afraid you'll sue me.

205
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You can solve the problem

206
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
in a few words.

207
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It depends on what you look like.

208
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
All right.

209
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Let me teach you.

210
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll teach you how to deal with

211
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
the minister of the Ministry of Justice

212
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
without a single word.

213
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Why are you like this?

214
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Where are your men?

215
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
How do I know?

216
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This place is not a hotel.

217
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Let's go.

218
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Stop.

219
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I didn't expect it to be you.

220
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Commander Meng.

221
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Xia Dong.

222
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Why are you here?

223
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Commander Meng,

224
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
what's the problem?

225
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Now, Mr. Cai is going to run away.

226
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
His Highness is chasing after him.

227
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's not your fault.

228
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
His Highness?

229
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yes.

230
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Xia Dong has escaped.

231
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He's a fake.

232
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
He has nothing to do with Commander Meng.

233
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Why did you bring back the criminal?

234
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Do you really want to know?

235
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Commander Meng.

236
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Are you kidding me?

237
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Do you still remember

238
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
the order of His Majesty

239
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
to escape from the prison?

240
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The Ministry of Justice

241
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
is responsible for the loss of the criminal

242
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and the death of the prisoner.

243
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If there is a criminal,

244
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
we'll have to investigate.

245
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Mr. Cai,

246
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
did I say anything wrong?

247
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Xia Dong escaped from the prison

248
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
and was arrested by the crown prince.

249
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If we bring him back,

250
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
it doesn't mean that we tell everyone

251
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
that you have to

252
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
escape from the prison again.

253
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The crown prince is very proud of you.

254
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
He doesn't want you to be punished.

255
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So he secretly asked me

256
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
to bring Xia Dong back to the prison.

257
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I hope that

258
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
the Ministry of Justice

259
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
will not think that way.

260
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'll go now.

261
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Mr. Cai,

262
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
although we are not familiar with each other,

263
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I am always proud of you.

264
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The current Liang is very loyal.

265
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You need such a good official.

266
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Since the crown prince

267
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
loves to protect others,

268
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
why do you have to be so stubborn

269
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
to let him down?

270
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Mr. Cai,

271
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
please take me to thank the crown prince.

272
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
This time,

273
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I will never let him escape again.

274
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Don't worry, sir.

275
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I will bring the painting.

276
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Thank you, Mr. Cai.

277
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Goodbye.

278
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The situation of the power is very serious.

279
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Although he trusted us,

280
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
he still took the policy

281
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
of how to escape Xia Dong.

282
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Fortunately, we have prepared

283
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
for Zhou Quan.

284
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Otherwise, he would have been killed.

285
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Where is Gong Yu?

286
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
She is a fake criminal

287
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
who has been in prison for Xia Dong.

288
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Of course, Cai Quan won't let her go.

289
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Fortunately, Gong is not an ordinary person.

290
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
She is a smart and skilled person.

291
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Xia Dong said that Xuan Jing Si

292
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
arranged a secret plan

293
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
in the temple room.

294
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He made it in time.

295
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Where is Gong?

296
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Cai Quan should have

297
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
gone there to confirm it.

298
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You are making a fuss.

299
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Who is the person

300
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
who arrested Xia Dong?

301
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
How did he send him back?

302
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Does the crown prince know?

303
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
He has been there

304
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
for a long time.

305
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You arranged it well.

306
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
This matter

307
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
is finally settled.

308
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Settled?

309
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Maybe.

310
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
How did you know

311
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
about this?

312
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Did you find it?

313
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
No wonder you are so tired.

314
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I will give you a ride.

315
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You have a bodyguard

316
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
who just got married recently, right?

317
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's a luxury.

318
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Go and check it.

319
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Go.

320
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
How did you know everything?

321
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Come.

322
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You come to Langya Pavilion

323
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and make a three-year study.

324
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I will give you everything.

325
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Go.

326
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Go.

327
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Go.

328
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Go.

329
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Go.

330
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Go.

331
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Go.

332
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Go.

333
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I said you are not pretty.

334
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Come here.

335
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I will bring you.

336
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Brother Su.

337
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
If you think it's boring,

338
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
go and check it for me.

339
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
How many people

340
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
have Princess Xianji left for Xia Jiang?

341
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Don't waste it.

342
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Who are you?

343
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You should have thrown the doctor

344
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
to the wall.

345
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You are so careless.

346
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You would have been sick.

347
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You are not sick at all.

348
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I met the Minister of War Li Lin.

349
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Seeing him in a state of mental disorder,

350
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I think he got the crown prince's

351
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
first case.

352
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
He has been a minister of war for so many years.

353
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
He knows the military system the best.

354
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
He is capable of leaving the Party.

355
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The first case is not a big deal.

356
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I will let him modify it

357
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and report it to the Central Library.

358
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Chief.

359
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The Minister of War Li Lin.

360
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You haven't been treated well.

361
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Why did you destroy it?

362
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Because I won't kill them.

363
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's meaningless to keep these two wooden cards.

364
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's like a nightmare.

365
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Some people will be trapped forever.

366
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Some people will wake up.

367
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
These two ministers are awake.

368
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Whether you participated in the war before,

369
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
as long as you have the heart to destroy it,

370
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I will give them the chance.

371
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Actually, most people have a symbol

372
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
of the Prime Minister of the State of Ji

373
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
when they enter the world.

374
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Only because the Prime Minister of the State of Qi

375
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
has lost his mind and has been left behind.

376
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
When His Highness has updated the Prime Minister of the State of Qi,

377
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
he will be able to make a new one

378
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
for the new Prime Minister of the State of Qi.

379
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I think it's a good idea.

380
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
When His Highness has updated the Prime Minister of the State of Qi,

381
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
he will be able to make a new one for these people.

382
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's really a good idea.

383
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But this kind of opportunity

384
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
can't be given again and again.

385
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Some people are already old and afraid of change.

386
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
There are many people in the world.

387
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Why not leave some more opportunities

388
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
and give those Hanmen scholars who are not infected.

389
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Isn't that better?

390
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
No matter how good Hanmen are,

391
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
all scholars should have a close relationship.

392
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
As long as some of the disciples

393
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
are selected to use public transportation,

394
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
they can't be too far away from the government.

395
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You should know that

396
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
the experience of being a government official is very important.

397
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
The new scholars are in the quality and details.

398
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
But the new ones are still a bit worse than the experience.

399
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Everyone knows what's left.

400
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Then there will be more opportunities

401
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
for those who are in the training.

402
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Of course, they will be old.

403
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Then there will be time.

404
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
For example, the situation of helping the army to change the house.

405
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Li Lin's age is not to be seen there.

406
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I think that if anyone does this,

407
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
they will not be able to do anything else.

408
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
They will be more powerful and more focused.

409
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I admit that the military plan is very good.

410
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
But this is just a personal case.

411
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It can't be pushed by most people.

412
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The age and experience are just because of people.

413
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Some people have been on the top for a few years.

414
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Some people have been in the same position for more than ten years.

415
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But in the end, they still don't know anything.

416
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You can't just talk about it.

417
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You need to be careful.

418
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
There are so many places in the world.

419
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
How can you be careful?

420
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Can't you just do it?

421
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You can choose the talent and the talent.

422
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
It's the most important thing for the king.

423
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
There are not too many people in the food and the food.

424
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But too many.

425
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
The crown prince is in charge.

426
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
The new court will have a new aura.

427
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Cai Qin is very strict.

428
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Qin Shenyan.

429
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
There is no new court.

430
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yes, your highness.

431
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Now the crown prince is in charge of the court.

432
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Why are you so idle?

433
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I can't say it in a word.

434
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Why are you so idle?

435
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
How is the thing about the Hua tribe?

436
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Can you say something happy?

437
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Our Young Master has a headache.

438
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You should know that

439
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
looking for these little buildings

440
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
is more troublesome than finding those big heads.

441
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Plus, the people of the Xuanji Palace are both scattered and secret.

442
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
If there is a person who knows the inside,

443
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
it's good to help.

444
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Don't give me that.

445
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You promised me.

446
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Before Xie Yu's death was sent to the capital,

447
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
you cleaned up all the trouble that was left in the river.

448
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Can't you just say it?

449
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Loso.

450
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
What's wrong?

451
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I thought you were going to Loso.

452
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I suddenly thought of Prince Yu.

453
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Before he died, he told me

454
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
that he must have thought it through.

455
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
You mean

456
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Prince Yu and Hua tribe are also related?

457
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Otherwise, he wouldn't have been in the river

458
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and stayed with Qin Banruo for so long.

459
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
And they wouldn't have helped him so much.

460
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
No way.

461
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Could it be that the emperor's son and Hua tribe's woman

462
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
are also related?

463
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Nonsense.

464
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Only His Majesty knows about this.

465
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm thinking

466
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
if this matter is as we expected,

467
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Prince Yu will definitely

468
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
give up the revenge so easily

469
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
after he dies.

470
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Are you tired?

471
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Yes.

472
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Let's go.

473
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Chief.

474
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
What's the matter?

475
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Chief, please tell me

476
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
where the emperor's son is.

477
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'm sorry for the crime of hiding it.

479
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Why did you hide it from me?

480
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm also from Hua tribe.

481
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
My mother told me about it.

482
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
But Chief,

483
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I've never done anything bad to you.

484
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm really sorry

485
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
for the trouble you've caused

486
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
this time.

487
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I knew you were from Hua tribe.

488
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Chief, you knew?

489
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Back then,

490
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Hua tribe was located between

491
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
the Great Liang and Beiyan.

492
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
It was a place without a tribe.

493
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
It was hard to find a country

494
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
but it was a country that was destined to be.

495
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It was a country that was not determined by the royal family.

496
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Although Princess Xuan Ji

497
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
was a very wise person,

498
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Hua tribe and Great Liang were the same.

499
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Now, Hua and Liang are no different.

500
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Why do you have to change your mind?

501
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Chief.

502
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh, right.

503
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Since you mentioned it,

504
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I have something to ask you.

505
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Chief, please ask.

506
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Do you know

507
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
if Princess Xuan Ji had a child?

508
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
No.

509
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But Princess Xuan Ji's sister,

510
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Princess Ling Long,

511
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
had a child.

512
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But she died

513
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
when she was fighting with Great Liang.

514
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
After she died,

515
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
the child was not aware of the situation.

516
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
If there is nothing else,

517
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
you can leave.

518
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yes.

519
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
She has been sad

520
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
for a long time for the sake of God.

521
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Today,

522
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
finally,

523
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
the ancient tribe has the courage

524
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
to talk to you.

525
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
How come you don't know

526
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
how much comfort she has?

527
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
If I don't comfort her,

528
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
what will she do?

529
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
She won't do anything.

530
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
She's just sad.

531
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Since she won't do anything,

532
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
why should I bother her?

533
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I hope for her now.

534
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
She will come

535
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and take care of me.

536
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
She will be more disappointed.

537
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Am I right?

538
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You really know how to be kind.

539
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Little Pei Liu,

540
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
do you see?

541
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Your heart is as hard as stone.

542
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
No.

543
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Come on up.

544
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Come down and drink with me.

545
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
No.

546
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Come down.

547
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Mr. Yan, you're here.

548
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Hello, Mr. Yan.

549
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Welcome.

550
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Congratulations, Yan Hong.

551
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Thank you.

552
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Congratulations, Yan Yan.

553
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

554
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

555
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

556
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Come in, please.

557
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Brother.

558
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You're blessed to be in the East Sea.

559
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Thank you.

560
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Long time no see.

561
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Long time no see.

562
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Please come in.

563
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Congratulations, Mr. Yan.

564
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Thank you.

565
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Please come in.

566
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
This is Mr. Yan.

567
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm Yan Yu Jin.

568
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Are you coming to my house?

569
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Mr. Yan is a good man.

570
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Congratulations.

571
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Thank you.

572
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Please come in.

573
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Madam, you're...

574
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Bixing Han.

575
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
He's Mr. Yan's old friend.

576
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
This is the whole family.

577
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Congratulations, Mr. Yan.

578
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Thank you.

579
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
He's my father's old friend.

580
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Please come in.

581
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Thank you.

582
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
This is my father's old friend.

583
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Please come in.

584
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Mr. Yan, this way, please.

585
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Please come in.

586
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Please come in.

587
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Congratulations, Mr. Yan.

588
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Thank you.

589
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Congratulations, Mr. Yan.

590
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Thank you.

591
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Thank you.

592
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Thank you.

593
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Thank you.

594
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Turn around.

595
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Turn around and take a look.

596
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Take a look at the inside.

597
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The inside.

598
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It's not as good as the eye sight.

599
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Don't you know?

600
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Put it there.

601
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Does it hurt?

602
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Who told you to drink so much last night?

603
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You're going out again?

604
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Today is Yan Hou's birthday.

605
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
The iron was sent a few days ago.

606
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I want to go there.

607
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yan Hou's birthday?

608
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
The crown prince will go there, too.

609
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Take me with you.

610
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yan Yu Jin's crown prince

611
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
likes to play with him.

612
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You lost.

613
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Fei Liu.

614
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Although we were playing

615
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
water-sweeping games last night,

616
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
the whole night has passed.

617
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
The new day has begun.

618
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
The game is over.

619
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Especially...

620
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
The new day of the door is coming.

621
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
994466.

622
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Come.

623
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Now I'm talking to your brother Su

624
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
about other things.

625
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
You're doing this behind me

626
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
with a lot of water.

627
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's not just a mistake.

628
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
It's not a joke.

629
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Do you understand?

630
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I don't care.

631
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I lost.

632
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I lost.

633
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Zhen Liang.

634
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Madam, please.

635
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's you.

636
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yan Xiong.

637
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Long time no see.

638
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Yes, madam.

639
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Long time no see.

640
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I think...

641
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
this is Zhuo, right?

642
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
He's my surname.

643
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Han Zhuo.

644
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Greetings, Uncle Yan.

645
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Please.

646
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Good.

647
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Madam.

648
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You chose to come to the capital.

649
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You should have made your decision.

650
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Although I've already broken the past,

651
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I can't remember the future.

652
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
But there's still a long way to go.

653
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I think...

654
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
he'll have a solution soon.

655
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I can come and see.

656
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'll make it clear.

657
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
If possible,

658
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
let me take care of him.

659
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It's the last chance.

660
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Madam, please.

661
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Brother Su, please.

662
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Where's Yan?

663
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
My father has been listening to the lessons.

664
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
A lady came just now.

665
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
She's known as the old friend.

666
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
His father passed away.

667
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
A lady?

668
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
That lady is called Han.

669
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
There's a young lady around her.

670
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
She said she's her son.

671
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Her name is Han.

672
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
How come you know her?

673
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Chief,

674
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
it's Master Li who came to see her.

675
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It should be him.

676
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I know.

677
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It's probably just these few people.

678
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Maybe he can't help much.

679
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
He just has some mental strength.

680
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I hope he won't be too much of a killer.

681
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
If there's someone in here

682
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
who doesn't know what you're talking about,

683
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I really can't believe it.

684
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You said

685
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
there's someone else in the Jiangs.

686
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Will he know?

687
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
They've been separated for more than ten years.

688
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
He should know a lot.

689
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Maybe the more you wait,

690
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
the deeper you hide.

691
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
He'll know.

692
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Brother Su.

693
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
What are you talking about?

694
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Who is that lady?

695
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Don't move.

696
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Don't move.

697
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
That's mine.

698
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
It's useful.

699
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I know.

700
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Don't move.

701
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
That's yours.

702
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I know.

703
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Miss.

704
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Miss.

705
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
You're getting up early.

706
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Why are you wearing a suit?

707
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Why are you wearing a suit?

708
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
The four maids in my company

709
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
have been chosen.

710
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
They've been chosen?

711
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The maids in the company

712
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
will serve and support you.

713
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
They'll be happy.

714
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I'll have to help you

715
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
to get some more.

716
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Thank you, maids.

717
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I wonder if you're

718
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
so concerned

719
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
about Princess Xuan Ji

720
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
and Xia Jiang?

721
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Go.

722
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Go.

723
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Your Highness.

724
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
What did we do wrong?

725
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Are you trying to attack us?

726
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Yes, Your Highness.

727
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
What did we do wrong?

728
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
We don't want to attack you.

729
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
We don't want to attack you.

730
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Please spare us.

731
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Please spare us.

732
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Please spare us.

733
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Your Highness.

734
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Please spare us.

735
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Your Highness.

736
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Your Highness.

737
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Your Highness.

738
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Do you still remember

739
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
your sisters' care?

740
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
They're still clean.

741
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Go to the palace.

742
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Have a peaceful life.

743
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Yes.

744
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Your Highness.

745
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Your Highness.

746
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Your Highness.

747
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Your Highness.

748
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Your Highness.

749
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Your Highness.

750
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Your Highness.

751
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Take him away.

752
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Yes.

753
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Go.

754
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Your Highness.

755
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Lord Xia.

756
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It's been a long time

757
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
since I last saw you.

758
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm sure you want to know

759
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
the news.

760
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I brought you something today.

761
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You're here to see me, aren't you?

762
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
That's right.

763
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,440
It's still the only place you can bring here

764
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,800
after you've finished all the cards.

765
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,280
It's really something that makes people happy.

766
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,880
Don't say that!

767
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,360
How did you survive?

768
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
You're a ghost soul.

769
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,360
You're a ghost soul from the enemy.

770
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,360
You think I'm a spirit book?

771
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
I admit it.

772
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,360
But His Majesty doesn't believe me.

773
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,360
You must have heard about it.

774
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,360

777
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
Xie Yu died in Qianzhou.

778
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,360
When his death message reaches the capital,

779
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,360
you'll have the chance to get it.

780
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,360
The night is long.

781
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,360
I can't find the right time.

782
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,360
I'm not a spirit book.
