1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,560
See you later.

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,720
Your Highness.

3
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,720
What is it?

4
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,880
The balance report of the Ministry of Revenue

5
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,080
and the absence of the selection list

6
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,280
have been reported.

7
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,600
But it hasn't been approved yet.

8
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,520
And

9
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,920
the increase in the price of the year

10
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,120
should be settled.

11
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,440
Now the Ministry of Revenue

12
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,800
is full of people every day.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who will go to see them?

14
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,480
It's all about the Ministry of Revenue.

15
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,240
Why don't you ask the Minister of Revenue?

16
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,960
Since Mr. He's son was sentenced to prison,

17
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,400
his spirit is less than one day.

18
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,800
He can't get up in a few days.

19
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,920
He's sick?

20
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,640
Yes.

21
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,480
All right.

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,880
I know.

23
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
I'll give it back to you in two days.

24
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,440
I'll give the two leaders of the Ministry of Revenue

25
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,600
the result of the selection list.

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,160
I'll give them a list of the advantages.

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,880
Yes.

28
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,840
If you're fine, you can leave.

29
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,480
Yes.

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,680
Is He Jing Zhong really sick?

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,760
Is it because of the selection list?

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,800
I went to see Mr. He in the morning.

33
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,800
He's really sick.

34
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,640
His son is his son.

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,840
He's going to be taken away.

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,760
He can't bear it.

37
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,760
But the Ministry of Revenue is the most busy time.

38
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
All the connections have to be used in this period.

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,920
The people and the people

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,120
can't be relaxed.

41
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,720
If the Crown Prince is in trouble,

42
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,080
we can't just laugh at him

43
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,920
and follow him.

44
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,520
I'm afraid that the Ministry of Revenue

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,640
needs Mr. He to take care of himself.

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,880
I'm afraid I forgot.

47
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,520
I'm not in danger for that case.

48
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,920
But it's better to be careful than to be careful.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,240
It's not good to be in a hurry.

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,080
But it's not as good as the water in the mountain.

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,720
Do you have any good ideas?

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,520
Wen Yuan Bo wants a life.

53
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,880
Then let's give him a life.

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,720
I'll tell you about it.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
I don't understand it at all.

56
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,360
We only know Gu's disease.

57
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Why my father didn't call you?

58
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,920
I'm so sorry.

59
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,600
Bo во phishing,

60
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,620
the current Apparently,

61
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,600
you're not as good as Mr. He is.

62
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,080
Bo,

63
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,240
Okay.

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,080
I just came in to ask them to bring in some.

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,840
Fei Liu.

66
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,440
How's your tiger-ball shape?

67
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,840
It's so comfortable to soak in hot spring.

68
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,080
I should go.

69
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,880
It's good for your health.

70
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,240
Here.

71
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,720
Here.

72
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,080
This is thin and thin.

73
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,320
It's not sweet.

74
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,560
I'm sure you'll like it.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,960
I'm going to take these fruits.

76
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,720
He's in his own yard next year.

77
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
He's also in his own place.

78
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,920
This is a very rare and rare game.

79
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,280
It's called the game of the north.

80
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,200
If it's really in your house,

81
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,640
I'm afraid it's a bitter melon.

82
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,000
You're right.

83
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,600
This game is very fresh.

84
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,200
It's actually made from the silkworm.

85
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,520
It must be made from the official ship.

86
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,960
That's right.

87
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,200
It's from the official ship sent directly from the Linnan Manor.

88
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,200
It's a common ship that doesn't need to be cut off in the middle of the river.

89
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,440
It's faster than a normal ship.

90
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,280
It's a rich family in the capital.

91
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,400
They all like it.

92
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,880
It's a real ship.

93
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,160
They can't even grab it after a long time.

94
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,600
Luckily, my father made a reservation early.

95
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,720
That's why we have this kind of food.

96
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,120
So that's how it is.

97
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,120
It's really your favor.

98
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,480
You're welcome.

99
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,760
Just eat.

100
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,640
I'll give you a gift when you're done.

101
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,520
Mr. Wen.

102
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,160
Mr. Bin.

103
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,320
Mr. Wen.

104
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,480
Thank you for your hard work.

105
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,560
Mr. Bin.

106
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,720
Don't worry.

107
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,800
I've re-watched the game

108
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,280
and revised the game's location

109
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
according to the new year's plan.

110
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm sure

111
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,560
I won't be able to forget the old days.

112
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,720
Mr. Wen is a great cook.

113
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,200
I'm really grateful for

114
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,160
the preparation of the new year's day.

115
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,800
You're in a good health.

116
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,840
I'm really enjoying

117
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,960
this food.

118
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,240
You only ate one.

119
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,800
You didn't eat one.

120
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,720
You ate several.

121
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
Are you going to

122
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,000
finish this dish and go back?

123
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,320
It's delicious.

124
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,760
If you like it,

125
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,360
I'll give you a gift later.

126
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,280
Why are you here today?

127
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,880
Her Highness the Empress is sick.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,440
You're not going to the palace to visit her.

129
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,920
Her Highness the Empress is sick?

130
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,720
How come I don't know?

131
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,400
I have to ask her.

132
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,920
If Her Highness the Empress is sick,

133
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,080
I have to inform my father

134
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,120
to let her come back soon.

135
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,800
What's wrong?

136
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,480
Is the Empress not in the capital?

137
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,280
She went to the Xuan Tian Temple

138
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,240
and called for her.

139
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,720
You know my father

140
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,920
is a good cook.

141
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,920
He only wants to ask for the

142
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,240
Daliantan.

143
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,800
Without my son,

144
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,240
our family would be in trouble.

145
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,680
Her Highness the Empress

146
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,560
doesn't care about her.

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,960
They're always close.

148
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,160
My father likes to take care of her.

149
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,360
If he didn't have to

150
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
take care of her in the capital,

151
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,480
she would have moved to the mountains.

152
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,520
Uncle Yan is innocent.

153
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,120
He's like a fairy.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,160
But why are you

155
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,840
so passionate

156
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,400
and so eager to do things?

157
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,400
I think

158
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,840
you're like a wild cat.

159
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,960
Fine.

160
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,520
You're so generous.

161
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,840
You're a family cat, okay?

162
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,800
I haven't heard you

163
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
say that in a long time.

164
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,480
Brother Su.

165
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,560
During the New Year,

166
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,360
are there only these people in Suzhai?

167
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,640
Most of them are.

168
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,200
But when it's the third or fourth,

169
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,560
I'll invite some friends.

170
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,720
How about it?

171
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Are you coming?

172
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,040
Of course.

173
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,080
But there are few people in Suzhai.

174
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,560
It's cold outside.

175
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,440
It's not cold.

176
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,360
Brother Su,

177
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,800
he doesn't like to make fun of people.

178
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,320
Besides,

179
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,040
I think there are many people in this family.

180
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,400
Unlike our family,

181
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,440
after we finish the homework,

182
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,560
there's only me in the whole mansion.

183
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,920
Where's your husband?

184
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
He usually goes to the unit to practice.

185
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,360
You should find something.

186
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,880
You should take good care of yourself.

187
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,280
Brother Su.

188
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,400
Do you want to go to the

189
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,360
Qing House in Luo City with me this year?

190
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,840
Look.

191
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
This is not a good time

192
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
for you to stay.

193
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,360
Okay.

194
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,640
Come here when you're done.

195
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,480
Let's drink some wine together.

196
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,600
Then you can take me to play.

197
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm sick

198
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,320
in Langzhou this year.

199
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,800
I'll feel uncomfortable.

200
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,760
Okay.

201
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,960
Xiao Fei Liu.

202
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,680
You're in charge of me this year.

203
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

204
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,600
My Lord.

205
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Where are you going?

206
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,040
It's a few days.

207
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,640
I can go to the Palace to greet my mother.

208
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,440
What?

209
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,320
Can't you go to the Palace

210
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,680
and meet the Imperial Concubine?

211
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,920
I can go to the Palace at any time.

212
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,320
That's the Prince's specialty.

213
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,640
I'm just a Prince.

214
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,600
I'm not that bad.

215
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,400
I don't know how many

216
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,000
of you have fought in the Palace.

217
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,680
You even gave me a chance.

218
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,560
Are you still investigating about Cao Yun?

219
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,400
I'll take my leave.

220
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,360
I found a manga

221
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,200
about the suppress

222
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,040
in Cao with Please.

223
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,800
Do you see it?

224
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,400
I found this

225
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,200
in Cao Yun's gunfire.

226
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,360
Gunfire?

227
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,320
uphold the gather in the Qingyang

228
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,320
But because of other reason,

229
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,880
you said the Crown Prince and the Ministry of Revenue

230
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,480
were trying to get the private room out of the way.

231
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,160
What is all this?

232
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,480
Your Highness, please calm down.

233
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,280
I have some evidence that I haven't checked.

234
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,600
When the investigation is over,

235
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,840
I will cut off the private room.

236
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,920
No more questions!

237
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,640
Your Highness, Prince Jing is here.

238
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,080
Huh?

239
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,980
exchange

240
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:52,900
It'slie

241
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,660
Come on,

242
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,160
Break down the critical information quickly

243
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,300
notions

244
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,400
Alright

245
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,980
Have something to tell you

246
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,200
Right.

247
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,500
I have beenATHING

248
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,240
to you

249
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,200
And staying overnight

250
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,300
Because of all the trouble

251
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,600
Going into the corner

252
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,260
Right.

253
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,500
If you haven't ihnamed me

254
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,400
Why am I here?

255
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,560
What do you think I should do?

256
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,340
You'll squeeze my back

257
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,120
That's not it.

258
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,900
I can go home

259
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,440
I am so do!

260
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,240
It's another kind of brain.

261
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,640
It's a thought in mind.

262
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,480
You can listen to it if you want to.

263
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,640
You're a very smart person.

264
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,240
You should understand the truth

265
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,120
that the loss is too long.

266
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,840
Yes.

267
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,960
I also want to spend more time with you.

268
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,160
I just want you to be more careful.

269
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,040
I'm here to take care of you.

270
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,080
But you've been gambling with someone.

271
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,040
I know

272
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,880
you won't let me lose.

273
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,920
Let's go.

274
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,040
You're sick.

275
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,160
Take it easy now.

276
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,520
Don't worry.

277
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,800
No one sees me.

278
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,560
Mr. Huang,

279
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,440
what happen?

280
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,160
Can't I come for a visit?

281
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,600
But

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,680
there's something nice in thebolt.

283
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,600
Later.

284
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,880
Your Highness.

285
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,560
The Empress suddenly got sick.

286
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,840
I'm sure you're concerned about the cause.

287
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,880
What news did Your Highness get?

288
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,080
The Empress got poisoned by soft grass.

289
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,160
Soft grass?

290
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,160
This kind of grass

291
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,480
helps people to recover from the cold and the cold.

292
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,840
It's easy to recover.

293
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,600
But it can only last for six to seven days.

294
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,080
Why are you so sure?

295
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,560
When the Empress was sick,

296
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,320
my mother was with Consort Zhong

297
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,960
好像 один着

298
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,700
causing spots

299
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,080
to hub against her.

300
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,880
I'm sure

301
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,720
they just makegtz

302
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,220
Lord Yu was at大廁

303
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,800
to search for a woman

304
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
This is the harem's case.

305
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,320
I'll be in a hurry.

306
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Let Prince Yu investigate.

307
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,320
It doesn't matter if we can't find out.

308
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,320
The final result is that the Empress can't attend the ceremony.

309
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
There's nothing.

310
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
When Mr. Su is thinking about something,

311
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,320
will he be able to hold on to something unconsciously?

312
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,320
I often feel like this.

313
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Even if I'm alone,

314
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
my fingers will move.

315
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Many people have this habit.

316
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Yes.

317
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,320
There's someone I know like this.

318
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
I'll be in a hurry.

319
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Everything is arranged.

320
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Don't worry.

321
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Okay.

322
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Thank you for helping me in this big thing.

323
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
After the ceremony,

324
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,320
you'll have to stay away from the world.

325
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
I understand.

326
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,320
Mr. Jiang's gang is out of the air.

327
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,320
There should be some more people to guard.

328
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
You have a point.

329
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,320
The Ministry of Revenue is investigating a case.

330
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,320
I'm afraid it'll be dangerous.

331
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Even the case of the private kitchen has been told by you.

332
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Your relationship is getting better and better.

333
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,320
You know the private kitchen?

334
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Yes.

335
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,320
Mr. Shen is the one who asked me to be his friend.

336
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Of course, I'll keep an eye on him.

337
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
Are these friends worthy of a hand?

338
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
You're right.

339
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
The ones he chose are all smart and smart.

340
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
It's even more pleasant to be friends with them.

341
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
Unfortunately,

342
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
I can't be sincere to them.

343
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
I always feel uncomfortable.

344
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,320
It's not comfortable at all.

345
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
You should bear with it.

346
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
You should bear with it.

347
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
I'll take a good look at them.

348
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
I'll make them some trouble.

349
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
I'll ask you to help them.

350
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
You can also give them some more love.

351
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,320
If there's no true love in love,

352
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,320
what's the use of it?

353
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,320
I think

354
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
the two of us are too close.

355
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
As long as we're together,

356
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
why should they feel bad for us?

357
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
There's a thing that

358
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
a man can only know.

359
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Only a sincere person can't be a man without a hand.

360
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
If it's something like a foe,

361
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,320
it's just sincere and kind.

362
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,320
It's not easy to be honest.

363
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
You're just a little man now.

364
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
You can still be a man.

365
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
Once the Crown Prince and Prince Yu notice you,

366
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
there's no more love.

367
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,320
I understand what you mean.

368
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,320
I've already walked this path.

369
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,320
I'm not that naive.

370
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,320
What you just said is just a man.

371
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
I'm afraid that

372
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,320
I'll be more anxious and not get it.

373
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,320
It's not easy to be honest with a man.

374
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
I have my own way

375
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
to deal with the strategy of the Prince.

376
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Your Highness, you're right.

377
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
I'm a man of wealth.

378
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
Sometimes, I'm more dangerous.

379
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
Sometimes, I'm more important.

380
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
This is to see

381
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,320
when and where you're using it.

382
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
Your Highness, go and see the man in the yard.

383
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
He's Tong Lu.

384
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
He's the one who's responsible for

385
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
the foreign exchange.

386
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,320
I'm not that lucky to have him.

387
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
But his mother left me

388
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
in Langzhou by Jiang Zuo Meng.

389
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,320
I'm the only one who's important to Tong Lu.

390
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
I'm not afraid of anyone.

391
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
This is my sincerity.

392
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
I'm not afraid of anyone.

393
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
I'm not afraid of anyone.

394
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,240
Just leave him

395
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,460
carefully

396
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,320
I'm done with it

397
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
in the answer is check with someone else.

398
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,320
I was just a woman's fierce spirit.

399
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,320
It only blows out trees when I gather,

400
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,780
because I've never

401
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,280
put myself at risk.

402
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
I believe in that.

403
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,320
But do you know that if you treat people like this,

404
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
people will treat you like this.

405
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
You are so smart.

406
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,320
You don't understand this, right?

407
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,320
I understand.

408
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320
But I don't care.

409
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,320
You can use any means to test me and test me.

410
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
I don't care.

411
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Because I know what I am in my heart.

412
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,320
I have never thought about betraying.

413
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,320
Wrong!

414
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
Here!

415
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Here is a chess piece.

416
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
It's wrong down there.

417
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,320
Here!

418
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
You come here.

419
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Here!

420
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,320
You come here.

421
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,320
You can do it.

422
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
You can do it.

423
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,320
I will do it.

424
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,320
I bow to Your Majesty.

425
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,320
You are right.

426
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
You are right.

427
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

428
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,320
You come here.

429
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
I haven't seen you for days.

430
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
Have you lost your weight?

431
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,320
Your Majesty is busy with the court affairs.

432
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,320
Her Highness the Empress is unwell.

433
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
I am incompetent.

434
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,320
I can only pray for you.

435
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
You are thoughtful.

436
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,320
Here.

437
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Come sit here.

438
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

439
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
I am here to see you.

440
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,320
What's the matter?

441
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,320
The year is coming.

442
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,320
Her Highness the Empress is unwell.

443
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
To make the country better,

444
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
I have invited Consort Xu

445
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
to bring the Empress to the memorial.

446
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
She is a gift from the Empress.

447
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Your Majesty, please.

448
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Consort Xu?

449
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,320
Consort Xu?

450
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
Consort Xu?

451
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,320
You and you

452
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,320
are the birth mother of the Crown Prince.

453
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,320
I am the birth mother of the Crown Prince.

454
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,320
But the year is far from Consort Xu.

455
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Besides, Sister Xu has a princess,

456
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
and she is the eldest.

457
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,320
She is here to bring the Empress.

458
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,320
I am very happy.

459
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,320
It's rare that you have such a brother.

460
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
Good.

461
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
This time, the court's judgment

462
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,320
was not only caused by my words,

463
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,320
but also caused Your Majesty to suffer.

464
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,320
Your Majesty, although you did not punish me,

465
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,320
I really can't bear to do it.

466
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
You can stop.

467
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
Jing Huan is too much.

468
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,320
I feel sorry for her.

469
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,320
I can't bear to do it.

470
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,320
I can't bear to do it.

471
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,320
I can't bear to do it.

472
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
I can't bear to do it.

473
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
I am too much.

474
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,320
I am not happy with it.

475
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,320
But the truth is that I am a righteous person.

476
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,320
I can only do it in my own way.

477
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
From now on,

478
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
you should be more careful

479
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,320
in front of the Empress.

480
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
I am sorry.

481
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
The private kitchen has been using the official ship

482
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
to send the firewood to the temple.

483
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
It has been here for a long time.

484
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,320
The firewood that is used every year is fixed.

485
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,320
But this year, there are more firewood.

486
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
But the firewood in the temple

487
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
has not entered the private kitchen.

488
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
And the spirit doesn't know

489
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
that the ghost is gone.

490
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
Maybe...

491
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Maybe what?

492
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Someone else is missing from the firewood.

493
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
That is to say,

494
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,320
there is still a group of firewood hidden in the capital.

495
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
I don't know where it is and what it is useful for.

496
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,320
If we don't make the firewood to be fixed,

497
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
if it is not for the sake of the firewood,

498
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
what is it that we want to do?

499
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,320
The private can use the official ship

500
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
and also know how to use the salt-shrine method

501
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,320
to make the sword-picking arrangement with the private kitchen.

502
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,320
He must not be a normal person in the world.

503
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,320
Is he trying to kill people or destroy something?

504
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
Is there any important occasion

505
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,320
in the capital this year to become his target?

506
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,320
The year is not over yet.

507
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,320
It is from the official ship that Lingnan Manor used.

508
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,320
It is not necessary to stop the journey to the middle of the world.

509
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,320
It seems that the Empress' illness

510
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,320
really has nothing to do with the Noble Consort Yue.

511
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
I'm going to leave the carriage.

512
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Dr. Ye,

513
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,320
I really have something very urgent.

514
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
I must go out.

515
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
Look at how warm I am wearing this.

516
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
Moreover,

517
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,320
Feiliu and Li Gang will follow me.

518
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,320
Don't worry.

519
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,320
Look, the wind and snow have stopped.

520
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
You should be fine.

521
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
I said I would be fine.

522
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
You are just a cold-hearted person,

523
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,320
but your body is different from the normal person.

524
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,320
If you come back with a grudge,

525
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,320
isn't this clearly the sign of my demolition?

526
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,320
Dr. Ye, look at this.

527
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,320
As long as you let me out today,

528
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,320
I will listen to you when I come back.

529
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,320
No.

530
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,320
I said no, but it is no.

531
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,320
What are you doing?

532
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,320
Let me out!

533
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,320
You are not allowed to go!

534
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,320
You are not allowed to go!

535
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,320
You are not allowed to go!

536
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,320
You are not allowed to go!

537
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
Brother Su.

538
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Brother Su.

539
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
Why are you here?

540
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
I have been here for so long.

541
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,320
I have never been to your house to visit.

542
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
I am really sorry.

543
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
Is Dr. Ye here?

544
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
You are here to see my father?

545
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
He came back late today.

546
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
Are you playing the horse game?

547
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,320
Yes.

548
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,320
He has been playing the ball outside the yard.

549
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
Jin Rui, please help me to call Brother Su.

550
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
Okay.

551
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,320
I will go back when I am back.

552
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,320
Why haven't you found him yet?

553
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
Sir, you can't go out.

554
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
Your horse game was hit by a car that was hit by Ye Qing.

555
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
He is looking for you everywhere.

556
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
He is playing the game.

557
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
My horse game is more important.

558
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,320
Is Yu Jing alone at home these days?

559
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
I think so.

560
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,320
I haven't seen Marquis Yan for a while.

561
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
Even if he is in the capital,

562
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
he is always in the coffin.

563
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,320
Brother Su, I am back.

564
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
Is something wrong?

565
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Nothing serious.

566
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,320
I just hit their horse with the car that Ye Qing gave you.

567
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
That's good.

568
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,320
You didn't see the Ye Qing's official

569
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,320
looking so dirty.

570
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,320
He was so mean at first.

571
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
But then he ran away.

572
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
He was not angry at all.

573
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Although Ye Qing is a small country in the country of Daliang,

574
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
he is also the leader of the whole country.

575
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,320
He should choose some people, okay?

576
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,320
What kind of person do you think

577
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
can be a member of the country of Yi?

578
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
I feel that

579
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
the most important thing is that

580
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,320
when the letter was in the letter,

581
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,320
when the tiger's flesh was red,

582
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
it could suppress the whole nation.

583
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
It could really kill the army.

584
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,320
It could even prevent the rule of the country from becoming a military.

585
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,320
It is really bold and bold.

586
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
It is not as good as it is.

587
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,320
You have a good taste in your eyes.

588
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,320
You don't have to envy me.

589
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,320
In fact, in Daliang,

590
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,320
there was once a minister like this.

591
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,320
Really?

592
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,320
Really?

593
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,320
37 years ago,

594
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,320
the three sides of the North and East Sea

595
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,320
were united to fight against Daliang.

596
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,320
The enemy used a five-time army

597
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,320
to suppress the army.

598
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
When the minister was 20 years old,

599
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
he knew that the king was in the middle of the war.

600
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
He was so stubborn.

601
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
He was so brave.

602
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,320
He was so stubborn.

603
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,320
He was so brave.

604
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,320
He was so brave.

605
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,320
The enemy's power was so strong.

606
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,320
He was so weak.

607
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,320
He was so weak.

608
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,320
He was so strong.

609
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,320
The army of the King was so strong.

610
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
He was so strong.

611
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
If you don't mind,

612
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
I will not be as good as you.

613
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,320
How could a person like me

614
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,320
be so brave?

615
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
I don't know anything.

616
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
When I was young,

617
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
I was not mentioned by anyone.

618
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
I was a few years older than you.

619
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
I was also told by my elders

620
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
when I was young.

621
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
37 years ago,

622
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
20 years ago,

623
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,320
I was 57 years old.

624
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,320
Is he still alive?

625
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
If he is alive,

626
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
I really want to see his talent.

627
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
Of course he is alive.

628
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
That person is your father.

629
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
Do you think

630
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,320
that the position of the King

631
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,320
is based on Yan Taishi's son?

632
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,320
With the identity of the King,

633
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,320
he can easily get it?

634
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,320
But my father is now...

635
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,320
He...

636
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,320
He has been a king for 40 years.

637
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,320
He was a person who killed Feng Yun.

638
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,320
It's a pity that the world is not normal.

639
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,320
Now, he can only fight with his husband alone.

640
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,320
Why do you come to my father's room today?

641
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
What is the reason?

642
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
You take the things in.

643
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320
Yes.

644
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,320
Marquis Yan is back.

645
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
Father, you are back.

646
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
Go ahead.

647
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,320
No need to go.

648
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
Father,

649
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,320
I came to visit you

650
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
on the topic of Mr. Su.

651
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,320
I am Su Zhe.

652
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
I have met Marquis Yan.

653
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,320
I am so glad to meet the King,

654
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,320
ask you to talk to him.

655
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,320
My father is the second son of the King.

656
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,320
He just wants me to be with him.

657
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,320
Punish the father.

658
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,320
Pray that he also experienced death like now.

659
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,320
Yeah.

660
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,220
Lord Jiang gel is bothering me.

661
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,760
Mom, go and ask advice.

662
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,740
Little girl, hurry and get up the just genau.

663
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,380
Where's King Ma Tou Dan?

664
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,320
His home.

665
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,780
LiuIGNAN needs a sense of hosting him himself.

666
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,800
岂能受父的观解,

667
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,060
do NederL보请。

668
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,060
What did you say?

669
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,060
Say it!

670
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,060
I won't say it!

671
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,060
I won't say it!

672
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,060
Who did it?

673
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,060
Your Highness.

674
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,060
How is it? Did anyone call?

675
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,060
All the things that can be used in the palace are used.

676
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,060
But they still say they don't know anything.

677
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,060
I think...

678
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,060
What do you think?

679
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,060
The poison that Empress Dowager sent,

680
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,060
maybe it really has nothing to do with them.

681
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,060
It reminds me that this whole thing

682
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:25,060
is indeed not like what happened in the Palace of the Zhao.

683
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,060
I understand. You may leave.

684
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,060
Yes.

685
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,060
It's not the Palace of the Zhao.

686
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,060
Who could it be?

687
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:49,060
You have hidden all the black fire under the roof.

688
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,060
Right?

689
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,060
You can not stand it now.

690
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,060
But I have sent someone to check.

691
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,060
The evidence is very accurate.

692
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,060
The past is a matter of time.

693
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,060
You are so clever.

694
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,060
Aren't you afraid of getting hurt?

695
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,060
The surgery is fixed.

696
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,060
Why bother?

697
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,060
I just want to ask my husband.

698
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,060
We will arrive at the Palace of the Zhao in the future.

699
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,060
You have made up your mind.

700
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,060
Everything will be fine before you appear.

701
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,060
The poison is hidden in the roof.

702
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,060
The ashes are hidden.

703
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,060
As long as His Majesty is with us,

704
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,060
he will be able to throw the imperial edict into the prison.

705
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,060
The entire base will be covered.

706
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,060
Indeed.

707
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,060
When His Majesty was in the prison,

708
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,060
the Empress was about to take over.

709
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,060
Although His Majesty and His Majesty have been together for many years,

710
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,060
they are still very close.

711
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,060
The plan is to make him poisoned.

712
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,060
He cannot take part in the ceremony.

713
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,060
Although he is a serious criminal,

714
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,060
he is my sister.

715
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:35,060
Sir, you are so strange because of his illness.

716
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:39,060
Did you find out about me?

717
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,060
The Empress is unwell.

718
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,060
She is very ill.

719
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,060
The imperial edict I sent to me has made me more anxious.

720
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,060
The edict?

721
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,060
His Lordship won't even go to the Palace for the ceremony.

722
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,060
This time, it was for the anniversary of the execution.

723
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,060
It was specially set up to prevent the execution.

724
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:10,060
Isn't it for the sake of bringing the black fire into the capital?

725
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,060
Your time has been chosen very well.

726
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,060
The black fire of the Ministry of Revenue is reliable.

727
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,060
Even if someone is suspicious,

728
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,060
the spy will surely take the Crown Prince's private room.

729
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,060
Although I have lost my way into the Zhou family,

730
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,060
you still have me.

731
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,060
His Lordship is willing to take the risk of killing the imperial edict.

732
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,060
What exactly does His Majesty want to do?

733
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,060
I want him to die.

734
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,060
What is the big deal?

735
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,060
It is the crime of the imperial edict.

736
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,060
I don't care.

737
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,060
As long as he can die,

738
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,060
I can do anything.

739
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,060
I can bear any crime.

740
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,060
Is it for Consort Chen?

741
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,060
You...

742
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,060
You actually know Consort Chen?

743
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,060
It is a matter of time.

744
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,060
Prince Qi died in a deep grudge.

745
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,060
Consort Chen is still in the Palace.

746
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,060
Although no one is mentioning it now,

747
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,060
after all, it has only been 12 years.

748
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,060
I know what is strange.

749
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,060
12 years.

750
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,060
It has been a long time.

751
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,060
Who else will remember

752
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,060
except me?

753
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,060
Since His Lordship is deeply in love with Consort Chen,

754
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,060
why did you look at her in the Palace at that time?

755
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,060
Because that person is the Emperor of Liang.

756
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,060
He is the Emperor who we risked our lives to help him

757
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,060
become the Emperor of the throne.

758
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,060
I heard that

759
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,060
His Lordship is the eldest son of the Yan State.

760
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:15,060
When he was young,

761
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,060
he used to be the Emperor.

762
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,060
Is that so?

763
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,060
He and I...

764
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,060
We have a great relationship.

765
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,060
And we have a great brother Lin Xie.

766
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,060
We studied together.

767
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,060
We were very close to each other.

768
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:39,060
We shared great peace and security.

769
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:43,060
We once had a marriage.

770
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,060
We were together in a difficult time.

771
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,060
We never met each other in life and death.

772
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,060
But when the Emperor was born,

773
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,060
there was only one son left in this world.

774
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,060
The Emperor of the Yan State.

775
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,060
When he was in the second year of the throne,

776
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,060
he took Yue Yao away from me.

777
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:15,060
Yue Yao was left with Jing Yu.

778
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,060
She was divided into Consort Chen.

779
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,060
I thought...

780
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,060
I could give up.

781
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,060
As long as she was alive in the palace,

782
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,060
but as the Emperor of the Yan State died,

783
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
Yue Yao died.

784
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,060
And Brother Lin Xie was in a difficult time.

785
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,060
If I hadn't...

786
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,060
trained Yuan Dun Hong Chen,

787
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,060
I would have been in the Ninth World.

788
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,060
So you've been drawing a long time.

789
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,060
You just wanted to kill him?

790
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,060
Such a generous Emperor.

791
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,060
He deserves to die?

792
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,060
What happened after he was killed?

793
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,060
The Emperor died.

794
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,060
He left a piece of the evidence.

795
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,060
The Crown Prince and the two internal conflicts

796
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,060
were all over the border.

797
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,060
Who was the most loyal one?

798
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,060
Who was the most loyal one?

799
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,060
The people of Meng Yuan's body

800
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,060
were all scattered around them.

801
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,060
Yishan was in their body.

802
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,060
I hope Yishan is a traitor.

803
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,060
And Yishan is a traitor.

804
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,060
And Consort Chen,

805
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,060
she was a ghost who was killed by the Yan State.

806
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,060
She was innocent and innocent.

807
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,060
You made the Emperor of the Yan State feel so sad.

808
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060
But in the end,

809
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,060
you just killed someone.

810
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,060
I don't know why,

811
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,060
but this is the next time.

812
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:09,060
But look at the chaos in the imperial court.

813
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,060
The whole country

814
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,060
doesn't have the same kind of

815
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,060
as we wanted.

816
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,060
This person

817
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,060
was the one who supported him

818
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,060
to leave the Emperor.

819
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,060
Now, Brother Lin Xie is no longer here.

820
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,060
This situation

821
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,060
should have stopped him from coming here.

822
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,060
My Lord,

823
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,060
you're not here to revenge,

824
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,060
but to thank me.

825
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,060
His Majesty is dead.

826
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,060
Xuanjing Bureau must investigate it.

827
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,060
You're here to kill me.

828
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,060
But have you ever thought about Yu Jing?

829
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,060
Yu Jing?

830
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,060
Yu Jing's mother passed away

831
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,060
after she gave birth to him.

832
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,060
I've never cared about her since I was a child.

833
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,060
It's hard for her.

834
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,060
She's my son.

835
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,060
Maybe this is her fate.

836
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,060
My Lord,

837
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,060
although Yu Jing is not the one you love,

838
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,060
she's your biological son.

839
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,060
Are you really willing

840
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,060
to let her be a pig's face

841
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,060
when she's young?

842
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,060
Yu Jing is a good child.

843
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,060
Maybe

844
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,060
we can't make up for her.

845
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,060
If you're still

846
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,060
guilty of Yu Jing's love for Yu Jing,

847
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,060
you can't go back soon.

848
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,060
Commander.

849
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,060
Is the memorial site ready?

850
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,060
Don't worry, Commander.

851
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,060
The memorial is ready.

852
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,060
The brothers are very careful.

853
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,060
Okay.

854
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,060
I'll go check it out.

855
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,060
Go ahead.

856
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,060
Yes.

857
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,060
Yu Jing.

858
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,060
Yu Jing.

859
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,060
Yu Jing.

860
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,060
Yu Jing.

861
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,060
Yu Jing.

862
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:34,420
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
