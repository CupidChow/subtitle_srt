Episode 1

2
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,720
Even if it's what you look like now,

3
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,120
I feel very good.

4
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,680
Fengge,

5
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,000
in order to spend more time with me,

6
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,040
just bear it, okay?

7
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,000
Mr. Lin,

8
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,360
since Brother Nie has already decided,

9
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,960
let's start the detoxing tomorrow.

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,120
Young Marshal,

11
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,880
the Xiyang Fist is very good.

12
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,760
Can you help him?

13
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,040
The Wolf King knows how to detox.

14
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,440
He doesn't need to be so quick.

15
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,480
Mr. Lin,

16
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,480
don't always fight with Young Marshal.

17
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,040
Young Marshal actually has his own difficulties.

18
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,080
Mei Changsu is your Marshal,

19
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,200
not mine.

20
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Why should I be like you?

21
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,360
I've always helped him

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,200
to help his friend

23
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,520
to get his wish.

24
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,680
I didn't let him come to find himself.

25
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
He said Mei Changsu is your Marshal.

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,920
What do you mean?

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,040
Why do you think I forgive this?

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,960
She is Uncle here.

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,760
What's wrong with her?

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,160
She spent two years in theft for theブリ gr conquest,

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,480
but I couldn't recognize her.

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,520
Wouldn't that make herself

33
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,640
wear skydive?

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,960
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
How can I help you?

36
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,960
This is my only choice.

37
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
I still have a lot of things to do.

38
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,960
I have to have a normal voice and appearance.

39
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Did you ask me to hide somewhere?

40
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,960
Have you ever been a dog?

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
You should have told me.

42
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,960
If I told you,

43
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,960
you wouldn't listen to me.

44
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,960
You have been so kind to me.

45
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
You have been so kind to me.

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
I have to do this.

47
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,960
I always thought

48
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
you were just hiding from the king.

49
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,960
I didn't expect you to hide from me.

50
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
It's better to go to the king.

51
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,960
I don't know anything.

52
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
I'm afraid I can't keep the scene.

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
If he knows that the patient is Brother Nie,

54
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,960
he will be suspicious of me.

55
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,960
I told you long ago.

56
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
Tell him the truth.

57
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
He can't keep the scene.

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,960
He doesn't know that he's Brother Nie.

59
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
But I don't believe it.

60
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
He's not even suspicious.

61
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Are you satisfied?

62
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
I can't tell you now.

63
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Only when his strength is stable enough,

64
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
can he find the chance to get back to the old case.

65
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,960
It's okay if he can't find the chance.

66
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,960
As long as the king gets the chance.

67
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
No.

68
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,960
The case of the eyes can only be re-enacted

69
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,960
when the emperor is in the capital.

70
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
Otherwise, in the future,

71
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,960
the case of the eyes will be re-enacted.

72
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
What's more?

73
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
The relationship between the two of them is so good.

74
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
It's hard to tell who is the king.

75
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
I'm afraid I can't keep the scene.

76
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
I don't know what to do.

77
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
I don't know what to do.

78
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
I don't know what to do.

79
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
I don't know what to do.

80
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
I don't know what to do.

81
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
I don't know what to do.

82
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
I don't know what to do.

83
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
I don't know what to do.

84
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
I don't know what to do.

85
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
I don't know what to do.

86
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
People will feel that there is a risk.

87
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
If everyone wants to be clear,

88
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,960
they must be completely clear.

89
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,960
You are...

90
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
I can't say anything.

91
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,960
I'll go and see Nie Feng.

92
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
Xiao Pi is in the wrong.

93
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
She is in pain.

94
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
When you are in pain and in pain,

95
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
where am I?

96
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Why can't I be with you?

97
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Ni Huang.

98
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,960
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,960
I...

101
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,960
I've been...

102
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,960
You don't have to explain.

103
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
I just want to know

104
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
how long you still have.

105
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,960
I can ignore anything you've done to me.

106
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,960
But you must tell me about this.

107
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Ten years.

108
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,960
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
I'm sorry.

110
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Promise me.

111
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
For ten years,

112
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
don't leave me.

113
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
You've been convinced again.

114
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
But I'm surprised.

115
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
You didn't even have my father with you.

116
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
You even had them with you.

117
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Right?

118
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Lin Chen.

119
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,960
I really don't feel well now.

120
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
How can you say that?

121
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,960
You're awake.

122
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
I'm done.

123
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Why are you so bitter?

124
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
White water.

125
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Am I the only one who's angry with you?

126
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
You're so scary.

127
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
I want you to help me.

128
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
I still need at least one year.

129
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,960
One year?

130
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
If you keep on fighting,

131
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
you'll be a beast for half a year.

132
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
You don't know that?

133
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
I know.

134
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
You know?

135
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
There's no way.

136
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,960
I can only help Jingyan.

137
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,960
But now I don't even know

138
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
when I'll fall.

139
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
You've fallen?

140
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
You'll fall?

141
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
You can't fall again?

142
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Of course not.

143
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Jingyan is a bad temper.

144
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
She's in the palace.

145
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Who will stop her from taking the risk?

146
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
You go.

147
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
I don't know her.

148
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Now she's in a good shape.

149
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Even if she's taken a step or two,

150
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
what's the point?

151
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
The situation now

152
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,960
is far from the best.

153
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
I've been in the court for so many years.

154
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
I can't let myself be the pervert

155
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,960
in the end.

156
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
That's too bad for Jingyan.

157
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
So I must ask you for your help.

158
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Prince Jing is the one who should bear the burden.

159
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
He's not the kind of person

160
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
who can't bear the burden.

161
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
To put it bluntly,

162
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
it's not your own business

163
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,960
to take the risk.

164
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
It's not your responsibility.

165
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
You're just too obsessed with it.

166
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,960
That's why you're so concerned about it.

167
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Of course it's not my own business.

168
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Mei Changsu is not just a leader.

169
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
He's also the hope

170
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,960
of being a man of hope

171
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
with a strong will to be born.

172
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,960
I've finally made it to this step.

173
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
I must wait.

174
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
Wait to see Jingyan get married,

175
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
see the result,

176
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,960
and take over the whole court.

177
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
I must wait for Xie Yu's death

178
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
to pass into the capital.

179
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
I must wait for the fall of Xia Jiang.

180
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,960
I must wait for His Majesty to agree to re-appear.

181
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
What I need most is time.

182
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Don't worry.

183
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
The way Doctor Yan calls it

184
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
is the same as the way I call it in Langya Pavilion.

185
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
I'm here.

186
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,960
I won't let you down.

187
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
I'm planning to take over your business

188
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
and make you a wife.

189
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
How can I let you die so easily?

190
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Xie Yu.

191
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Don't say Xie Yu.

192
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
You can't say Xie Yu.

193
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
How about this?

194
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Give the little consort back to me as a gift.

195
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
No.

196
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
You're so heartless.

197
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
You forgot who picked you up.

198
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
I don't want to.

199
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
Stop.

200
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Stop.

201
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Stop.

202
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
Don't make trouble.

203
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Don't break my ring.

204
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Stop.

205
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Stop.

206
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Stop.

207
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
Stop.

208
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Doctor Yan.

209
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Doctor.

210
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
I'm sorry to make you believe me.

211
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
It doesn't matter who's the boss.

212
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
Just listen to him.

213
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
You're a gift.

214
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Put this secret letter

215
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
in Li He's shelf.

216
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,960
Let your wife send it to the imperial decree.

217
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Then someone will take over the position.

218
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
You don't have to worry about anything.

219
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,960
So you have someone in the palace.

220
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,960
But I don't know if this letter...

221
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,960
I think you've already arranged it.

222
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,960
I won't ask more.

223
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
Minister Fan.

224
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
Don't know anything.

225
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,960
Of course there's less trouble.

226
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
I understand.

227
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
I understand.

228
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
Hurry up.

229
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Madam is waiting.

230
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Hurry up.

231
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
Madam is in a hurry.

232
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
Hurry up.

233
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
I'm sorry.

234
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
Qin.

235
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
What are you doing?

236
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
I've prepared a gift for you.

237
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
It's convenient to go to the warehouse.

238
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
You're looking at the red stone.

239
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Send it over.

240
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Here.

241
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
I'll get it over right away.

242
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,960
I, Li Lin,

243
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
bow to the crown prince.

244
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Why are you here so late?

245
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
I'm afraid that you'll be punished.

246
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
All right. Get up.

247
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Thank you, your highness.

248
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,960
When the army is in trouble,

249
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
there's a problem with the security of the capital.

250
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
You go back and think about it.

251
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
You should go through a plan to

252
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
change the defense and the army.

253
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Send it to me in twenty days.

254
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Do you understand?

255
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
I understand.

256
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
I obey the crown prince's order.

257
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Get out.

258
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Anything else?

259
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
I'm fine.

260
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
I'll take my leave.

261
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Your highness.

262
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Your highness.

263
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Why are you so pale?

264
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
You were punished by the crown prince again

265
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
for doing something wrong.

266
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
His highness didn't do anything wrong.

267
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
He only did the job.

268
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Your highness.

269
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,960
We've been together for years.

270
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
I've said a few words.

271
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Now, the crown prince

272
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
is not the crown prince.

273
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Don't think about

274
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
what he means to deal with you.

275
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Since you've done your job,

276
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
you should do your best.

277
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
If you think about it,

278
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,960
you'll find your own fault.

279
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
I'll take my leave.

280
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
I'll take my leave.

281
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
Qin'er.

282
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Did you take anything?

283
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
I didn't, Xiao Juan.

284
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
I saw it in person

285
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
what you took from the box.

286
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
It's a serious crime to be in the palace.

287
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
We've been together for a long time.

288
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
I haven't told your highness yet.

289
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
Give it back.

290
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Qin'er.

291
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Did you hear what I said?

292
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Just like you said.

293
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
I'm sorry.

296
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
I'm sorry.

297
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Xiao Juan.

298
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Let's have a fight.

299
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
If you can't see it,

300
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
that's great.

301
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Qin'er.

302
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Qin'er.

303
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
Chuiazi Sect.

304
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,460
As expected,

305
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,960
I'm determine who you really think you are.

306
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,860
Go on, my elegant husband.

307
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,600
Don't forget to tell me the fun of which

308
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,760
I am a lot prettier than most beautiful women.

309
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,060
Don't lie to me if you're trying to be happy.

310
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,100
I am blessed.

311
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,240
Your Majesty, I've just seen the letter Sharperię.

312
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,820
I thought this away with38 birthday.

313
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:31,280
Your

314
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:40,480
son

315
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,480
I didn't tell him how many times he needs to do it.

316
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
What's his hurry?

317
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,480
It's not an important job.

318
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,480
It's a matter of time.

319
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,480
I'm giving him a solution to the problem of the general phoenix.

320
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,480
Solution of the general phoenix?

321
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,480
They are both royal and ordinary.

322
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
They are both different.

323
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,480
The phoenix of the royal family can't be used as the old method.

324
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
I've always wanted to change it.

325
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,480
But it seems that it's all old.

326
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,480
It's hard to understand.

327
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,480
This time, I, as the crown prince,

328
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,480
officially went to the court to make him go to the court

329
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,480
to make him go to the court to take the blame.

330
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,480
No wonder he hasn't left the palace yet.

331
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,480
He's in a hurry to ask the emperor and Marquis Yan to go to the Eastern Palace.

332
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Really?

333
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,480
That's good.

334
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,480
This year, the country has grown up.

335
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,480
The more you work, the better you will be.

336
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Do you know that these two people are very popular in the imperial family?

337
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,480
If you help him with the solution,

338
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,480
this will naturally be a good thing for the people.

339
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Good.

340
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,480
You said that you have important news to tell me.

341
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
You want me to withdraw from the left?

342
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,480
Just to let me pass the news to Xia Jiang?

343
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,480
Yes.

344
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,480
You're so bold.

345
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,480
Xia Jiang is now a criminal in the imperial court.

346
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,480
He has nothing to do with me.

347
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,480
You came to me at this time to make me bury him?

348
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:50,480
What's the good thing about letting you bury him?

349
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
Your Highness, you were a good servant at the time.

350
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,480
You almost did everything with the empress.

351
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
You're so insensitive.

352
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Are you willing to keep a maid?

353
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Prince Yu is dead now.

354
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,480
Prince Ning and Prince Huai are not good enough.

355
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Once Xiao Jing is gone, who will His Majesty think of?

356
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,480
His Majesty was the prince of the prime minister.

357
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,480
But now, the palace is in a state of chaos.

358
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,480
I'm not stupid.

359
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,480
I won't be too hasty.

360
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,480
What if the subordinate is sent to you by a iron hammer?

361
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
Your Highness, take a look first.

362
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,480
What does this letter say?

363
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

364
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,480
I'm sorry.

365
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,480
I'm sorry.

366
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,480
I'm sorry.

367
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
I'm sorry.

368
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
I'm sorry.

369
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,480
I'm sorry.

370
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,480
I'm sorry.

371
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
I'm sorry.

372
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
I'm sorry.

373
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,480
I'm sorry.

375
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
I'm sorry.

376
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,480
I'm sorry.

377
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,480
General Nie, take off your clothes.

378
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
We're going to start.

379
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,480
Dong Jie, let's go out first.

380
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
I won't let you down.

381
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
I'm sorry.

382
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
Your Highness, you've been sick for a while.

383
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,480
You didn't dare to bother His Majesty.

384
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
You were very ill.

385
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
You were suddenly in a state of chaos.

386
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
You couldn't even swallow the water.

387
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
You didn't stop thinking about His Majesty.

388
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
You... you... you were with His Highness.

389
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Now His Highness is far away in the county.

390
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
I'm begging Your Highness.

391
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
Please go and see Your Highness.

392
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
What's wrong with Consort Xian?

393
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Why is she sick?

394
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,480
I should go and see her.

395
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,480
Yes.

396
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,480
Your Majesty, please get off.

397
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
It seems that everything went well.

398
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
You don't have to worry.

399
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,480
How did you know that everything went well?

400
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
My expression is very heavy.

401
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,480
If it didn't go well, you would have jumped out of the window.

402
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,480
You would have had to come out of the door.

403
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,480
You're not going to say anything if you see it.

404
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
You're not going to.

405
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,480
You've been sick for seven times today.

406
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
You're not feeling well.

407
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,480
You can walk in the bed in a few days.

408
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,480
After a month of rest, you've been feeling better.

409
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

410
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Even if it's a thank you, it's not a thank you.

411
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Don't worry. You can go in first.

412
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
Tian Lang,

413
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,480
it's been a long time since you've had a meal.

414
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,480
The risk is too high.

415
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,480
It's not like you.

416
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,480
You're very cautious.

417
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,480
It's like your style.

418
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,480
You know me.

419
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
You're right.

420
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,480
It's not a good idea to come out too late.

421
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
When Brother Meng comes tomorrow,

422
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
send him back.

423
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Okay, now you're the only one who's cured.

424
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
It's your turn tomorrow.

425
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Are you ready?

426
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
I said no.

427
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,480
I don't care if you're ready.

428
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
I'm starting anyway.

429
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
I believe in you.

430
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
I also believe in myself.

431
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,480
The Old Chief always has a steady temper.

432
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Who's your temperament?

433
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,480
Of course, the old man has to be patient before you.

434
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
If he really is stable,

435
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Lord Lingzun was so strong back then.

436
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,480
How could he have made friends with him for the rest of his life?

437
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,480
You're right.

438
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
The wedding date is fixed.

439
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,480
You're always at home.

440
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,480
I'm sure you have a lot of fear in your heart.

441
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,480
I asked you to come today.

442
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,480
I want to comfort you.

443
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Don't be so anxious.

444
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
Thank you for your love.

445
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
Jingyan is often at the battlefield.

446
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,480
She has a temperament.

447
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,480
She's been saying that

448
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
most of the time,

449
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,480
she's not a gentle person.

450
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,480
You must have heard of her.

451
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Don't worry.

452
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,480
Jingyan is a good person.

453
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,480
She will never be harsh on you.

454
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Your Highness.

455
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,480
His Majesty has gone to the Palace of the Sunset Hall to look for someone.

456
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Consort Xian is sick.

457
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,480
His Majesty should go and visit her.

458
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,480
I just got this.

459
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,480
I can accompany my future daughter-in-law.

460
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,480
But you've been sick for three times today.

461
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,480
And the weather is getting worse.

462
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,480
It's not a test.

463
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,480
Lingchen.

464
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,480
I know what you're trying to say.

465
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,480
So you don't have to say anything.

466
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
From now on,

467
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
except for your anger,

468
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
you must listen to me.

469
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Even if the wall outside is full of trouble,

470
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,480
you must not look at me.

471
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,480
Do you understand?

472
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,480
His Majesty has arrived.

473
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,480
Lingchen.

474
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,480
Your Majesty.

475
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
I was a dead man.

476
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,480
I didn't expect to see you again before I died.

477
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,480
What are you talking about?

478
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,480
You're sick.

479
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,480
Why do you say such things?

480
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Your Highness is so careless.

481
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Why are you so cold?

482
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,480
His Majesty is famous.

483
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
Consort Xian is not cold.

484
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
She was sick.

485
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
How dare you!

486
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,480
The palace is now under the control of the Noble Consort.

487
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,480
What are you scared of?

488
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Your Majesty is right.

489
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,480
I'm just a cold.

490
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,480
I'm just a cold.

491
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Don't fool me.

492
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,480
Just tell me what you want to say.

493
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
I...

494
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,480
I was a dead man.

495
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
I didn't dare to bully you.

496
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,480
I was just afraid that I would be punished.

497
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
Xing Chenxing.

498
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,480
You're innocent.

499
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
Tell me.

500
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
His Majesty knows that

501
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,480
when Prince Xian was still in the Eastern Palace,

502
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,480
I came to the court to help him.

503
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
I know.

504
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,480
After Prince Xian passed away,

505
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,480
I broke my connection.

506
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
I was so confident in the palace

507
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,480
that I was the most guilty one for him.

508
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,480
But then,

509
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,480
a few days later,

510
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,480
a secret letter came from the palace.

511
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,480
It was a letter from the emperor.

512
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,480
What secret letter?

513
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
Did you take him to bed?

514
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
The Commander of the Alliance has arranged a lot.

515
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,480
I'll go back to the prison in a few days.

516
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
Don't worry.

517
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,480
We'll take good care of him.

518
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Actually, I've been thinking about it all the time.

519
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
Dongjie,

520
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
don't say anything.

521
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,480
No matter what,

522
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
you're back.

523
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
I'm really happy for you.

524
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Dongjie,

525
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,480
you're Nihuang's best friend.

526
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,480
If one day,

527
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,480
he can meet someone again,

528
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
can you help me persuade him?

529
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Uncle, you...

530
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,480
Actually, my health is not so good.

531
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
Even if Ling Chen is with me,

532
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,480
my life is not long.

533
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,480
Although I've never changed my heart for Nihuang,

534
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
I can't fight him anymore.

535
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
I can't tell him these words.

536
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,480
I'm afraid he won't accept it.

537
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
It's always been a long time.

538
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
It's hard to understand.

539
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
You understand.

540
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,480
I'm not afraid of him.

541
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
I'm afraid of him.

542
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
I'm afraid of him.

543
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480
You understand.

544
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
Dongjie,

545
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
you're his wife.

546
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,480
You should be happier than anyone else.

547
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
After I leave,

548
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,480
I'll give you Nihuang's gift.

549
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,480
Can I?

550
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
I'm sorry.

551
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,480
Although His Majesty is not coming to the court today,

552
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
he can't do anything.

553
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,480
He can give it to the Inner Palace or the Inner Palace.

554
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,480
No matter what,

555
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,480
I shouldn't be involved in the imperial court.

556
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,480
You're wise enough to have such an idea.

557
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
According to the palace rules,

558
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,480
I'm going to give it to the person who gave it to me

559
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,480
and the letter to the imperial concubine.

560
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,480
She will deal with it.

561
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,480
I...

562
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,480
I shouldn't have done it.

563
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,480
I was so anxious that I took it out on Miha.

564
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
But in the future,

565
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
I can't eat or sleep.

566
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
I was sick that night.

567
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,480
I didn't want to give it to His Majesty.

568
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,480
I didn't want to give it to the imperial concubine.

569
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
I...

570
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,480
I don't know what to do.

571
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,480
I'm so sorry.

572
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,480
What on earth did that secret letter do?

573
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,480
I'm sorry.

574
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,480
This is the lily soup.

575
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,480
It's the best when you're in the cold.

576
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

577
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
I've heard that you're very good at it.

578
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
Listen to me.

579
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,480
When His Majesty returns to the Yangju Palace,

580
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,480
I'll send you a bowl of it.

581
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
Yes.

582
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,480
I'll send you a bowl of it when you return to the Yangju Palace.

583
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
Yes.

584
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,480
Yes.

585
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Do you like Nansu?

586
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,480
Yes.

587
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,400
I've been so fond of it

588
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,820
Xia Jiang is greedy, bossy,

589
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,780
arrogant, and I'm just a scary suspect

590
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,280
Just out a few beamed

591
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,460
How can you be like this?

592
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,740
You're right

593
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,740
I shouldn't have been so sure.

594
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,740
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

595
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,740
I'll destroy it.

596
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,740
I won't mention it.

597
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,740
Don't be so sad.

598
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,740
What did you write?

599
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,740
You dare not give it to Noble Consort?

600
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,740
I dare not say it.

601
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,740
I order you to say it.

602
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,740
Say it.

603
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,740
The oral saying says

604
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,740
that Mei Chaosu

605
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,740
is not only the one who saved the King of Qi.

606
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,740
She is also the one who escaped from the imperial guards.

607
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,740
What did you say?

608
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,740
She...

609
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,740
is the one who saved the King of Qi.

610
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,740
How is it?

611
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,740
I feel much better.

612
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,740
You really are a mysterious hand.

613
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,740
I didn't hear it right.

614
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,740
Are you praising me?

615
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,740
It's really a good thing that people die in the end.

616
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,740
I have already sent the letter to the people.

617
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,740
I'm sorry that she doesn't know anything.

618
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,740
It's just a form of fate.

619
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,740
Your Majesty, if you think this oral saying is fake,

620
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,740
I'll immediately hand it over to Noble Consort.

621
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,740
This oral saying

622
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,740
wasn't written in the prison.

623
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,740
The book of Lian is dead.

624
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,740
I'm sure that Xia Jiang

625
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,740
was the one who saved the King of Qi.

626
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,740
You're right.

627
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,740
Maybe Xia Jiang

628
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,740
is trying to get His Majesty and the Crown Prince's attention.

629
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,740
That oral saying

630
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,740
sounds like it's fake.

631
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,740
Maybe it's because Xia Jiang made it.

632
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,740
Even if Xia Jiang

633
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,740
had the Heavens' hand,

634
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,740
the old records in the Imperial Library

635
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,740
couldn't be made and changed.

636
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,740
Your Majesty, you mean...

637
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,740
Gao Zhan, here.

638
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,740
Summon the Imperial Academy

639
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,740
and summon all the books that are not.

640
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,740
I want to see

641
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,740
what's going on.

642
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,740
I want to see what's going on.

643
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,740
Yes.

644
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,740
Where's the oral saying

645
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,740
of the Emperor Xia Jiang?

646
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,740
You...

647
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,740
Your Majesty, you want to see him?

648
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,740
I don't want to see him.

649
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,740
Since he can send the message,

650
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,740
he'll know how to contact Xia Jiang.

651
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,740
Let him send a message to Xia Jiang.

652
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,740
Tell him that I'm giving him the chance to be punished.

653
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,740
As long as he's in control of the royal family,

654
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:51,740
I can take all the crimes of Xuanjing Bureau.

655
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,740
I can do it.

656
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,740
But...

657
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,740
I don't dare to...

658
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,740
You only care about the message.

659
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,740
You can send the message to Xia Jiang

660
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,740
if you dare to enter the palace.

661
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,740
Yes.

662
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,740
After sending the message,

663
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,740
burn it down.

664
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,740
Don't come here again.

665
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,740
What?

666
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,740
Lord Shouzun didn't convince His Majesty?

667
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,740
If His Majesty trusts me,

668
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,740
it's the day of Xuanjing Bureau's rebirth.

669
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,740
You can't tell him that

670
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,740
he's in control of the royal family.

671
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,740
It's the day of Xuanjing Bureau's rebirth.

672
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,740
If there's a change of fate,

673
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,740
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble.

674
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,740
Your Majesty.

675
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,740
Even if I go back to Nanhui,

676
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,740
I won't let them succeed.

677
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,740
You can tell me

678
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:11,740
that all the people in the capital

679
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,740
are in a state of emergency.

680
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,740
No matter how much they're in the palace,

681
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,740
they'll be in a state of chaos.

682
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,740
I've watched over those people.

683
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,740
They'll have to pay for their lives.

684
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,740
I'll kill them all.

685
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,740
I'll kill them all.

686
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,740
I'll kill them all.

687
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,740
I'll kill them all.
