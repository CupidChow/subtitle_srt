00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Xia Dong,

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
since I was a child,

4
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
in your west,

5
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I heard your teachings,

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and did things for you,

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and you are as rich as a father.

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But,

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
when you were about to ignite the fire,

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you wouldn't care about

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
where he was.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You wouldn't care at all.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Maybe he was standing at the door at this moment.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Master,

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Master.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
How many lives did he have?

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You are the future heir to the Xuanjing Bureau.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You are the heir to the family.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Xia Dong was sentenced to death.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He was not alive

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
when he was in the Iron Law of the Royal Family.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Master,

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
you promised him...

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I promised him I would spare him.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If he is dead this time,

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I will not pursue him again.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I will use him.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I will use him again.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If I can't use him,

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I will destroy him.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's a pity

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
that Xia Dong was at your door.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He couldn't see your true face in time.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He was a teacher,

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and he was a traitor.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How could I be merciful to him?

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I have always been clear

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
about the way you treat me.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will never forgive you.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I have always been clear about it.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It seems that

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
you can't save Wei Zheng this time.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Marquis Yan is still so calm at this time.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's not because you are in charge of the Xuanjing Bureau,

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
whether it's a life or death,

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
you can't get involved directly with me?

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Prince Jing didn't participate directly.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How do you want to do this Iron Law?

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Before the fire lightning,

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
it was really useless.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
After the fire lightning,

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
please think about it.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Blood is in it,

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
it's not in it,

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
it's in there.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's in there.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It can be spread out very soon.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There are so many people

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
who are in charge of the Xuanjing Bureau.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
They are all the new leaders of Prince Jing.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Can they bear to

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
watch me with their eyes open?

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
As soon as the fire lightning comes,

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
my men can attract them

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
into the door.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Everything is difficult.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Once you get involved,

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
the people who are involved will be more and more.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Of course, things will get bigger and bigger.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Prince Jing never wants to be involved in the business,

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
and I will never

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
give him any chance to attack me.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't go.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Listen to me.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You haven't been out yet?

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Get ready, brothers.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What's wrong, Marquis Yan?

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You are a little bit worried.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You are a little bit worried?

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Did Prince Jing tell you

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
how he is going to

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
get himself into trouble once he fails?

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I have never been involved in Prince Jing.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't believe

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
he will do anything illegal.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Brother Xia.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't be disappointed

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
with me.

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I will do anything illegal.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I will do anything illegal.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Brother Xia.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't be disappointed with me.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I will do anything illegal.

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't be disappointed with me.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The temple in the mountain

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
is much cleaner than the city.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
There is no such thing here.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's a pity.

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I am destined

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
to not see such a wonderful scene.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There are many scenes

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
that are more wonderful than this.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yan Que.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I will advise you

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
on the fate of my old friend.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You have already chosen

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
to fail once.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Do you want to fail again?

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Failure is only in your heart.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You think I am wrong.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't usually think you are wrong.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Xia Qing.

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You can not believe in love.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But you should not be in love.

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Otherwise

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
you will be defeated by him.

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yan Xiong.

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You are only old.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You can still say such a naive thing.

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Actually, you are the ones

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
who were defeated by love.

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You have originally won the game

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
but you gave up on yourself.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It was like this back then.

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Now it's still like this.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What are you doing, my lord?

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I am leaving.

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I will stay with you for a while.

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I can't stand it anymore.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Master.

134
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Master.

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yan He is really leaving?

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He is not in the palace.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't you think

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
he is strange in the end?

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's right.

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He is the one who is in the palace.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Do you think

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
he is strange in the end?

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No.

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He is strange in the end.

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
In the end?

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
In the end

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
he said he could leave?

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He is not ready to leave.

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He is not going to leave.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He can leave.

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Is he not allowed to leave

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
before this?

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Why can't he leave?

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The main purpose of Yan He today

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
is to distract him from the city.

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Report.

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Master,

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
the horse is gone.

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What should we do?

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Let's go.

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The signal is hidden.

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If we go back to the city,

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Xia Jiang will definitely take our horse.

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I can't defeat him.

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You are still in the mood.

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
People are busy on the way.

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And they are in the age.

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Xia Jiang is afraid

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
he will run to the city gate

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and take a horse.

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Even if he is behind the gate,

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
he will have to carry it along the way.

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't know what's going on

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
before Xuan Jin Temple.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Don't tell me.

176
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't tell me.

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Master Kang, I didn't see you.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Master Kang, what should we do now?

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You didn't catch the leader.

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The people in the camp are gone.

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We can't chase them.

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Where should we chase them?

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You ask me.

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I will ask the immortal.

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Go.

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Master.

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Master.

188
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What's going on?

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Why is it so quiet?

190
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Where is he?

191
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Master,

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
the situation is different from what we expected.

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's completely different.

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Master,

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
after those rebels

196
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
went through the front yard,

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
they just attacked the gate of the dungeon.

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
They didn't try to rush in.

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
They started to attack the outside.

200
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We see

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
that if the fire lightning can't blow them,

202
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
you won't have any chance.

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You can catch a few firecrackers.

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Who would want them to...

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
They are cleaning the medicine powder,

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
putting poison smoke,

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and making the whole passage.

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We can't see anything.

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I can't stop them.

210
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Let them rush out.

211
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If they do,

212
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
you won't chase them.

213
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
We are not going to let them go.

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But when we went out,

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
the people in the camp

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
actually came out.

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They said they would catch some bandits.

218
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
They were in a mess.

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Then...

220
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Then it was like this.

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Master,

222
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
the fire lightning is so big,

223
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
why is it so small?

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Why is the fire lightning so small?

225
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The Prince of Jing

226
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
won't be a fool.

227
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Could it be...

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Could it be that Yan Qu and I

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
went out of the city

230
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
to do something better?

231
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I was afraid that I would

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
break the barrier

233
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
that they had set up.

234
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Barrier?

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Master, you mean

236
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
the real purpose of the Prince of Jing

237
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
is not to attack Xuanjing Temple?

238
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's not true.

239
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But, sir,

240
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
when those bandits

241
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
rushed in,

242
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
the fire lightning

243
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
was really big.

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The bigger the fire lightning,

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
the more it can attract

246
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
our attention.

247
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And the ultimate purpose

248
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
is to cover

249
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
their real actions.

250
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Real actions?

251
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Master,

252
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hu Miao,

253
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
did Prince of Jing

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
already find

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
the real brother of the Guanyang Wei?

256
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Master,

257
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
you are...

258
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Master.

259
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Master.

260
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Master.

261
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Master.

262
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Master.

263
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Master.

264
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Master.

265
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm too stupid.

266
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm too stupid.

267
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Lord Xia!

268
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Thank you for your help!

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Master!

270
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Hurry up and go.

271
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
All the monsters are in the house.

272
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes!

273
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Go!

274
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Save him!

275
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Go!

276
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Good boy, you go first.

277
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'll come back to save you.

278
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Come back!

279
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Go!

280
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Master!

281
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Good boy!

282
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Go!

283
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I want to play with you.

284
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I forgot who you were with.

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Hurry up and go!

286
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Master!

287
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Master!

288
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Master!

289
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Master!

290
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Don't worry.

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'll take someone to chase him.

292
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You captured the evil Xun Fang Ying.

293
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
How can you chase him?

294
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Then watch this.

295
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Why did they save him?

296
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
We didn't expect them to succeed.

297
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But no matter how Prince Jing did it,

298
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
it wasn't a ending.

299
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It was a start.

300
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Master!

301
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Master!

302
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
How is it?

303
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Your Highness.

304
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Master, we've got the hand.

305
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Did Wei Zheng save him?

306
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
He did.

307
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He's already saved him.

308
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Where did he get Wei Zheng?

309
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's a place we didn't expect.

310
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The prison of Dali Temple.

311
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The case of Dali Temple is in charge of the case.

312
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
There's no punishment for interrogation.

313
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The prisoners are usually locked in the prison.

314
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Only when they're in the prison can they be released.

315
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So I'm even a tiger.

316
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Actually, there's a prison in the prison of Dali Temple.

317
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Xia Jiang chose a good place.

318
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
No one would have thought of it.

319
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Luckily, he took us there.

320
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Marquis Yan's intention

321
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
will make Xia Jiang's life better.

322
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
If he can't see Wei Zheng,

323
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
he won't be relieved.

324
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Mr. Su, you're so amazing.

325
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Your Highness.

326
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You should prepare for the next trial.

327
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll do it.

328
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Are you ready?

329
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Next.

330
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's my battlefield.

331
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What battlefield?

332
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
General Lie, you think

333
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Xia Jiang has suffered so much.

334
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Where will he go next?

335
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He'll definitely get into trouble in front of His Majesty.

336
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
How will you deal with him?

337
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's not Xia Jiang's fault.

338
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's a big deal.

339
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Your Majesty.

340
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
When the Emperor of the Immortals finished his military service,

341
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
the water was falling.

342
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
At the beginning,

343
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
there was a son of Liang An in the world.

344
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The whole court called him Xiang Rui.

345
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The Empress really knows the war in the north.

346
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The world is safe.

347
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I think

348
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
it's because of the son of Liang Sheng

349
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
and the son of Sheng Shi Liang An.

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's because of the son of Liang Sheng.

351
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
His Majesty is responsible for it.

352
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yes.

353
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Father is a good man.

354
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He's a good man.

355
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
He's a good man.

356
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't know if the Emperor of the Immortals is right.

357
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Since Xiang Rui is out,

358
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
he knows the fate.

359
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Why not follow the God's will

360
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and enter the Feng San?

361
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What do you think?

362
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You're so lucky.

363
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Feng San

364
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
can easily form

365
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
the holy points of his own.

366
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Look.

367
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Zhong Ai Qing asked you

368
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
how to answer him.

369
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm thinking about it.

370
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll say it.

371
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
How can I live so much?

372
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's hard to get it.

373
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Jing Huan.

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Ask him to marry Zitan

375
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
and live a good life.

376
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Put it in the Red Light Pavilion.

377
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yes.

378
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Then you can leave.

379
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yes.

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I understand

381
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
what Mr. Su means.

382
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
He used his power to break into Xuanjing Temple

383
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and enter the Great Lixi Festival.

384
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
As long as you tell him the truth,

385
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
he'll be satisfied.

386
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Moreover,

387
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Xia Jiang will tell him personally.

388
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You understand.

389
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's the best.

390
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's my own decision.

391
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I know what the consequences will be.

392
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But I've never thought about it.

393
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But

394
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I might be in trouble

395
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
and apologize.

396
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's still early.

397
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We were in a position to avoid defeat.

398
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But now

399
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
we've successfully saved Wei Zheng.

400
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And Xia Jiang doesn't have any evidence.

401
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's a big loss.

402
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I understand.

403
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Although the operation was successful,

404
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
there are still many failures.

405
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Especially the cooperation between the patrols

406
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and the external guards

407
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
will be taken away by Xia Jiang.

408
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
His Majesty trusts Xia Jiang so much.

409
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But he said

410
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
he would be upset.

411
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Moreover,

412
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
my suspicion is the most important.

413
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's a difficult situation.

414
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
In front of His Majesty,

415
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
it's okay to be disobeyed.

416
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's not a dead end.

417
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Xia Jiang is innocent.

418
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Even if His Majesty trusts him,

419
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
it's hard to be suspicious.

420
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Mr. Su,

421
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
His Majesty is not a good person.

422
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Will he be killed

423
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
by Xia Jiang and Prince Yu?

424
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
He's not innocent.

425
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So you must remember.

426
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
No matter how I'm in trouble,

427
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I must take care of it.

428
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It has nothing to do with you.

429
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
From now on,

430
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Wei Zheng has me to take care of him.

431
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
His Majesty and he

432
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
have nothing to do with each other.

433
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Can you do it?

434
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yes.

435
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Your Majesty,

436
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'd like to see Xia Jiang.

437
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Let him in.

438
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yes.

439
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Xia Jiang is really a good person.

440
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You can see

441
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
the real Xia Jiang soon.

442
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Now,

443
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
go to Hong Guang Pavilion.

444
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm sure you won't be so anxious.

445
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Of course.

446
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Your Majesty.

447
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Do you have any doubts?

448
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I have a question.

449
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I've never thought about it.

450
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Actually,

451
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Xia Jiang will only

452
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
take Wei Zheng to the dungeon

453
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
and send him to the hospital.

454
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Unless he's a rebel,

455
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
we can't get involved.

456
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Why does he have to

457
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
suffer so much?

458
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Because Xia Jiang's purpose

459
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
is not Wei Zheng.

460
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
He wants to take you in.

461
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Although Xia Jiang knows

462
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
you won't be

463
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
a rebel,

464
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
but as for

465
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
how much sacrifice

466
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
you can make

467
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
for Wei Zheng,

468
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
he's not sure.

469
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Really?

470
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
He's really thoughtful.

471
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Actually,

472
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I have no idea

473
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
how to deal with him.

474
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But once he's done with it,

475
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
he'll be in trouble.

476
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Even if he's in danger,

477
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I can find a solution.

478
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm afraid

479
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
he won't take it.

480
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Your Highness,

481
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
you've made up your mind

482
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
to handle everything.

483
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm very relieved.

484
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But I'll be

485
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
in contact with Consort Jing

486
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and hope that

487
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
you won't move.

488
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Mother and I

489
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
have discussed it before.

490
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
His firmness is on my side.

491
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Don't worry, Mr. Qin.

492
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's good.

493
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And...

494
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What else?

495
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Nothing.

496
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
We'll talk about it later.

497
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Your Majesty,

498
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm here to punish you.

499
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Qin.

500
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I can't do it.

501
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Today, Xuanjing Temple,

502
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Dali Temple,

503
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Xiangji Temple,

504
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
was attacked by bandits.

505
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm not in the palace.

506
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That Chiyu Ying,

507
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and Wei Zheng,

508
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
were taken away by them.

509
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What did you say?

510
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Wei Zheng,

511
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and Wei Zheng,

512
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
were taken away by them.

513
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
What?

514
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
They were taken away?

515
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
They...

516
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
They were taken away?

517
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Mr. Xia,

518
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
tell me clearly.

519
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Someone tried to arrest Nifan,

520
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
but failed.

521
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Or was it really...

522
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
They were taken away.

523
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
How could it be?

524
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Someone broke into Xuanjing Temple

525
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and robbed Nifan.

526
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Isn't this

527
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
a rebellion?

528
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Your Majesty,

529
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
where did the bandits come from?

530
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
How dare you

531
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
make such a big mess?

532
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Who?

533
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The bandits were killed by the bandits.

534
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I...

535
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I have a few words in my heart.

536
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But I dare not

537
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
to say it for ten days.

538
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You...

539
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You have a few words in your heart.

540
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Tell me.

541
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Tell me.

542
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Who is it?

543
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Who?

544
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Your Majesty,

545
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
after Wei Zheng was taken away by me,

546
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
who was to pay for his love?

547
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Of course, you know it.

548
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And when the bandits were taken away by the bandits,

549
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
when the bandits were to be executed,

550
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
the patrol force was to take over the whole street,

551
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
but they didn't help me.

552
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Instead, they used the justice of the justice,

553
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
to make trouble,

554
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
to release the bandits.

555
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
They stopped me from going to Xuanjing Temple

556
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
to help me.

557
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I couldn't catch up with them.

558
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
No way.

559
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Jingyan is usually a little bit ignorant,

560
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
but he doesn't dare to do that.

561
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
The robberies are a big crime.

562
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Besides, Wei Zheng is not a common robber.

563
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Jingyan is crazy, isn't he?

564
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Your Majesty.

565
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Your Majesty, take care.

566
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Go.

567
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Father.

568
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Go.

569
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Call Prince Jing.

570
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Your Majesty.

571
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Go.

572
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Go.

573
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Go.

574
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Father, you need to be careful.

575
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Don't be angry.

576
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Jingyan must be confused all the time.

577
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You go first.

578
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Father.

579
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Hello, Sister Qi Huang.

580
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
What's the matter?

581
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Your Highness ordered me to tell Your Highness the story.

582
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's time to go.

583
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I see.

584
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Your Highness.

585
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Your Highness.

586
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I don't think this place is too quiet.

587
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Here.

588
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You're right.

589
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
There are some sounds here.

590
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I heard them.

591
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I heard them.

592
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
There are some sounds here.

593
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Otherwise, I'll change it like this.

594
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's so beautiful.

595
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You're a great woman.

596
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Your Highness, thank you for your compliment.

597
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's a pleasure to meet you.

598
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Thank you, Miss Gong.

599
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
We've been talking for an hour.

600
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm hungry.

601
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Go and get some food.

602
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'm sorry.

603
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Please wait.

604
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
This place is too quiet.

605
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's really wronged by Miss Gong.

606
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
No one even takes care of her.

607
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
She has to do it herself.

608
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Send some people over

609
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
and let them serve Miss Gong.

610
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Okay.

611
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I'll go and get some food.

612
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I'll go and get some food.

613
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I'll go and get some food.

614
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'll go and get some food.

615
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'll go and get some food.

616
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'll go and get some food.

617
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Okay.

618
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

619
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It's quiet here.

620
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
And I don't feel wronged.

621
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
If you don't want to live in my house,

622
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
you can also live in a more comfortable place.

623
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's too quiet here.

624
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
And it's not good to smell.

625
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's not suitable for you to live in.

626
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Maybe you're bored.

627
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I'll open the window

628
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
and let you breathe.

629
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Okay.

630
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It's delicious.

631
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
What's wrong?

632
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Isn't that Miss Gong?

633
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Why does she appear in this kind of

634
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
low profile?

635
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Let me find out.

636
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Miss Gong is taking the food again.

637
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's spring and noon today.

638
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Miss Gong is coming down from the valley so soon?

639
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Ma Cheng hasn't come yet.

640
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Don't worry, Your Lordship.

641
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
She'll be here soon.

642
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Give her some air.

643
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Don't let her die.

644
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
The carriage is coming.

645
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Hurry up.

646
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Be careful.

647
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Let's go.

648
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Your Lordship,

649
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Xuan Jing Si is taking the food.

650
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It's not that good.

651
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Let's eat.

652
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
You're not hungry?

653
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I've never seen anyone

654
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
take the food from the capital.

655
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Xuan Jing Si is getting more and more evil.

656
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Greetings, Father.

657
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You bastard!

658
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
How dare you

659
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
destroy my heart?

660
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Father,

661
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Xuan Jing Yan is a minor.

662
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
He's injured his body.

663
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Xuan Yan,

664
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Xuan Jing Si is a minor.

665
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Xuan Yan,

666
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
please punish me.

667
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm here to see you.

668
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm not sure what's wrong.

669
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I dare not to punish you.

670
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Father, please punish me.

671
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Please forgive me.

672
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Fine.

673
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I'll give you this chance.

674
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Say it.

675
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
How can I explain

676
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
what happened to Xuan Jing Si

677
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
today?

678
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Did he get married?

679
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You don't know

680
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
what's going on, do you?

681
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Xuan Jing Si is only a minor.

682
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I didn't get involved.

683
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Why did Xuan Jing Si

684
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
make such a big mistake?

685
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I need to explain.

686
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Isn't this

687
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
what you sent?

688
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Father, why do you say that?

689
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm not good at taking revenge.

690
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I dare not to punish you.

691
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Who's the chief?

692
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Please punish me.

693
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Your Highness,

694
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
you're so clean.

695
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I admire you.

696
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
But the truth is

697
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm afraid I'm not good enough.

698
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Your Highness,

699
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
have you ever

700
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
sent troops to Xuan Jing Si's house

701
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
to fight in front of Xuan Jing Si?

702
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Is that true?

703
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm not only

704
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
fighting in Xuan Jing Si's house.

705
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Okay.

706
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The most important thing about Xuan Jing Si

707
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
is the arrangement.

708
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
To make the Taichang Bureau

709
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
you need to know this.

710
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Okay.

711
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I have an order for the Bureau.

712
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Your Highness,

713
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
have you ever been busy

714
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
with the Bureau?

715
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm just about to ask the subordinate.

716
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I just got a report from the palace today.

717
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I've already found out that the bandits were being attacked.

718
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
But when I was chasing them,

719
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Xuan Jing Si's soldiers were charging up.

720
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I also want to ask the subordinate to explain to me about this.

721
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Good.

722
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
This is a bad person's first report.

723
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Do you think that you can be so ridiculous

724
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
that you can make a fool out of yourself?

725
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Who is the bad person's first report?

726
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I don't know.

727
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You really have a self-aware person.

728
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
All right.

729
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I'll ask you to fight.

730
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You have to answer my question.

731
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I want to hear it well.

732
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Xuan Jing Si's soldiers and patrol camp

733
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
were attacked by bandits today.

734
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
There was a conflict in the street.

735
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm afraid that the bandits are going to attack.

736
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm afraid that the bandits are going to attack.

737
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm afraid that the bandits are going to attack.

738
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
There was a conflict in the street.

739
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But there was no criminal involved.

740
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I haven't even entered Xuan Jing Si's camp.

741
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I don't understand what you mean.

742
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
He wants to say that the people in the patrol camp

743
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
robbed his prisoners on the street?

744
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Your Majesty, the conflict with the patrol camp

745
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
happened in the street.

746
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The bandits had already been killed.

747
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Xuan Jing Si's soldiers were being chased out of the house.

748
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But the patrol camp was completely destroyed.

749
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
What are you laughing at?

750
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Is that where Xuan Jing Si was hiding?

751
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
How did Xuan Jing Si's strategy work?

752
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Father knows it.

753
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
How many people can I have?

754
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Father knows it too.

755
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Even if there was a group of bandits today

756
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
who attacked Xuan Jing Si,

757
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
how could I have decided that

758
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
the bandits were my people?

759
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Your Highness,

760
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
is there anything else in the capital

761
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
that you are so determined to do?

762
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
It turns out that the subordinates were not calm

763
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
and just focused on their actions.

764
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
If that's the case,

765
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
I'll help you.

766
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Father,

767
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I request that you meet with the Ministry of War.

768
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
What do you want him to do?

769
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
The guards in the Imperial Prison and the patrol camp

770
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
were armed with weapons.

771
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
They were involved in the war.

772
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Did they have any external enemies today?

773
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Did they have any injuries?

774
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Did they have any power to break into Xuan Jing Si?

775
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
As long as they want to investigate,

776
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
they can find out the traces.

777
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Your Highness,

778
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
how could you use the military camp

779
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
to do such a thing?

780
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Are you the Seven Pearls King now?

781
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's not hard to keep the guards in secret.

782
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The patrol camp is just helping the guards.

783
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
The people who really attacked Xuan Jing Si

784
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
might not be able to find their true identity.

785
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Jing Yan,

786
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I'll give you another chance.

787
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Tell me honestly.

788
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Who are the people

789
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
who tried to get rid of Xuan Jing Si?

790
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

791
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Search them.

792
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Yes.

793
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I wonder what I did wrong again.

794
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Please show me your name.

795
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Your Highness, please step inside.

796
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Consort Jing,

797
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
you're so bold!

798
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Father also believes that

799
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
there are people who are secretly guarding the place.

800
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
If it's the other way around,

801
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
but what kind of place is Xuan Jing Si?

802
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Father must know better than me.

803
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm not sure.

804
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'm not sure.

805
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I'm not sure.

806
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I'm not sure.

807
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Father must know better than me.

808
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Father,

809
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
how many people I want to accompany?

810
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Only then can I get rid of Xuan Jing Si's identity

811
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and get rid of the prisoner.

812
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Prince Yu has been the Seven Pearls King for so many years.

813
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Please ask him if you can accompany him.

814
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
He doesn't care about the location or the location.

815
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
He can't find any traces.

816
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
But he's enough to attack Xuan Jing Si's secret place.

817
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Now it's you!

818
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You don't have to hold me in your arms!

819
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
As I said, it makes sense.

820
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
If you want to break Xuan Jing Si's secret place,

821
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
at least you need to have a few hundred people.

822
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Prince Jing's mansion

823
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
can't have so many people.

824
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
There's no trace of them.

825
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
You can't find any.

826
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Your Majesty,

827
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
the attack on Xuan Jing Si's secret place

828
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
is very fierce.

829
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
There are only about thirty people.

830
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Thirty people?

831
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Xuan Jing Si is a high-ranking soldier.

832
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Your secret place is very secluded.

833
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
No one knows about it.

834
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
More than thirty people?

835
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You want to take the criminal from Xuan Jing Si's secret place?

836
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Xia Shou Zun,

837
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
you're not joking, are you?

838
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
With so few people,

839
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I'm afraid we can only look at Xuan Jing Si's secret place.

840
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Xia Qing,

841
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I really want to know

842
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
how your secret place

843
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
was attacked by the imperial guards.

844
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Your Majesty.

845
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
The secret place was actually

846
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
taken away by the Dali Temple.

847
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Dali Temple?

848
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Why did you take the Dali Temple in again?

849
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Your Majesty,

850
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
when I came in,

851
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I reported to Your Majesty that

852
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Xuan Jing Si and Dali Temple were attacked together.

853
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
At that time, the people had already transferred to Dali Temple.

854
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
In fact, it was taken away by Dali Temple.

855
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Such an important criminal.

856
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Why didn't he take the Dali Temple in Xuan Jing Si's secret place?

857
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Xia Shou Zun,

858
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
do you want to force people to come or not?

859
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Your Majesty,

860
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
the Empress sent someone to report to you.

861
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
She said she had something urgent to report.

862
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
What urgent matter could she have?

863
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Wait a minute.

864
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Father,

865
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
the Empress is always stable.

866
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
She will never disturb you.

867
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
She will never disturb you.

868
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Maybe she really has something urgent to report.

869
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Your Majesty,

870
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I heard the King Jing's words.

871
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
It's not clear what happened.

872
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I think

873
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
it's better to hear what urgent matters are

874
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
for Her Highness.

875
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Let her in.

876
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yes.

877
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Your Majesty.

878
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
What's the matter with the Empress?

879
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Her Highness ordered me to report to Her Highness.

880
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Her Highness Consort Jing was in the Palace of Poisonous Seals.

881
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
She was caught by Her Highness the Empress.

882
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
She was in love with the Empress.

883
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
She didn't dare to leave.

884
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Her Highness asked me to personally go there

885
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
and let her in.

886
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Say it again.

887
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Who?

888
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Consort Jing?

889
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Yes, Consort Jing.

890
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It's the opposite.

891
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It's the opposite.

892
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You two,

893
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
how can I repay you?

894
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
How can I repay you?

895
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You two,

896
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
you won't say it.

897
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Your mother also...

898
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
How can I repay you?

899
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
You scoundrels!

900
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Scoundrels!

901
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Get up!

902
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Kneel!

903
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I'll go to deal with your mother first.

904
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I'll come back and take you.

905
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I'll go to deal with your mother first.

906
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I'll go to deal with your mother first.

907
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'll go to deal with your mother first.

908
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000

I'll go to deal with your mother first.

910
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'll go to deal with your mother first.

911
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I'll go to deal with your mother first.

912
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I'll go to deal with your mother first.

913
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'll go to deal with your mother first.

914
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I'll go to deal with your mother first.

915
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
I'll go to deal with your mother first.

916
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I'll go to deal with your mother first.

917
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I'll go to deal with your mother first.

918
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I'll go to deal with your mother first.

919
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I'll go to deal with your mother first.

920
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000

I'll go to deal with your mother first.

934

I'll go to deal with your mother first.
