1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,260
Thank you.

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,840
Good to see you, Minister balconatheen!

3
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,360
Ge Lung,

4
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,900
Feng,

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,680
Who is going to pee?

6
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,480
Whoa, some little car caused a disturbance!

7
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,280
Mr. Su, I'm so flattered to have you here.

8
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,680
You don't have to be so polite.

9
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,840
Where are the others? Are they still looking for you?

10
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,200
Of course not. I wanted to call them.

11
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,200
But I didn't let them. We can only come back quietly.

12
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,760
Oh? I didn't expect you to be so kind.

13
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,280
The girl you came with seems to be not of any level.

14
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,160
Uh...

15
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,240
What? Is there a princess in a trance?

16
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,160
On my way back, I saw that girl looking for treasure in the south.

17
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,640
She was so excited that she had a way out.

18
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,040
She just said a word and said she knew the magic of the gate.

19
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,680
She couldn't find the moon.

20
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,680
Maybe she could find some other treasure.

21
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,200
Oh?

22
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,600
Brother Chun, please.

23
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,160
Thank you, Mr. Su.

24
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,320
Sister, you're so back on your words.

25
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,760
You didn't even say anything.

26
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,440
If Brother Li Gang hadn't come to inform us, we'd have been fooling around.

27
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,600
That's mine!

28
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,520
I said you'd be unhappy.

29
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,080
Yes, a little.

30
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,480
You're looking for something Junior Buddha!

31
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,880
It's a satisfying visit.

32
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,480
I found a much lovey-pahin story.

33
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,080
I'm with you at our door.

34
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Okay.

35
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,780
6,5,6,3,2,2,1

36
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,900
I'm in love.

37
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,160
I'll do what I've learned from you today.

38
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,480
Are you ready to all of this as preys?

39
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,160
Okay.

40
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
What's wrong?

41
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,000
These are all the treasure of the flying dragon.

42
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
Why is this shadow broken?

43
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
Who made this?

44
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,280
It's all my fault. I broke the flying dragon's treasure.

45
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
How about this?

46
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,280
I'll go to the capital to search for some fun.

47
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,280
I'll give the flying dragon a box.

48
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,280
No need.

49
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,280
It's all my fault. I broke this child.

50
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
I hope you can forgive me.

51
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
No, no.

52
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
It's my fault.

53
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,280
Brother Su, it's already April.

54
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,280
It's the season of flowers.

55
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,280
I've asked Jingrui to go to the capital tomorrow.

56
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
You should come with me.

57
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,280
I'm weak and I don't want to move.

58
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Fine.

59
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,280
I'll go and collect some spring colors.

60
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
I'll finish it.

61
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Goodbye.

62
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
Goodbye.

63
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,280
Master, you've been waiting for a long time.

64
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
You should rest for a while.

65
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
You think they're gone?

66
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Who else?

67
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
You two went out of the gate and came back.

68
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
You're so fast.

69
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
How dare you play this game

70
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
with Xia Chun and Qin Ban Ruo?

71
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
You really put me in a cold sweat.

72
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Qin Ban Ruo and Xia Chun

73
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
are all out of the game.

74
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
You just let them

75
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,280
find their own way.

76
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
I set this game for them.

77
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
Qin Ban Ruo and Xia Chun

78
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
can't find their own way

79
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
because they can't find their own way.

80
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,280
This way is for the Prince of Jing's Mansion.

81
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
It's not a big deal.

82
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
It's a big deal.

83
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,280
I've changed this way.

84
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,280
Even if Xia Chun turns it around,

85
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
she can only see a secret room.

86
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Without the true confidence,

87
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
how can I take this risk?

88
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,280
I'm afraid of the Prince of Jing's Mansion.

89
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Good.

90
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
That's right.

91
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,280
You can do it.

92
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,280
You can do it.

93
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
No problem.

94
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
Brother Meng.

95
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
The secret room is ready.

96
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,280
Do you want to go with me

97
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
to the Prince of Jing's Mansion?

98
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
Sure.

99
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
It's too cold in the dark.

100
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Take this.

101
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,280
Let's go.

102
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
What's wrong?

103
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Commander.

104
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
You just go with me.

105
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
If the Prince of Jing asks you,

106
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
how can you be with him?

107
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,280
What do you want to say?

108
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
He doesn't know.

109
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
I thought he knew.

110
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
He knew we were in the wrong place.

111
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
But he didn't know

112
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
we were really wrong.

113
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
If I take you

114
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
from the most secret passage

115
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,280
in the capital today,

116
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,280
and you're the Prince of Jing,

117
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
do you want to know

118
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,280
whether you understand it or not?

119
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
Then let's say

120
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
you helped me.

121
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
I did it for the sake of my own good.

122
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
No.

123
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
I got it.

124
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
I said I was in danger.

125
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
I had no choice.

126
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
I had no choice but to be with you.

127
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
You think he's you?

128
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
You're so good at lying.

129
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
I...

130
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
You're the Prince of Jing's Mansion.

131
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
The first master of Liang

132
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,280
who has the power to manage 50,000 soldiers,

133
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
will he easily

134
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
help Tian'er?

135
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
If it's not for my father's help,

136
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
I'm sure I can't

137
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
tell you the secret passage

138
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,280
from this relationship to life and death.

139
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
Uncle.

140
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
You just tell him everything.

141
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
Just tell him

142
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
you're actually...

143
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
I'm afraid that

144
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
we'll have more and more

145
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
contacts with Jingyan.

146
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
I beg you two

147
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
no matter what happens,

148
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
you must never tell him

149
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
who I am.

150
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
I thought you were really curious

151
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
about how Mei Changsu's original

152
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
was built.

153
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
So you wanted to go to Suzhai with me.

154
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
I thought you were

155
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
really curious about

156
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
the secret of his house.

157
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

158
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
I always think

159
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,280
Mei Changsu's original

160
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
was not built for Jingzhi.

161
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,280
Even if it wasn't for Jingzhi,

162
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,280
what could he do?

163
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
At most, he built

164
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
several secret rooms and secret passages.

165
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
What's the problem with us?

166
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Is he able to make the house

167
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,280
into a gold soup?

168
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Or can he hide the money?

169
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
I don't know.

170
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
I'm not sure.

171
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
I was originally

172
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
sincerely going to congratulate him.

173
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
But you were so angry.

174
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
It's like I'm not

175
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
being considerate.

176
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
What's he thinking?

177
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
Your Highness, you're right.

178
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,280
You're indeed making a mistake.

179
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Please punish me.

180
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
You don't have to punish me.

181
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
It's not like

182
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Mei Changsu wants to play

183
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
games on her own.

184
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
It's not like you said.

185
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
Now that I think about it,

186
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
he's still

187
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
trying to make a fool of himself.

188
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,280
If I were to be the one to do it,

189
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
I wouldn't let you out.

190
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
You're too weak.

191
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
You're too weak to be in touch with me.

192
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
You've been out for more than half an hour.

193
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
What did you find out in the garden?

194
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
As you said,

195
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
there are secret passages and secret passages.

196
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,280
The materials inside are very important.

197
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
They're very detailed.

198
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
From this,

199
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
Mei Changsu wants to

200
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,280
enter the court for a long time.

201
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
It's not like he's

202
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,280
trying to break the law.

203
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Of course.

204
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
What he said is a comment.

205
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
It's not a pretext.

206
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
Unless Mei Changsu

207
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
has entered the court,

208
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
and has the talent to control the court,

209
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
he won't

210
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
give his name out of the blue.

211
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Your Highness,

212
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
it's not like you're too weak to be in touch with me.

213
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
I hope you can give me more advice.

214
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,280
You're so smart.

215
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Just let the court go.

216
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,280
I have nothing to give you.

217
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Uncle.

218
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Why do you have to

219
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
hold on to him all by yourself?

220
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,280
If you tell the truth about the matter,

221
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,280
I believe he will be more...

222
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
He will be more evil.

223
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
How could he?

224
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
I think he's already

225
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
very much in line with you.

226
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
Yes.

227
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Prince Jin's unique temperament is still firm.

228
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
No matter what I say,

229
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
he can listen to me.

230
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
Actually, some plans and actions

231
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
are his own intention.

232
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
He never refused.

233
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Do you know why?

234
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Because...

235
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Because he has no idea.

236
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
He just needs to think about

237
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
what I did

238
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,280
to make sure that I have the power.

239
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
As for these things,

240
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,280
there will be

241
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
some kind of consequence to Meichang Su.

242
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
He doesn't need to care too much.

243
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
But once he knows

244
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Meichang Su is Uncle Lin,

245
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
before he does anything,

246
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
he will surely set up a new law

247
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
to protect me first.

248
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,280
How could he be so stubborn

249
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
and be so honest?

250
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
You should know what I mean.

251
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
After knowing my identity,

252
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
there are many things

253
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
that I can't bear to care about.

254
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Am I right?

255
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Brother,

256
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,280
you are not in a hurry to trouble me.

257
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Actually, I won't tell him.

258
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
I will write it down.

259
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
I will write it down.

260
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
After all, I grew up with him since I was a child.

261
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
I am too familiar with him.

262
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
I am more confident

263
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,280
in Meichang Su's identity

264
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,280
no matter what I write.

265
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
But that day,

266
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,280
you were also angry.

267
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Which day?

268
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
The day the private kitchen was bombed.

269
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Prince Jing thought

270
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
it was the idea of the brother

271
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
to be the prince's son.

272
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
I was angry at that moment.

273
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
Although the brother doesn't care about the cousin,

274
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
he is still angry in his heart.

275
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Am I right?

276
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
He is looking at you like that.

277
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Of course you should be angry.

278
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
What's wrong with Meichang Su

279
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
that he is looking at?

280
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,280
The road to the enemy is dangerous.

281
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
If we are not patient,

282
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
we will make mistakes.

283
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Once we make a mistake,

284
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
many people's lives

285
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
will be in danger.

286
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
You know

287
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,280
the brother's hard work.

288
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
You will be more careful

289
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
in the future.

290
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Actually, Prince Jing doesn't know

291
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
that it's nothing.

292
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
As long as I am here,

293
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
I will not let you be wronged.

294
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
That's right.

295
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
Prince Jing doesn't know that it's okay.

296
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
We are the ones

297
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
who are here to take care of you.

298
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Prince Jing.

299
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Did Your Highness ever hear

300
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
that the Emperor of South Chu

301
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
sent a son to Jinling

302
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
more than twenty years ago?

303
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
A son of the Emperor of South Chu?

304
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
Did you hear that?

305
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,280
It's been more than twenty years.

306
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
Why did you ask him?

307
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
There is a man

308
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
who has been in the capital

309
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
for a long time.

310
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
I have talked to Miss Hong Xiu Zhao

311
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
about the old days.

312
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
It seems to be related

313
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
to the Duke of Ningguo.

314
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
There is indeed something like that.

315
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
Aunt Li Yang

316
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
was in love with a son of the Emperor of South Chu

317
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
for a long time.

318
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
This crazy thing

319
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
was also caused by

320
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
the chaos in the capital.

321
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
There is indeed something like that.

322
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Yes.

323
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
But I didn't expect that

324
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
after this son of the Emperor of South Chu left,

325
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Aunt Li Yang suddenly

326
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
married the Xie Yu

327
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,280
who was the first emperor at that time.

328
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
And this Lord Xie

329
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,280
was the first emperor in several years.

330
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
He was the first emperor

331
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
to be the emperor

332
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
and the emperor of the imperial family.

333
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
He became the emperor's heir.

334
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Lord Xie

335
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
is really capable.

336
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
Has no one mentioned it

337
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
after this?

338
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
The elders are old.

339
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
Who is more embarrassed to mention it?

340
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,320
Xie Yu is the first

341
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,280
emperor in the Eastern Palace.

342
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
He is the most loyal enemy of the emperor.

343
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,280
We must catch him

344
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,280
at any time.

345
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Aunt Li Yang married Xie Yu

346
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
is not willing to marry him.

347
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,280
But no matter what the internal affection was,

348
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
he married for more than twenty years.

349
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
He has three children.

350
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
I'm afraid it's hard to

351
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
turn him over

352
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
to deal with Xie Yu.

353
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,280
It's easy to take down Xie Yu.

354
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
The words of the Emperor of South Chu

355
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,280
sounds strange.

356
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Maybe you are interested.

357
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
Tell me.

358
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Xiao Jingrui?

359
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,280
Although you blame me,

360
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
I still have to say

361
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
Prince Jin is too unkind.

362
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
He doesn't know how to change.

363
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,280
It's too hard for him to serve the throne.

364
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
After he has these shortcomings

365
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
in the throne,

366
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
he is very noble.

367
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,280
When did we go to the inn

368
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
to play with the emperor

369
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
who would make the whole family?

370
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
The things that the emperor

371
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
has done these years,

372
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
sometimes,

373
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
it's really hard to keep an eye on him.

374
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
The emperor used to be more righteous.

375
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
But he didn't have to do this.

376
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
The most pitiful thing is the crown prince and Prince Yu.

377
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
They didn't learn anything.

378
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
They just made those

379
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
who were angry with him

380
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
the most pitiful thing.

381
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
It's a treasure of the country.

382
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
You two are in the middle of the book.

383
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,280
You can see it more clearly.

384
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
These years,

385
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,280
the court has been in a civil war.

386
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
The five wars are all about

387
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,280
the top of the throne.

388
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
The power is in the hands of the guards.

389
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,280
The top of the throne

390
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
can be forced to fight.

391
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,280
If the next court is still like this,

392
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
I'm afraid it will be difficult to keep the peace

393
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,280
with the power of the country.

394
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,280
Speaking of these,

395
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,280
my heart is like a rose.

396
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,280
I remember when Prince Qi was in the world,

397
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
the whole court

398
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,280
was in a state of chaos.

399
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,280
There was no such situation in the court.

400
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Unfortunately,

401
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
after the beauty was taken,

402
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,280
the fortune of Prince Qi's family was scattered.

403
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
It was lucky that he survived.

404
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
Either he became a new person,

405
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
or he was unable to get out of the palace.

406
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
If anyone could still keep the style

407
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
of Prince Qi's brother,

408
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
there would be only Prince Jin left.

409
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
Since I was a child,

410
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,280
I have been taught by Prince Qi.

411
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Of course, I have different opinions.

412
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
Although according to the current

413
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
and the current situation,

414
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
the fortune of Prince Qi is still difficult.

415
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
But once it is successful,

416
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
with his determined will,

417
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
he will definitely become a good emperor

418
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
in the middle of the Ming Dynasty.

419
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,280
Since you believe in me,

420
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
I also believe that

421
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,280
Prince Jin will be a good emperor in the future.

422
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
If you look at him,

423
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,280
you can't even think about it.

424
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
Just because of this,

425
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
although there are many things,

426
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,280
he cannot bear with me.

427
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,280
I am from the hell.

428
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
I am even poisoned with bone marrow.

429
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,280
Those dangerous and poisonous things

430
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,280
I can do it alone.

431
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,280
I must keep the heart of the fan

432
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,280
of Jingyan.

433
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
I will do it.

434
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
Sister Hui Fei,

435
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,280
you still have to follow the last method.

436
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
It is not time for you to be young.

437
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,280
The old illness on the waist

438
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,280
cannot be cured.

439
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
I am not willing to

440
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,280
take this old bone.

441
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,280
Then the empress

442
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,280
will come to the palace

443
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,280
and will be on the shoulder.

444
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
I am afraid that I will be full.

445
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
Have you heard that

446
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
next month,

447
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
a marriage proposal will be held?

448
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
The south palace?

449
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,280
Are you going to

450
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
get married to our Liang?

451
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
But the palace

452
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,280
seems to have no princess.

453
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,280
But we have a prince.

454
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,280
I heard that this time

455
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,280
the south palace

456
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
wants to marry a princess.

457
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,280
I don't know which prince will go.

458
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
Your Majesty,

459
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,280
you have an idea.

460
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
But it is not so fast.

461
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
It is just that the empress

462
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
I have never heard

463
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
that the empress is so virtuous.

464
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
If you really want to marry her,

465
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
I think it is not a good thing.

466
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
And

467
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
the prince, the prince,

468
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
the prince who is favored by the prince

469
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
will not consider it.

470
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
But

471
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,280
it is in the middle of the few children.

472
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
Maybe it is our Jingting.

473
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
It may be Jingli.

474
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,280
Your Jingyan is also possible.

475
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
The marriage proposal

476
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
will be given to the emperor.

477
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Moreover,

478
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
it will be too long

479
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
and too complicated.

480
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
It is enough to get married.

481
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
You are right.

482
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
Our children

483
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
have no idea.

484
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
Whether to marry or not,

485
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
let the emperor decide.

486
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
The emperor will marry

487
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
the princess.

488
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
The emperor will marry

489
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
the princess.

490
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
The emperor will marry

491
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
the princess.

492
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,280
The emperor will marry

493
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,280
the princess.

494
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
The emperor will marry

495
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
the princess.

496
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
Prince.

497
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,280
Prince.

498
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
Prince.

499
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Prince.

500
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
What's wrong?

501
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
Someone knocked on the door.

502
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
Knock on the door.

503
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
Come on.

504
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
Help me up.

505
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Mr. Su, sorry to bother you.

506
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
Your Highness.

507
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,280
The emperor is not well.

508
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,280
I should not come here at this time.

509
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,280
Please.

510
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,280
I have been sleeping

511
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,280
for a long time.

512
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,280
I don't like it.

513
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
Father ordered me

514
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,280
to go to the capital to change my room.

515
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,280
I have to leave in two days

516
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
and return in three days.

517
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
So,

518
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,280
I can only disturb your good dream.

519
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,280
Your Highness, you are so kind.

520
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
It is my duty.

521
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,280
I don't want to disturb you.

522
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,280
Your Highness, you are right.

523
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,280
I am fine.

524
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
I was in the palace yesterday.

525
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Mother mentioned

526
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
that the south side

527
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,280
will marry the princess.

528
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
It seems that

529
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
you do not want this peach blossom

530
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
to fall on your body.

531
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
Mr. Su, you have a good argument.

532
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
So,

533
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,280
do you have any plans?

534
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
The chief is in charge of the war.

535
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,280
Before the order is made,

536
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,280
he will definitely find

537
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,280
the Taichang Taigu Fairy and the Eighth words.

538
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
As long as the Eighth words

539
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,280
of His Highness are not compatible with the princess of the south side,

540
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,280
even if His Majesty chose you,

541
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,280
the south side will not agree.

542
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
The Taichang Fairy

543
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,280
actually has a name for you.

544
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
I can't say it.

545
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
There are some tricks to do.

546
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,280
Mr. Su, you are the first to enter the capital.

547
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
It feels like

548
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
you are being treated as a member of the Seven-Lin-Taiji-Shing-Ming.

549
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
You are being attacked by the Crown Prince

550
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
and the Prince of the Prince.

551
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
But now,

552
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
you are not in a good mood.

553
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
It feels like you are

554
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,280
prepared to come.

555
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,280
The world is always

556
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,280
difficult to control.

557
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,280
I am talented.

558
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,280
I am not willing to be a member of the world.

559
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
If I do not have a good chance,

560
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,280
how can I leave the Crown Prince

561
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
and the Prince alone?

562
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,280
And I have already

563
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,280
been given the crown prince as my emperor.

564
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,280
This is also a

565
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
place that I have never thought of.

566
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
What have you never thought of?

567
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Why did this talented Jiang Zuo Meilang

568
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,280
choose me so firmly?

569
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,280
Is it really to support a

570
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,280
ungrateful prince

571
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
who can get more attention

572
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
and higher status?

573
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
Why not?

574
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
Mr. Su loves to listen to me.

575
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
I always wanted to ask you,

576
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
did you know

577
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
my brother before?

578
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Your Highness.

579
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,280
When I was young,

580
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
I really wanted to

581
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
show my ambition

582
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
in his arms.

583
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
It's a pity that

584
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
this ambition

585
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
is finally not realized.

586
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Sister.

587
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
Sister.

588
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Sister.

589
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
Stop calling me.

590
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,280
You can't be so rude

591
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
and always be so old.

592
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,280
What are you doing?

593
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
I can't learn it.

594
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Your sister is still possible.

595
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
What is it? Say it.

596
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
This is the imperial court's

597
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,280
plan to change the death penalty.

598
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
This is the report.

599
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
Do you want to know?

600
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,280
How do you know?

601
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,280
Read it.

602
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,280
You used to be

603
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,280
not interested in this kind of

604
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,280
court dispute.

605
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,280
Why do you want to know now?

606
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
It used to be because

607
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
it was not in the capital.

608
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Now you should know

609
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
what you should know.

610
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Read it.

611
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
The court's letter of interest

612
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
He Jing Zhong

613
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,280
sent a letter of interest

614
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,280
to the minister

615
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
to read the letter of interest

616
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,280
to the minister.

617
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
He sent the letter of interest

618
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
to Yue Zhou as an internal force.

619
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
He Wen Xin

620
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,280
sent a case of a trial

621
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
to the minister.

622
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,280
The minister of justice

623
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
Qi Min, Cao Jin, Ren Ming

624
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
and the independent king

625
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
were sentenced to death

626
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
and sentenced to death.

627
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
The minister of justice

628
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,280
of the Ministry of Justice

629
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,280
was sentenced to 15 crimes.

630
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
But Prince Yu

631
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
was so hard-working

632
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,280
in the court.

633
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
He sent two cases.

634
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Xie Yu used one case

635
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
to get two ministers.

636
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,280
It's a pity.

637
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,280
Sister,

638
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
you always say

639
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,280
I'm lazy and don't like to think.

640
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
So I've been

641
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
serious about

642
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
the current situation.

643
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,280
I think it's weird.

644
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
Prince Mu

645
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
will also be in the court.

646
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280
Tell me

647
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,280
what's weird.

648
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,280
Look,

649
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,280
the crown prince

650
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,280
lost the court debate.

651
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,280
Without the minister

652
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,280
and the minister,

653
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
he was still

654
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,280
in the palace.

655
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
Prince Yu

656
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
was in the palace

657
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
in the case of a Duke of Qing.

658
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,280
The queen was more cold

659
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
in the palace.

660
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
Now,

661
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
the minister of justice and the minister of justice

662
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
are gone.

663
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
They all say

664
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
they're more arrogant.

665
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,280
They're both

666
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,280
as funny as the picture.

667
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,280
They're just a little bit more handsome.

668
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,280
Right?

669
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
It's weird, right?

670
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
I didn't see it.

671
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,280
The minister of justice

672
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,280
is in the palace.

673
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,280
He's good at talking.

674
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,280
Unfortunately,

675
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
the crown prince and Prince Yu

676
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
are not as idle as you are.

677
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
They're in the new court.

678
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
But

679
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
the minister of justice

680
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
and the minister of justice

681
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
are in the palace.

682
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
They must fight for it.

683
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
But in the end,

684
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,280
no one can

685
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,280
let the other person

686
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,280
go.

687
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,280
I think

688
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,280
the most important thing

689
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
is the emperor.

690
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Your Majesty,

691
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,280
Prince Jing asked to see you.

692
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280
He said

693
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
you've already done

694
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
the task.

695
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
He came to report it.

696
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,280
Let him in.

697
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,280
Let Prince Jing in.

698
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,280
Greetings, father.

699
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
Get up.

700
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Father,

701
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
I went to the west mountain

702
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
to investigate the two-bedroom

703
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,280
and the room.

704
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
Everything went well.

705
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
Nothing happened.

706
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,280
I'm glad to hear that.

707
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
Is there anything else?

708
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
No.

709
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
No.

710
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Nothing.

711
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,280
I'll go.

712
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,280
Go.

713
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Great.

714
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
You've worked hard.

715
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
Father,

716
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,280
you look tired.

717
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,280
You haven't gone to bed yet?

718
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,280
You don't know.

719
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Because of this bad luck,

720
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,280
It's a mess.

721
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,280
It's so painful.

722
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
The position of the superior is not in the control.

723
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,280
It will not affect the daily affairs of the two departments.

724
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
It's good to have a new superior to lead the way.

725
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,280
It's not as clear as you said.

726
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,280
The power department is good to say.

727
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
But it just took off a mirror.

728
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,280
There is no problem with the mechanism.

729
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
But the shape department.

730
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,280
The official of the society is very much.

731
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,280
I just took off half the mirror.

732
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,280
I'm so confused.

733
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
Then father.

734
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,280
Just appoint the superior.

735
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,280
It's just that the superior is not good.

736
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,280
Jingxuan and Jinghuan.

737
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,280
It's not easy to make this thing happen.

738
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,280
It's hard for me to make a decision.

739
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,280
Jingyan.

740
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,280
Who do you think is more suitable for the management of the shape department?

741
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
Father knows.

742
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,280
I have never been in charge of the six departments.

743
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
If it's not for the last time,

744
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
If it's not for the last time,

745
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
If it's not for the last time,

746
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,280
If it's not for the last time,

747
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
I'm afraid no one will recognize it.

748
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,280
How would you know who is suitable for the management of the shape department?

749
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
You just said the case of Qing emperor.

750
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
I remember it.

751
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,280
The book of the case was good at that time.

752
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
What is the title of the book?

753
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
The shape department's chief.

754
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Cai Quan.

755
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
Yes.

756
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,280
Yes.

757
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,280
Cai Quan.

758
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,280
I have a good impression of him.

759
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,280
I think he is a good person.

760
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,280
I think he is a good person.

761
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,280
I have a good impression of him.

762
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
He?

763
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,280
He was involved in the exchange of the case.

764
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,280
I don't know about that.

765
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
But

766
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,280
I know about the chief Cai.

767
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,280
He is not the kind of person who is in charge of the shape department.

768
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,280
I don't think he is involved in the exchange of the case.

769
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,280
The name of the book is indeed not in it.

770
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,280
Good.

771
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
Good.

772
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
Gong Zhan.

773
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Yes.

774
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,280
I will see you in Cai Quan.

775
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
Yes.

776
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
Good.

777
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Who do you think it is?

778
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,280
The chief.

779
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,280
Yes.

780
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
The chief.

781
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,280
Yes.

782
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
The chief.

783
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Yes.

784
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
The chief.

785
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Yes.

786
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,280
The chief.

787
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
Yes.

788
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,280
The chief.

789
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
Yes.

790
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
Who do you think it is?

791
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,280
Cai Quan?

792
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Yes.

793
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
The public just sent a message.

794
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
His Majesty proposed that Cai Quan

795
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,280
be the chief of the shape department.

796
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,280
He will lead the book.

797
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
He asked him

798
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,280
to restore the shape department

799
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,280
within a month.

800
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,280
And clean up the mess.

801
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,280
This Cai Quan...

802
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,280
The first lady in the palace, Yu Le Cheng.

803
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
994466.

804
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
Com.

805
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
The most exciting game in the county.

806
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,280
The horse is running.

807
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
The horse is running.

808
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
The viewer she got 2.

809
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,280
The reward is female king's.

810
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
The reward for the reward.

811
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
The reward for the reward for children.

812
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Generous reward.

813
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,360
The additional rewards make us

814
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,280
more diverse and convince us

815
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,280
our answer to your answer.

816
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
Who are you?

817
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,280
Why are you 对被及 눈でき吗?

818
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
Immortal Master?

819
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,280
My investigation has been cleared of the public.

820
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,280
Cai Quan is hot boss

821
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,280
There are few people who are good at character and character.

822
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,280
It's not like the soldiers of the Eastern Palace.

823
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,280
This person is like Shen Zui of the Ministry of Revenue.

824
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,280
They are not reliable.

825
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
Maybe this is the intention of my father.

826
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Choosing someone who is reliable and reliable

827
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,280
will make me and the Crown Prince continue to fight.

828
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,280
Since His Majesty has already done this,

829
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,280
I think it's not the worst outcome.

830
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
No matter what,

831
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:39,280
we must let the people of the Eastern Palace go up to fight.

832
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
You go and investigate this power.

833
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,280
See what way we can get to the bottom of this.

834
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
Yes.

835
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,280

838
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,780
I would have thought

839
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,900
I still should have many resort shop ones

840
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,780
instead of petition.

841
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,780
You should go to the Meichang Clan to discuss it.

842
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,780
You should see the outcome now.

843
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,780
Good thing that the Crown Prince was sent to the Imperial Palace.

844
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,780
He is not allowed to attend the court.

845
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,780
The court still holds the position of your highness.

846
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,780
The case of the death was very clear.

847
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:49,780
His Majesty didn't blame you either.

848
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,780
The court's grand event still allows me to ask your opinion.

849
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,780
Now the ministers of the court are discussing it.

850
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,780
If the Eastern Palace doesn't get up again,

851
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:06,780
Prince Yu, you will soon be the Crown Prince.

852
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,780
What's the point of discussing it?

853
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,780
If father really has this intention, he won't choose the right one.

854
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,780
I really don't understand.

855
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,780
It's so easy to be a Chu soldier.

856
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,780
Why is it so hard for me to be Xiao Jing Huan?

857
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,780
Now the Eastern Palace is in chaos.

858
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,780
The whole court is in my favor.

859
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,780
But father...

860
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,780
He is always so far away.

861
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,780
Wang Qing.

862
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,780
Yes.

863
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,780
Did you hear a rumor?

864
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,780
That I will soon be deposed from the Crown Prince

865
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,780
and be the Prince of Yu?

866
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,780
What do you think?

867
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,780
The Eastern Palace is a state-run army.

868
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,780
It's very powerful.

869
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,780
It's all related to the basic of the court.

870
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,780
It's not as easy as the outside world.

871
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,780
So I don't mind.

872
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,780
I don't care.

873
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,780
Prince Yu is very wise.

874
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,780
I am very proud of him.

875
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,780
Do you think it's more like me

876
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,780
compared to the Crown Prince?

877
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,780
I don't think so.

878
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,780
The Crown Prince and the Prince are very alike.

879
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,780
You are always so far away.

880
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,780
I am asking you.

881
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,780
Gao Zhen, you are here.

882
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,780
Get up.

883
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,780
Your Majesty.

884
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,780
Are you going back to the Hall of the Mages

885
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,780
or to the Empress?

886
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,780
I am going to the Palace of the Mages.

887
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,780
Let's go to the Palace of the Mages.

888
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,780
Let's go.

889
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,780
Get up.

890
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,780
Please leave.

891
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,780
Before the spring, I was bored here.

892
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,780
I was also worried about the blood and tears in the West.

893
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,780
I didn't expect that he would be so happy

894
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,780
when he arrived at the Palace of the Mages.

895
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,780
I don't care about the people here.

896
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,780
The brothers are very kind.

897
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,780
But the way the Seven Seasons are built,

898
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,780
it's better to compare with the North enemies.

899
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,780
It's better to be more careful.

900
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,780
The North enemies are all soldiers.

901
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,780
That's true.

902
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,780
I heard that Prince Jing

903
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,780
has been working on the Palace of the Mages

904
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,780
for years.

905
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,780
It's so amazing.

906
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,780
Can I have a look at the Palace of the Mages?

907
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,780
Why not?

908
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,780
Your Highness.

909
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,780
Go to the study room.

910
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,780
Bring my two-star palace to me.

911
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,780
Yes.

912
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,780
No need.

913
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,780
Your Highness.

914
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,780
There are so many people here.

915
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,780
If we bring out the palace,

916
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,780
we will not let them

917
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,780
ask for a training.

918
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,780
It's not easy to clean up.

919
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,780
Why don't I go and have a look?

920
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,780
Yes.

921
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,780
I will accompany the Commander.

922
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,780
How dare you!

923
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,780
It's just a moment of work.

924
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,780
Let Zhan Ying accompany me.

925
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,780
That's good.

926
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,780
Zhan Ying.

927
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,780
Yes.

928
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,780
Please.

929
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,780
Zhan.

930
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,780
Have you smelled

931
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:13,780
a fresh herb?

932
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,780
I have.

933
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,780
Your Majesty.

934
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,780
The wall is the Palace of the Mages of the Imperial Concubine Jing.

935
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,780
There is a prescription.

936
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,780
I think this fragrance

937
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:33,780
came from the wall.

938
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,780
Jing Ping?

939
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,780
Your Highness.

940
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,780
I found a secret room with Commander.

941
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,780
Gao Zhan.

942
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,780
Yes.

943
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,780
Jing Ping has been in the Palace

944
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,780
for more than 20 years.

945
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,780
I have been in the Palace for more than 20 years.

946
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,780
I have been in the Palace for more than 20 years.

947
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,780
Yes.

948
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,780
After the Imperial Concubine Jing

949
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,780
was born,

950
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,780
Yue Yao was always ill.

951
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,780
She was unwell for more than two years.

952
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,780
I was worried.

953
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,780
So I sent her to the Palace

954
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,780
to be taken care of.

955
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,780
I remember

956
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,780
Yue Yao has always been like a sister to her.

957
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,780
She is like a sister to her.

958
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,780
Why are you so far away?

959
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,780
Come here.

960
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,780
Come here.

961
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,780
Do you dare to do this?

962
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,780
Well...

963
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,780
I know

964
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,780
you...

965
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,780
No one can

966
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,780
mention Chen Fei and King Qi

967
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,780
in front of me.

968
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,780
Go.

969
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,780
Jing Ping, take care of the family.

970
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,780
Yes.

971
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,780
I am sorry.

972
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,780
