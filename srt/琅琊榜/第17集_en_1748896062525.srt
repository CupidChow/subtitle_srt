00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 13

2
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,040
Mr. Su, you're leaving?

3
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,600
Go and find some jade stones.

4
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,920
I need to find out how to help Shen Zui secretly.

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,520
Are you satisfied with that?

6
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
It's hard to find a way to hide the jade.

7
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,920
Is it just that you secretly helped Shen Zui?

8
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,160
Tell me.

9
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,480
You think...

10
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,920
Shen Zui is a successor to the Ministry of Revenue.

11
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,080
He's deeply relies on the pleasure of meeting up with Sen Slitch.

12
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,400
Unlike him,itteny and busy,

13
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,880
there will always be a mess.

14
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,920
Mr. Su wears the letter that

15
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,960
the Eastern Palace has startedCheering The stare at the Imperial Court.

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,600
It's one thing to hear the help of the punchline.

17
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,200
The Crown Prince nói so is the son-in-law,

18
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,400
No matter how the talent causes him,

19
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,560
I think workflow of the imperial system could be controlled.

20
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,000
Your rooms were designed to be compared

21
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,240
You mean...

22
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,920
Before the private kitchen is closed,

23
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,280
make things bigger.

24
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,680
Your Highness is wise.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,600
Brother.

26
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,560
Wuват.

27
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,440
Go.

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,200
Sister Bao.

29
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,560
You go out with me.

30
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,560
You tell me clearly.

31
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,320
How is the Baochuan General injured?

32
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,240
But did Shangyuan's night come out again?

33
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,240
Father asked her to go.

34
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,240
Brother, you don't want me anymore.

35
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
You're pregnant.

36
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Father asked brother to do such a dangerous thing.

37
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Brother, don't you go and talk to father.

38
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
Brother Qing is so stubborn.

39
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
He's still willing to do it.

40
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,240
No wonder you can't blame me.

41
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
Brother.

42
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Father.

43
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Han'er.

44
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,240
Who told you to come here?

45
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,240
You don't have any manners.

46
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
I have something to ask father.

47
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Tell me if you have anything.

48
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,240
Although I'm filial, I shouldn't ask for the elders.

49
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
But what father has done recently,

50
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,240
I don't understand.

51
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,240
I can't keep my mouth shut.

52
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,240
What do you want to say?

53
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:44,540
W

54
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,160
The fact that you're my close friend

55
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,400
is why I trust you so much.

56
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,880
I've never heard of such a thing, father.

57
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,560
There are some tricks.

58
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,240
It's not what you think.

59
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,080
I hope father can be a good son.

60
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,680
Don't let the two families

61
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,040
get into the game together.

62
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,240
Shut up!

63
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,760
You're still young.

64
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,160
How dare you call me father?

65
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,680
You're wasting your time.

66
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,720
Xiao Yao is here.

67
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,400
How can she know that

68
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,760
there's no one in the court?

69
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,720
Do you think I can

70
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,880
always be a good son?

71
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,520
Do you think I'm a hero

72
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,200
who can defeat the Party?

73
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
You're kidding me.

74
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,560
I have the right to do it.

75
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,920
I can do it.

76
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,000
But do you know who's right?

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,320
It's the future of His Majesty.

78
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,720
If I can't take the chance

79
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,680
to take the chance to be the emperor,

80
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,040
I won't let the two families

81
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,080
get into the game.

82
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,320
Do you know that?

83
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,480
What a surprise!

84
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,160
The court is in a fight.

85
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,800
There's no point to be so serious.

86
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,440
The winner will be punished.

87
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,200
Father, shut up!

88
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,840
Get out!

89
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,480
Father.

90
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Please wait.

91
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,440
I miss Qu МУЗЫКА

92
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,480
Princess.

93
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,120
No one will come

94
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,720
if I don't become any closer to them.

95
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,680
We've had Gozang

96
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,760
and Lv Liquid

97
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,720
and not a white-headed person.

98
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
From now on,

99
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
we can't let him know

100
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
that we are doing everything right.

101
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
Chief.

102
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Did you hear that?

103
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
Yes.

104
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
The ground is covered with dust.

105
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Go and check it out.

106
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
There's nothing wrong.

107
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Yes.

108
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Your Highness.

109
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
I heard it.

110
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Your Highness, please.

111
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
Everything is in our plan.

112
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
We didn't make any mistakes.

113
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Even if we hurt innocent people,

114
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
only then

115
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
can we let the Si Pao Fang's case

116
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
really take its value.

117
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Si Pao Fang is in trouble?

118
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Yes.

119
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
He is dead.

120
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Si Pao Fang is in trouble?

121
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Yes.

122
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
It is said that

123
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
he has been in a bad condition

124
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,720
and has been in a bad state.

125
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,720
When Si Pao Fang was in trouble,

126
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
he was already in a poor state.

127
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
About 90 people

128
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
from the family of Si Pao Fang

129
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
were killed.

130
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
They were all killed by the fire.

131
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
There was a whole street.

132
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
How is he?

133
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
But Si Pao Fang

134
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
has killed dozens of people.

135
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Plus,

136
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
there are at least 100 people

137
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
who are killed by Si Pao Fang.

138
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
There are hundreds of people

139
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
who are injured.

140
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
The fire is controlled.

141
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
Fortunately, it is not windy today.

142
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
The next street is not burned.

143
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
It has been destroyed.

144
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
It is still a whole street.

145
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
Yes.

146
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,720
The fire was not controlled at all.

147
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
The most early Jin Zhao Ya Men

148
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
only had that kind of people.

149
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Even the people who came to save the fire

150
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
were not controlled at all.

151
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Is there any chaos?

152
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,360
There are indeed some

153
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,720
scum-raising maps that are starting to be destroyed.

154
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
The people of the patrol camp

155
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,720
were caught and were not able to see for a while.

156
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Fortunately, the King of Jin

157
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
was able to see for himself.

158
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
That's why he was able to see for himself.

159
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
The police also went there?

160
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
The King of Jin

161
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
also made some military reports

162
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
to keep the victims and the injured.

163
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
The doctors in the hospital

164
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
are currently on the official list.

165
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,720
They can't be transferred for a while.

166
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
He sent people to pay for the public service.

167
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
I have already asked the brothers

168
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,720
in the capital to go to the hospital.

169
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
That's good.

170
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
Zhao Li said

171
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
the war is about to end.

172
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
The people who came to the patrol camp

173
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
are getting less and less.

174
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
The fire department

175
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
should have gone through the most dangerous time.

176
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
But there was an accident at this time.

177
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Princess, you suspect

178
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
that this is a person's fault?

179
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Do you want me to go and check on Prince Yu?

180
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
See if I can find out

181
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,720
the evidence that he was involved in this case.

182
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
Zhao Li,

183
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,720
tell me the evidence that he was involved in this case.

184
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
There are so many lives.

185
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
We can't just die.

186
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
If you have any clues,

187
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
report it to me immediately.

188
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Yes.

189
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
What did you say?

190
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
What do you mean by the fire department?

191
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Didn't I tell you to stop?

192
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Yes.

193
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
Since the royal highness's order,

194
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
that Shen Jun has found out the fire department,

195
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,720
I'm not afraid to be a brother.

196
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Send someone to collect the transfer.

197
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,720
I just hope that before we check the fire department,

198
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
we can find out more.

199
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
I was busy last night.

200
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
I didn't expect that today...

201
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
How did you get the fire department?

202
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
I don't know.

203
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Maybe it was the emergency in the middle of the month.

204
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Maybe there was a fire department.

205
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
After all, it was a fire department.

206
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
This...

207
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
As long as there was a little fire,

208
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
it would be immediately blown away.

209
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Go to Xie Yu immediately.

210
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
Take the patrol camp to the scene.

211
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
No one can go in.

212
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,720
The patrol camp has already been there.

213
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,720
But the people in the Jin Rui Yin mansion are still here.

214
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Even the people in the Prince of Jin's mansion are here.

215
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Even if we forcefully drive them away,

216
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Your Highness,

217
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
this matter...

218
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
This matter can't be kept.

219
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Can't be kept?

220
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
Can't be kept?

221
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Come, retreat!

222
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
Your Highness!

223
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Your Highness!

224
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Help!

225
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Help!

226
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
Come, you two.

227
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Look over there.

228
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
Yes, I'm confident.

229
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Okay.

230
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Stop!

231
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
This is the place where the Immortal Immortal is not allowed to enter.

232
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
What are you doing?

233
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
I'm looking for him.

234
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Go down.

235
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
Go in.

236
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Mr. Su.

237
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
General Liao.

238
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
Where is Prince of Jin?

239
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
In the room.

240
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
He's still looking for the private room.

241
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

242
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

243
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
Your Highness.

244
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
Mr. Su.

245
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
The thing Prince Mu sent me is quite useful.

246
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Go and take a look.

247
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Yes, Your Highness.

248
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
What's this?

249
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
It's a letter from Prince of Jin.

250
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
It's from Prince of Jin.

251
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,720
What's this?

252
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,720
demon people in southern China who killed exiled to third-partyaj spy flees

253
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,220
STried은aneremeapsoire

254
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
students come out!

255
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
quickly

256
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Mary

257
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
has lonned

258
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
The Minister!

259
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Princess.

260
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Prince of Jin

261
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Mr. Su arrived there so fast?

262
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
The big thing at the palace

263
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,920
The big thing in this capital is Mr. Su's words.

264
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,800
In the capital of Daliang,

265
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,960
it's such a rare sight.

266
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,440
They are all poor people.

267
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,440
Who would have thought that

268
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,720
there would be a black fire pit

269
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,160
next to their own house.

270
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,240
It's a ten-year life.

271
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,240
It's good to have more than one day.

272
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,520
More than one day?

273
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,640
How is it possible?

274
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,520
Minister Shen told me yesterday

275
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,040
that he had already reported it.

276
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,360
He asked His Majesty to send a report

277
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,200
to the Imperial Court to help him

278
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
to find out the house.

279
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,920
He told me very confidently

280
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,440
that the house will be closed in a few days.

281
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,240
I didn't expect that

282
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,720
the memorial would happen

283
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,960
in just one day.

284
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,000
Do you really think it's an accident?

285
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,400
What's Mr. Su's case?

286
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,160
It was a simple case.

287
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,280
But this is a disaster.

288
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,080
This matter is not limited to the court.

289
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,960
After all, it's related to hundreds of people.

290
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,000
The fate of the people is to be the top.

291
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,440
In this way,

292
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,560
the punishment for the East Palace is more severe.

293
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,160
Your Highness, don't think.

294
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,080
This matter is a big deal.

295
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,000
Who will be the last victim?

296
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,700
Is this just to

297
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,100
attack the Crown Prince's father?

298
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,600
Can they be so cruel?

299
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,360
Is this Mr. Su's

300
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,560
plan to kill Prince Yu?

301
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,680
Xiao Jingyan,

302
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,480
what do you mean?

303
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,440
I was even thinking...

304
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,520
What do you mean?

305
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,140
No matter who Rahmen Youkuan was.

306
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,200
How can he embarrassed his life

307
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,360
even if he was hungry for the benefiting of the fingers?

308
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,360
Mr. Su,

309
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,160
the situation has become strange

310
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,560
and entirelyavilion makes you warm up.

311
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
You should be so lenient to him.

312
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,000
Princess.

313
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,640
Will

314
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,960
Prince Yu have no hope

315
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,600
under his own shelter?

316
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,680
Would you know

317
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,780
they have done all the acclaimed

318
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,740
values for him?

319
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,420
Princess.

320
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,560
You don't mean this is intentional.

321
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,520
No matter there are

322
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,000
any ruptured rebels,

323
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,880
especially him.

324
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,800
It's him.

325
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,600
Princess.

326
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,160
Your Highness, you misunderstood.

327
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,680
This is not the idea of Su Mu Chu.

328
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,760
I just said that.

329
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,560
Please don't put it in your heart.

330
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,480
You are the crown prince of Donggong.

331
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,720
Why are you so greedy?

332
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,760
You can't blame me for being greedy.

333
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,520
If it wasn't for the old Wu Chu and Jing Bi,

334
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,840
in order to deal with him,

335
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,360
I would have spent too much money on him.

336
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,760
I remember there were a few assassins.

337
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,040
In�,...

338
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,080
There were actually princils.

339
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,760
You heard them.

340
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,640
Do have that.

341
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,720
Zhoi Ming하고 was already arriving.

342
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,880
It wasn't subject to me.

343
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,400
Why did you have to eenscene him?

344
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,560
scripted against him?

345
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Your Highness,

346
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,800
Please don't call for them anymore.

347
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,600
The fact that hope doesn't leave you alone

348
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,760
is almost impossible.

349
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,600
No, your majesty.

350
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
You're not guilty.

351
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
You didn't change the place of your death.

352
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
You're guilty.

353
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
But Your Majesty,

354
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
you're too suspicious.

355
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
The more people of Prince Yu are crazy to attack you,

356
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
the more he'll think

357
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
it's related to the party.

358
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
What you mean is...

359
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
As long as Your Majesty thinks

360
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
it's related to the party,

361
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
he'll be in danger

362
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
and he'll be left behind.

363
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
In case Prince Yu gets too much of a fight

364
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,600
and loses balance in the current situation.

365
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
I understand.

366
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
I'll go and make arrangements.

367
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Your Highness.

368
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
What is it?

369
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Your Highness, I've already finished the case.

370
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
In addition to the internal and external stuff,

371
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,600
the military government has provided a total of 200 pieces of pig's trotters.

372
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
The total is 450 beds.

373
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
These are all military supplies.

374
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Do you want to report to the Ministry of War?

375
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I forgot what you said.

376
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
It's not a big deal.

377
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
But report to the Ministry of War.

378
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Yes.

379
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Wait.

380
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
This batch of military supplies is useless.

381
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Why?

382
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Don't ask so many questions.

383
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
If you don't report, I won't.

384
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Just forget it.

385
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
You forget it too.

386
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Just don't report it.

387
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Do as you wish.

388
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Yes.

389
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
How is it?

390
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Open it.

391
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
Do you know that

392
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
although this batch of military supplies has been distributed to me,

393
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
it's already used by the officials

394
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
to settle the debts.

395
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
According to the rules,

396
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
I should report to the Ministry of War.

397
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Why don't you let me report it?

398
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
You didn't know why.

399
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
You should have done it.

400
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Aren't you afraid that I'll have

401
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
some evil intentions?

402
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
I was wrong.

403
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
Please don't mind it.

404
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
The supplies of the Prince of Mu's Mansion are here.

405
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Don't you want to go and have a look?

406
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
I should go and have a look.

407
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
I'll go with you.

408
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
Is it war time now?

409
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
Of course not.

410
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
Are these accounts and the money

411
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
of the soldiers

412
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
a big amount?

413
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
From the number,

414
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
it's almost nothing.

415
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Have you finished the report?

416
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Of course I will.

417
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Since it's not war time,

418
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
we should take a look at the accounts

419
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
and prepare for the war.

420
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
What's the big deal?

421
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Although the matter is not big,

422
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
we still have to follow the rules.

423
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
What if we don't follow the rules?

424
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
You should know that

425
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
the Ministry of War

426
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
belongs to the Crown Prince's power range.

427
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Although it's a small mistake,

428
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
once the Ministry of War is caught,

429
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
I'm afraid that

430
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
they still have to be held accountable.

431
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
I just want them to be held accountable.

432
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
Your Highness, you are very kind.

433
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
You are very kind.

434
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
You are very kind to the people.

435
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Is this a bad thing?

436
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Of course not.

437
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Since it's a good thing,

438
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
it's not worth mentioning.

439
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Why would the Ministry of War

440
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
take you in

441
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,600
to take the big deal?

442
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
This is a big deal.

443
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
Your Majesty and the officials

444
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
think that you are the most insolent.

445
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Or do you think

446
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,600
it's the Crown Prince

447
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
who is holding the Ministry of War

448
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
to pressure you?

449
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Now, in the court,

450
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
the Crown Prince

451
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
can't stand the day at all.

452
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
When the Ministry of War

453
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,600
takes you in,

454
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
you will admit your mistake.

455
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Naturally, there will be a brave courtier

456
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
to speak for you.

457
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
What can you be worried about?

458
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
I'm not afraid of

459
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
the Ministry of War

460
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
to take me in.

461
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Even if Father is so strict,

462
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
I won't

463
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
put this little crime in my heart.

464
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
But

465
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
I can obviously avoid this loss.

466
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
Why do you have to

467
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
make such a fuss?

468
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
I'm just going to make things worse.

469
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Now, all the eyes

470
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
on the court

471
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,600
are on the Crown Prince and Prince Yu.

472
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Who will

473
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
really take care of

474
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
what you did?

475
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
Didn't you say

476
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
you should do more things now?

477
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
Don't talk.

478
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
I won't say it myself,

479
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
but I want others to know.

480
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
When the Ministry of War

481
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
reports it,

482
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
His Majesty and the officials

483
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
will know

484
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
that when the Crown Prince

485
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
and Prince Yu

486
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
were young,

487
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
who controlled the situation

488
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
and stabilized the people's hearts?

489
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Who is it?

490
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
It's obvious that it's a silent struggle,

491
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
but it's going to be attacked.

492
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Everyone has a sense of responsibility.

493
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
It's natural that

494
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
the matter will be discussed.

495
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
Thank you.

496
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Anyway,

497
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
if His Highness

498
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
reports this to the Ministry of War,

499
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
although the rules

500
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
are made

501
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
and you are clearly

502
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
keeping your good intentions,

503
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
I don't do these things

504
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
for others.

505
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
If you want to

506
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
show it to others

507
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
before you do it,

508
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
that's your own moral problem.

509
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
But if you do something good,

510
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
and you are not aware of it,

511
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
then it's useless

512
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
to do this.

513
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Hurry up.

514
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
I, Prince Yu,

515
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Jing Huan,

516
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
will be in charge of

517
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
the Ministry of War

518
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
and the Ministry of War

519
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
to report to the Ministry of War.

520
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
I have come here

521
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
to discuss

522
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,600
how to deal with the private fire department case.

523
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
Shen Qing,

524
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
this case is your earliest copy.

525
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Tell me

526
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
what you know.

527
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,600
I trust His Majesty

528
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
to take care of it.

529
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
When I was in the court

530
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
for the first time,

531
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,600
I found that there was a black fire.

532
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
I found the private fire department

533
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
and the building was already

534
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
completely destroyed.

535
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
The private fire department was still in operation.

536
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
Later,

537
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
I found that

538
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
the Eastern Palace also had a part in it.

539
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
During the report,

540
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
I have already put

541
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
the record of the building

542
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
and the distribution of the Eastern Palace.

543
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
There is a signature

544
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
of the Imperial Physician Han Li

545
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
on it.

546
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Where is Han Li now?

547
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Your Majesty,

548
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
he is in the Ministry of War.

549
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Your Highness,

550
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
what do you think?

551
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
I don't mind

552
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
your teaching.

553
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Han Li

554
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
is really bold.

555
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
He dares to be impulsive.

556
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
I

557
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
can't make any early conclusions.

558
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
It's really hard to say.

559
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Shen Qing,

560
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
do you have evidence

561
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
to prove that the Crown Prince

562
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
directly involved in this case?

563
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Your Majesty,

564
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
in the report of the investigation,

565
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
I didn't find

566
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
the signature of the Crown Prince.

567
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Then

568
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,600
if this case is done by Han Li,

569
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,600
the Crown Prince will not know.

570
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
It's also possible.

571
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
The Louzhi Mirror

572
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,600
was originally a secondary department

573
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
and a secondary department.

574
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
It was the first major department

575
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
of the Deputy Chief of the Department.

576
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
The Crown Prince's official position

577
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,600
is only

578
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
the four-part official position of the Eastern Palace.

579
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Shen Qing,

580
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
what do you mean?

581
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
From the accounts of

582
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
the Louzhi Mirror and the

583
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Donggong Li Nian,

584
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
it's been five years.

585
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
Every year,

586
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Louzhi Mirror has two shares.

587
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,600
Han Li has eight shares.

588
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
I just think

589
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
Han Li is

590
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
really a miracle.

591
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,600
A small Crown Prince's official position

592
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,600
is the four-part official position of the Donggong Li Nian.

593
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
How could he

594
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
make the two-part official position

595
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,600
of the Louzhi Mirror

596
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
look like this?

597
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Madam,

598
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
I'm here.

599
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,600
How is the death of the

600
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Minister of Justice,

601
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
the Minister of Justice,

602
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
the crime scene?

603
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Until today,

604
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
the Ministry of Justice

605
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
has destroyed 60 people.

606
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
121 people were killed.

607
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
39 were injured.

608
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
309 were injured.

609
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
309 were injured.

610
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
309 were injured.

611
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
The other property was damaged.

612
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
How is the death of the Minister of Justice?

613
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Although the Ministry of Justice

614
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
is in a very bad state,

615
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
there are too many casualties.

616
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
So,

617
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
the death of the Minister of Justice

618
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
is still a very serious matter.

619
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Your Highness,

620
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
I'm here.

621
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,600
How do you think

622
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
the Crown Prince's crime

623
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
is a serious matter?

624
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
I got this news yesterday.

625
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
It's very serious.

626
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
But

627
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
since the Crown Prince said

628
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
he didn't know the truth,

629
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
I don't believe it.

630
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
Please, father,

631
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
investigate the crime

632
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,600
in case you get wronged, brother.

633
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
You only knew it yesterday?

634
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,600
Because mother just got out of the hospital.

635
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
I took the blame

636
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,600
when I was born.

637
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,600
I was too late to know the truth.

638
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
The case happened until now.

639
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
It's been three days.

640
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
The food and food I received

641
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
already had 17 copies.

642
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
Some people think

643
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
the Crown Prince's crime is serious

644
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
and he has been executed by the Crown Prince.

645
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
He is in a very bad state.

646
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
The Crown Prince is not dead.

647
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,600
He has a serious background.

648
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
He has a serious relationship with the state.

649
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,600
How can he be so despicable?

650
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
You don't know

651
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
the details of the case?

652
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
I heard it for the first time.

653
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
What do you think

654
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
should be handled?

655
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
There are many cases of death.

656
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,600
The people who are killed

657
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
should be at ease.

658
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,600
As for the Crown Prince,

659
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
although he is not guilty,

660
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
please keep an eye on

661
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
the dignity of the Eastern Palace.

662
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
He did this dirty thing

663
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
and lost my face.

664
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
He even tried to save my face.

665
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Please calm down, father.

666
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Please calm down, your majesty.

667
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Pass the order.

668
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
The Crown Prince is dead

669
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
and he is in a very bad state.

670
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Order him to go back to the Imperial Palace

671
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
and take the blame.

672
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
The case is over.

673
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
The Crown Prince is dead.

674
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
He has to take the court.

675
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
The case is over.

676
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
The Ministry of Justice

677
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
is the official of the Crown Prince.

678
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
No matter who is the Crown Prince,

679
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
he will be executed.

680
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
He has to be punished.

681
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Your highness.

682
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Have a bite.

683
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Your identity is still there.

684
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,600
The Noble Consort is still in the palace.

685
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Although it is a bit of a crisis now,

686
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
but once the emperor's fire is gone,

687
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
he will naturally bully me.

688
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Xiao Jing Huan.

689
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Shen Zhui.

690
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
Don't think I will let it go.

691
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
When I am back,

692
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,600
I will use your good looks.

693
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
Your highness.

694
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
You all have to die.

695
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
All of you.

696
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
When I am back,

697
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
you all have to die.

698
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
And that Prince Jing.

699
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Father's eyes are on you.

700
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
You dare to fight with me.

701
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
Why are you still here?

702
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
Didn't you say you found his collar?

703
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
Why didn't you go to visit him?

704
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,600
Your highness,

705
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
I have already visited him.

706
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Then why didn't you take care of him?

707
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Prince Jing said that the royal guards are very strict.

708
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Prince Jing said that the royal guards are very strict.

709
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
He has already forgotten to report to the court.

710
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
He is willing to admit his crime.

711
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
But Shen Zhui, the guard,

712
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
is still defending him.

713
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
He said that the Ministry of War is a big issue.

714
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
He is already attacking.

715
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
The court's various campers

716
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
are at least standing by the Ministry of War.

717
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Even the emperor didn't blame Prince Jing.

718
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
He even praised the imperial court's decision.

719
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
When he was asked to report to the court,

720
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
even if it happened,

721
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
the Ministry of War

722
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
has been eating a lot this time.

723
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,600
But Prince Jing

724
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,600
is now in front of His Majesty.

725
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Your highness, are these all for you?

726
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
Yes, send them all over.

727
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Hurry up.

728
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Yes.

729
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
These are very important.

730
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
Take care.

731
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Your highness, this Qilin is really good.

732
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
He always returns

733
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
the things he sent.

734
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
But you still have to

735
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
collect some good things

736
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
and send them to him.

737
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Whether it is his or not,

738
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
it is my gift.

739
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
From the Qing State's attack,

740
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,600
to this time,

741
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
I stopped the crown prince from attacking.

742
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
Although he doesn't give me much advice,

743
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
he can always be very careful.

744
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
However,

745
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
this Qilin is a talented man.

746
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
If we calculate the credit,

747
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
we may not even be able to

748
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
suppress his power.

749
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
We should have something to say.

750
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,600
What did you send this time?

751
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
The snow is spring.

752
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
It is warm during the day.

753
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
I heard that he is in the forest

754
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
to repair the mountains.

755
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
I sent some

756
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
ungrateful arrows and toys.

757
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,600
They are neither luxurious nor expensive.

758
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
They are all things

759
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
that he can use now.

760
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Maybe

761
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
he will take them by surprise.

762
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
This Mr. Su

763
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Be careful.

764
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
is very good.

765
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
He personally changed the Qilin

766
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
and wanted to come to the imperial palace.

767
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
It is a pity that

768
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
he can't enter the palace

769
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
because of his weak status.

770
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
I am afraid that he has no reason to see me.

771
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
What is so difficult about this?

772
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
When he has finished changing the Qilin,

773
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
you can come with me

774
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
and have a look.

775
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
Your Highness,

776
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
you are right.

777
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
It has only been two months.

778
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
You have changed the whole place.

779
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
I can't even recognize

780
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
the house

781
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
that you recommended.

782
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
I have also put

783
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
the garden next to me

784
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
into the palace.

785
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
It is a little bigger.

786
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
I am happy to play with it.

787
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
This is the first time

788
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
you have tried

789
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
the new guest

790
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
after you arrive in the capital.

791
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,600
Yes.

792
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Let's have a warm

793
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
and new round.

794
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
I am really

795
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
invited

796
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
to Jiangzuo Meilang.

797
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
I am really...

798
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
Aumei, Shimp Jin,

799
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Yulecheng, 994466,

800
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Hong

801
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,600
The most exciting

802
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
game on the line.

803
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,600
The horse is running.

804
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
The horse is running.

805
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
The horse is running.

806
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
The queen of the reward

807
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
is the queen of the reward.

808
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
The gold city,

809
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
the rich cat,

810
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
the gold ship,

811
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
the super high pay rate,

812
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
the reward rate is higher.

813
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,600
There are many opportunities to repay.

814
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Come to the Aumei Shimp Jin

815
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Yulecheng 994466.

816
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Come.

817
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
It's a serious matter.

818
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
Commander Meng,

819
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
the guests are not here yet.

820
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
You should come with me

821
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
to play the game.

822
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Am I wrong again?

823
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
How many guests

824
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
will you invite today?

825
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Of course, there will be Jingrui and Yujing.

826
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,600
And Princess and Xia Dong.

827
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
If I don't invite five guests,

828
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
then...

829
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Princess will come with Mu Qing.

830
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
Xia Dong will bring

831
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
his big brother.

832
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
Xia Chun will come too?

833
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
I don't invite anyone else.

834
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
But I think

835
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
he will definitely

836
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,600
invite himself.

837
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Who?

838
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
This is the place

839
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
where Jiangzuo Meilang is.

840
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
I just came from the garden.

841
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
It's so beautiful.

842
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,600
It's so beautiful.

843
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
It's so beautiful.

844
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
I didn't expect you

845
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
to come here yourself.

846
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
It's just that I'm here

847
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
to fix things.

848
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,600
I'm not a newbie.

849
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,600
So I didn't dare to surprise you.

850
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
I didn't expect you

851
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
to come here.

852
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Fortunately,

853
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
you invited

854
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
some acquaintances today.

855
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
Otherwise,

856
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
if I were to be

857
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,600
so ungrateful,

858
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
everyone would be so happy.

859
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
Where are the guests?

860
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
This garden

861
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
was recommended by Commander Meng.

862
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
The first one to invite

863
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
is him.

864
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Jin Rui and Yu Jing

865
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
have also come here.

866
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,600
They are having tea in the hotel.

867
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Princess,

868
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
all the guests are here.

869
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Okay.

870
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Your Highness,

871
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
please.

872
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Okay.

873
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Please.

874
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
Is this the seventh kind of wine?

875
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
The dishes

876
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
of Brother Su's restaurant are all right.

877
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
The best is

878
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
each dish

879
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
is matched with different wines.

880
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
It's really

881
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,600
a unique taste.

882
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Yu Jing,

883
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
you are a good wine lover.

884
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
Mr. Su,

885
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
you can

886
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
call all kinds of wines.

887
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
Is this

888
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Qiu Yue Bai?

889
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
Yu Jing is a good wine lover.

890
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
It's not strange

891
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
to guess.

892
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Jin Rui,

893
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
how many wines can you make?

894
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
I can't.

895
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,600
I can only make

896
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Zhao Dian Hong.

897
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,600
No way.

898
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
You can make Zhao Dian Hong?

899
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
During the New Year,

900
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Brother Qing Yao

901
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
gave Xiaotan to Xie Bi.

902
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
I tasted it,

903
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
so I remembered.

904
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
You don't call me

905
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Zhao Dian Hong?

906
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
I don't care about Xie Bi anymore.

907
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
And you.

908
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Yu Jing,

909
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,600
you are so good at this year.

910
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
You are still so childish.

911
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,600
Jin Rui,

912
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
I heard that

913
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
your brother is seriously ill.

914
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,600
He hasn't been out for more than a month.

915
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Is he better now?

916
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
He's no longer in a coma.

917
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
He's much better.

918
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
In the world,

919
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,800
there will be many

920
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,600
things that are not suitable

921
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,600
for him in the capital.

922
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
But be careful.

923
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
It's boring to be like this

924
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
after so many years.

925
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,600
I was thinking of a way

926
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
to play last night.

927
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
I wonder if you are interested.

928
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
Mr. Jiang,

929
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
you have a point.

930
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Even if you don't play,

931
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
you should ask me.

932
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Mr. Su,

933
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
tell me about it.

934
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
Fine.

935
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
I got a book

936
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,600
that's easy to read.

937
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
It's a good book.

938
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
I'm so lucky

939
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,600
to get this book.

940
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
I've been drinking.

941
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
It's like

942
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
the old song of the poem.

943
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
It's called,

944
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
The Flowing Flowing.

945
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
It's really the Flowing Flowing.

946
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
I hid the purple tiger

947
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
in the garden yesterday.

948
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
You can go out

949
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
and find it anytime.

950
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
Whoever finds it first

951
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
will give it to you.

952
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Mr. Su, you're so miserable.

953
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
My brother Chun is a famous musician.

954
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
He should know that

955
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
the white tiger is hidden in your garden.

956
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
Even if he finds it,

957
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
he will find it.

958
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Before he finds it,

959
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
it's hard to find it.

960
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Jingrui,

961
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Prince Mu,

962
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
let's team up.

963
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Let's go.

964
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Yujin will help you.

965
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
They are not

966
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
the people of the moon.

967
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
If they find it,

968
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Yujin will take it.

969
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Mr. Xia hasn't helped yet.

970
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Dongjie,

971
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
I'll help you.

972
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Let's go.

973
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
Where?

974
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Left.

975
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Left.

976
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
No.

977
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
How can I...

978
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
This way.

979
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
This way.

980
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,600
This way.

981
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Hurry up.

982
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
I can't.

983
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
You can't.

984
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
No.

985
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
This way.

986
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
You can't find it?

987
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Let me see.

988
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Jingrui,

989
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
have you found it?

990
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
No.

991
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,600
I saw it.

992
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Go there and have a look.

993
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Hurry up.

994
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
Let's go.

995
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Higher.

996
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
Higher.

997
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
Hurry up.

998
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
I can't hold it.

999
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Let me see.

1000
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Is there any?

1001
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,600
No.

1002
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Is there?

1003
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
No.

1004
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
It seems that

1005
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
we have only a few people

1006
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,600
who are here.

1007
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,600
Look at the momentum

1008
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
that Xia Chun went out.

1009
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
It's a huge achievement.

1010
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Mr. Xia Chun loves these things the most.

1011
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Last time,

1012
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
for a bone marrow,

1013
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,600
he even fought with His Majesty.

1014
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
I've heard that

1015
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
in the Xuanjing Bureau,

1016
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Mr. Xia Chun

1017
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
is the best at

1018
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
playing the trick.

1019
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
I think

1020
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
he can

1021
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
break the little disguise

1022
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
he has.

1023
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
It seems that Yujin

1024
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,600
is going to be unhappy today.

1025
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
It's hard to tell.

1026
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Mr. Su's circle is not small.

1027
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
If he finds the right direction

1028
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
at the beginning,

1029
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,600
he will still be lucky.

1030
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
It seems that Miss Qin

1031
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
can't do anything.

1032
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
Why don't we go together

1033
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
and get lucky?

1034
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
Mr. Xia Chun is really thoughtful.

1035
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Then

1036
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
you can go.

1037
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

1038
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Thank you, Mr. Xia Chun.

1039
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
Come on, Commander Meng.

1040
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
Come on.

1041
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Mr. Su, please.

1042
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
Please.

1043
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
I've thought about it.

1044
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,600
I've thought about it.

1045
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
We are so stupid.

1046
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,600
Brother Su is

1047
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
a person who likes to be in the moon.

1048
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
How could he

1049
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
put such a precious moon sheet

1050
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
outside and pour water?

1051
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,600
We should go to the house to find it.

1052
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Right?

1053
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Let's go.

1054
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Hurry up.

1055
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
You should have told me earlier.

1056
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
You are so stubborn.

1057
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
Let's go.

1058
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
What friend are you?

1059
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Yes.

1060
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Brother Chun,

1061
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
are you going to turn this room over?

1062
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
Maybe she is outside.

1063
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
I think

1064
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
she is in the house.

1065
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,600
I will take care of her.

1066
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
I will.

1067
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
Okay.

1068
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
I will go.

1069
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
I will go.

1070
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,600
I will go.

1071
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Okay.

1072
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,600
I will go.

1073
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Okay.

1074
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,600
Okay.

1075
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
Okay.

1076
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Are you sure?

1077
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Maybe she is outside.

1078
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
No.

1079
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
The ancient house should be a treasure.

1080
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,600
I'm afraid of being lost.

1081
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,600
Mr. Su said

1082
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
she was hiding outside last night.

1083
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
He didn't say

1084
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,600
it was just a few days ago.

1085
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
But the water was still

1086
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
lost in the early night.

1087
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,600
How could she hide outside?

1088
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Let's go.

1089
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
She must be inside the house.

1090
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,600
I will go to the house to see.

1091
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Okay.

1092
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
Go.

1093
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,600
I'm sorry.

1094
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,600
I'm sorry.

1095
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,600
I'm sorry.

1096
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,600
I'm sorry.

1097
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,600
I'm sorry.
