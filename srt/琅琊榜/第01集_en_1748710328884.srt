1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The first time I saw a monster that was a bit too strong.

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I was a bit worried about the damage, but I was able to get it.

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I was able to get it, but I was able to get it.

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I was able to get it, but I was able to get it.

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I was able to get it, but I was able to get it.

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I was able to get the damage, but the damage is too strong.

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's easy to get it, so I'm using my ult run smartly.

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I didn't lockdown, but the vision is so cool.

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I think I got it, but theï¿½

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I got it, but the vision is so cool.

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,060
Your majesty

12
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,400
I want to see you

13
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
for One-eyed army

14
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,080
For one blood tougher army

15
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Father...

16
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,080
Father!

17
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,080
Father!

18
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,080
Father!

19
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Father!

20
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,080
Father!

21
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Father!

22
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,080
The first in the palace of the A-Meng is at the Yule City, 9994466. Come.

23
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,080
Young Master, I just arrived in Beiyan, the capital city.

24
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,080
I got some news from there.

25
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Do you need me to know anything?

26
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,080
Beiyan has been planning to establish the Sixth Prince as the Crown Prince.

27
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,080
You've already become the Crown Prince?

28
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Yes.

29
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Do you want to send a message to Jinling?

30
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
No need.

31
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,080
The envoy of Beiyan has been on the way.

32
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,080
The princes of the capital city will know soon.

33
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,080
You go and wait.

34
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
Yes.

35
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,080
He's really done it.

36
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,080
The first in the palace of the A-Meng is at the Yule City, 9994466.

37
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,080
The first in the capital city will know soon.

38
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,080
The first in the capital city will know soon.

39
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,080
The first in the capital city will know soon.

40
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,080
The first in the capital city will know soon.

41
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,080
The first in the capital city will know soon.

42
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,080
The first in the capital city will know soon.

43
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,080
The first in the capital city will know soon.

44
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,080
The first in the capital city will know soon.

45
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,080
The first in the capital city will know soon.

46
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,080
Lord Xu.

47
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
The envoy of Beiyan has been on the way.

48
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Let's go in.

49
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Lord Zhu.

50
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Lord Zhu.

51
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,080
I didn't expect to meet Lord Zhu in this remote palace.

52
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,080
What a coincidence.

53
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Your Majesty.

54
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Greetings, Your Highness.

55
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,080
Your Majesty.

56
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,680
Hurry.

57
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,080
I have just sent His Majesty

58
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,080
to report theood to the emperor.

59
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,080
Report on the subjects.

60
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:27,000
in order to prepare her house's

61
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll be back.

62
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,440
Next month is the birthday of Empress Dowager.

63
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,600
Prince Yu should be back to the capital.

64
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,920
He's on his way back to the capital.

65
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I can't forget that.

66
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,200
Jing Huan is doing well in the business.

67
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,800
When he comes back,

68
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,600
I'll give him two more beads.

69
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're the best.

70
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,000
His Majesty said that he'll give Prince Yu two more beads

71
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,000
when he comes back to the capital.

72
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
I've been a crown prince for six years.

73
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,400
Now I have a seven-leaf clover.

74
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,200
His Majesty's care for me

75
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,600
is really great.

76
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,200
I can't take a step back.

77
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,800
Hasn't the person who sent Prince Yu

78
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,200
any news yet?

79
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,600
He hasn't been returned yet.

80
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,200
I don't know what the result is.

81
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,400
I've made it clear

82
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,000
that what you want to know is true.

83
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,400
Among the most important princes in Yan State,

84
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,400
only the six princes have no background,

85
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
and their strength is the weakest.

86
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,600
But no one has ever thought

87
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,200
that he would be the one

88
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,200
who took the position of the crown prince

89
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,000
in the end.

90
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
It's just making people think

91
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,400
that's nonsense.

92
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,000
How did the six princes

93
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
do it?

94
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,600
How did the six princes

95
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,200
do it?

96
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,200
The six princes

97
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,400
got a gold-tongued clover

98
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,400
by themselves.

99
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,600
It's that

100
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,800
clover that no one knows.

101
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
The clover that no one knows.

102
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Exactly.

103
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,800
The six princes in the north Yan State

104
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
have no background,

105
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
and no one knows

106
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,600
what they have written.

107
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,600
The seven princes

108
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,400
know that they have the world.

109
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,400
And then?

110
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,800
The six princes

111
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,400
have no background,

112
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
and no one knows

113
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
what they have written.

114
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,800
They know

115
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,200
that they have the world.

116
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,800
Is that all?

117
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,800
They know that they have the world.

118
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,800
Who is the one who wrote it?

119
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,600
Well,

120
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,000
the six princes

121
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,600
can't tell their lives.

122
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,600
It seems

123
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,800
that I have to go to the Wolf's Pavilion myself.

124
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,200
Your Highness, the dinner is ready.

125
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,600
You are using it in the front hall.

126
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,800
Or...

127
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You can go to the front hall.

128
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Your Highness, be careful!

129
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,200
The seal is in the coffin!

130
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Search the assassin!

131
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,400
Forget it.

132
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,200
I know it's from the crown prince.

133
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
After returning,

134
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,600
my father will add the seal again.

135
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,800
If we can't go further,

136
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,800
there will be only one way out.

137
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Your Highness.

138
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Who is the real heir?

139
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
You must ask him.

140
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Who is the real heir?

141
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
You must ask him.

142
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Who is the real heir?

143
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Who is the real heir?

144
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
Who is the real heir?

145
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Tomorrow,

146
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,400
I will go to the Wolf's Pavilion.

147
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Father,

148
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,400
I have confirmed that

149
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
Prince Yu is not in the car.

150
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,600
He must be in the car when he left the city.

151
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,400
There are not many roads to go.

152
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,200
He is like a golden hill.

153
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
It's not that easy.

154
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Let's retreat to the back yard

155
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
and continue to search.

156
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes.

157
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Yes.

158
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,000
Wolf's Pavilion is really famous.

159
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Prince Yu,

160
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,000
it's rare to see such a beautiful view.

161
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,200
The Wolf's Pavilion is always known

162
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,800
for its great power.

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,400
It's a great place to visit.

164
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,400
It's a rare place.

165
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Your Highness is right.

166
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,800
Go up the mountain.

167
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Go up the mountain.

168
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The Wolf's Pavilion

169
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,800
Is it your name?

170
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,600
I'm the famous Wolf's Pavilion.

171
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
I'm from the south.

172
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,400
I'm here to ask for your help.

173
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
You don't have to be polite.

174
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,800
The Wolf's Pavilion is a place to relieve people.

175
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,600
Please choose a key ring over there.

176
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,000
Write down the questions you want to ask.

177
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Put it in the ring.

178
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
After three days,

179
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,800
there will be a necessary price.

180
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,000
If you think the price is right,

181
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,400
then put the money in the ring

182
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,200
according to the price.

183
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,200
The answer will be given to someone.

184
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,800
I know the rules of the Wolf's Pavilion.

185
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,400
But there are different types of people in the world.

186
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Those little ones can be installed.

187
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,200
Of course, they can't be installed.

188
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,800
Am I right?

189
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,200
I see.

190
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,400
Please follow me.

191
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Young Master,

192
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,000
Prince Yu of Daliang is here.

193
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
Give him the well-prepared key ring.

194
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,600
Ask him to open the door after he returns.

195
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,800
Yes.

196
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,000
Prince Yu is here.

197
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,600
The Prince of Daliang should be here.

198
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,200
At that time, give them the same answer.

199
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,200
But...

200
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
I don't know.

201
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
I don't know.

202
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
I don't know.

203
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
But...

204
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
What do you want to say?

205
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,600
Once the Wolf's Pavilion opens and answers the court,

206
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,800
I'm afraid it's not safe.

207
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,600
The problem is that the answer is in the martial arts world.

208
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,400
It's okay.

209
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
This is your answer.

210
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,200
I'm asking you a big question.

211
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,000
Don't you have any more of the Pavilion?

212
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,400
The seal has been changed.

213
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,400
It's not leaving the Pavilion.

214
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,200
It's meaningless.

215
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,000
The price promised to the Pavilion

216
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,600
will be closed within three days.

217
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
How is it?

218
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,000
It's closed.

219
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,000
The seal is closed all night.

220
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,600
Prince Yu and I will never return to the Pavilion.

221
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,600
We just sent the seal to the Wei's family.

222
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The Wolf's Pavilion is closed.

223
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The Wolf's Pavilion is closed.

224
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,000
The Pavilion is closed.

225
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The Wolf's Pavilion is closed.

226
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Wang Rong.

227
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,000
Who is this person?

228
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The Wolf's Pavilion is closed.

229
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's a rare talent in the world.

230
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
No matter what kind of person it is,

231
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,000
he can already be described as the Wolf's Pavilion.

232
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This person is the first name on the Wolf's Pavilion.

233
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Who is this Jiang Zuo Meilang?

234
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Jiang Zuo Meng Zongzhu.

235
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Mei Changsu.

236
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yao Yingrenjian, Snowflake.

237
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,000
An Xiang Youfu, Qu Linjiang.

238
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The world is full of heroes.

239
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Jiang Zuo is the best.

240
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Although Jiang Zuo Meng is the best of the best,

241
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
he is a strong man.

242
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
He has been a strong man for a year.

243
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
No one can forget his past.

244
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What's more,

245
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
he doesn't know how to think about martial arts.

246
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
But he has many masters who listen to him.

247
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
With this achievement,

248
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
it's not a matter of martial arts.

249
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What's more?

250
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Mei Changsu.

251
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Since you are sure that the Wolf's Pavilion is the only one,

252
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
then our action must be fast.

253
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
As long as we can get this talent,

254
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
we won't be in a hurry to be the king.

255
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If it's really a talent,

256
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I will have to be with him.

257
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Fanru, prepare a gift for me.

258
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Your Highness,

259
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
do you want to marry a seven-leafed pig?

260
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You have no idea how to get out of the capital.

261
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Will you marry a seven-leafed pig?

262
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm afraid that...

263
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Why are you hurt?

264
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Is it...

265
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Who else can it be besides the people of the Eastern Palace?

266
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's me.

267
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Since the Eastern Palace has sent someone to assassinate,

268
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
then I'm afraid that the way you went to the Wolf's Pavilion

269
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
has been revealed.

270
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's better to send an old man to leave early tomorrow morning.

271
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
We must see this man before the crown prince.

272
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Send an old man to Langzhou immediately.

273
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
We must get the talent and Mei Changsu to talk.

274
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
How is the matter with the Qing State?

275
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Your Highness, don't worry.

276
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
This time, there will be a great battle in the Heavenly Spring Mountain.

277
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We must be able to break the law of the King of Yu.

278
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Hurry up.

279
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Hurry up!

280
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Hurry up!

281
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's almost time to go to the river.

282
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
We can't chase them anymore.

283
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The Qing Spring!

284
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The Qing Spring!

285
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm Ji Ying, the Yi Shi Lu.

286
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm here to enter the Jiangzuo.

287
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I hope you can forgive me.

288
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The Shang Cha Sect has always been close to the Jiangzuo Alliance.

289
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Since the Chief of the Sect has come here personally,

290
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
how can Changsu not come to the camp?

291
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Since we are here in the Jiangzuo,

292
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
you are my friends.

293
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Fortunately, we didn't fight each other.

294
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
We still have a place to go.

295
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
If we are willing to do so,

296
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
we will be able to make a living.

297
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But if we kill each other,

298
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
the Chief of the Sect will be dead.

299
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
In the place where I live,

300
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
we can't just do that.

301
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Chief Mei.

302
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Those people are the servants of the Qing State.

303
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
We are the servants of our own family.

304
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Do you want to take care of this?

305
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Help!

306
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Chief Ji!

307
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Chief Ji, you are being careful.

308
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's been so long.

309
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I've never heard such stupid words.

310
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Chief Mei, this person is not a person of the Jianghu Sect.

311
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
He always has a clear mind.

312
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I know the rules of the Jiangzuo Alliance.

313
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I hope you can be open to the public.

314
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The Jiangzuo is so cold.

315
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Before the Emperor of the Sect opens the spring,

316
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
don't do business in the water anymore.

317
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yes.

318
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Retreat!

319
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Go back.

320
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Okay.

321
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'll listen to you.

322
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
He is doing work on the charge.

323
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But they don't allow the others to comeagerick.

324
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Please vote.

325
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Well...

326
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I got the reward for it.

327
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
These two kids

328
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
are enough to make me worry.

329
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I heard they sent out a new father yesterday.

330
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Bu Ye and Chongzi were sent to Langzhou

331
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
for a funeral.

332
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I don't know about that.

333
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Of course you don't know about that.

334
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
They went to make a fortune

335
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and they said they knew they would get the world.

336
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
But it's just a white coat of white.

337
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
In fact, the world can take it

338
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
if he says so.

339
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Do you think it's a joke?

340
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yes, yes, yes.

341
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Go, go, go.

342
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Chief,

343
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I've already done

344
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
all the things you asked me to do.

345
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I've arranged for Qiu Zhen to go to Qinzhou.

346
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Do you think it's good?

347
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's good.

348
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Fei Liang, Fei Liang.

349
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You're here.

350
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm back.

351
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I know you.

352
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I don't know where you are.

353
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Fei Liu, what's wrong with him?

354
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
What else can he do?

355
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Someone is here.

356
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
He won't do that.

357
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I'm afraid he's a traitor.

358
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Where's Fei Liu?

359
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Where is he?

360
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Chief Ling has arrived.

361
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
He has to get away.

362
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Are you still waiting for him to be trusted?

363
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Little girl, how much is this?

364
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Ten cents.

365
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Twenty cents.

366
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
What about this?

367
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Twenty cents.

368
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Young Master Yan,

369
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
how can we go back to the capital

370
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
after you've gone so far?

371
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You're not going to bother me.

372
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
It's a very good time to go to the temple.

373
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I can just see him today.

374
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
How can I go around?

375
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
What about this?

376
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Which way?

377
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
The Black funded sarcasm.

378
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Chief Ling,

379
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
that was the battle against the efficient king, right?

380
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Yeah.

381
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Thank you.

382
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm coming next.

383
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Twelve years ago,

384
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Since our Dan and Dashik had fought

385
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
in Meiling,

386
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What are they doing here?

387
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
What do they want to do?

388
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Are you really going to go to the capital with Xiao Jingrui?

389
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
They are noble and not a court official.

390
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's the best way to do it.

391
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
There should be a conclusion.

392
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
If I don't follow them,

393
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
will they really want me to accept the Crown Prince and Prince Yu's invitation

394
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
and go to the capital with a certain identity?

395
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Although Xiao Jingrui has nothing to do with the enemy,

396
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
but his father, Ningguo Hou Xie Yu, is not like that.

397
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
If you live directly in Xie's mansion,

398
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
would it be too risky?

399
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Don't worry.

400
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
The preparations for the capital are not just one day.

401
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Even if I live in the Hou's mansion in Ningguo,

402
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I am still confident.

403
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Okay.

404
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Chief, there is a friend of yours named Xiao Jingrui

405
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
who is your friend.

406
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Please listen to me.

407
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Although you are a long-time-living fox,

408
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
you are the only one who can be with the Chief of Jiang Zomeng.

409
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's not easy.

410
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It was a coincidence that I met him two years ago.

411
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Recently, I heard that he has changed his old skin.

412
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I think that the wolf's breath is cold.

413
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I wrote a letter to him.

414
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I asked him to stay in the capital for a while.

415
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I didn't expect that he agreed.

416
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I am so worried about him.

417
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
He is not a man of the enemy, but he can be called a hero.

418
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't know how he can be so amazing.

419
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Now, I can finally see his real face.

420
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Can you not be so perfect every time?

421
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Are you here to give me a lift or to stop me?

422
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Can I stop you?

423
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I knew it 12 years ago.

424
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You will be back in Jinling City sooner or later.

425
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Since you know that I will be back sooner or later,

426
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I can help you with this.

427
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I didn't say anything about the pulse.

428
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
How do you know that you are fine?

429
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Tell me how long I can last.

430
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Tell me how long you need.

431
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Two years.

432
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Two years is enough.

433
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Take ten doctors.

434
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
When you are in a hurry to finish your meal,

435
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
remember to say hello to the capital city earlier.

436
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
With your permission, I can take ten doctors.

437
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Fei Liu,

438
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
you are going to leave your brother Su to Jinling City.

439
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Why don't you go to the south side with me?

440
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
No, I want to go.

441
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Where are you going?

442
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Jinling City.

443
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Hurry up.

444
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
The police is coming.

445
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Hurry up.

446
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The police is coming.

447
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Hurry up.

448
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Hurry up.

449
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Hurry up.

450
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

451
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Sister Ni Huang.

452
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Sister Ni Huang.

453
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
The most exciting game of the day.

454
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
The horse is running.

455
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
The horse is running.

456
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
The queen of the reward.

457
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
The gold city of the treasure.

458
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
The rich and the rich.

459
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
The reward is more and more.

460
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The reward is more and more.

461
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Hurry up.

462
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Hurry up.

463
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Are you okay?

464
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Not bad.

465
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I've had these tricks this year.

466
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You are very mature.

467
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Sister Ni Huang,

468
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
am I not the most mature?

469
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Or is the gold city of the day more mature?

470
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

471
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
She has the Tianquan Sword and the Dragon Instructor.

472
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I only teach Xia Dong.

473
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Of course, she is more powerful than me.

474
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You are all right.

475
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The gold city is very big.

476
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Sister, next time, don't see us.

477
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
We are our own hands.

478
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So many people are watching.

479
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
It's not easy for you to beat them.

480
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay.

481
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Next time, I'll be alone.

482
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Where have you two been?

483
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I went to pick up a friend.

484
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
She is not well.

485
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I invited her to the gold city to rest.

486
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Did it so quickly fall?

487
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yes.

488
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,840
You can do it,

489
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I feel late.

490
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,000
Harder than mole.

491
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Too late.

492
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,960
Make no mistake.

493
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,000
Lingyi is trying to catch a thief this time.

494
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
to the emperor's grace.

495
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,640
Yes.

496
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,680
The emperor's palace is not

497
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,080
a place where ordinary people can be.

498
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,320
At this time,

499
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,720
father should be in the study.

500
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,800
Brother Su, please.

501
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,520
Jingrui.

502
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,600
I come here to recuperate.

503
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,560
I can save a lot of trouble

504
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,920
with ordinary people.

505
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,480
I'm now a revolutionary.

506
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,000
Don't lose your memory

507
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,160
when you call me.

508
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,560
Don't worry, brother Su.

509
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,280
I remember this.

510
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:25,920
Brother Su.

511
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,120
Xiebi.

512
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,680
You're back.

513
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,600
This is my second brother, Xiebi.

514
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,280
This is Mr. Su Zhe Su.

515
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:32,920
He's my friend.

516
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,240
Mr. Su.

517
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,120
He's a little old-fashioned.

518
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,400
I asked him to come to Jinling to recuperate.

519
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,560
Brother Su's friend

520
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,880
is a noble guest from Xie's Mansion.

521
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,000
Mr. Su,

522
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,320
please stay here.

523
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,480
Please.

524
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,040
Father of Secret Service.

525
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
Father of Secret Service, please.

526
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,480
The old man

527
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,640
came to the Imperial Hall

528
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,600
safely and safely

529
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,960
This drum

530
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,720
will rotate in the hall.

531
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,240
Okay.

532
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,040
Since

533
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,680
this particular case happens,

534
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,960
I'm sure

535
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,520
Your Highness

536
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,760
will figure out

537
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,800
what to do.

538
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,080
Ziying,

539
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,760
brother has returned.

540
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,800
Okay.

541
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,880
I do not know

542
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,240
It's the last time I see you.

543
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,560
I'll leave from the back door.

544
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,320
Brother Su, please.

545
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,800
Greetings, Father Jingrui.

546
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,760
This is such a long time.

547
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,160
I've been mistaken about the Mid-Autumn Festival.

548
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,840
If I dare to do this again,

549
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,040
I'll...

550
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,480
I have a guest.

551
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,320
Greetings, Your Highness.

552
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm Su Zhe.

553
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,960
Greetings, Your Highness.

554
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,440
In the past few days,

555
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,360
I have announced on myã«é³³æ¨

556
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,800
a ÑÐµÑÑæ hour cake

557
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,880
at your table.

558
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,840
When the person gifted with the longest 90 years

559
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:48,080
get to do Bulgaria

560
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,080
I'll help you choose three.

561
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,080
Who will be the final winner?

562
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,080
It depends on your choice.

563
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Now that Mu Qing has already established the position of the King of Yunnan,

564
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,080
why do you still have to be a soloist?

565
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Girls always have to marry early.

566
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,080
Your Majesty's love is in your heart.

567
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,080
Since you have promised to continue, I won't return to this world.

568
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,080
I just want to change the rules.

569
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,080
How do you want to change?

570
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:33,080
The ten winners have the right to fight with me,

571
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
until the winner is in charge.

572
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:41,080
Your Majesty, your martial arts skills are very good.

573
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,080
Who can be your opponent?

574
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,080
If the ten winners can't win,

575
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:51,080
this time, you won't be able to win.

576
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,080
Don't worry.

577
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,080
If you really want to win,

578
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,080
I'll win no matter how good his martial arts skills are.

579
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,080
You know what to do.

580
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,080
Don't waste it.

581
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,080
I'll be sorry for your pain.

582
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,080
You're lying.

583
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:42,080
C motivating SU

584
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,080
Your Majesty.

585
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,080
Since you have the tools, I will leave.

586
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,080
There is nothing to worry about.

587
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Let's meet together.

588
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,080
Let's go.

589
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
Yes.

590
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
I, Xuanjing Si Xia Dong,

591
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,080
greet Your Majesty.

592
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,080
Rise.

593
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,080
Your Highness.

594
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,080
Lord Xia Dong.

595
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,080
Today, on the first stage,

596
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,080
there is a case.

597
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,080
A couple of old men

598
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,080
entered the capital

599
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,080
and reported that the Qing State's palace is full of relatives.

600
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
They have been hiding in Binzhou

601
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,080
for property and property.

602
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
They killed people and so on.

603
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,080
They are in many crimes.

604
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,080
You can go there yourself.

605
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,080
Please tell me.

606
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,080
I think the special envoy

607
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,080
is my secret edict.

608
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,080
I will go to Binzhou

609
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,080
to investigate this case.

610
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

611
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,080
I think we can stay in the capital

612
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,080
and see the result of your visit.

613
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,080
I didn't expect that Your Majesty

614
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,080
would send me out at this time.

615
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,080
Don't worry.

616
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Your Majesty has agreed.

617
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,080
I can personally ask the envoy for a favor.

618
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,080
There is no trouble.

619
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,080
If Your Majesty doesn't agree,

620
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,080
I am afraid that the result of the election

621
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,080
will not suit your intentions.

622
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,080
But he has agreed.

623
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,080
I am afraid that you won't give yourself a chance.

624
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
I only want to keep the marriage

625
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,080
that should not be made.

626
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,080
Actually, I understand.

627
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,080
Although we are close in the army,

628
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,080
we are close in love.

629
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,080
But as long as I don't marry you,

630
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,080
you still mind

631
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,080
the marriage that I and Ling Shi saved.

632
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,080
You can't treat me as your friend.

633
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,080
My husband Nie Feng

634
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,080
was in Ling Shi Hui

635
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,080
at that time.

636
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,080
He was killed by the commander

637
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,080
in the Meili Battle.

638
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,080
He died in the war.

639
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,080
It's hard to kill a father.

640
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,080
I hope you can forgive me

641
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
for this obsession.

642
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,080
But you are not young anymore.

643
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,080
I still hope that you can have a good return.

644
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,080
I hope so.

645
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,080
Actually, this time

646
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,080
His Majesty's election

647
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,080
was his intention.

648
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
If I really didn't find

649
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
Ruyi Lang Jun,

650
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,080
I'm afraid that it's hard to get back to Yunnan.

651
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,080
I hope you can forgive me.

652
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,080
I hope you can forgive me.

653
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,080
I hope you can forgive me.

654
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,080
I hope you can forgive me.

655
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:36,080
The End
