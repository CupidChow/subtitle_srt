Episode 8

2
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:50,340
Greetings to Your Highness the Noble Consort at the Grand Muman and구나.

3
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,280
It's journey is over.

4
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,340
This is me, my humble niece.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is the granddaughter of Lord Liu Cheng.

6
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So this is the granddaughter of Lord Liu Cheng.

7
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's really a warm and elegant place.

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's a good place to eat.

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Thank you for your compliment.

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't worry, Young Marshal.

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I've already known the difficulties.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I won't be able to do anything.

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll be back soon.

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm not in a hurry.

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He's going to be back soon.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm worried about Dong Jie.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
His Majesty has already sent a letter of gratitude.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But he has to get him out of jail.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't know when he'll be back.

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's just a death sentence.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's not that he's not going to send a letter of gratitude.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm trying to turn him against me.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
His Majesty is angry with Xuanjing's private door.

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He must have saved her.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He must have been worried.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm relieved that you're fine.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Just wait a few more months.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You can think of it as a good thing.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I've told you.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're a good person.

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You don't need to do these things.

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The injury in the palace is almost healed.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I heard that you have some problems.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So I've come up with an idea.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I wonder if you can help me.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You mean Xia Dong's case?

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What's your idea?

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The palace is full of people.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Although I want to hide it for a long time,

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I can't replace someone else.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But the imperial court is in a hurry.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There's only a few days before the imperial court is held.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If I can hide it for a few days,

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't know.

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What you mean is

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
to find someone to take you to the prison

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and exchange you with Xia Dongjie?

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You and Mrs. Nie are so close.

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's good that they meet soon.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Why don't I replace them?

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can let them meet as soon as possible.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Even for a few days.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Are you sure?

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The palace is confident that no one will be exposed.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But your wound isn't healed yet.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Doctor Yan said

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
that as long as we can rest in peace,

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
we'll be fine.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Miss Gong, this is a good idea.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
As long as we can be careful

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
during the exchange,

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
don't let Dongjie be promoted.

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We should be able to confuse the officials.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But Miss Gong Yu,

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
it's hard to get married today.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's hard for the princess.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If Dongjie and Nie meet soon,

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
they should thank you.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You...

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hurry up and join the Aomhen Fairy Pujing Entertainment Center 94466.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Come.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You can leave now.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's time. I'll inform you.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes.

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No.

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
A gift.

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What gift?

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
A gift.

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What?

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
She's the one.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
She's the one.

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The owner is the gift.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The shopkeeper.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The shopkeeper.

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The news came out.

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It was reported on June 16th

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
that Prince Jing was the crown prince.

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This news isn't surprising at all.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Although it isn't surprising,

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
it's a good news.

93
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Prince Jing was the crown prince.

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He's a good man.

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You're so lucky.

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're going to finish it.

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Are you happy?

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But if you do it,

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll be happier.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Don't mention it.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Since you've changed

103
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
the special power of your audience,

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
it's getting closer.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't want to waste time.

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Chief.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The news came from Qinzhou.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Jie Yu is dead.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Dead?

110
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
How?

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The official said something happened.

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He was in the market.

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He broke the rock and killed him.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Killed him?

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's so strange.

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But...

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Think about the evil deeds he did.

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He's dead?

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's a little cheaper.

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's cheaper.

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But he's dead.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Now he's in the dark.

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The emperor is in the dark.

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The crown prince is in a high position.

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's a good time to re-examine.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But I have a bad chance.

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What?

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
There's a letter from the princess of Liyang.

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
She'll get it when she's dead.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Will it be too fast?

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The prince hasn't been discharged yet.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Should we wait?

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Of course.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Brother Meng, we received the letter from Feige.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Jie Yu is a hard-working man now.

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
His death can only be passed through a horse.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He doesn't even have the right to be a family member.

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's been two months since he passed the letter to the capital.

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What's wrong with Feiliu?

140
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He's been gone for a day.

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I think the minister is here.

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The minister is so stubborn.

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He knows you're waiting for him.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He'll be here soon.

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Who are you talking about?

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
A wolf in the countryside.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I invited him here to see the doctor.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Great.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Finally, someone has given him the letter.

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You've been so happy since you came back from the palace.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's strange that you're so happy because of the poison.

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Prince Jing is also happy recently.

153
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What's so happy about him?

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Think about it.

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
His burden is getting heavier.

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's hard to face him.

157
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I have you to tell me the truth.

158
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Who is he?

159
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Even if Consort Jing can comfort him,

160
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
he's still a man of honor.

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes.

162
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The higher the position, the less people talk.

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The more bored he is after he becomes the emperor.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Right?

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You tell him your true identity.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Then he'll...

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm talking nonsense again.

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

169
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Please rise.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Your Highness.

172
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Every day is the grand ceremony of the Eastern Palace.

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
How do you look unhappy?

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
How can I?

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Xuanjing Bureau has made a thorough guess.

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Today, they've set up a place to keep the peace.

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The court is doing this.

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What's so unhappy about it?

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Your Highness, the day has been set.

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The imperial decree will be moved in a few days.

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I heard that there aren't many people in the Zhu Lian.

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Your Highness, you can be relieved.

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The people are fighting against each other.

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
How many people are dying without a reason?

185
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If the emperor could guard the emperor's power,

186
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
it wouldn't be like this.

187
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Sometimes, the power of the palace is strong.

188
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Sometimes, the people are falling.

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We can't stop the killing of the people.

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes.

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I thought that although the emperor asked for the emperor,

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
he kept his family's life.

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's hard to make a conclusion that the life is not a life.

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What's the conclusion?

195
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Since the palace of the palace, you've been thinking about it.

196
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm afraid to ask you one thing.

197
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Did you recall the past?

198
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I just entered the world 13 years ago.

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But I still remember the past when the emperor was released.

200
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I wasn't there at that time.

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Tell me.

202
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Although it was a crime,

203
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the past was different from the past.

204
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The capital was like a river flowing through the snow.

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The emperor's life was high.

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
When the emperor was released,

207
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
almost half of the ministers of the court

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
were begging for his life.

209
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But the things were getting worse.

210
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
One person killed another.

211
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Several of the emperor's family were killed.

212
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The wife of the emperor, Princess Jin Yang,

213
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
asked the emperor about the palace.

214
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
When the emperor's wife, Consort Chen,

215
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Lin Yueyao died,

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
she was taken out of the palace.

217
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Who would dare to mention the prince of Qi in the future?

218
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why do you say that?

219
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Your Highness, the person who investigated the prince of Qi is Xia Jiang.

220
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But Xia Jiang has become a criminal now.

221
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I think you have some thoughts about this.

222
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's right.

223
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This is what I think about.

224
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Your Highness,

225
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
the imperial guards in the Eastern Palace

226
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
can never mention the prince of Qi again.

227
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Why not?

228
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Although the emperor of the palace is Xia Jiang,

229
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
he is the emperor's wife.

230
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But his temper is the most important thing.

231
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
His temper is the most important thing.

232
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
If he doesn't have any evidence,

233
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
he will be re-enacted.

234
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
His Majesty will only think that you are

235
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
a criminal who has no intention of committing any crime.

236
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
He will admit the mistakes he made.

237
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
His Majesty will never forgive you.

238
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But you can see from the rebellion in Xia Jiang,

239
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
maybe the truth was not the truth.

240
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Did no one ever mention the truth to the truth 13 years ago?

241
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What happened?

242
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The person who was caught in the trap

243
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
or the person who was caught in the trap

244
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
was not the one who was caught in the trap.

245
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
To be honest with you,

246
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
was the prince of Qi really not important?

247
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The important thing is that

248
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
if he thinks the opposite,

249
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
he can turn the tables at any time.

250
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Your Highness,

251
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
you can't give His Majesty

252
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
such an idea now.

253
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Brother Nie,

254
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
the matter of the Eastern Palace

255
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
has been arranged by Commander Meng.

256
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
After the crown prince is established,

257
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
you can take him out.

258
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't worry.

259
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The wolf I told you about last time

260
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
has also entered the capital.

261
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He is very capable.

262
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
As long as he is able to show you the true colors,

263
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
you can know what to do next.

264
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You say that the prince of Ling is really

265
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
not doing anything serious,

266
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
what kind of beauty is he going to pursue?

267
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You missed the beauty.

268
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
No one can escape.

269
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Prince Ling.

270
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Of course you have to pursue beauty first.

271
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Right?

272
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You really have such a beauty.

273
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's fun.

274
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What are you doing here?

275
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Go and call the emergency room

276
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and cook me a bowl of rice.

277
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I haven't eaten yet.

278
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I see.

279
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's good to have rice.

280
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Hurry up and give me the food.

281
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
If you don't want it,

282
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'll give you the food.

283
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You little impudent.

284
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You are a flying bird.

285
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I came from the south

286
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and ran away from the country.

287
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's the way it is.

288
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
If you don't want the food,

289
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll give you the food.

290
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't you really want to eat?

291
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Fine.

292
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You are very generous.

293
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's not for me.

294
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The patient is here.

295
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I didn't see him.

296
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I think you should be kind too.

297
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's not good to spend

298
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
a lot of time with Dr. Yan.

299
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I won't argue with you.

300
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Hurry up.

301
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Fine.

302
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Let's fight together.

303
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Are you tired?

304
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'll give you a massage.

305
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Forget it.

306
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I have to go to the secret room

307
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
and see the guest.

308
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Tell him something.

309
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
He comes back every day

310
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
to see him.

311
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Can't he come by himself

312
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
to see you?

313
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
He seems to be

314
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
asking for your help.

315
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He is like a master.

316
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yaozhu,

317
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
don't talk nonsense.

318
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He is hiding in the secret room.

319
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I only told you

320
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and even madam didn't know.

321
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You go out.

322
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Don't talk nonsense.

323
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Master told me

324
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
that when he jumped in

325
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
from the window,

326
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Master,

327
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
you are in my room.

328
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't want to know

329
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
but I can't.

330
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
How is he?

331
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Why are you looking at me?

332
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
He looks better than you.

333
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You are better than him.

334
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I don't know

335
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
what he looks like.

336
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I can't help you.

337
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What else do you want me to say?

338
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
How is his personality?

339
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
His personality?

340
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's your three-stage.

341
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't care.

342
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You have never

343
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
cured that poison.

344
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Can you?

345
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You don't trust me?

346
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Then why did you ask me to come here?

347
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm leaving.

348
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Come here.

349
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
If I can find the master,

350
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
who will be tired of asking you to come?

351
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Fei Liu, are you happy?

352
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm not.

353
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Fine.

354
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I admit it.

355
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If he's as sick as you were,

356
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I can't help you.

357
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But this person is not like you.

358
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's just that...

359
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You know that?

360
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
As for the consequences

361
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
after you cure him,

362
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
you must tell him

363
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
to choose by himself.

364
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You're right.

365
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
We can't wait any longer.

366
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
When we get Dong out,

367
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
let them discuss it.

368
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Fine.

369
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I have to say it.

370
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I can't say a single word.

371
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I really have to

372
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
discuss it.

373
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I brought you a big gift.

374
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Did Fei Liu tell you?

375
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What?

376
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Fei Liu.

377
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That's not good.

378
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Why don't you bring Brother Lian Cheng a picture?

379
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I want to use your magic leaves

380
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
to cover your face.

381
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm not going to do that.

382
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm not going to do that.

383
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I want to wrap your magic leaves

384
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
and brush them with oil

385
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
to make them look like wood.

386
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Then I'll roll them down from the mountain.

387
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Fine. Stop fighting him.

388
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What kind of treasure do you want to give me?

389
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
A beauty?

390
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
This is not a normal beauty.

391
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You must be interested in her.

392
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Guess who she is.

393
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You caught Qin Ban Ruo.

394
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What a silly scene.

395
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
How can a beauty

396
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
use the word

397
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
catch?

398
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Does she know where Xia Jiang is?

399
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
She was originally running away with Xia Jiang.

400
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
But Xia Jiang's middle class

401
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
thought she was drunk

402
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
and threw her away.

403
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So...

404
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
But now she's gone mad.

405
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Even if Xia Jiang has the ability to be so great,

406
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
she can't escape this place.

407
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The reason she can't find her way

408
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
is because she's in the capital.

409
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Exactly!

410
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Master Xia.

411
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Does Master Fan have any news?

412
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Master Xia knows His Majesty well.

413
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
In the end,

414
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
he has chosen

415
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
the granddaughter of the middle class,

416
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
as the future Crown Princess of Xiao Jing Yan.

417
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I've been with His Majesty for decades.

418
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I know

419
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
his preferences and intentions.

420
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Let him be a few days later.

421
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'll be more than happy.

422
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
As long as His Majesty

423
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
knows the true identity of Meichang Su,

424
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
he'll know all the truth.

425
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
When His Majesty's favor is over,

426
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
he'll be able to be the heir of Yan Xiao.

427
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Meichang Su's identity?

428
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Master Fan.

429
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You'll know

430
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
when you know.

431
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I've locked the Qin Ban Ruo outside the city.

432
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You can handle it.

433
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
There's a law to deal with it.

434
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You can't do anything about it.

435
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What?

436
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What's the matter with the Hua Clan in the capital?

437
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Have you interrogated them?

438
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I can't blame you for not interrogating them.

439
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I can only say that Princess Xuan Ji

440
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
also saw Qin Ban Ruo's self-pity

441
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
and didn't tell him everything.

442
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And some of them are in the hands of Xia Jiang.

443
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So you don't have any value in this gift?

444
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Fine.

445
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm just asking you.

446
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
After Prince Jing's order,

447
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
how are you going to deal with the Hua Clan?

448
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
In the end,

449
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
there are many people in the Hua Clan

450
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
who are holding the national responsibility.

451
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's their policy to stand in their way, right?

452
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The Hua Clan was in a good mood.

453
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
But after three years,

454
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
they went to Beiyan with the renaissance.

455
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So the renaissance commander and the commander

456
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
killed the Hua Clan.

457
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Everyone was different at that time.

458
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
How could they make the right decision?

459
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Just like the people of this year

460
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
who are calm and honest,

461
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
they also renaissance.

462
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm afraid that

463
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
after Jing Yan's order,

464
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
whether it's the Hua Clan or the current Shu State,

465
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
they have to settle down and take the lead.

466
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm afraid that the military life is not easy.

467
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You are so thoughtful.

468
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It seems that my father told you

469
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
that you didn't remember anything.

470
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Take care.

471
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
You can't get better.

472
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You asked me to do that?

473
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I asked you, right?

474
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I don't care about you.

475
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Have you finished your meal?

476
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Have you finished my egg?

477
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Prince Yu is in the trial.

478
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But his order is still very serious.

479
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
What's your plan next?

480
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I have something urgent to do.

481
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I have to report to His Majesty.

482
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
How is that possible?

483
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
His Majesty is now

484
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
appointed Prince Yu as the criminal.

485
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
He is still in charge of the whole street.

486
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You can't even come here.

487
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
If you want to see His Majesty, I...

488
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Don't worry, Mr. Fan.

489
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I can't see His Majesty for the time being.

490
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
But Mr. Fan, please arrange for me.

491
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I think the message should be good.

492
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'm just an outsider.

493
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I can't help you

494
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
with the message sent by the public.

495
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Aren't you a noble woman in the palace?

496
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
A noble woman?

497
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I asked the imperial decree

498
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
to contact someone for me.

499
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Who?

500
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
The late Crown Prince's mother.

501
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
The noble consort of the Qing Sixth Palace.

502
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The Consort of Yue.

503
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
The Emperor of the Qing Sixth Palace

504
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
The Emperor of the Qing Sixth Palace

505
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
The Consort of Yue

506
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
The Consort of Yue

507
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
The Consort of Yue

508
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
The Consort of Yue

509
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
The Consort of Yue

510
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
The Consort of Yue

511
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
The Consort of Yue

512
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
The Consort of Yue

513
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
The Consort of Yue

514
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
The Consort of Yue

515
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The Consort of Yue

516
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Don't showed your face

517
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
The Consort of Yue

518
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Sooner or later

519
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
the Emperor of the Qing,

520
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
or the Imperial assignment

521
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
will go to the Imperial shot.

522
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
What if he loses?

523
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,520
to serve Donggong

524
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,280
keeping the unity for 9000 years

525
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,560
safe and sound today.

526
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,880
Hereby.

527
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:04,720
Thank you for your kindness

528
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,480
Hurry.

529
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,760
Your Majesty.

530
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,080
Commander.

531
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Chief.

532
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,080
Go find two people and seal the secret room.

533
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,080
Since the first year of the fortification,

534
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,080
how many big news are spread by him?

535
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,080
Now that the seal is completely sealed,

536
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
there is no trace left.

537
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Crown Prince has made his move.

538
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,080
What else do you want to keep?

539
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080
The first day of the fortification

540
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Your Majesty.

541
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
The imperial doctor said you didn't like it.

542
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
You should rest for two days.

543
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,080
I...

544
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
After all, it's old.

545
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080
Crown Prince has made his move.

546
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
Tomorrow,

547
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,080
let him see Li Zheng.

548
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
Yes.

549
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Although Brother Nie has changed a lot,

550
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
but he is only concerned about Dong Jie.

551
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,080
It's a surprise that he can be reunited again.

552
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,080
Can you cure Brother Nie

553
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,080
with the medical skill?

554
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,080
He won't take it easy without his confidence.

555
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,080
What about your illness?

556
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,080
I'm fine now.

557
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,080
I'll be fine.

558
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
Brother Nie, sit.

559
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Dong Jie will be here soon.

560
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,080
He'll be happy to see you later.

561
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,080
Dong Jie.

562
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Dong Jie.

563
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,080
Dong Jie.

564
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,080
It's finally back.

565
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,080
It's finally back.

566
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,180
Grand Dukerias,

567
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,080
I am rising from the throne,

568
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,080
to gather as the late syntax queen and Queen into embantment,

569
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,080
to have the royal crown of the 150thmediate in addition toors,

570
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,080
to ascend into the throne and crown the lower oct lumière ablaze,

571
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,080
and to round up plaster paintings,

572
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,080
deduct an imperial Anaes peacefully in high pikes.

573
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
We're ready to enjoy the zrobić,

574
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,080
and deal with the flame of the fire就業.

575
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,080
The wedding date.

576
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,080
Which one do you prefer?

577
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,080
I'll choose.

578
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
What about July 29?

579
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,080
At that time, the weather was a bit better.

580
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,080
It's not as hot as it is now.

581
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,080
I'll choose.

582
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Since you came back from Mount Jiuan,

583
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,080
you've been thinking about it all the time.

584
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,080
Even His Majesty saw it and asked me.

585
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,080
Do you not like the current Crown Princess Consort?

586
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,080
I'll choose.

587
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,080
What did you say?

588
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,080
I understand your feelings.

589
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,080
But at this time,

590
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,080
the more you want to hold on,

591
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,080
the more you're being sealed.

592
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,080
Prince Yu has fallen in love with you secretly.

593
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,080
No matter what,

594
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:12,080
it's not the right time to mention the past.

595
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,080
I think that's what Mr. Su meant.

596
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,080
Is that so?

597
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,080
Yes.

598
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,080
He even asked Ni Huang to remind me.

599
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,080
He can't be too hasty.

600
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
General Nie and Mrs. Nie,

601
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,080
it's not that I'm killing the scenery.

602
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,080
Can you not do that?

603
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,080
Fine.

604
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,080
I did kill the scenery.

605
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,080
I mean, you two have the right time

606
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,080
to experience this kind of reunion.

607
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Can you hear me

608
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,080
talk about General Nie's illness?

609
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,080
I know you've said that before.

610
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,080
General Nie is very poisoned.

611
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,080
He's called the Poison of Fire.

612
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,080
He's always been the first poison in the world.

613
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,080
His life is at stake.

614
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,080
He can save lives and hide.

615
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,080
He can also be the one who can cure the disease.

616
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,080
General Nie was burned to death by the Poison of Fire.

617
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,080
He was a poison-poisoned man.

618
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,080
He was always in the same boat.

619
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,080
But General Nie fell into the snow pit.

620
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,080
He was bitten by the snow and died.

621
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,080
That's why he's alive.

622
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,720
Youngבעon

623
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,080
Snow詽 only grows up around the forest.

624
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,080
One'schmal joints are very ice-free.

625
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,080
At the same time, it eats up the other bird elements.

626
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,080
ai the wand of the cold.

627
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,080
The other perils and chains get kept secret.

628
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,080
This is the poison of the burning cold.

629
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,080
The Poison of Fire is also called rest assured.

630
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,080
It's so heavy.

631
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,240
just like General Nie

632
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,980
and snake and flying

633
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,660
cannot do that

634
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,720
This poison 82 gibt

635
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,100
that can make that brain approach

636
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,160
but g passenger is the better

637
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,980
In this way it can make people sleep

638
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,500
The physical strength is also meaningless with the common people.

639
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,780
But this torture

640
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,980
is not more clean than death.

641
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,980
General Nie has been holding on for so many years.

642
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,940
But his mind is not what the common people think.

643
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,380
I admire him.

644
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,260
Can this be solved?

645
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,220
With my world being in the wolf's den, I can solve it.

646
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,420
There are two solutions.

647
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,460
A completely solved solution.

648
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,060
A completely unsolved solution.

649
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,860
You can choose.

650
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,860
Of course, I want a completely solved solution.

651
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,060
Mrs. Nie.

652
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:30,060
Please allow me to explain to these two different solutions.

653
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,060
Is there any choice?

654
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,100
The process of solving the poison of the fire is very difficult.

655
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,700
Simply put, it's a repair of the skin.

656
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,780
General Nie is a real man of iron.

657
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,940
Of course, this is a problem.

658
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,220
But if you want to solve it completely,

659
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,900
you need to get rid of the poison of the fire and the bones.

660
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,660
Then you need to make up for it at least for a year.

661
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,540
And then you need to use the ancient machine to make it.

662
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,740
The biggest advantage of this solution is that

663
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,540
after solving the poison, the face and the common people are different.

664
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,100
But the appearance is different from the past.

665
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,580
And the tongue is soft and the back is soft.

666
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,180
You can talk normally.

667
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,380
This broken bone poison is very harmful to human body.

668
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,660
Not only is it internal and internal.

669
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,060
It has been working for more than half a year.

670
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,060
And from this, it is more painful and more avoidable.

671
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,460
It is constantly recurrent and dangerous.

672
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,380
You can't think of the beast of the common people anymore.

673
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,180
What are you talking about?

674
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:39,340
Human body always has a limit that cannot be reached.

675
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,060
If you want to choose this kind of completely solved solution,

676
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,660
you can actually choose to change it.

677
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,380
But if you can take good care of it,

678
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,460
you will be 40 years old. There should be no problem.

679
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,620
Young Master Li, is he...

680
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,180
Brother Meng, don't call me!

681
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,580
How did you tell me?

682
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,700
You said you are weak.

683
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,140
You said you are fine.

684
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,140
But now, you have become like this.

685
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,340
You are still in the capital.

686
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,820
You are still suffering from this.

687
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,740
You don't want to die.

688
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,180
Your fate is not mine.

689
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,020
Have you ever thought about us?

690
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,420
Have you ever thought about us?

691
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,980
Brother Meng, shut up!

692
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,340
You are with him.

693
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,100
He is like a fool. You don't care about him.

694
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,300
Just let him be!

695
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,740
Enough. Stop scolding him.

696
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,820
He is a person with many opinions. You still don't know?

697
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,740
Even if Wei Zheng was not with you,

698
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,060
can you stop him?

699
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,540
Of course!

700
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,140
Stop it!

701
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,780
Ni Huang,

702
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,380
come with me.

703
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,460
I will explain to you.

704
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,300
Stop talking nonsense.

705
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,100
Say it carefully.

706
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,660
What's wrong with Mr. Su?

707
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,700
Fine.

708
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,660
Let's continue to talk about this kind of non-removable solution.

709
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,260
This kind of solution is not bad.

710
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:41,260
It is to keep the poison in your body under control.

711
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,100
It doesn't hurt your human body at all.

712
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,540
After the detoxification, it can keep the poison in place.

713
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,460
It doesn't need to be re-intestinated.

714
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,460
Although the body cannot recover to five people,

715
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,060
it basically has nothing to do with the common people.

716
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:58,260
The most important thing is to think about the future.

717
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,980
But what about the world?

718
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,420
That's right.

719
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,140
But...

720
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,460
The white fur under the soul cannot be removed.

721
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,700
The snake and the ginger can't be removed.

722
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,940
It can't be explained clearly.

723
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,420
Even if it's what you look like now,

724
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,580
I also feel very good.

725
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,900
Feng,

726
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,260
just to spend more time with me,

727
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:33,500
can you just bear it?

728
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,340
Once you recover,

729
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,940
morevenir can create a better place for you.

730
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,380
Until then,

731
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,660
I promise togarrest it naturally.

732
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:48,500
Feng,

733
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,540
I love...

734
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:56,300
Feng you.

735
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,140
I can't live without you,

736
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,780
except for at least a pleasant life that You need.

737
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,780
So
