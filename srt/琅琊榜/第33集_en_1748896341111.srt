00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 22

2
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,400
Your Highness, Your Highness, I can't see you anymore.

3
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
What's wrong?

4
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,360
Don't listen to this girl.

5
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,720
She's a child. She's never seen a maid.

6
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,040
I'm fine.

7
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,320
Your Highness, please forgive me.

8
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
If that's the case,

9
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,000
why don't you let her know?

10
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
Be careful.

11
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,320
Tell me everything from the beginning.

12
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
Yes.

13
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,320
After General Qi was transferred,

14
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,960
the person Mr. Su sent

15
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,440
didn't bother me.

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,840
He just asked me to come back with him.

17
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
And he said

18
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,000
how would Mr. Su

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,680
punish his mother in the capital?

20
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,360
I was in a hurry.

21
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,680
That person said

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,240
Mr. Su's intention

23
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,480
was to take care of Her Highness.

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,520
Is that what he said?

25
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
He said

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,520
if he went to the Wei Ling Palace to report,

27
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
His Majesty sent someone to save Her Highness.

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,720
When he returned,

29
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,120
it was cold.

30
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,920
There was no good thing at all.

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,360
It's better to let Her Highness do the wrong thing.

32
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
After His Majesty came back,

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,720
he saw Her Highness's grievance

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,800
and naturally, he would be more grateful.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,320
The Empress' punishment was more severe.

36
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,560
Anyway, Her Highness

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,360
didn't give birth to a child.

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,280
It was just a slight torment.

39
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,600
He didn't even want to

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,920
hurt His Majesty.

41
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,320
It was just a slight torment.

42
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,720
So, he didn't need to be saved.

43
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,520
How would his mother be hurt?

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,840
Will the Empress

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,920
have a more strict rule?

46
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,520
She doesn't care about that at all.

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,960
Jing Nian,

48
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,520
this girl

49
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,720
is just a mere listener.

50
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,240
She didn't have a real son.

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,920
And I believe

52
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,920
Mr. Su

53
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,960
will never be like that.

54
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,760
Mother, look at you.

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,000
You're just a mere listener.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,880
Can you tell that girl is just a mere listener?

57
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,440
You're just a mere listener.

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,640
She never did such a thing before.

59
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,600
That's what Her Highness thought.

60
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,360
Now, she's like that to her mother.

61
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
She's not a mere listener.

62
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,240
She's not a mere listener.

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,240
I thought she was different from the others.

64
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,040
Jing Nian,

65
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,000
calm down.

66
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,720
You're the one

67
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,520
who made Her Highness worry about me.

68
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,440
This time,

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,400
it's not as you think.

70
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,640
Even if this girl is right,

71
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,280
Mr. Su

72
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,960
didn't do anything wrong.

73
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,160
I didn't expect

74
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,520
that Her Highness would be like

75
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,040
the Empress after His Majesty returned.

76
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,760
Everything is as she wanted.

77
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,280
There's nothing wrong with that.

78
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,200
Your Highness,

79
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,760
it's not that simple.

80
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,600
When the Empress sent people

81
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
to take her away from the street,

82
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,440
Shut up!

83
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,360
Jing Nian!

84
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,520
Jing Nian!

85
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
Your Highness,

86
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
you've known.

87
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,520
I know.

88
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,680
The Wei Zheng Yi

89
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,920
was suppressed in the dungeon of Xuan Jing Zi.

90
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,040
He might be killed at any time.

91
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,760
Your Highness, what do you think?

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,120
I don't know.

93
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
I don't know.

94
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
I don't know.

95
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
I don't know.

96
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
I don't know.

97
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,120
I don't know.

98
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
I don't know.

99
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,240
You should go find Mr. Su.

100
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,960
Damn it.

101
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,300
The DoctorZeng

102
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,060
The actorZeng

103
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,800
кошel

104
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,580
Huang Jin Cheng

105
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,020
Zhao Cai

106
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,760
Aw Nan Xing

107
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,740
The DoctorZeng

108
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,660
The picture with a swollen face

109
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,620
more chance

110
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,520
Here!

111
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,840
diğer

112
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,040
I hope you won't stop in the red room.

113
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,640
I have a Japanese game for you.

114
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,840
What did he say?

115
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,440
I didn't see him at all.

116
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,240
I heard that Mr. Su has been keeping an eye on him.

117
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,040
He's acting strange with Su Zhai.

118
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,840
I think they can't hear anything I say.

119
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,240
What's so strange about it?

120
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,640
Maybe what you said in the past

121
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,240
they don't care at all.

122
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,440
Mother doesn't have to save him.

123
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
He won't die anyway.

124
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,240
It's good that he lost his body.

125
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,440
As for Wei Zheng,

126
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,840
it's no use.

127
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,440
It's just a young man.

128
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,240
There's no point in the current party.

129
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
It's a good idea to not see him.

130
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,840
He must be thinking like that.

131
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,040
Your Highness, you can't ignore him.

132
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
I thought that for over a year,

133
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,640
he was already thinking about it with his mood.

134
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,840
I didn't expect that he would do such a thing.

135
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,240
That's why I found out that

136
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,040
this is just my mistake.

137
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,840
Let's talk about Mr. Su.

138
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,240
Let him come up with a plan.

139
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
No matter what,

140
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Mr. Su has many ideas.

141
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,240
Will Chou say something like,

142
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,440
welcome to the grandальная- drawing for an attack on people living here?

143
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,240
Leave her alone.

144
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,440
He doesn't care about me or you.

145
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,640
Shu Ke,

146
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,640
I want to hold on.

147
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,040
Xia Jiang said that the people in the gate of the city

148
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,640
were Wei Zheng's comrades.

149
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,080
But what's their identity?

150
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,640
They didn't even reveal their identity.

151
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Xuan Jing Si didn't die in the city.

152
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Xuan Yang must be worried about it.

153
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
You should let the people in the patrol camp pay attention.

154
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,640
Don't let Xuan Jing Si catch more people.

155
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Yes.

156
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,640
Your Highness, let's meet in the past.

157
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
Your Highness, General Lie.

158
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,640
Why are you here?

159
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Is there anything?

160
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,640
Your Highness, you came out of the palace today.

161
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Did you have anything to discuss with me?

162
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,640
Yes, of course.

163
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,640
Do you know that Wei Zheng, the father of Chi Yu Ying,

164
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
was caught by Xia Jiang?

165
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
I know.

166
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,640
He is locked in Xuan Jing Si's dungeon.

167
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
That's exactly what we thought.

168
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
We thought that Wei Zheng was in a deep trance.

169
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
He was still alive.

170
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
But he is now in the city.

171
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
He should be saved.

172
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Your Highness, as the saying goes,

173
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,640
the emperor's will is unparalleled.

174
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,640
Please think twice before you think.

175
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,640
General, I understand your feelings.

176
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,640
But please think carefully.

177
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
No matter what kind of plan I have,

178
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,640
I must personally face the truth.

179
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,640
These years, you have suffered a lot

180
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
for the sake of Chi Yan.

181
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,640
If you leave this place,

182
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,640
you will surely upset His Majesty

183
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,640
and lose the great favor of En Chong.

184
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Don't worry about that.

185
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,640
Before the meeting today,

186
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,640
I have already upset my father because of this.

187
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,640
I am afraid that I can't come back now.

188
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,640
I am very happy that you can leave this place today.

189
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,640
As long as Wei Zheng is still locked in Xuan Jing Si's dungeon,

190
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Prince Yu will still be in the battle.

191
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,640
No matter what method you use to rescue Wei Zheng,

192
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,640
you will fall into their trap.

193
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Don't you understand?

194
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
Of course I understand.

195
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Chi Yan's case is the most deep one

196
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,640
between me and my father.

197
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,640
I have already made a promise to Wei Zheng.

198
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
I just want my father to understand

199
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,640
that he has a grudge against me.

200
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,640
Once you give me the right to do so,

201
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,640
I will be a prince who is dangerous to my father.

202
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
Because in that case,

203
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
the person with the greatest responsibility

204
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,640
is my father.

205
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,640
You always talk about Chi Yan.

206
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,640
You know everything.

207
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,640
So His Majesty has never thought about it.

208
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,640
But he is not a person with a broad heart.

209
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,640
If His Highness continues to act,

210
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,640
he will definitely feel that the power of his body

211
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
is not limited to his own.

212
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,640
This time, the sword of Prince Qi

213
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
is in front of His Highness.

214
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Minister Su has said so much.

215
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,640
What should Wei Zheng do?

216
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,640
Your Highness, you want to rescue Wei Zheng

217
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,640
because of love.

218
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,640
Can you tell me?

219
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,640
There is no power in saving Wei Zheng.

220
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
Your Highness,

221
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,640
the great-grandson,

222
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,640
knows how to sing.

223
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
What you mean is

224
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
that you are not going to save him?

225
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
Fine.

226
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
I have already said

227
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
what I should have said.

228
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
Very well.

229
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
I have already understood

230
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
your point of view.

231
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Thank you.

232
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Your Highness.

233
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,640
Your Highness.

234
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,640
Your Highness.

235
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,640
I once thought that

236
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Mr. Su would be a different kind of monster.

237
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,640
I didn't expect that this time

238
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
you would see clearly.

239
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
You are also very active.

240
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,640
You have no talent and conscience.

241
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,640
If I had been a master from Mr. Su,

242
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
I would have left all the moral and human love in my heart

243
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
and only wanted to take the throne.

244
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,640
What would I have done to take the throne?

245
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
Once I have become that kind of person,

246
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,640
I will be able to take the throne.

247
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,640
I will find someone who will be a good person.

248
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Don't you worry

249
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,640
that I will also help you

250
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,640
to help me to stop my anger in the future?

251
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,640
Until now,

252
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
you don't want to give up.

253
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
I have nothing to say.

254
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,640
The so-called Taoism is not the same.

255
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,640
I have been a coward for years.

256
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
I will not let you down.

257
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,640
What do you mean?

258
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,640
You have entered the world.

259
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,640
What do you mean?

260
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,640
How could you not know?

261
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Zhan Ying!

262
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,640
Go!

263
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
Your Highness! Your Highness!

264
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,640
Your Highness!

265
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,640
Your Highness, don't be angry.

266
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,640
Stop him!

267
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Chief,

268
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
the door is locked.

269
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Tell me honestly.

270
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,640
Did anything else happen

271
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
when I was sick?

272
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
Nothing.

273
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
It was General Wei and Tong Lu's fault.

274
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
And Consort Jing

275
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
said that she was put in a difficult position

276
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,640
and was imprisoned in Zhengyang Palace for a few days.

277
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
But she can't blame you, right?

278
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,640
No matter what happens,

279
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,640
at this moment,

280
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
I can't let Prince Jian

281
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
act like a fool.

282
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Go back now.

283
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,640
Your Highness, is it true

284
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,640
that you plan to kill Lu Dugu?

285
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
No matter what,

286
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
I think Mr. Su

287
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
is really in your favour.

288
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
So,

289
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
don't let things happen

290
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,640
on his mind.

291
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,640
Don't be too cunning.

292
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,560
If it weren't for the

293
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,640
intention of killing him,

294
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,640
and the intention of killing Tong Lu,

295
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,640
I wouldn't have been so disappointed.

296
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,640
But in this situation,

297
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
if we didn't help Su Xian,

298
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,640
how could we have saved Wei Zheng?

299
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,640
You heard what he said.

300
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,640
But he wanted to save Wei Zheng.

301
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
He was just talking about the anger of the people.

302
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,640
It's not reasonable.

303
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
You...

304
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,640
I'm so surprised.

305
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
But, Your Highness,

306
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,640
Mr. Su is from another country.

307
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,640
He doesn't know

308
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,640
the relationship between Wei Zheng and us.

309
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,640
Your Highness,

310
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
can you please talk to him?

311
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
The great man is still alive.

312
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
He has his reasons and his weaknesses.

313
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
There's nothing to discuss.

314
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
No matter how much he says,

315
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
no matter how much he says,

316
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,640
he doesn't want to let me

317
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
be so arrogant.

318
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Chief,

319
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
if you have anything,

320
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
you can just tell us.

321
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,640
Doctor Yan said that you can't leave now.

322
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
Chief,

323
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
please send Commander Meng to persuade Prince Jing.

324
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
If you're...

325
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Chief,

326
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
you're ill.

327
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,640
I'm afraid that this is not worth fighting with Prince Jing.

328
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
Zhen Bing,

329
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
if I heard you guys

330
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
lying in bed now,

331
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,640
I would have been in the trap

332
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,640
of Prince Jing's falling into the river.

333
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Do you think I'm useless

334
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
after I'm cured?

335
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
Your Highness,

336
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,640
I don't know what I did wrong.

337
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,640
Please forgive me.

338
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
Forget it.

339
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
You may leave.

340
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Your Highness.

341
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
You may leave.

342
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
Yes.

343
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Be careful.

344
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
Your Highness.

345
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
You said that you were pretending to be in a trap

346
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
and then found the opportunity to escape.

347
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,640
Yes.

348
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
This excuse

349
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,640
can only escape from the Palace of Poison.

350
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
How did you get out

351
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,640
of that Chong Chong gate?

352
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
It was Consort Hui's

353
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,640
little gold to help me.

354
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,640
She just had a cousin

355
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,640
who was a little girl.

356
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
That's right.

357
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
You should have told me

358
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,640
about these things earlier.

359
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Take the silver

360
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
and give me the little gold

361
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,640
and her cousin.

362
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Yes, Your Highness.

363
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Your Highness,

364
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
I'm sorry.

365
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,640
I'm sorry.

366
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
Your Highness,

367
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
the message from the Palace of Poison

368
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
has been sent by His Majesty.

369
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Get ready to see her.

370
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,640
What is Prince Jing doing?

371
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Our Sect Leader has been waiting

372
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
for almost half an hour

373
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
in this place.

374
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
He hasn't even got a tiger's den yet.

375
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Our Prince Jing's Mansion

376
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
is always full of tigers.

377
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
What did you say?

378
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
Ren Ping.

379
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Ren Ping.

380
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
Mr. Su.

381
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
You still have some things to do.

382
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Please go back to the room.

383
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Please tell His Highness

384
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
that if he doesn't come to see me today,

385
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
I won't go back.

386
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
Mr. Su.

387
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Are you really

388
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
not going to let His Highness

389
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
save Wei Zheng?

390
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
You let Prince Jing come to see me.

391
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
I will make it clear to him.

392
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,640
Do you feel better now?

393
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,640
Much better.

394
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,640
You all can leave now.

395
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,640
Yes.

396
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Sit.

397
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Yes.

398
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
Jing Fei.

399
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
What can I do for you?

400
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,640
When you get to take that case,

401
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
I will take it.

402
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
You can take it.

403
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
I will.

404
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
Jing Fei.

405
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
I will.

406
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
I will.

407
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
I will.

408
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,640
What do you think?

409
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,640
Your Majesty.

410
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,640
How can I ask you this?

411
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,640
You only know how to answer.

412
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
What do you think?

413
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
I...

414
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
I will be honest.

415
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Your Majesty.

416
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
I dare not answer.

417
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,640
No matter how I answer,

418
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
it's hard to make you feel sad.

419
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,640
I apologize first.

420
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Please forgive me.

421
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,640
What do you think?

422
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
I will.

423
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
I will.

424
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
I will.

425
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
I...

426
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,640
I am from the Lin family.

427
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,640
I have been living with Consort Chen since I was a child.

428
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,640
If I were to be unfair to you,

429
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,640
Your Majesty wouldn't dare to hurt me.

430
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,640
Consort Chen is innocent.

431
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
She is not guilty.

432
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,640
If I were to be jealous of Consort Chen's old love,

433
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
and I would be jealous of her,

434
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,640
and I would be jealous of her old love,

435
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,640
then I would feel

436
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,640
that I don't know how hard you worked to stabilize the situation.

437
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,640
I will.

438
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,640
Please forgive me.

439
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
Forget it.

440
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
You are kind-hearted.

441
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
I shouldn't have done that for you.

442
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Get up.

443
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
Yes.

444
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
You have been in the palace for more than 20 years.

445
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
I don't know you.

446
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
You...

447
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,640
You and Consort Chen,

448
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,640
are different from the Empress and Noble Consort Yue.

449
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,640
You shouldn't have involved yourself in the palace's affair.

450
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
I understand.

451
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,640
Your Majesty was also kind-hearted to Consort Chen.

452
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Your Majesty was also kind-hearted to Consort Chen.

453
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
You were kind-hearted to Consort Chen.

454
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,640
Your Majesty also knew

455
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,640
that although Consort Chen was in the palace for a long time,

456
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
she was a kind-hearted person.

457
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,640
She was kind-hearted.

458
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,640
She was kind-hearted to Consort Chen.

459
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,640
How could she be willing to be jealous of her?

460
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,640
I understand her.

461
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,640
Instead of saying that

462
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,640
she committed suicide to make up for her crimes,

463
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,640
she should have said

464
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,640
that she was afraid that she couldn't face Your Majesty

465
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,640
and felt that she would be heartbroken.

466
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,640
You have been in the palace for so many years.

467
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,640
Now, in the palace,

468
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,640
you are the only one who dares to talk to me about Consort Chen.

469
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,640
If it weren't for Your Majesty's kindness,

470
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,640
I wouldn't dare to lie.

471
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,640
I was in the hall the other day.

472
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
I was so tired.

473
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,640
She appeared in front of me

474
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,640
all the time.

475
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,640
I almost forgot

476
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,640
her.

477
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,640
But the day before yesterday,

478
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,640
I realized

479
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,640
that many things that were young

480
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
were completely forgotten.

481
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,640
I was just wondering

482
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,640
why Your Majesty was so embarrassed today.

483
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,640
So, it was because of seeing Yan Hao?

484
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
It wasn't because of him.

485
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,640
I only remember so many things.

486
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,640
It was because Xia Jiang came to the palace today

487
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
and told me

488
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,640
that she caught a criminal who was a bastard.

489
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
Mr. Su.

490
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
What's wrong?

491
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
What's wrong?

492
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
Are you all right?

493
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
I'm fine.

494
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
Li Gang passed down my plan.

495
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
Why did he start fighting again?

496
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
Where is he?

497
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
He won't throw you out of the palace, right?

498
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,640
No, he hasn't even shown me his face for half an hour.

499
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
He thought that our princess had something to do with him.

500
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,640
He didn't want to do anything to him.

501
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
How could he do that?

502
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Where is he?

503
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
I was looking for him.

504
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
How could he do that?

505
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
Your Highness.

506
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,640
Mr. Su.

507
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
What's the problem?

508
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,640
I've made it clear.

509
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,640
Before Your Highness made it clear,

510
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,640
I didn't make it clear.

511
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,640
I've already understood what you mean.

512
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
In the eyes of the Mongols,

513
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
maybe we can't fight for justice.

514
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,640
There's no doubt about it.

515
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
But in my eyes,

516
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
it's a matter of no need to worry.

517
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
We must do it.

518
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,640
If we can't achieve this,

519
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,640
then it's meaningless to say more.

520
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,640
You mean,

521
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,640
we must save Wei Zheng, right?

522
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Yes.

523
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,640
But if we do,

524
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,640
we'll pay a lot of price.

525
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
Even if we put ourselves in,

526
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,640
we might not be able to save him.

527
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,640
How would we know if we didn't try?

528
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Wei Zheng is just a deputy of Chi Yuying.

529
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,640
Is it worth it?

530
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,640
After I die,

531
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,640
I'll see Chi Yuying's main general, Lin Shu.

532
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,640
If he asks me,

533
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,640
why didn't I save his deputy?

534
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Can I answer him?

535
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
I know.

536
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,640
Since you've decided,

537
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,640
then let me arrange it.

538
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,640
But no matter what,

539
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,640
you can't leave.

540
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Also,

541
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Prince Jin can't come in directly.

542
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,640
I can only do this.

543
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,640
I'll find a way to save Wei Zheng.

544
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
No.

545
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
No.

546
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
What?

547
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,640
I can't.

548
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,640
I don't know.

549
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,640
It's been more than ten years.

550
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
We can still save him.

551
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,640
I'm really disappointed.

552
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,640
Yes, yes.

553
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,640
I didn't expect that.

554
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,640
I don't know which one is a criminal.

555
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
You know it.

556
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
You know it?

557
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,640
It's Lin Shu.

558
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,640
They caught Xia Shu?

559
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,640
It's the deputy of Lin Shu.

560
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,640
That's Wei Zheng.

561
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
Yes.

562
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,640
Yes.

563
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,640
His Majesty came in without permission.

564
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,640
He brought me here.

565
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,640
How could Xia Shu be here?

566
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,640
He scared me.

567
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,640
You're blaming me for that?

568
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,640
You're really confused.

569
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,640
You scared yourself.

570
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,640
In Meiling,

571
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Xia Jiang was the one who killed the Emperor.

572
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,640
If anyone is the most likely to be escaped,

573
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,640
that's Lin Shu.

574
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,640
I'm sure that

575
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,640
you know what I'm saying.

576
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,640
But, Your Majesty,

577
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Jing Yan is very stubborn.

578
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
I'm afraid that

579
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,640
he has something to do with it.

580
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Please don't argue with him.

581
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,640
That's why I told you so many reasons today.

582
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,640
You should also forgive Jing Yan.

583
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Don't be so stupid.

584
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,640
If he still wants to be stubborn and confused

585
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,640
and not know how to be smart,

586
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,640
then don't blame me.

587
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
You should forgive him.

588
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,640
Understand?

589
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
Yes.

590
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Do you still remember

591
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,640
the rules I made for you

592
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,640
when Princess Ni Huang was in danger?

593
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,640
What else?

594
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
You've already done the same thing

595
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,640
twice.

596
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,640
I can't just watch you do it again.

597
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,640
You're doing it again.

598
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,640
You've done what you're doing

599
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,640
and you're still in my way.

600
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,640
I can't believe you anymore.

601
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
You think I'm trying to fool you?

602
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
You think I won't be stubborn

603
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
and save Wei Zheng?

604
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
Isn't that so?

605
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
Your Highness,

606
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
think about it again.

607
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
Mr. Su isn't such a person.

608
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,640
In the time I left the capital,

609
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,640
you know what Mr. Su did.

610
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,640
Maybe,

611
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
I didn't have the right to do it.

612
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,640
Maybe,

613
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,640
the current situation will be cut off.

614
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,640
But I must do it

615
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,640
for Wei Zheng.

616
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,640
You're a talented man.

617
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,640
You can take the responsibility.

618
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,640
You chose the wrong person

619
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,640
at the beginning.

620
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Your Highness.

621
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,640
Your Highness.

622
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,640
Your Highness.

623
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
Xiao Yan, stop!

624
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,640
Mr. Su.

625
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,640
No matter what you say,

626
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,640
you can't stop me.

627
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
If I don't stop you today,

628
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,640
what do you want to do?

629
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
Is it to attack the palace

630
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,640
and force His Majesty to release Wei Zheng?

631
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,640
Or to take your soldiers

632
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
to the capital?

633
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,640
Or to save Wei Zheng?

634
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,640
That's better than

635
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,640
telling the truth.

636
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
The Prince of Jin is a traitor.

637
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,640
He can't do that.

638
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
Xiao Yan!

639
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,640
You're so kind.

640
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,640
But why are you so stupid?

641
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,640
The fire that was in the capital

642
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,640
was not enough to burn it.

643
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,640
The blood of the Prince of Jin is not enough to boil it.

644
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,640
How many lives do you want to take?

645
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,640
Tell me!

646
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,640
I don't care if you believe me.

647
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,640
But if you want to save Wei Zheng,

648
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,640
you can't do it without my help.

649
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,640
At that time, what do you want to do

650
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,640
to meet your brother?

651
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,640
Hurry up and join the

652
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,640
9994466.com

653
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,640
Your Highness,

654
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,640
I understand your feelings.

655
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,640
When they needed you the most 13 years ago,

656
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,640
you were not with them.

657
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,640
This anger,

658
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,640
this suffering,

659
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,640
you didn't have a clear conscience today, did you?

660
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,640
I know that you are aware

661
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,640
of this.

662
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
How could I deny you?

663
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,640
I will definitely save Wei Zheng.

664
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,640
I hope that you can take the big picture now.

665
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,640
There is no need to make a fuss.

666
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,640
You can't be caught in the face of the truth.

667
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,640
You can do this, right?

668
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,640
Your Highness.

669
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
Your Highness.

670
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
What do you think?

671
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,640
Please stand up.

672
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,640
Your Highness.

673
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,640
Don't worry.

674
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Prince Yu and Xia Jiang

675
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
were the ones who came to save Prince Jing.

676
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,640
Wei Zheng will not have any life-saving worries.

677
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
What you said is right.

678
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
That's because of their intention,

679
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,640
we have the opportunity and time to save them.

680
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,640
This time, the gate of the city is closed.

681
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,640
Jiang Zomeng's brother is in grave danger.

682
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,640
Zhen Ping,

683
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
I heard that you got hurt too.

684
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,640
Are you all right?

685
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
I asked the general about it.

686
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,640
It's just that I'm not well.

687
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
That's good.

688
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,640
Xia Qiu was in the imperial palace in the west gate.

689
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,640
It was you.

690
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,640
This time, the operation was too hasty.

691
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,640
Naturally, it was hard to enter the artificial world.

692
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,640
I don't know

693
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,640
if Jiang Zomeng has saved you.

694
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,640
But why didn't you inform Zhan Yin about the operation?

695
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,640
How?

696
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,640
Did he take your soldiers

697
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,640
or Xun Fangying?

698
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,640
I didn't know he would do that.

699
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
Your Highness, you just came back from the capital.

700
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,640
You got such news.

701
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,640
I was so worried about you.

702
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,640
It's hard to avoid the chaos.

703
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,640
Mr. Su, don't mind.

704
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
Yes, Mr. Su.

705
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,640
You said that you would continue to save Wei Zheng.

706
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,640
How should I save him?

707
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,640
You must be tough.

708
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
You must be tough?

709
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,640
I've been to Xuanjing Temple.

710
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,640
I've been to the Heavens.

711
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
I want to do something there.

712
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,640
I'm afraid that I'll be more dangerous than the city gate.

713
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,640
I know this is a good idea.

714
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
But there's no better way.

715
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,640
If you go to the emperor to beg for mercy,

716
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,640
you'll be punished for your relationship with him.

717
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
Besides,

718
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,640
this matter

719
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,640
was supposed to pay for it.

720
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,640
But it's not a complete plan.

721
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,640
Since we've decided to do it,

722
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,640
we must make it as soon as possible.

723
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,640
The longer we take it out,

724
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
the deeper the matter will be.

725
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,640
Without Xue Guang,

726
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,640
how can we get rid of this matter?

727
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,640
Since that's the case,

728
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,640
I can't let Mr. Jiang's alliance be in danger.

729
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
I'm just sitting next to him.

730
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,640
What you said is true.

731
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,640
I've saved Wei Zheng.

732
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,640
I can't just stand by and watch.

733
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
I can save Wei Zheng.

734
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
I'll give you a hand.

735
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,640
Xuanjing Temple is a great place.

736
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,640
You can take the blame.

737
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,640
Once you're caught,

738
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,640
I'll make you a witness

739
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,640
and take part in the royal family.

740
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,640
You're right.

741
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,640
In the capital,

742
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,640
if there's someone else besides me,

743
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,640
would there be someone else

744
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,640
who would be so brave to save Wei Zheng?

745
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,640
Even if Xia Jiang didn't catch me,

746
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
as long as he says I'm behind this,

747
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
I'll give him a lot of credit.

748
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,640
So, once we've tried,

749
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,640
I can't get rid of him.

750
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,640
You're right.

751
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Even if our plan is not in the best condition,

752
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,640
as long as someone else is there to save Wei Zheng,

753
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,640
His Majesty will still suspect you.

754
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,640
How can this be?

755
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,640
Since Xia Jiang has made a mistake,

756
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,640
you can't get rid of him.

757
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,640
You have to be prepared.

758
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
It's been a long time.

759
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,640
I'm afraid you'll have to bear the cold and the pressure.

760
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
I'm used to this.

761
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
The city is in the sky,

762
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,640
but there's someone else in the city.

763
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
I won't give up easily

764
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,640
until the last moment.

765
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,640
General Nian Guan,

766
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,640
Wei Zheng is in Xia Jiang's hands now.

767
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,640
He won't take the risk of his first attack.

768
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
But remember,

769
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,640
no matter how careful he is,

770
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,640
you must be patient.

771
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,640
After these days,

772
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,640
it's good that you wait for someone to come back.

773
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
Wait for someone? Who?

774
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,640
Xia Dong.

775
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
Junior Brother,

776
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
you're here to look for the criminal again.

777
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
Senior Brother.

778
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,640
Master has already told me not to worry about you.

779
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,640
Junior Brother, you don't know

780
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,640
that the master I met at the west gate

781
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,640
was really suspicious.

782
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,640
He was not able to defend himself.

783
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,640
No matter how good he is,

784
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,640
he's just alone.

785
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Are you afraid that someone will

786
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,640
steal Wei Zheng's place

787
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,640
and take him to Xuanjing Temple?

788
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,640
Master, this is an internal situation.

789
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,640
How can Wei Zheng come to the capital without Wei Zheng?

790
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,640
Don't worry.

791
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,640
Master won't be careless.

792
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,640
Junior Brother,

793
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,640
this is the place I can't think of.

794
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,640
Why must you deal with Prince Jin?

795
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,640
Although Prince Jin has been close to Chi Yan,

796
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,640
but at that time,

797
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,640
he wasn't involved in the shooting.

798
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,640
He wasn't even a criminal.

799
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
Master must have his reason for doing this.

800
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,640
You can listen to me.

801
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Don't think too much about Qi Yu.

802
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
I don't think much.

803
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,640
I don't believe in you either.

804
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,640
This time,

805
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,640
I feel that there are some strange things.

806
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,640
Even Dong Er doesn't know where he went.

807
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,640
Do you know when Dong Er will return?

808
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
Xia Dong?

809
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
If we want to break Xuanjing Temple's old people,

810
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,640
it's impossible to do it.

811
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,640
But if Xia Dong returns,

812
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,640
we'll have hope.

813
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,640
But he's Xia Jiang's disciple after all.

814
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,640
Are you sure he'll help you?

815
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,640
He's not helping me,

816
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
nor are you helping him.

817
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,640
He's helping his father's comrades.

818
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,640
Xia Jiang killed Nie Feng with his back-to-back.

819
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
He's already been abandoned.

820
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,640
According to Xia Dong's mood,

821
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
he can't be taken by his master now.

822
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,640
As long as he's willing to give up,

823
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,640
we'll make it.

824
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,640
The wind blows.

825
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,640
The wind blows.

826
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,640
The wind blows.

827
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,640
The wind blows.

828
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,640
The wind blows.
