00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Do you like this book a lot?

3
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes.

4
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,500
This book

5
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,500
reminds me of the days before I entered the palace.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,500
Is the book on this book

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,300
written by Mr. Su, the one you often mentioned?

8
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,700
Yes.

9
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,700
The one who wrote this book

10
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
should be the one who wrote the book

11
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,700
for Ji Yue Qing Feng, the man who made the book.

12
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,700
How could I hear you say that

13
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,700
Mr. Su is indeed a man

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,700
who has a deep thought

15
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,700
and is very considerate.

16
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,700
Mr. Su is a very face-to-face person.

17
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,700
Sometimes, I feel that

18
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,700
he makes me feel sad.

19
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,700
Sometimes, I feel that

20
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,700
he is a man who is very considerate.

21
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,700
He has a deep thought and is very considerate.

22
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,700
He is not a man who is very considerate.

23
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,700
What?

24
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,700
Why did mother suddenly think of asking him?

25
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,200
You are very considerate.

26
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,200
You should learn from your brother and Lin Shi.

27
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,200
You should make the world more comfortable.

28
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,700
You should make the world more comfortable.

29
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,700
I am proud of you.

30
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,700
Unfortunately,

31
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,700
I am weak.

32
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,700
I don't have much attention on you.

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Of course, I hope

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,700
that you can help your daughter

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
to achieve her goal.

36
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,700
I understand your intention.

37
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,700
Mr. Su,

38
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,700
I think he is very good.

39
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,200
He abandoned the mirror of the Crown Prince's Prince.

40
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,200
He helped you with his heart.

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
But he never succeeded.

42
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
You always have a long life ahead of you.

43
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,700
I didn't have any good looking.

44
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,700
I just think

45
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,700
it is really hard to be like Mr. Su.

46
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,200
For him,

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,700
you should be more considerate

48
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,200
than others.

49
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
No matter what the outcome will be,

50
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,700
don't forget that

51
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,200
he has been supporting you since the beginning.

52
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Mother has said it.

53
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
What?

54
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Mother has been asking me

55
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,700
about the matter of the person

56
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
who was criticized by me

57
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,200
after reading this book.

58
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
She also told me

59
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
to treat Mr. Su well.

60
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
She is very considerate of him.

61
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Why did she mention it again today?

62
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
I am afraid that I have forgotten

63
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,200
or I think Mr. Su is very important.

64
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
He is

65
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
too old to forget.

66
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Look,

67
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
he has said it again

68
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
and again.

69
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
I am so old.

70
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
I am old.

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
I am sorry for my mistake.

72
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,700
All right.

73
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,700
You have grown up.

74
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,700
You have been taking care of me.

75
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,700
I am happy.

76
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,700
I don't care about the other things.

77
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,700
You just have to...

78
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,700
You just have to...

79
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,700
You just have to...

80
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,700
You just have to...

81
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,700
I know.

82
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,700
Your Highness.

83
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
What is it?

84
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,700
Your Highness,

85
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,700
the message from the Wuyin Hall is coming.

86
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,700
His Majesty has already set off to our palace.

87
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,700
Please prepare to take off.

88
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
I know.

89
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
Come.

90
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
I prepared two cups of desserts.

91
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
One for you

92
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
and the other for Mr. Su.

93
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,200
I will

94
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
thank him for his help.

95
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,200
I am relieved.

96
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
I will take my leave.

97
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
I will be back soon.

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
I will be back soon.

99
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,700
I will be back soon.

100
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,700
Let's go, Your Highness.

101
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Let's go.

102
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
What does it mean without the letter?

103
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,700
Do you still want to give it back to me?

104
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
No, no, no.

105
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
Well,

106
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,700
I...

107
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,700
I heard that

108
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,700
the letter was taken by Consort Jing.

109
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,700
Uncle.

110
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,700
Don't...

111
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,700
Don't be anxious.

112
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,700
Don't be anxious.

113
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,700
Consort Jing is

114
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,700
too bored in the palace.

115
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
She...

116
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,700
Don't you think that

117
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,200
those two words are very small?

118
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,700
I don't think

119
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,700
Consort Jing will notice it at all.

120
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,200
She won't notice it.

121
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
I am done eating.

122
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
I will take you to the palace.

123
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,700
I hope as you wish.

124
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Your Highness.

125
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Tian Ziying has finished the work on the side.

126
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Do you want to give the troops back?

127
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Yes.

128
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Your Highness, you have been reading this book for several days.

129
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
Do you have any secrets?

130
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
I just couldn't find any secrets.

131
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
That's why I had to think so hard.

132
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Is there a problem with the letter?

133
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I read the letter one by one.

134
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
I even took it out.

135
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
I read it again and again.

136
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
But I couldn't find any secrets.

137
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
There's no problem.

138
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Isn't it good?

139
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Maybe.

140
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
But if it's really just a normal letter,

141
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
why does a letter that is always firm

142
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
and the letter is always so important?

143
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Why does it even have a lot of mongzhi?

144
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
It's not a good idea.

145
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Especially mother.

146
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
She has been living in the palace for more than 20 years.

147
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,200
What is the secret in this book?

148
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
To be so sure of her,

149
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,200
she has to mention this stranger who is secretly looking for her.

150
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Your Highness,

151
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
the Empress sent someone to send two boxes of food.

152
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
I see.

153
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Put it in my bedroom.

154
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Go inside.

155
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Yes.

156
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
As long as she sends food and food,

157
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
she has become a double-edged sword.

158
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Send this book to the Manchu Manchu Manchu.

159
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Yes.

160
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
Your Highness.

161
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Your Highness.

162
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
What's wrong?

163
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
What's the hurry?

164
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Your Highness, the imperial edict is here.

165
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Please go out and pick up the paper.

166
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
You don't have to pick up the paper.

167
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
How can you be so anxious?

168
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Don't we have any paper in the Prince's Manchu Manchu?

169
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
No.

170
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
The paper is from Eunuch Gao.

171
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Eunuch Gao?

172
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Your Highness.

173
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Eunuch Gao sent the paper himself.

174
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
He wants to make a promise.

175
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
The Emperor's son, Xiao Jingyan,

176
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
is a filial son of the Empress.

177
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
He is a good man.

178
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
He is a good man.

179
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
He has a lot of skills.

180
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
He is a special guest.

181
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
His Highness

182
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,200
gave him the title of

183
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
the Emperor's son.

184
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,200
I thank you, Father.

185
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Thank you, Eunuch Gao.

186
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Your Highness.

187
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,200
I am very grateful to you.

188
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
After you leave,

189
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,200
I need you to take care of the Imperial Academy.

190
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,200
I have prepared a new dress for you.

191
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Tomorrow, you must wear it

192
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
to the court.

193
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
I will accept the gold seal

194
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
that you gave me.

195
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
I will go to the temple first.

196
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
I will go to the Palace of the Zhengyang Palace

197
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
to see the Empress.

198
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
I will be back to Zhiluo Palace.

199
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Remember,

200
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
the ceremony is over.

201
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Don't make any trouble.

202
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Thank you, Eunuch Gao.

203
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Xuan.

204
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Prince Jing.

205
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
The gold seal is here.

206
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,200
The看看ation is always岂

207
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Please.

208
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Greetings, father.

209
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,900
So many have sending greetings from Le Dam.

210
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,680
Father,

211
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:05,720
here comes your son,

212
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,180
the hope.

213
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,320
Please,

214
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,540
look after J Tiger quite well,

215
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,980
I think he's almost the same level as you.

216
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,760
So it's time to leave now,

217
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,860
and now,

218
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,700
time to say goodbye.

219
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:27,300
Mm. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. Hm e

220
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,600
15

221
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,000
Congratulations to the royal court!

222
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,700
Your majesty?

223
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,140
He deserved it!

224
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,300
So I'm being disciplined by this?

225
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,020
What the hell?

226
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,960
The palacedisplaystyle weight?

227
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:21,720
Now that the Prince ofistas has been sent offsilent2

228
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,840
we can give you a good reason!!

229
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,400
Now the Prince often wish to Motorun

230
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,180
remains in the court

231
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,180
I know you are still in power.

232
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,180
But I'm sure the court and the two parties are working together.

233
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,180
Now that the throne is in power,

234
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,180
the Crown Prince is about to be released.

235
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,180
Your Majesty wants to create a new balance.

236
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,180
Isn't that right?

237
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,180
I understand what you mean.

238
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,180
I understand what you mean.

239
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,180
But I can't be so concerned.

240
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,180
You've worked so hard for so many years.

241
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,180
You're making such a mess.

242
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,180
How could you say that?

243
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,180
You've moved the Crown Prince.

244
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,180
He's now in the Eastern Palace.

245
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,180
He's never been able to get up.

246
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,180
He's only missing a reason and a letter.

247
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,180
But I've spent ten years fighting the Crown Prince.

248
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,180
Do I have to spend another ten years fighting the King of Jing?

249
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,180
After I was sealed with the King of Jing,

250
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,180
my mother's situation in the palace is different from the past.

251
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,180
I'm sure that the Empress...

252
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,180
Don't worry about me.

253
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,180
I've been in the palace for more than twenty years.

254
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,180
I've been self-sufficient.

255
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,180
I'm not a person who can be seen as a person.

256
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,180
The Empress will understand.

257
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,180
I understand.

258
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,180
I've never doubted this.

259
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,180
I remember you once said that

260
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,180
when the Eastern Palace was being sealed,

261
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,180
Commander Meng was taken by Eunuch Gao.

262
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,180
He suggested that you take him as your bait.

263
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,180
Yes.

264
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,180
But Mr. Su didn't agree.

265
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,180
He said that the high station is always safe.

266
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,180
It's risky to take him in.

267
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,180
Besides,

268
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,180
if the situation is too serious in the future,

269
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,180
even if Eunuch Gao is not our person,

270
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,180
he is also our person.

271
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,180
Mr. Su,

272
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,180
there's still the third level of friendship.

273
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,180
Do you understand?

274
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,180
What you mean is...

275
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,180
It's true that Eunuch Gao is a man of choice.

276
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,180
But one of the advantages is that

277
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,180
he's not someone else's type.

278
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,180
The reason why he didn't look for this direction

279
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,180
is because he still wants to be your father.

280
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,180
Yes.

281
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,180
If you want to take over the high station,

282
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,180
you must have brought your mother here.

283
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,180
This is something I'm absolutely unwilling to do.

284
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:27,180
I'm relieved that you can understand Mr. Su's intention.

285
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,180
Your Highness, you're right.

286
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,180
How is the Crown Prince and Prince Jin the same?

287
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,180
The Crown Prince is the crown prince of the Eastern Palace.

288
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,180
He has a great reputation.

289
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,180
Although Prince Jin is the King of the Five Pearls,

290
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,180
he's only because he's a man of his heart.

291
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,180
Now that the Crown Prince's position is about to be revealed,

292
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,180
this is a great victory for the Crown Prince.

293
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,180
If you don't take this step,

294
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,180
if His Majesty has any other side in the future,

295
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,180
then the Crown Prince will still be the Crown Prince.

296
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,180
If you continue to fight,

297
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,180
that will be a disaster.

298
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,180
I hope you agree with Mr. Su.

299
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,180
Your Highness, take care.

300
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,180
The King of the Sixth Prince may not be so confused this time.

301
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,180
If he hasn't been alert,

302
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,180
then it's not the King of the Sixth Prince who has been fighting with the Eastern Palace for years.

303
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,180
It's always a matter of time before he gets confused.

304
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,180
Then we really have to be prepared.

305
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,180
Who knows what will happen to the King of the Sixth Prince in a hurry?

306
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,180
I thought you and Li Gang were still here.

307
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,180
Since you said that,

308
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,180
I think the bullet on your shoulder is really heavy.

309
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,180
So you usually have to be careful with the flying fluid.

310
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,180
Do you know how much weight it has been burdening you?

311
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,180
By the way, why hasn't Tong Lu come yet?

312
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,180
Be careful.

313
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,180
Be careful.

314
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,180
Be careful.

315
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,180
Be careful.

316
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,180
Be careful.

317
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,180
Let me see.

318
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,180
I'll go and ask the doctor to take a look.

319
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,180
No need.

320
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,180
The doctor will have to pay me back.

321
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,180
I'm just a coward.

322
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,180
I'll just have to use the emergency room to get in.

323
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,180
But today,

324
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,180
I can't help the aunt to deliver the sugar water.

325
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,180
Don't worry about that.

326
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,180
I'll ask the doctor to take a look.

327
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,180
It's really good.

328
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,180
Don't be afraid of the expenses.

329
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,180
We are the senior ones.

330
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,180
We just paid the salary.

331
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,180
Your salary can't be so short.

332
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,180
You have to pay the money well.

333
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,180
You'll get a wife in the future.

334
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,180
That's the right thing to do.

335
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,180
I...

336
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,180
I'm fine now.

337
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,180
I...

338
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,180
I'll go back first.

339
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,180
Okay.

340
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,180
You should go and deliver the goods.

341
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,180
Okay.

342
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,180
Qi Hong,

343
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,180
keep talking.

344
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,180
I want to know

345
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,180
what else can you do in the palace?

346
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,180
Yes.

347
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,180
I heard that

348
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,180
since the King's reign,

349
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,180
except for the words from the palace,

350
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,180
the palace is also saying that

351
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,180
it used to be nothing.

352
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,180
But now it seems that

353
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,180
the King's reign is no worse than the King's reign.

354
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,180
No worse?

355
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,180
Are these people blind?

356
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,180
Xiao Jingyan,

357
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,180
what does she compare with the King's reign?

358
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,180
Mother, please calm down.

359
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,180
What did you hear?

360
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,180
The rumor says that the King's reign

361
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,180
is not that he is a good person,

362
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,180
but that he is less favored.

363
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,180
After the rumor,

364
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,180
the King's reign is no worse than the King's reign.

365
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,180
Even the King's reign

366
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,180
can't be compared with the King's reign.

367
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,180
Xiao Jingyan is originally a martial artist.

368
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
Who would compare with him?

369
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,180
But there's still someone who says

370
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,180
that he has been staying in the palace for a year.

371
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,180
His Majesty has sent many tasks for him.

372
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,180
So it's not bad in the political situation.

373
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,180
As for the birth...

374
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,180
A year ago,

375
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:21,780
in order to avoid the

376
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:42,180
surveillance Cute

377
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,180
Developer

378
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,820
But he's a King of the Five Pearls.

379
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,660
He wants to make it up to heaven.

380
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,860
What is it that he's doing?

381
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,820
He's been in the palace for so many years.

382
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,740
What kind of eyes do you have on him?

383
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,420
I don't believe him.

384
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,580
As for the real enemy,

385
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,300
can he be compared to the Noble Consort of the past?

386
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,180
It's all because of those little people who went to the Yan-Fu Palace.

387
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,780
Your Highness, please calm down.

388
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,060
All right.

389
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,300
All right.

390
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,180
Since you've become a King of the Mirror with me,

391
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,180
let's fight.

392
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,180
There's no such thing as simplicity in the court.

393
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,180
Just use the power of the mirror.

394
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,180
I want to step on it,

395
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,180
but I won't want to step on the Crown Prince's throne.

396
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,180
Xiao Jingyan,

397
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,180
Xiao Jingyan,

398
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,180
let's fight.

399
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,180
Everyone is here. Hurry and get in.

400
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,180
Xiao Jingyan,

401
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,180
Xiao Jingyan,

402
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,180
Xiao Jingyan,

403
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,180
Xiao Jingyan,

404
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,180
Xiao Jingyan,

405
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,180
Xiao Jingyan,

406
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,180
Xiao Jingyan,

407
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,180
Xiao Jingyan,

408
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,180
Xiao Jingyan,

409
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,180
Xiao Jingyan,

410
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,180
Xiao Jingyan,

411
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,180
Xiao Jingyan,

412
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,180
Xiao Jingyan,

413
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,180
Xiao Jingyan,

414
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,180
Xiao Jingyan,

415
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,180
Xiao Jingyan,

416
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:08,180
by his means,

417
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,180
by his means,

418
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,180
by his means,

419
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,180
by his means,

420
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,180
by his means,

421
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,180
by his means,

422
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,180
by his means,

423
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:26,180
by his means,

424
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,180
The first one is the first one.

425
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,180
The second one is the first one.

426
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,180
The third one is the first one.

427
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,180
The fourth one is the first one.

428
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,180
The fourth one is the first one.

429
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,180
The fifth one is the first one.

430
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,180
The fifth one is the first one.

431
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,180
The fifth one is the first one.

432
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,180
The fifth one is the first one.

433
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,180
The fifth one is the first one.

434
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,180
The fifth one is the first one.

435
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,180
The fifth one is the first one.

436
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,180
The fifth one is the first one.

437
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,180
The fifth one is the first one.

438
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,180
The fifth one is the first one.

439
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,180
The fifth one is the first one.

440
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,180
The fifth one is the first one.

441
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,180
The fifth one is the first one.

442
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,180
The fifth one is the first one.

443
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,180
The fifth one is the first one.

444
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,180
The fifth one is the first one.

445
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,180
The fifth one is the first one.

446
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,180
The fifth one is the first one.

447
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,180
The fifth one is the first one.

448
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,180
The fifth one is the first one.

449
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,180
The fifth one is the first one.

450
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,180
The fifth one is the first one.

451
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,180
The fifth one is the first one.

452
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,420
The fifth one is the first one.

453
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,180
Go down.

454
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,180
Yes.

455
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,300
Your Majesty.

456
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:46,200
I think we should move to the warm-up room in the Wenhui Palace tomorrow.

457
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
You can do it.

458
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
But it's really...

459
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,980
It won't be cold here tomorrow.

460
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,900
We'll carnally bring you warm twenty percent of your water.

461
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:06,000
I didn't expect you to be this kind of一個REAMY.

462
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,800
Gao Zhan.

463
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,000
Yes.

464
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Tomorrow morning,

465
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,400
I will summon Prince Yu, the commander of the royal family,

466
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,200
and the minister of the Ministry of Revenue to come in.

467
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,400
Yes.

468
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,800
And Prince Jin.

469
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,000
Yes.

470
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,200
I will leave now.

471
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,800
There are so many things to deal with every day.

472
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,200
I wonder if it's going to be dark again.

473
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,200
Your Highness, you really worked hard.

474
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
Aren't you also working hard?

475
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,800
There weren't so many things to do before.

476
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,200
But now the brothers are very excited.

477
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,800
Not only do they feel tired,

478
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,200
they are even more energetic than before.

479
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Zhan Ying.

480
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,200
You are the first person in the mansion to know

481
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
how much I hate you.

482
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,200
I think at that time, you must have thought I was crazy.

483
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
But you didn't say anything.

484
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Right?

485
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,200
It's really not possible at that time.

486
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,200
I also can't say it clearly.

487
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
But since you also decided to do something,

488
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,200
no matter what, I will do it.

489
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
I know.

490
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,200
That's why I will only tell you one person.

491
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
To be honest,

492
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
at that time,

493
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
I was also very busy.

494
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
I didn't have the confidence.

495
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,200
I even asked Mr. Su to ask him

496
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,200
how he should be like to the person around him.

497
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,200
I was afraid that he would be scared.

498
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,200
How did Mr. Su answer?

499
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,200
He said,

500
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
there is no need to say it.

501
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
When the time comes,

502
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,200
they will know it.

503
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
But Your Highness,

504
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
I think the brothers,

505
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
they are now...

506
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
Now,

507
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,200
maybe it's Mr. Su's time to say it.

508
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,200
I didn't say anything.

509
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Everyone has a tacit understanding.

510
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Even if I stop calling now,

511
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,200
the brothers will also push me forward.

512
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
You are so mean.

513
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
In the past,

514
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
brothers were very far away.

515
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,200
They wanted to be a client.

516
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
The cotton was too thin in winter.

517
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
But now,

518
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
what the brothers are discussing is

519
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
how to build a more effective military system.

520
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
How to implement the new horse-riding ceremony in the area.

521
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,200
This is really different from before.

522
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
But Your Highness, brothers...

523
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
I know.

524
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Even if I never get to do anything in court,

525
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
because of these,

526
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,200
the old men who used to follow me to kill me,

527
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
they will not leave.

528
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
You are clear.

529
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,200
Your Highness,

530
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Minister Shen of the Ministry of Revenue asks to see you.

531
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
Shen Zui?

532
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
It's so late.

533
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Why are you here?

534
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,200
What's the hurry for Mr. Shen to come here?

535
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
After the double battle,

536
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,200
the people of the city were all in the autumn harvest.

537
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Yesterday, Lu Xu Daoqi handed over the Inner Pavilion to the General of the Assembly.

538
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
This is my copy.

539
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
Your Highness, please have a look.

540
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
In the last five weeks,

541
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
the spring and summer had been very cold.

542
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,200
The autumn had been very cold.

543
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,200
According to the population and the disaster in the last five weeks,

544
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,200
the Ministry of Revenue's disaster relief fund

545
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,200
has been handed over to His Majesty.

546
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,200
It seems that Minister Shen has a grudge against the disaster.

547
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
Then come to me.

548
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,200
In the past, there was a disaster.

549
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
The only person in the royal family who took the lead

550
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
was not Prince Yu, but the Crown Prince.

551
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,200
After they had this task done,

552
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
they took it as a piece of fat meat

553
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
and cut it into pieces to split.

554
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,200
But the lives of the people of Wuzhou are also dead.

555
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,200
If they had followed the official's orders

556
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
and the officials of all places,

557
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
the disaster relief fund

558
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,200
could have been in the hands of three people in ten minutes.

559
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
That would have been good.

560
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
It would have been a long time.

561
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,200
It would have been a long time.

562
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
It would have been a long time.

563
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
It's really so serious.

564
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Your Highness, look.

565
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
This is the 20th anniversary of the opening of the capital

566
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
of the Crown Prince's capital,

567
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
the disaster relief fund.

568
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
This is the memorial of Prince Yu

569
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
who was responsible for the disaster relief fund

570
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
in Qin, Nan, and Bazhou in three years.

571
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
This memorial hasn't been given to the central government.

572
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,200
The person who wrote the memorial will be dead.

573
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,200
This is the memorial of the seven years...

574
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,200
Mr. Horan.

575
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
I understand what you mean.

576
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
What do you want me to do?

577
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Your Highness,

578
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
I hope that you will be responsible

579
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
for the disaster relief fund.

580
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
If the disaster relief fund is in the hands of Prince Yu,

581
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
it will be a huge loss.

582
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,200
He can cheat His Majesty with a cap that is known to be a sign of his death.

583
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
By then,

584
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Your Highness,

585
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,200
can you go to the horse and remove the names of the people?

586
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,200
The horse is a horse that is known to be a sign of his death.

587
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,200
The horse is a horse that is known to be a sign of his death.

588
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
This isn't the right thing to do.

589
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
This isn't the right thing to do.

590
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,200
This is the responsibility of the design of the temple hall.

591
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,840
the terms of Qin

592
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,980
only rely Hunan

593
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,880
General Shen.

594
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,200
I promise you, I will do my best to prove it to you.

595
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Shen Qing, I have read your script.

596
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,200
Although the disaster this year is not as serious as it was in seven years,

597
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:51,200
you must arrange all the disaster reliefs immediately.

598
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Father, please forgive me.

599
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Father, please don't worry.

600
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
The national affairs is stable this year.

601
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,200
There is no big problem.

602
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
The stock price is still good.

603
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,200
The money from Mr. Shen is not meaningful.

604
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,200
Then, we will send officials to various states to start the disaster relief.

605
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
I have experience with these things.

606
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
There is no difficulty.

607
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Please rest assured, Father.

608
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,200
You are the first one to share the oil with me.

609
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
I know you are a good man.

610
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,200
You will not be in trouble.

611
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Father.

612
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,200
Jing Yuan, what do you think?

613
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,200
I have been a father since I was 15 years old.

614
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
I have been in many cases.

615
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
The disaster relief is a serious problem.

616
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Although the people in the main market are not as good as the public,

617
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,200
they should at least go to the disaster zone to investigate the disaster.

618
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,200
This time, there are five states suffering from disaster relief.

619
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,200
There are some difficult places.

620
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,200
How can the King of the Yu have such a big problem?

621
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
I have been in the field for a long time.

622
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,200
I have been in the field for a long time.

623
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
I have been in the field for a long time.

624
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
So, I hope you can be sure.

625
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,200
When the disaster relief is over,

626
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,200
I will share the oil with you.

627
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
You are right.

628
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Father.

629
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Although Jing Yuan is kind,

630
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
I can't accept it.

631
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,200
It is not difficult for the army to handle the disaster relief.

632
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,200
I can't trust Jing Yuan.

633
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
He is a good man.

634
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
The disaster relief is not a war.

635
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,200
He can handle it with all his strength.

636
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,200
The disaster relief in the five states is all the grace of the court.

637
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,200
I am afraid it is not suitable for Jing Yuan to practice.

638
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,200
I am not sure about the disaster relief.

639
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
But I know some details.

640
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Since the King of the Yu has a lot of experience,

641
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,200
I think he is not good at teaching.

642
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
I have to ask you.

643
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,200
What is the purpose of the disaster relief

644
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
if the money is transferred?

645
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
The two countries are more stable than therol injection.

646
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
You can use grain for a few days.

647
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,200
The disaster reliefs are natural because of the money and food.

648
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,200
I just expected to explain it horizontally.

649
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,200
The perfect decision is to Spring Mall the wind power system.

650
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,200
The disaster relief is not considered passive.

651
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Jingyan's words are a bit far-fetched.

652
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,200
It seems you've used your mind.

653
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Prince Jing's study is correct.

654
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
He's fast at it.

655
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,200
I admire him for that.

656
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
It's simple.

657
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
It's not like that when you sit up.

658
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,200
Jingyan, you're familiar with it now.

659
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,200
Do you know how the local government works?

660
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Last time you promoted new horse-riding.

661
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,200
You took over the case.

662
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
You didn't do anything wrong.

663
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,200
You just did it.

664
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,200
These local officials are not your job.

665
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
You should be in a good mood.

666
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,200
It's not like that.

667
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
It's not good to promote new horse-riding.

668
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
It's because of the military.

669
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,200
And in the end, the new government has done it.

670
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,200
I believe the Ministry of Revenue will arrange everything.

671
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
Of course.

672
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,200
The Ministry of Revenue has no other choice.

673
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,200
You've promoted all the responsibilities to the Ministry of Revenue.

674
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,200
It's not your style, Jingyan.

675
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Just say it.

676
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Even if the new horse-riding is not good,

677
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,200
it's the Ministry of Revenue.

678
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
You're sure no one will do it this time?

679
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
You're young and fearless.

680
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Someone is not good at it.

681
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
How to take over the case,

682
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
how to resolve the problem and monitor it,

683
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
is it all you should learn?

684
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Since Minister Liu said you're fast,

685
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,200
I think you can learn it in a year and a half.

686
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
But now, the disaster is urgent.

687
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
I'm afraid you can't learn it.

688
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
What Yu just said,

689
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
the balance of the official business is different.

690
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,200
I won't learn it this time.

691
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,200
I won't learn it either.

692
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,200
The court has its own law.

693
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
There are also the official policies.

694
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
If you only have your own personal interests,

695
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,200
it's not the official and the court's style.

696
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,200
What do you mean?

697
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Now the Emperor is in charge of the court,

698
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,200
but you said the official style is bad.

699
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Jingyan, you're just the Prince of Qin.

700
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,200
You want to clear the official business for the Emperor?

701
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Why do you want to reject me?

702
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
I mean...

703
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Enough.

704
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,200
How can you be so stubborn?

705
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
You won't say the official style?

706
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
Father, I'm not upset with you.

707
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
Jingyan is so talkative.

708
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
She was like this before father.

709
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,200
I thought she changed her mind after a year or two.

710
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,200
Old thing.

711
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,200
You're happy to see the joke

712
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
when my son is not considerate.

713
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Your Majesty,

714
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,200
you're not not considerate.

715
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
You're more considerate.

716
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,200
I think the Prince of Qin has a good temper.

717
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,200
He never blames the official style.

718
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
Even if he's wrong,

719
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,200
Your Majesty, you can still teach them a lesson.

720
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
You're so generous.

721
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,200
You're not convinced of your own health.

722
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,200
My son is even more upset.

723
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
Your Majesty, you see me,

724
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
I'm not happy with it.

725
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Enough.

726
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,200
You're both...

727
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,200
What's the big deal?

728
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Do you know what you're doing?

729
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
Since you all have a grudge against me,

730
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
are you being so cruel?

731
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Father, I'm not tolerant.

732
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Since you're still not over,

733
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,200
I don't think the money will be enough.

734
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
I'm trying to be cruel.

735
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
I'm not good at it.

736
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
I'll cut the use of the house first.

737
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
I'll make a 30,000 taels of silver to pay for the hard work.

738
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
After Father's death,

739
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
I'll pay for the compensation.

740
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,200
Jing Huan,

741
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
are you going to

742
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
pay for your own loss?

743
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,200
I have a lot of money.

744
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
It's all my father's money.

745
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
I don't have any loss.

746
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
It's all my father's money.

747
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,200
In the future,

748
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
I'll pay for my father's life.

749
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
I'll be grateful to him.

750
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
I've already thought about it.

751
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,200
I'll pay for all the favors that father has done.

752
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
Once the money is gone,

753
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
I'll pay for it.

754
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
I can't let my father's life

755
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
be ruined because of the money.

756
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
Father.

757
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,200
Jing Huan, you're so kind.

758
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
It's really hard to get.

759
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
I remember

760
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,200
the numerous times you were alone.

761
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,200
I didn't even think about it.

762
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,200
I was so proud of myself.

763
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,200
I was at peace.

764
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Jing Huan,

765
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,200
you're the one who's in a hurry.

766
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Your Majesty,

767
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
I have a decree.

768
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,200
I'm responsible for the court.

769
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
I didn't let Prince Yu

770
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,200
think of the right to make money.

771
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Shen Xing,

772
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
the amount of silver you've paid

773
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,200
is 30,000 taels.

774
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,200
The rest is all from Prince Yu.

775
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
You must not let it go.

776
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,200
Your Majesty.

777
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
All right.

778
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,200
I'm tired.

779
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,200
You may leave.

780
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
I'll take my leave.

781
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
I'm sorry.

782
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
I'm sorry.

783
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
I'm sorry.

784
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,200
I'm sorry.

785
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
I'm sorry.

786
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,200
I'm sorry.

787
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
I'm sorry.

788
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
I'm sorry.

789
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,200
I'm sorry.

790
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
I'm sorry.

791
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,200
I'm sorry.

792
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,200
I'm sorry.

793
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
I'm sorry.

794
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,200
I'm sorry.

795
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,200
It's a good thing

796
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,200
that we're not getting married.

797
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,200
Your Majesty.

798
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,200
I'm sorry.

799
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,200
I'm sorry.

800
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,200
I'm sorry.

801
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
I'm sorry.

802
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,200
I'm sorry.

803
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,200
I'm sorry.

804
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,200
I'm sorry.

805
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
I'm sorry.

806
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,200
I'm sorry.

807
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,200
I'm sorry.

808
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,200
I am the one who is willing to die

809
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:34,200
I am a man who is willing to die

810
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:41,200
I am a man who is willing to die

811
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,200
I am a man who is willing to die

812
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:55,200
I am a man who is willing to die

813
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,200
I am a man who is willing to die

814
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:13,200
I am a man who is willing to die

815
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:21,200
I am a man who is willing to die
