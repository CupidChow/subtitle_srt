00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 14

2
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Your Majesty,

3
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,800
the Ministry of Revenue is a big source of goods.

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,800
How should we make up for it after the entrance of the building?

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's the important thing in the court.

6
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,120
Your Highness, there are several books.

7
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,400
That's what you should do.

8
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,280
Your Majesty, you don't need to worry.

9
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,000
Look at these scrolls.

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,600
There are many people.

11
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,320
But none of them is satisfied with all of them.

12
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,520
If you keep making trouble,

13
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,640
the government of the Ministry of Revenue will be in chaos.

14
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,120
The Ministry of Revenue has a spy to take care of.

15
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,280
It's okay to do it at once.

16
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
A spy?

17
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,160
The spy of the Qinghe Palace?

18
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
Yes.

19
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,200
The Ministry of Revenue is a spy.

20
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,640
You've known him, haven't you?

21
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,600
Mr. Su sent a message that day.

22
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,480
He told me to go to the Jinyun House.

23
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
How dare I not go?

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
Since you went,

25
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,640
how could you not notice Shen Zui?

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,920
The Ministry of Revenue is a good person.

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,880
It's related to the national security.

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,800
But now, Lu Zhijin is calling him a big man.

29
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,000
He's just looking at it.

30
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,080
He can do anything.

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,720
Only Shen Zui can do it.

32
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm very close to Shen Zui.

33
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
But he's not from the Eastern Palace.

34
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,040
He's not from the King of Yu.

35
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,920
It's not easy to get the position of the Imperial Uncle in the Jinyun House.

36
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,720
The Ministry of Revenue is a good person.

37
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,720
Yes, yes.

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
He's the third-ranked guard of the Ministry of Revenue.

39
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,680
I didn't think of him at all.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,480
In the family,

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,080
he's not as talented as Shen Zui.

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,320
I even praised him before.

43
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,840
Since Shen Zui is the official of the Ministry of Revenue,

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,800
why didn't anyone in the top-ranked guard

45
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,400
see him?

46
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,800
Maybe

47
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,520
we didn't think of him at all.

48
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,120
You old man.

49
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,720
You're just a fool.

50
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,720
Do you think I'm a fool?

51
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,320
I think he's not from the Eastern Palace.

52
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,200
He's not from the King of Yu.

53
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
Your Majesty.

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,840
Shen Zui is noble.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,320
He's more arrogant than the others.

56
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,720
He's always busy with his work.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,880
So he's not close to you.

58
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,760
That's the case.

59
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,200
Isn't that good?

60
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,040
Shen Zui is very lucky.

61
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
He's a good man.

62
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
What's this?

63
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,080
His Majesty asked you to choose

64
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,680
the three officials of the Ministry of Revenue.

65
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,240
As far as I know,

66
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,800
you only chose a master in the Ministry of Revenue, right?

67
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,600
I'm far from the Imperial Court.

68
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,400
I don't know anything about it.

69
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,680
But you made a clear choice.

70
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,480
This list of candidates

71
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,680
Judging by this,

72
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,040
if something collides

73
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,440
we're left with no room.

74
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,740
W gambling was taken by Sendlicherあり

75
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,380
and King of Jing spoke out the names

76
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,440
behind this.

77
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,920
I am Lord and by the Pawn Investigator.

78
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Some were sent also

79
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,560
to check out the genre

80
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,720
of the loan insurance.

81
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,480
The Prince of Jing is a man of majesty.

82
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,320
He's very scoresy

83
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,000
and not even well-acquainted.

84
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,500
You're only

85
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,040
Let me come in quickly the next day

86
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,640
Mr. Shen He

87
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,920
you need to quarantine me

88
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,100
We can visit Mr. Amis

89
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,160
Thank you

90
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,600
Thank you

91
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,000
You are welcome

92
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,260
Mr. Shen He

93
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,260
Even if it's a Mo Liu Xiao Guan,

94
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,260
only the Chief God can accept the evidence.

95
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,260
You are so stubborn.

96
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,260
Where did Prince Jin send you from?

97
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,260
You are asking for the case.

98
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,260
I can't answer you.

99
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,260
What if I don't give you the evidence?

100
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,260
You won't.

101
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,260
Why?

102
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,260
Xuanjing Bureau's secret agents

103
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,260
are so strict and strict.

104
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,260
They are being trusted by His Majesty.

105
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,260
It's just because of this,

106
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,260
it's a crime.

107
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,260
It's strange.

108
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,260
Strange?

109
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,260
I don't know anyone in the six departments of the court.

110
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,260
After I came back,

111
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,260
I met some of the members of the court.

112
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,260
Most of them are in this list.

113
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,260
Isn't it strange?

114
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,260
The officials in this list

115
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,260
are worried about them.

116
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,260
We don't need to take them away.

117
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,260
You are talking differently

118
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,260
from the general mode.

119
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,260
The sooner there is a meaning,

120
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,260
the sooner it will lead to the Crown Prince and Prince Yu's death.

121
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,260
The more you need, the more you will be pure.

122
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,260
The more pure you will be, the less you will be.

123
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,260
If you want to protect your true nature,

124
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,260
it will be easier.

125
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,260
But these people are hard to get along with.

126
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,260
It's hard to get along with the Crown Prince and Prince Yu.

127
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,260
But I hope you can change the situation.

128
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,260
They don't lack intelligence and talent.

129
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,260
They lack opportunities.

130
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,260
Although they are not willing to wait for the future,

131
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,260
they will definitely change the grace of Prince Yu.

132
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,260
Your Highness, don't worry.

133
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
We will be honest with them.

134
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,260
As for the future,

135
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,260
if you want to calculate them,

136
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,260
you can leave them to me.

137
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,260
The Crown Prince is still alive.

138
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,260
He has been waiting for Prince Yu's death.

139
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,260
He will be back.

140
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,260
Prince Yu, Mr. Su.

141
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,260
Where is Feiliu?

142
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,260
In the Yanwu factory.

143
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,260
That's right.

144
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,260
Where else can he go besides Yanwu factory?

145
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,260
Let's go and see.

146
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,260
Okay.

147
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,260
Aren't you still in the military?

148
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,260
Where is the military?

149
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Lan Tai County has a emergency.

150
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,260
The people from the Qingzhang camp are here to ask for help.

151
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,260
The luck of the high school is good this year.

152
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,260
What emergency?

153
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,260
I didn't cause him any trouble this time.

154
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
It's not a big deal.

155
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,260
But recently,

156
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,260
there was a monster in the eastern suburbs.

157
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,260
It disturbed the villagers.

158
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,260
Those officials are limited and can't catch him.

159
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,260
So they came here to get some soldiers.

160
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,260
It's such a simple thing.

161
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,260
It's worth discussing.

162
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,260
It's not hard to get rid of this monster.

163
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,260
It's just that the Zhan Ying people want to catch him alive.

164
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,260
It's worth checking what it is.

165
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,260
There is a monster in the southern suburbs.

166
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,260
It's a miracle.

167
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,260
If we catch him,

168
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,260
you must let me have a look.

169
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,260
Okay.

170
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,260
You're so happy.

171
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,260
It seems that he's interested in that knife.

172
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,260
Do you see it?

173
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
If he's not interested in that knife,

174
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,260
he can't get away with it.

175
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,260
You're so happy.

176
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,260
I'm so happy.

177
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,260
I'm so happy.

178
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,260
I'm so happy.

179
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,260
Fei Liu.

180
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,260
Fei Liu.

181
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
You've got it.

182
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,260
You guys are not good at knife and sword.

183
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,260
Are you scared?

184
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,260
Qian Meng.

185
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,260
What are you looking at?

186
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,260
Do you want me to say no?

187
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,260
No.

188
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,260
Is everything okay?

189
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,260
Your presence.

190
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,260
Do you guys want a eel?

191
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,260
No.

192
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,260
I'm sorry.

193
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,260
is Kos Linked with the Heaven'schu.

194
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,780
to find the emperor's heir.

195
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,540
It seems that you are in danger

196
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,740
and you are not as good as me.

197
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,340
Please punish me.

198
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,660
I really want to see you open your eyes today.

199
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,340
Goodbye.

200
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,180
Your Highness, I know I was wrong.

201
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,260
Please calm down.

202
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,100
I swear my military skills.

203
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,740
I'll

204
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,060
be the long-awaited�it.

205
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,020
Yes.

206
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,900
I order Самilas

207
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,420

208
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,340
and勿 to all halo palaces

209
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,660
and承 gear without permission.

210
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,420
The court's office must know

211
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,060
the punishment,

212
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,260
I will accept your order.

213
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,980
I will accept your order.

214
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,620
Mr. Qi.

215
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:22,900
Mr. Qian.

216
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,380
Mr. Zhu.

217
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,060
In places.

218
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,700
It's highly important.

219
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,180
I want to convince it is not an insult to me.

220
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,740
Please give me more support.

221
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,340
Your Majesty,

222
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,300
愛 Your Majesty for my help.

223
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,580

Public opinion of Prince Jing.

225
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,740
Please hand over the other way.

226
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,100
Prince Jing.

227
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,900
He wants to demand government files.

228
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,980
The name is included in his report.

229
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,920

230

Lang Zhong, Han Zhiyi

232
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,960
I, Lingzhi

233
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,920
Dalisi Cheng, Zhang Jianzhen

234
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,520
I, Lingzhi

235
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,440
Wei Yuan

236
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,160
I, Lingzhi

237
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,680
Tingwei's mansion, Duwei

238
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,520
Yuan Shiyin

239
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,160
I, Lingzhi

240
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,040
Zhijingling, Qin Yue

241
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,880
I, Lingzhi

242
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,440
These officials are being transferred

243
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,080
We must report tomorrow

244
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,680
The case is a criminal

245
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,600
It is under arrest

246
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,840
So the local authorities will also be involved in the arrest

247
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,640
What do you think, Mr. Qi?

248
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,840
Your Highness

249
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,080
The kitchen and the east-town

250
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,440
have been controlled

251
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,520
The five rooms are all equipped

252
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,240
If you are not satisfied with anything

253
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,080
just tell me

254
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,440
Thank you, Mr. Qi

255
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,320
The new minister of the Ministry of Revenue

256
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,440
Shen Zhui is here

257
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,520
Maybe it's because I fought with Lao Wu too much

258
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,680
So father didn't give anyone's face this time

259
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,200
You said this Shen Zhui

260
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,520
really went to the big crowd

261
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,600
Your Highness, you have been taken to the prison

262
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,480
Prince Yu can't keep the Duke of Qin

263
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,600
It's a fair play

264
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,040
How can it be a fair play?

265
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,200
In terms of strength

266
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,520
There's no room for a strong share in the Duke of Qin

267
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,680
Lao Wu's decision on this matter

268
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,000
He said he would give up

269
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,960
He didn't say anything

270
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,760
How do I think this idea

271
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,600
should be made by Mei Changsu?

272
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,000
Really

273
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
A Mei Changsu who is weak and unfeeling

274
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,160
How can you not make it?

275
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,120
Mei Changsu is weak and unfeeling

276
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,560
But he has a master by his side

277
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,240
We also have the power of the Jianghu?

278
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,400
Your Highness

279
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,840
How much difference

280
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,280
between Tianquan Manor and Jiangzuo Manor?

281
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,480
Look

282
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,120
This is another place I lost to Lao Wu

283
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,160
He has Jiangzuo Manor

284
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,720
And I only have Tianquan Manor

285
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,440
May my Lord give me some food

286
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,320
May my Lord give me some food

287
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,360
My Lord

288
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,320
Give me some food

289
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,200
The food here is so fresh

290
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,440
Yeah

291
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,320
We just...

292
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,000
For the food

293
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,440
Come

294
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,160
His Highness

295
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,160
I will rely on you to contact Mr. Thirteen from now on.

296
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,160
I will not let you and Mr. Thirteen get away.

297
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
The prison is under the prison.

298
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,160
We can't avoid a single cut.

299
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,160
You can rest assured that you can inform the doctor

300
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
and let your mother know about this.

301
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

302
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,160
I have a grudge against my sister.

303
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,160
This prison has the Crown Prince's support.

304
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
If it weren't for your effort,

305
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,160
I'm afraid the king of the prison will be in a difficult situation.

306
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,160
Yes. I didn't expect that

307
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,160
you would move to the prison so soon.

308
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,160
It's been a long time since the last time I moved here.

309
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
It's not a pleasant time.

310
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,160
I hope your family is not guilty.

311
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,160
Your Highness, you are serious.

312
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,160
I am grateful to you for your help.

313
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,160
The Crown Prince, you are looking for me?

314
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,160
The Blue Garden Cemetery case is over.

315
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,160
I think the recent investigation has been quite clear.

316
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,160
It's time for Gao Sheng to send the case.

317
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Do you mean that

318
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
you are looking for me?

319
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
I am looking for you.

320
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,160
I am looking for you.

321
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,160
I am looking for you.

322
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
I am looking for you.

323
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
What you mean is...

324
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
I am looking for you.

325
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
I am looking for you.

326
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
I am looking for you.

327
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,160
The Ministry of Justice.

328
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,160
The Ministry of Justice.

329
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,160
Let Mr. Shi San and the palace prepare.

330
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Yes.

331
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
You have been preparing for so long.

332
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
It's a good time to do it.

333
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
I can still hold on.

334
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
If you have any doubts,

335
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
it's fine.

336
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Just stop.

337
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
I won't stop.

338
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Even if someone finds out

339
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
and wants to take the blame,

340
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
I won't stop.

341
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
My poor little brother

342
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,160
was only 13 when Qiu Ze killed him.

343
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,160
He is a child of Chang Xi.

344
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,160
He is a child of the Prince of the Banquet Manor.

345
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
He is a child of the Banquet Manor.

346
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,160
I can't let him take the credit.

347
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,160
We can only repay him for this.

348
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Mr. He,

349
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,160
the new bride and groom are all sick.

350
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
You are lying.

351
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
I am not a jealous man.

352
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
The bride and groom are both sick.

353
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,160
They are going to die.

354
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Do you want to try it?

355
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
They are sick.

356
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
They are both sick.

357
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,160
Mr. He,

358
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,160
when did I lie to you?

359
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
The bride and groom are really sick.

360
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
Stop it.

361
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Mr. He.

362
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Miss Gong Yu.

363
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
You are not in the Miaoyin House.

364
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Why did you come to Yang Liu Xin?

365
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
The bride and groom are both sick.

366
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,160
I will come and see them.

367
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Really?

368
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
Yes.

369
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Miss Gong Yu,

370
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,160
we are really close.

371
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,160
How about I drink with you?

372
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Okay.

373
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Since you want to drink with me,

374
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
please wait here.

375
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,160
I will change my clothes.

376
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
Okay.

377
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,160
I will wait here.

378
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
Miss Gong Yu.

379
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
I heard that Miss Xin Liu Xin Yang

380
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,160
is looking for Mr. Qiu in the room on the building.

381
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,160
Yes.

382
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,160
Mr. Qiu is handsome and charming.

383
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,160
You are very close to each other.

384
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
I am so happy for them.

385
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
You are happy too?

386
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Mr. Qiu and Miss Xin Liu

387
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,160
are both sick.

388
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
I am so happy for them.

389
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
You are happy?

390
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
Mr. Qiu and Miss Xin Liu

391
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
are in love on the building.

392
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Why do you make me feel wronged?

393
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
You are the one who is with that girl.

394
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
Of course,

395
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,160
you should help each other.

396
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
This girl

397
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,160
is always in love with Mr. Qiu.

398
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,160
She is so shameless.

399
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
If it's not because of Xin Yang,

400
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
she is afraid of being in trouble.

401
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
She often advises her.

402
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Mr. Qiu

403
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,160
has already cleaned up.

404
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Mr. Qiu is here.

405
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Find him out.

406
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
Yes.

407
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Mr. Qiu.

408
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
Mr. Qiu, come out with me.

409
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
What are you doing?

410
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Get lost.

411
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
Mr. Qiu.

412
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Mr. Qiu, you are a coward.

413
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Come out.

414
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
Mr. Qiu.

415
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
Come out with me.

416
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
Come on.

417
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
Mr. Qiu.

418
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,160
Come out with me.

419
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,160
Come out with me.

420
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Mr. Qiu.

421
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
Come out with me.

422
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,160
Mr. Qiu.

423
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Who are you?

424
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,160
What are you doing?

425
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
Tell me.

426
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
It's nothing.

427
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
Come in.

428
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
What's wrong with you?

429
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
It's too dangerous.

430
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
It's nothing.

431
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,160
Go over there.

432
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
Come in and find me.

433
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
I don't know where to find you.

434
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,160
Mr. Qiu.

435
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
Mr. He.

436
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,160
Mr. He.

437
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,160
They are not in there.

438
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,160
I'm not in there.

439
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,160
Don't touch me.

440
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
Mr. He.

441
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,160
He Wen Xin?

442
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
Xing Qiu, you are indeed here.

443
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Mr. Qiu.

444
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
Mr. Qiu.

445
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Mr. Qiu.

446
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
Mr. Qiu.

447
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
Don't worry.

448
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Don't worry.

449
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
What are you doing?

450
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
I'm not good at it.

451
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
Mr. Qiu, stop fighting.

452
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Stop fighting.

453
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
Stop fighting.

454
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Stop fighting.

455
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Stop fighting.

456
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
Stop fighting.

457
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Stop fighting.

458
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Stop fighting.

459
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Stop fighting.

460
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
It's a good deal.

461
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
Stop fighting.

462
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Please stop.

463
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
Mr. He, please stop fighting.

464
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,160
Don't destroy things.

465
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
Destroy what I have.

466
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
Mr. Qiu.

467
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
Stop fighting.

468
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
Stop fighting.

469
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Stop fighting.

470
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
Stop fighting.

471
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,160
Stop fighting.

472
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
You are dead.

473
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Mr. He.

474
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
You are dead?

475
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,160
God, please.

476
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
You are dead.

477
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
You are dead.

478
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
Hurry up.

479
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Mr. He,

480
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,160
you stop fighting.

481
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Don't run.

482
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
Drive him away.

483
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,160
Stop.

484
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,360
What's going on?

485
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,960
He's dead.

486
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,480
What's the matter?

487
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
What's the important thing?

488
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,880
Your Highness, I don't know either.

489
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,720
Your Highness!

490
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,760
Your Highness, I'm begging you.

491
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280
I'm wearing three-dress clothes.

492
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,280
I'm wearing only one dress.

493
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,440
Your Highness!

494
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:55,920
What's wrong?

495
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,840
What's wrong?

496
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,040
What's the matter?

497
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,360
Come, put the clothes on.

498
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,600
Your Highness, please.

499
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
What?

500
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,280
I'm fine with this.

501
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,680
I'm really upset with the big trouble.

502
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,520
But Your Highness,

503
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,560
I've been working hard for years.

504
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,720
I've been working for 50 years.

505
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,280
I'm so proud of myself.

506
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,880
I'm so proud of my mother.

507
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,680
I'm so proud of myself.

508
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
I'm afraid...

509
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,480
I'm afraid that my mother

510
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,680
won't be able to bear it.

511
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,840
You're too much.

512
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,840
How can the capital and the capital

513
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,760
be so cruel when they're under the control of the emperor?

514
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,200
If they kill a commoner,

515
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,960
it's fine.

516
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,200
But the death of Wen Yuanbo's son.

517
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,680
Although he's not in the court now,

518
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,480
the cause and effect of the ancestors

519
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,800
is still there.

520
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,880
Your Highness,

521
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,720
but Your Highness,

522
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,880
your identity...

523
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,720
Although I'm more important than him,

524
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,960
I can't force my guard.

525
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,480
I wonder if there's any

526
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,760
minister who can help me.

527
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,040
Wen Yuanbo has the right

528
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,880
to do it himself.

529
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,480
He's going to make things worse.

530
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Who can you and me get away from?

531
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
Your Highness.

532
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,240
I know it's hard for you.

533
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,880
But if you kill a commoner,

534
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,080
how can you be so bold to touch His Highness?

535
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,480
I know that I'm powerful and powerful.

536
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,440
But I'm here to beg Your Highness.

537
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
Your Highness,

538
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,520
you know that

539
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,600
Wen Yuanbo is always afraid of things.

540
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,720
You're right.

541
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,920
Is that a small matter?

542
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,640
Your son is my son.

543
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,320
iveness is not my son.

544
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,000
Nobody dares do anything

545
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,560
against His Majesty's boss!

546
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,840
He Gaohao,

547
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,320
don't State discovered Your Highness.

548
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,800
Only later than that

549
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,640
you'll be their betrothal leader.

550
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,560
Why do you get mad?

551
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,520
I'm afraid

552
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,040
that the State挥 parents

553
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,560
wont accept the 안 t灵il to combat I Play.

554
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,640
The Golden Court's silver manor?

555
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,140
You think the Golden Court likes to set up this case?

556
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,140
They just opened a blue circle and hid it.

557
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,140
Now there's a criminal who's been killed.

558
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,140
Gao Sheng is still not sure how to get him in.

559
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,140
But the Golden Court's silver manor,

560
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,140
they sent someone to arrest my son this morning.

561
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,640
It's clear that they won't give me any face.

562
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,140
Open the door!

563
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,140
Open the door!

564
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
Zhang Dutou,

565
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,140
it's been knocking on the door for half an hour.

566
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,140
No one's here.

567
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,140
This is the residence of the Court's second-ranking official.

568
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,640
We can't just break in.

569
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,140
Gao Sheng is a man.

570
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,140
This is the smartest place he's ever been.

571
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
This case is yours,

572
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,140
and it's Wen Yuanbo's.

573
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,140
It's a case that could be solved anytime.

574
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,640
Besides, the case is a secret.

575
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,640
There's no reason for it.

576
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,640
So the criminal must be punished.

577
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,640
If the case is too slow,

578
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,140
and you send my son away,

579
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,140
will you still be responsible for it?

580
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,640
Then how will Wen Yuanbo explain it?

581
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,640
But once I hand my son over,

582
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,640
I'm afraid...

583
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
I'll have to take the credit for the case.

584
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
I'll have to wait and see.

585
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
If...

586
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,640
If...

587
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,640
If I'm afraid that your son will be punished,

588
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,640
and he doesn't care about you,

589
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
I'll have to punish you first.

590
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,640
But if it's a crime,

591
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,640
then I'll be in great trouble.

592
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
Are you afraid that I'll have to teach him

593
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,640
to take the blame?

594
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,640
So,

595
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
don't think that you're the father of Jinling,

596
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,640
and that it's easier to be your superior.

597
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,640
Your Highness,

598
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
you're so wise.

599
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,640
I'm confused.

600
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
Wait, wait, wait.

601
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Don't be so reckless.

602
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,640
In short,

603
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
you're not doing well.

604
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,640
Guards.

605
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,640
Your Highness.

606
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Please come here.

607
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,640
I order you to arrest He Wenxin.

608
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,640
The criminal was killed last night

609
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,640
in Yang Liuxin's residence.

610
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
Please open the door.

611
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,640
Hand over the criminal.

612
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,640
I order you to arrest He Wenxin.

613
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
The criminal was killed last night

614
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
in Yang Liuxin's residence.

615
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
Please open the door.

616
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,640
Hand over the criminal.

617
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,640
I order you to arrest He Wenxin.

618
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,640
The criminal was killed last night

619
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,640
in Yang Liuxin's residence.

620
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Please open the door.

621
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Your Highness,

622
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,640
you can take the blame first.

623
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
How?

624
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
Your Excellency,

625
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,640
don't panic.

626
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
Then,

627
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,640
the case of the Jin Dynasty's silver house

628
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
is not scary.

629
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
It's scary

630
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,640
to be a body case.

631
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Your Excellency,

632
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
you've made a move.

633
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
Of course,

634
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,640
Gao Sheng will be punished.

635
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,640
Although the case is a murder case,

636
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,640
the evidence in the case

637
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
can be a little bit more vague.

638
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,640
There's also some evidence

639
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
in the case.

640
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
But

641
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,640
no matter how Mr. Juan wrote it,

642
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,640
the culprit is still a murderer.

643
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,640
Your Excellency,

644
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
the case of the Jin Dynasty's silver house

645
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,640
must be reported to the Ministry of Justice.

646
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,640
The Ministry of Justice

647
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,640
has a full reason to review it.

648
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,640
It's different

649
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,640
when the case is reported to the Ministry of Justice.

650
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,640
Prince Yu is there.

651
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
Do you think that Minister Qi

652
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,640
can't be more determined than Gao Sheng?

653
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,640
You're really a good man.

654
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

655
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,640
The case of the Jin Dynasty's silver house

656
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,640
is a murder case.

657
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,640
The culprit was killed

658
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,640
in Yang Liu Xin's house last night.

659
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,640
Please open the door.

660
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,640
Hand over the criminal.

661
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
The case of the Jin Dynasty's silver house

662
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,640
is a murder case.

663
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,640
The culprit was killed

664
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,640
in Yang Liu Xin's house last night.

665
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,640
The case of the Jin Dynasty's silver house

666
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,640
is a murder case.

667
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,640
Your Excellency.

668
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Your Excellency,

669
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,640
the murder case of Yang Liu Xin

670
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,640
was reported to the Ministry of Justice.

671
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Please take care of it.

672
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Take care of it?

673
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
How can I take care of it?

674
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
The Crown Prince's new wife is the Crown Prince.

675
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,640
Prince Yu is the one who is responsible for the case.

676
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
The case of the two of them

677
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
has made me

678
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,640
offend both the two princes

679
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,640
in the court.

680
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
It seems that I can't

681
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,640
do much for the silver house.

682
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,640
Your Excellency,

683
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,640
where is this?

684
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,640
It's been more than a year

685
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
since the last month.

686
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,640
You may be able to

687
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
get better in the future.

688
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,640
You are also comforting me.

689
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,640
Your Excellency.

690
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
It's Wen Yuan Bo.

691
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
The case of Yang Liu Xin

692
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,640
was reported to the Ministry of Justice

693
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,640
for half a month.

694
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
I came to the Ministry of Justice

695
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,640
and there are more than ten cases.

696
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
I just saw you go to the Ministry of Justice.

697
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
Your Excellency,

698
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,640
I just want to ask you

699
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
whether this case is a interrogation

700
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
or not.

701
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
It's in the family.

702
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
There are many cases in the Ministry of Justice.

703
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
There are many cases in the State of Qin

704
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,640
that are related to the royal family.

705
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,640
You should understand me more.

706
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,640
I hope that the case is complicated.

707
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,640
The Ministry of Justice can use the Cui Ku

708
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
to promote the new Pujing Entertainment City

709
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,640
994466.

710
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,640
Com.

711
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
The most exciting game on the line.

712
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,640
The horse is running.

713
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
The horse is running.

714
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,640
The horse is running.

715
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,640
The horse is running.

716
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
The horse is almost running.

717
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
Union.

718
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,640
Union.

719
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
Union.

720
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,520
At that time, the situation was chaotic.

721
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,520
It's not impossible without a subordinate.

722
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,640
Eunuch Wu Fan, I'm leaving first.

723
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
You...

724
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,640
Good qin.

725
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,640
Yu Jin.

726
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,640
Have you been feeling unwell lately?

727
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,640
No.

728
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Unfortunately, the Dragon World is not a good place.

729
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,640
It can make you feel better.

730
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,640
Brother Su, you reminded me.

731
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,640
This time, it's good to soak in hot spring.

732
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
There are some good soups in the capital.

733
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,640
The biggest one is Prince Ji.

734
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,640
He said I can bring my friends with me.

735
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
Brother Su, let's go together.

736
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,640
I'm not going.

737
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,640
You mean Prince Ji is the youngest brother of His Majesty?

738
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,640
The uncle of Prince Huan.

739
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,640
It's him.

740
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,640
Prince Ji is a wonderful man.

741
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,640
He is very handsome.

742
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,640
He is very handsome.

743
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,640
Brother Su, you should know him.

744
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
His Majesty.

745
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,640
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

746
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,640
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

747
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

748
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
How are you?

749
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

750
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,640
You said goodbye.

751
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,640
But you have a result.

752
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
I'm here to see you.

753
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,640
I've sent the imperial court to the imperial court.

754
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
The Duke of Qing's palace, Bo Ye,

755
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,640
has 17 people in total.

756
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Qingduo is a private property.

757
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
He killed people.

758
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,640
He destroyed the evidence.

759
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,640
He destroyed the officials and broke the witness.

760
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,640
All of them are guilty of the investigation.

761
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,640
You are sentenced to death.

762
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,640
You are not allowed to be in the court.

763
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
The court is in charge of the female official.

764
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,640
Please accept the punishment.

765
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,640
Your Majesty, Wen Yuanbo is waiting again.

766
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,640
Go to the side gate to prepare the sedan.

767
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
I'll go there.

768
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,640
Yes.

769
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,640
Who is the suspect?

770
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,640
The chief of the Ministry of Justice, Cai Quan.

771
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
Your Majesty.

772
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Good.

773
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,640
You know what to do.

774
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
You are very wise.

775
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

776
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,640
Jingyan, you did a good job.

777
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
You should take care of the rest.

778
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,640
Everything is stable.

779
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,640
I agree.

780
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,640
The case is indeed beautiful.

781
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,640
Father really chose the right person.

782
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,640
Such a big case.

783
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,640
Thanks to Jingyan.

784
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
I've changed my mind.

785
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,640
I'm afraid I can't make it.

786
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,640
You are very sensible this time.

787
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
You have saved me a lot of time.

788
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
You know what?

789
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,640
You are the most stable and honest person in my son.

790
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,640
I heard that you helped Jingyan

791
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,640
to deal with some things.

792
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,640
I'm afraid that Jingyan will be in trouble.

793
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,640
If he doesn't do well,

794
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,640
I'll help him to get rid of him.

795
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
You are so kind.

796
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,640
I'm very kind.

797
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,640
I'll give you the royal token.

798
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,640
Yes.

799
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,640
I thank you, Father.

800
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,640
You're welcome.

801
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,640
What's this?

802
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
Prince Jing is so hardworking.

803
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,640
The case is so beautiful.

804
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,640
He won a few ungrateful awards.

805
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,640
Prince Yu is just a mess.

806
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
He is going to be a big hit.

807
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,640
He really doesn't know what to do.

808
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
Forget it, Lord Cai.

809
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
You always do this.

810
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,640
Don't be angry.

811
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
Jingyan.

812
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,640
Jingyan, wait for me.

813
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
Don't be angry.

814
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,640
I'm very satisfied with your job.

815
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,640
He wants you to be together

816
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,640
after you finish everything.

817
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
I'm a worker.

818
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,640
I'll take care of your work.

819
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,640
If you don't mind,

820
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,640
I'll send the gold and silver coins

821
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,640
to your mansion.

822
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640
You're welcome.

823
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
I only do business.

824
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,640
I don't need these.

825
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,640
I didn't use them for you.

826
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,640
I'm not using them.

827
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,640
I'm just doing business.

828
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,640
I didn't use them for you.

829
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,640
The first-born girls are just about to be used.

830
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
I'm just a prince.

831
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,640
I only have a concubine.

832
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,640
I don't need these things

833
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,640
in terms of rules.

834
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
Thank you for your kindness.

835
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,640
You're just a stubborn temper.

836
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,640
But you can do this.

837
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
Prince Feng is late.

838
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,640
There's no big deal.

839
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,640
Is there anything else?

840
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,640
The show is about to come.

841
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
I'm going to the New Year's Eve.

842
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
Since you're here,

843
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,640
I can't invite you to the New Year's Eve.

844
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
You've invited me before?

845
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,640
Didn't you send the iron?

846
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
I have to

847
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
organize the work

848
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,640
before I get the money.

849
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,640
How about this?

850
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,640
I'll send the iron myself this year.

851
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,640
You must come.

852
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Okay.

853
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,640
I should go and see the emperor.

854
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,640
I'll take my leave.

855
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Okay.

856
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
Sister.

857
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,640
Sister.

858
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
I've been looking for a case.

859
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
It's about He Wenxing's murder case.

860
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,640
I'm sure you're interested.

861
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,640
Xiao Yi Jin.

862
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,640
Xiao Yi Jin.

863
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,640
I'm busy in the city today.

864
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,640
You came to drink with me.

865
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
Good boy.

866
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,640
Jin Rui.

867
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
Prince.

868
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,640
You're like a family to me.

869
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,640
Don't be so stubborn.

870
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
Drink.

871
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Yes.

872
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
I'm not a family.

873
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,640
I'm just a family.

874
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
Drink.

875
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,640
Yes.

876
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,640
Drink.

877
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,640
Look at my naughty girl's hand.

878
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
Your hand.

879
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,640
Your hand.

880
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,640
That hand is really good.

881
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,640
It's worse than the girl in the palace.

882
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,640
It must be worse than the girl in the palace.

883
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
No.

884
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,640
Prince Ji's singing is always good.

885
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
Prince.

886
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Look at that girl.

887
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,640
She's a bit of a new-born girl.

888
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,640
Yes.

889
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,640
The song of the Miaoyin House.

890
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,640
The new-born girl.

891
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,640
The flower of the red embroidered jade.

892
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,640
It's not.

893
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
It's a pity.

894
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,640
If the case is not settled,

895
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,640
the new-born and adopted girl

896
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,640
can't come out and dance anymore.

897
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,640
Prince, don't be sad.

898
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,640
Don't be sad.

899
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,640
Prince, don't be sad.

900
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,640
But it's strange to say that.

901
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,640
Why hasn't the case been settled yet?

902
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,640
Has He Wenxin killed or not?

903
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,640
He killed.

904
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,640
What?

905
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,640
I saw it myself.

906
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,640
Prince Ji.

907
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:03,640
Prince Ji.
