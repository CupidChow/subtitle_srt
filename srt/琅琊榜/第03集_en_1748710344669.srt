1
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,380
pathetic

2
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,100
You'reutated.

3
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,340
See how stupid you are?

4
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,460
I'm gonna殺 you for good.

5
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,140
I'm going to beat you to death.

6
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,340
I'm going to beat you to death.

7
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,340
Good.

8
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,500
You have an inspiration.

9
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,100
You're your child

10
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,620
and you want to teach every other thing.

11
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,180
Listen to me,

12
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,100
Don't think that if Prince Jin�리 likes you,

13
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,420
he'd protect you.

14
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,220
He even parks in the palace.

15
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,620
What the Noble Consort has is

16
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,580
the one who is on the throne

17
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,980
and can protect you.

18
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,820
Give it to me.

19
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,580
I'll kill you.

20
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,060
Stop.

21
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,540
I'll kill you.

22
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,220
I don't dare to.

23
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,660
I'm not on the throne.

24
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,220
I don't have the right to be your servant.

25
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,460
I deserve to die

26
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,980
to be the King of Jing.

27
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,260
This little servant

28
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,100
always

29
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,940
blames and blames me

30
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,100
and even blames me.

31
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,420
This time, I really can't do anything

32
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,540
to punish him.

33
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,940
Your Highness,

34
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,100
this place is

35
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,420
where the Noble Consort of Yue

36
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,180
is the one who ordered me to be here.

37
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,380
Your Highness,

38
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,340
please forgive me

39
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,420
for being so generous

40
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,180
and blames me.

41
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,980
You bastard.

42
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,620
Nonsense.

43
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,260
How dare you

44
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,060
to take the name of the Noble Consort of Yue?

45
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,340
Your Highness.

46
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,300
I don't care

47
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,980
if you are so generous.

48
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,620
Your Highness.

49
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,500
Get out of here.

50
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

51
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,940
Go.

52
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,020
I'm glad to hear that.

53
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,300
But I can't

54
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,100
be your servant.

55
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,540
Does it hurt?

56
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,460
Because I hope that

57
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,460
your situation is difficult.

58
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,060
The other princes

59
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,300
are waiting to see you laugh.

60
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,260
These little people in the palace

61
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,700
can't be bothered.

62
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,900
They can't be bothered.

63
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,780
What's your name?

64
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,980
Ting Sheng.

65
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,460
How old are you?

66
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,460
I'm eleven years old.

67
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,420
Eleven years old.

68
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,260
Ting Sheng.

69
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,780
Good.

70
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,100
Good.

71
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,180
Good.

72
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,780
Good.

73
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,780
Xie Bi.

74
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,820
Go and check it out.

75
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,940
Why aren't they coming back?

76
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:08,980
Yes.

77
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,700
The princess said

78
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,780
she wanted to ask Mr. Su for help.

79
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,820
She can't come back in a while.

80
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,580
Besides,

81
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,940
Mr. Su is not feeling well.

82
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,140
He must be tired.

83
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,740
It's possible that he can

84
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,660
go back to rest.

85
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,260
Yes.

86
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,420
As the jade emperor said,

87
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,100
even if Mr. Su comes back now,

88
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,540
he will be tired.

89
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,300
Let's disturb him another day.

90
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,220
Good.

91
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,340
Take care, Your Highness.

92
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,820
Who are you?

93
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,180
This is Mr. Su Zhe.

94
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,820
Mr. Su.

95
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,460
Xiao Jingrui's friend

96
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,860
came to the capital to recuperate.

97
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,220
I'm not sure.

98
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,060
It's natural

99
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,140
that you don't know him.

100
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,580
If you don't know him,

101
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,740
don't go back to you stay in there.

102
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,540
May you have good news.

103
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,300
Thank you.

104
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,060
Autumn Delta Rift

105
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,940
is getting goin'

106
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,580
out of the capital.

107
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,700
The time it was graduat stung

108
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,220
next is interl vue to make the wUNG Gao Li Ka Castro smoke,

109
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,980
Inismatic with romanticабья

110
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,560
She is a common lover

111
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,100
She had been near me

112
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,360
Zao

113
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,260
Seemingly he Chrome

114
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,360
You look after your kid

115
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,860
Who is he

116
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,160
His mother

117
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,960
Is related to his daughter

118
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Blame Energy

119
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,360
I saw her pity

120
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
So I came to see you.

121
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
Tian Sheng.

122
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,360
Can you read this book fully?

123
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
I want to build a house.

124
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
I want to make a foundation.

125
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
I just started to choose some well-known and well-known.

126
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
To learn the principles of the Holy Immortal.

127
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,360
This book is good.

128
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,360
But you are still young.

129
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,360
You may not have the right to write it.

130
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,360
If no one tells you, you can't understand the essence of it.

131
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
I have many books at home.

132
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,360
If you like it, I can teach you how to read.

133
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Mr. Su probably doesn't know that

134
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Ting Sheng is from Ye You Ting.

135
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
Even if he is old enough to let go,

136
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
he is also a servant in the outside world.

137
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,360
You don't have to think too much.

138
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
As long as you tell me,

139
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
would you like me to teach you how to read?

140
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
No.

141
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
You should go back first.

142
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
In a few days,

143
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,360
I will find a way to get you out.

144
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,360
Mr. Su, you may not know that

145
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
the servant of Ye You Ting

146
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
is not a common servant in the palace.

147
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
If you don't have any special skills,

148
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
you can't leave.

149
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Besides, His Majesty

150
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
always doesn't like people begging for these servants.

151
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Otherwise,

152
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
with the title of Prince Jin,

153
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
he would have asked for this child.

154
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
There are many things that you can't do.

155
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
How would you know the result?

156
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Why do you want me to try it?

157
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
There are hundreds of servants like Ting Sheng

158
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,360
in the palace.

159
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,360
What special skills can he have

160
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,360
to attract your attention?

161
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Since you are asking Mr. Su,

162
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,360
I would like to ask you.

163
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
You take care of this child

164
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
because of Tong Qing?

165
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Prince Jin has been fighting outside for years.

166
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
It's hard to get him out of the palace.

167
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
If I can get Ting Sheng out,

168
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,360
you will be less interested.

169
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
What can you do?

170
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
As long as you want to do it,

171
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
you can do it.

172
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Okay.

173
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
I'll wait and see.

174
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
I'll wait and see.

175
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Prince Jin,

176
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
I just saw these.

177
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
A book?

178
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
Yes.

179
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
You mean

180
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
my sister is different in words.

181
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Two people are still in the palace

182
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
and they are still in the palace.

183
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
You mean Tan Xin?

184
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
I don't know about that.

185
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
But they really didn't take him with them.

186
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
And they have been in the palace for a while.

187
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Wei,

188
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Yes.

189
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
While this person is still not gone,

190
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
you go and check his knowledge.

191
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,360
I heard that Shu Shang is the best at lying.

192
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Don't lie to my sister without two brushes.

193
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Yes.

194
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,360
You don't have any intention to keep Ming Li's heart.

195
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Who will believe you?

196
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
What's your name?

197
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Ting Shu.

198
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
How old are you?

199
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
I'm eleven years old.

200
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Shu Shang.

201
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
Come.

202
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Come to my grandma.

203
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
You are Su Zhe?

204
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
General Wei,

205
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,360
this is the order of the Empress Dowager.

206
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
I'm here.

207
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
Go.

208
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Yes.

209
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Although you look like a soft-skinned man,

210
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
but you are so capable of being the Empress Dowager

211
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
and the Empress Dowager,

212
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
I don't mind.

213
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,360
I'll let Wei teach you a lesson.

214
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Don't hurt me.

215
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,360
Stop.

216
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
Commander.

217
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
The city is in a critical place.

218
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
Why do you fight here?

219
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Commander,

220
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
I have misunderstood.

221
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
I just want...

222
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
What do you want?

223
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
You are making a fool of yourself.

224
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
You can come with her.

225
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
I can't control her if she is in danger.

226
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
What?

227
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
Will you invite the Princess over?

228
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
No.

229
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
I'm too reckless today.

230
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,360
I'm too reckless today.

231
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,360
I'm not evil at all.

232
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Commander,

233
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
please forgive me.

234
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
But I can't tell the Princess.

235
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
You can't leave.

236
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
I'll treat you to dinner.

237
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Yes.

238
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
The front is about to leave the palace.

239
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,360
I'll send Mr. Su away.

240
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
You can go back.

241
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Yes.

242
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Go.

243
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Fei Liu,

244
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,360
get out.

245
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Twelve years.

246
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Twelve years in the city.

247
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
You are finally back.

248
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Yes.

249
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
I'm finally back.

250
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
I'm finally back.

251
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
I'm finally back.

252
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
I'm finally back.

253
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
I'm finally back.

254
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
I'm finally back.

255
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
I've mentioned this to you many times.

256
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Don't come back.

257
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
Why don't you listen?

258
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
If someone finds out your identity,

259
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
no one can help you.

260
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,360
I'm now like this.

261
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Who would believe

262
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
I'm the rebel twelve years ago.

263
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Although you said it in your heart,

264
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
because of the illness and the severe inflammation,

265
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
I never thought

266
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,360
you would become so shameless

267
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
and ruthless.

268
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
But that day,

269
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
you recognized me

270
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
in the Duke of Ningguo's mansion.

271
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
I'm Su Zhe.

272
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Why did you live in the Duke of Ningguo's mansion?

273
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
You don't know who Xie Yu is?

274
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
If he finds out,

275
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
he will be moved out.

276
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
Where did you live?

277
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
You know what I came here for.

278
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
Since I can live in his mansion,

279
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
he won't find out.

280
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
But one day,

281
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
no one can know that we are real.

282
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
I know your determination.

283
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
I know.

284
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
I know.

285
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
I know.

286
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
But now,

287
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
two powerful princes in the capital are fighting.

288
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Five hundred officials are fighting for the crown.

289
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
Who can help you?

290
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Who doesn't know

291
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
that it's the crime of the Zhu Jiu Clan?

292
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
I've been in the capital for many years.

293
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
I've been planning for free.

294
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,360
I've been trying to make a move.

295
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
I didn't do anything.

296
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
I just want to try.

297
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
What if it's a fake?

298
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
I've told you many times.

299
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
It's always so complicated.

300
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Do you know what he is?

301
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Do you know why I'm going to fight with him?

302
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
You just try.

303
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
You're brainless.

304
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,360
What is he?

305
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
He's just a friend of the Duke of Ningguo's.

306
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Do you know the Duke of Ningguo's friend?

307
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
So you mean

308
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,360
you don't want to fight with me anymore?

309
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
I can just show my face.

310
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
If there's something wrong with the fight,

311
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
you and Yu Jin will tell me.

312
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
That's right.

313
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
The fight is divided.

314
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,360
I'm glad that you're still in good health.

315
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
You've decided to go to the court tomorrow.

316
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
You have to sleep early tonight.

317
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
I'll have a good rest.

318
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
The Clan Leader of Jiang Zomeng?

319
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
What's wrong with that?

320
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
We're in the same boat with him.

321
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
You're not

322
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,360
the one who's the Clan Leader, right?

323
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
I remember two years ago,

324
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
the South Chu Star soldier

325
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
fought in the water.

326
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
We couldn't get rid of

327
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,360
the alliance's iron lock strategy.

328
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
How could you forget?

329
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,360
At that time,

330
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
they used the iron lock alliance

331
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
to fight in the battle.

332
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
They forced me to go to the south.

333
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
I was worried and worried.

334
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
But I really couldn't get rid of it.

335
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Sister,

336
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,360
if you push me back again,

337
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
the Qing Ming Clan won't be able to protect me.

338
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Report!

339
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
Princess,

340
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
someone came from the outside.

341
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
They said that he's from the Clouds.

342
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,360
They said that there's a strategy

343
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
to break through the enemy's boat.

344
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
They want to frame Princess.

345
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Break through the enemy's boat?

346
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,360
I'm afraid you don't know either

347
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,360
that the person who used the iron lock strategy

348
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
is a fake.

349
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
So,

350
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
you sent them to follow him

351
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
after he left?

352
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
I sent them to the palace.

353
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
He didn't find anyone

354
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
to follow him.

355
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
He kept chasing Jiang Zuo.

356
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
But he disappeared

357
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
and didn't leave any trace.

358
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
What you mean is...

359
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
If Jiang Zuo didn't

360
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
break through the enemy's boat,

361
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
who would have done

362
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
such a clean chase?

363
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
But if this person

364
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
has nothing to do with Jiang Zuo,

365
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
why would he help him?

366
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
Could it be that the person who broke through the enemy

367
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
was sent by Meichang Su?

368
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,360
Meichang Su

369
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
seems to be a man

370
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
who's living in the martial arts world.

371
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
He has no connections with Yunnan Mu's Mansion.

372
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
But he helped me to solve the problem.

373
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
Now, he's in the capital

374
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
and is in the middle of the chaos.

375
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,360
But he doesn't show who he is.

376
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
This person

377
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,360
is a secret group.

378
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
No one in Manhou's Mansion

379
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
has found me.

380
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
But you found him first.

381
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Fei Liu.

382
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
Let Brother Meng come in.

383
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
He's my guest.

384
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,360
You go ahead.

385
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
Close the door.

386
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,360
The weather is still hot in the east.

387
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
It's already hot in the east.

388
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
You've already heated up the fire.

389
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
I think your wound

390
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,360
hasn't healed yet.

391
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Why are you in the capital so anxious?

392
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,360
You said you didn't tell me

393
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
that I wasn't prepared at all.

394
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
How should I help you?

395
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Brother Meng.

396
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
You're now the commander of the imperial army.

397
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
You're very kind.

398
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Why must you be tired of me?

399
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
You just pretend to not know me.

400
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Even if you've helped me a lot.

401
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
What are you talking about?

402
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Who are you to see me as a man?

403
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Brother Meng.

404
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
I know

405
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
your love for me.

406
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
But as you said in the palace,

407
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
I don't have much confidence

408
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
in what I'm doing now.

409
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
I don't want you to get involved.

410
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
If I fail,

411
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
I'm afraid that

412
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
the people of the Ming Dynasty

413
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
will regret it.

414
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,360
You're finally in your heart.

415
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
You're in your heart.

416
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
You're not in your name.

417
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,360
Although I've been in the army for a year,

418
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,360
I've finally believed in the loyalty of the imperial family.

419
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
I believe in you.

420
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
Chief Gao.

421
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
There were many people

422
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,360
who survived

423
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
without a single word.

424
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Except for me,

425
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
you only know Wei Zheng.

426
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
70,000 people?

427
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
Chief Gao.

428
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
What happened

429
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
12 years ago?

430
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,360
For the sake of the imperial army.

431
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
Chief Gao.

432
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,360
Father.

433
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
Father.

434
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
Father.

435
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
70,000 people

436
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,360
are almost dead.

437
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,360
Brother Meng.

438
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,360
When it's right,

439
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,360
I'll tell you the truth.

440
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,360
Okay.

441
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Okay.

442
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
Tell me.

443
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
What do you need me for?

444
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
You mean

445
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Brother Su won't go to the camp these days?

446
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
He won't go to the battlefield either?

447
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
Maybe in the last day.

448
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,360
Maybe in the last day,

449
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
he'll go there in the last day.

450
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
It's been a long time since he came to see me off.

451
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
It's good that it's winter.

452
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
It's snowing.

453
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
You two are so busy.

454
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
That's why you're so hard-working.

455
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
Brother, go to the dance.

456
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,360
This is the gift for Prince Yu.

457
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
Okay.

458
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
Xie Bi.

459
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
It's none of your business.

460
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Xie Bi is the son of the Duke of Ningguo.

461
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
Let him go out.

462
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
Let's go.

463
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
Go.

464
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Go.

465
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,360
The fifth-year senior, Yan Yu, is the winner.

466
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Jing Rui, how is it?

467
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
It was supposed to be 58 moves.

468
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,360
But it took 65 moves.

469
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,360
It's to show

470
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
your identity as a Luo Ying soldier.

471
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
Right?

472
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
You know me better than you.

473
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,360
It's okay to be a martial artist.

474
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,360
You look more handsome.

475
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,360
Yes.

476
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,360
I think they should

477
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,360
go to the camp in person

478
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
in a few days.

479
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
You don't need to worry about these things.

480
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
Tomorrow is the last day of the dance selection.

481
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,360
You and Yu Jing have been together for a few days.

482
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
It's okay to be a member of the Wen clan, right?

483
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,360
Of course it's okay.

484
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,360
But Yu Jing

485
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,360
is not willing to say it.

486
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
After tomorrow,

487
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,360
the ten people of the Princess Wen clan

488
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,360
will be chosen.

489
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,360
Most of them are still our Liang's children.

490
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Your Majesty, don't worry.

491
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
It's okay.

492
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,360
It's okay.

493
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,360
We don't have any Liang's face.

494
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Princess is a big deal.

495
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
Don't say that you care about it.

496
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,360
I and the Crown Prince

497
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
don't want to give the whole world

498
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
the Qing Nian Cuisine

499
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
to the Princess.

500
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,360
Yesterday,

501
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,360
the Crown Prince entered the palace

502
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,360
and even asked me to be the judge.

503
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
I heard that

504
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
the Sima Lei of the Imperial Wei family

505
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
is good at appearance,

506
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,360
but this time,

507
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
she hasn't lost the dance yet.

508
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
As for the little thing of the concubine,

509
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
the Wen clan is not inferior to the dance clan.

510
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
Since His Majesty is very generous,

511
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
it's better to let the child

512
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,360
of the Sima Lei

513
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
choose the Princess

514
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
in front of her.

515
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,360
I understand what you mean.

516
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
It's rare

517
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,360
to have the same idea as you.

518
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,360
But the one she admires

519
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,360
is the daughter of the Marquis of the Marquis of the Central Court.

520
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,360
The one Her Majesty admires

521
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,360
is not bad, of course.

522
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
But...

523
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,360
I'm getting old.

524
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
I'm a little ill-tempered.

525
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
I'm a little bit like the Princess of the Wen clan.

526
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,360
I don't plan to see it myself.

527
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
So,

528
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
His Majesty

529
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,360
wants to be the Marquis of the Imperial Wei family?

530
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,360
I've met a Princess

531
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,360
myself.

532
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
She has no official position.

533
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
She's a white-haired woman.

534
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
His Majesty wants me to be the head of the Wen clan

535
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,360
and the imperial family.

536
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,360
The decree has been issued.

537
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,360
The Crown Prince is on his way.

538
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,360
How did His Majesty know about me?

539
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,360
You're well-known.

540
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,360
I'm sure he met you.

541
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
The fifth-century emperor,

542
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
the Great Liang Qin Shangzhi,

543
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
is the best-selling weapon in the war.

544
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Your Highness,

545
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,360
Qin Shangzhi is the best-selling weapon

546
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
in the world.

547
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
When he becomes the emperor,

548
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,360
will the princess be loyal?

549
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
You can't be so sure.

550
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
Please.

551
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,360
Yes.

552
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,360
I'm in great man's Credence.

553
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
Nice slap?

554
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,360
Jing-ui.

555
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,360
Did you beat them?

556
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,360
What about you?

557
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,360
Don't you

558
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
We are in a relationship.

559
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
It's not enough for him.

560
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,360
What did you say? Say it again.

561
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,360
To reply to father,

562
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,360
this white flag is from the North Yan City Chen.

563
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
The martial arts are very high,

564
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
and it protects everyone's reputation.

565
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
It seems that some days ago,

566
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,360
it was a very deep and hidden strategy.

567
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,360
I thought that you are not the opponent of Qi.

568
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,360
How could the Wolf-Eye Gang

569
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,360
have the name of the world's master?

570
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
Wolf-Eye has long been alive.

571
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,360
He was the one who used

572
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,360
the skills and strategy

573
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
that all the masters have shown.

574
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,360
If that White Flag had been hidden,

575
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
the Wolf-Eye Gang would not have its name.

576
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,360
By the way,

577
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
when the martial arts were in the same place,

578
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
father asked him.

579
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
Your Majesty,

580
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,360
I have seen the two White Flag battles.

581
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,360
This person is very strong.

582
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
I think

583
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,360
the Princess is indeed not his opponent.

584
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,360
The Princess must not marry into the North Yan City.

585
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Although the North Yan City has been well-off with me this year,

586
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,360
that is because we are strong in the North.

587
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
That is why there is no war in the border.

588
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,360
Once the Princess marries into the North Yan City,

589
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,360
the North Yan City will be like the sky.

590
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,360
The consequences will be unimaginable.

591
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,360
What other way do you have?

592
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
Sister,

593
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
how could you still sit there?

594
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
That White Flag really

595
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
threw that flag on the ground.

596
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
I think you may not be able to sit there.

597
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
White Flag is a very hard worker.

598
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Why should I compare him to

599
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
someone else's father?

600
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,360
I am not joking.

601
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,360
The Commander Meng said you may not be able to win.

602
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,360
Let's not talk about whether White Flag is a group of people.

603
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,360
Just because he looks like he can't eat.

604
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
You have learned to be a good person at any time.

605
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,360
Where have you read books this year?

606
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,360
I am serious, sister.

607
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
Think about it.

608
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,360
Even if you put White Flag into the last one in the Wen Clan,

609
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,360
he will still be there.

610
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,360
If you force him to do so,

611
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,360
you have to choose one of the nine in front.

612
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
Although there are some of the nine in front,

613
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
I still feel that

614
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
there is no real reason for you to do so.

615
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,360
You just got older.

616
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
Do you know what reason is?

617
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,360
Brother Su,

618
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
do you have any other way?

619
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,360
If you want me to do something,

620
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
I will have to let me see

621
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,360
the White Flag in the Palace of the Emperor

622
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,360
tomorrow.

623
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
Then I can draw it slowly.

624
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
That's right.

625
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,360
Brother Su hasn't seen that White Flag yet.

626
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Thank you for coming to the meeting.

627
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
Tomorrow's Palace of the Emperor,

628
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,360
I will be here early.

629
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
That's great.

630
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,360
Minister Shichen, please wait.

631
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,360
The Palace of the Emperor's Tomorrow,

632
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,360
I have someensa to say.

633
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,360
Isn't it ridiculous?

634
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
It's extremely cold.

635
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
Two years later,

636
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,360
you will have something interesting going on.

637
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,360
Minister Shichen has told me

638
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,360
about his proximity to theback pit.

639
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
But it certainly doesn't seem like

640
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
he wants to avoid threats.

641
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,360
Now,

642
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,360
I can risk aervice to breache

643
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,360
for myself.

644
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,360
So whom would you give,

645
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,360
to his throne?

646
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,360
Pay some allots.

647
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
Although everyone in the capital knows about this,

648
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,360
the Beiyan envoy is from the foreign people.

649
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,360
They may not know about it.

650
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,360
If they think that the emperor is against them,

651
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,360
they will surely have some kind of concern.

652
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,360
Maybe you can find a way to make Bai Liqi be a bit more talented.

653
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,360
It may not be as you wish.

654
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,360
The list of ten people is not to be missed.

655
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,360
If those people knew the name of Jingrui,

656
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
they wouldn't send someone to investigate it?

657
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
I'm not sure about it.

658
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
I'd like to ask you a favor.

659
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,360
Minister Shichen, please say something.

660
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,360
Yesterday, the emperor saw a young man named Xiao Jingrui

661
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,360
among the ten princes of the imperial family.

662
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,360
Could it be the emperor's son?

663
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,360
I know Jingrui's identity well.

664
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,360
But I don't know the other people's feelings.

665
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,360
I know! I know!

666
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,360
I know it very well!

667
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,360
You're a year older than me.

668
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,360
What can you know?

669
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Of course I know!

670
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,360
When the princess was born,

671
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,360
she was in the capital and was very warm.

672
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,360
So she had to live in a place in Rui Mountain, Ni Guo'an.

673
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,360
That night, the lady of the Jue Furen of Tianquan Mountain

674
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,360
was just on her way to the mountain.

675
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,360
She was so hungry that she went to her place.

676
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,360
The princess was so worried.

677
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,360
So she asked the lady of the Jue Furen to stay by her side.

678
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,360
I heard that the master of the Jue Furen just took over Tianquan Mountain.

679
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,360
She was very busy.

680
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,360
She didn't stay by the lady's side.

681
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,360
Not only the master of the Jue Furen,

682
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,360
but also the lady of the Jue Furen and the master of the Jue Furen

683
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,360
were also busy with the military affairs at the time.

684
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,360
The master and the lady of the Jue Furen

685
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,360
were both very busy and had to live together.

686
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,360
So they had to live together.

687
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
But then,

688
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
they were just on that night.

689
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
Sister,

690
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,360
do you think it's pretty?

691
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360
What's wrong, sister?

692
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
I'm afraid that it's going to be deep.

693
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,360
Go and call the shaman.

694
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Lady, lady, lady.

695
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
I'm scared.

696
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
Go and get the water towel.

697
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,360
Yes.

698
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
Be careful.

699
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360
Mother!

700
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
Mother!

701
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,360
So this is how it was.

702
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Two young girls just came out of the dark.

703
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,360
They were in a dark room.

704
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
They were shaking hands when they were panicking.

705
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,360
When they were hugged again,

706
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,360
they couldn't tell which one was the Jue Furen

707
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,360
and which one was the Xie Furen.

708
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,360
That's even worse.

709
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,360
The next day,

710
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,360
one of them became a demon.

711
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
Only one of them.

712
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
Who do you think this is?

713
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
Since the Heavens are like this,

714
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
how can we fight them?

715
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,360
The situation was very complicated.

716
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
It was hard to make up for it.

717
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
So I gave her this name.

718
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,360
It was like a gift from the Marquis of Ningguo

719
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,360
and the Heavens.

720
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,080
SHE CAME Out

721
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,160
Go.

722
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,520
Your Highness, let me report.

723
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,360
No need.

724
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,040
Your Highness.

725
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,360
Jingrui.

726
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,480
This time, you don't need to force me.

727
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,880
Just do your best.

728
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,960
I know I'm not good enough for Bai Liqi.

729
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,640
I just want to hurt her more.

730
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,040
In this case, you'll have more confidence.

731
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,760
Jingrui.

732
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,000
Your Highness.

733
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,880
This is Mr. Su Zhe, right?

734
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,400
Yes.

735
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,760
I'm Su Zhe.

736
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,440
Jingrui.

737
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:50,920
All right.

738
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,680
Don't mention it.

739
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,160
I just want to ask.

740
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,120
How are you going to solve Bai Liqi's case?

741
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,200
Do you need help?

742
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,480
Your Highness, you mean

743
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,320
I'm in charge of Bai Liqi's case?

744
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,360
Of course.

745
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,800
You're with my sister and you're in charge of her.

746
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,280
Who are you to take care of this case?

747
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
Since that, I'll save her.

748
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
All right.

749
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
Don't mention it.

750
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,880
Let's go.

751
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,680
Listen.

752
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,680
If you can't handle it,

753
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,280
I'll have to find someone to kill her.

754
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,880
The Su Zhe is in the palace.

755
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,920
Your Highness.

756
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,640
Greetings, Your Majesty.

757
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,960
Well.

758
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,280
I am doing this.

759
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,720
Get up.

760
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,960
I have given all of you

761
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,920
any permission

762
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,760
to confer your sinon mighty for secondhand.

763
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,740
But, although I am responsible for this,

764
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,740
I glad to announce my graduation since being the��을 in history.

765
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,900
Yes.

766
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,780
Come here

767
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,780
and sit in the Windows

768
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,140
with me.

769
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,620
Yes.

770
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,020
Thank you, Your Majesty.

771
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,500
I heard there would be

772
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,100
an européous need at a beholding Hallelujah today.

773
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,300
But our inner world

774
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,380
isn't able to see it good enough.

775
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,640
You see, it's not so easy for Beiyan to drive a horse like that.

776
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,980
You really have to put on this much pressure for her.

777
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,280
Since so many people in prior to the war,

778
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,400
Her Majesty has advisers to be dressed in the same way you.

779
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,460
I heard Her Majesty Mary had made a fancy to

780
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,140
a temple warm-up for mosthes masterwells.

781
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,140
I thought it was a good idea.

782
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,140
But I didn't expect it to be a matter of public service.

783
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,140
I'm not worried about that Bai Li Qi

784
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,140
is just a bad person.

785
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,140
I'm sure that you have a way to deal with it.

786
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,140
We just need to think about

787
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,140
how to give the princess a dowry.

788
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,140
The princess' thoughts are really hard to control.

789
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,140
You said that if you choose ten people,

790
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,140
you have to take another one.

791
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,140
If the princess doesn't choose one,

792
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,140
we'll just think about the dowry and there's no place for it.

793
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,140
I think the princess is a girl.

794
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:19,140
Can't she just keep on being so stubborn?

795
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,140
You mean the princess?

796
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,140
Okay, sit down.

797
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,140
Nine passes, three rounds.

798
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,140
There's no place for it.

799
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,140
Since the ten of you are all Bai Li and the one who chose one,

800
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,140
why don't we take a look at the dowry

801
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,140
and see how it goes?

802
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,140
Prince Yu is right.

803
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,140
How can the court make sword dance?

804
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,140
Moreover, I'm here.

805
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,140
I thought...

806
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,140
I...

807
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,140
Father, I thought

808
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:29,140
the dance was more than just a dance.

809
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,140
You two,

810
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,140
you're both very good at dancing.

811
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,140
You can try it.

812
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,140
But I have to pay attention to the difference.

813
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,140
Come on.

814
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,140
Your Majesty, I'm Xiao Jingrui.

815
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,140
I'm here to ask for your permission.

816
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,140
Please.

817
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,140
Please.

818
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,140
Your Majesty.

819
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,140
Your Majesty.

820
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,140
Your Majesty.

821
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,140
Your Majesty.

822
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,140
I usually use scissors.

823
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,320
intruders

824
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,700
So, who involves

825
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,680
your heart

826
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:56,200
for me

827
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,920
In a sea of

828
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,840
mud

829
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,020

The mountain is like a flower, the mountain is like a flower
