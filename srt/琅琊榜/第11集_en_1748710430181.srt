00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,500
Your Highness, don't be sad.

3
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
But it's strange to say it.

4
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Why hasn't the case been solved yet?

5
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Has He Wenxin killed or not?

6
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,500
He killed.

7
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,500
What?

8
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
I saw it myself.

9
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
What's going on?

10
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,500
What's going on?

11
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Mr. He killed Qiu Zan.

12
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
He killed?

13
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Look.

14
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
I see.

15
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
He's so scared.

16
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,000
He's waiting for the investigation to be done.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You found out that Mr. Ji is a serious person like He Wenxin?

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There were a lot of people in the scene.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's impossible for a high school student to pass the test.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So we don't know whether he's here.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is hard.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Although Mr. Ji doesn't like to be in court,

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
he loves to study and study.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But if Wen Yuanbo asks the royal priest,

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
he will tell the truth.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If Wen Yuanbo really loves Mr. Ji

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,500
and the royal priest is in a grudge,

28
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
he won't be able to escape.

29
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,000
But you don't have to

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,500
turn your face to the royal priest for a mature son.

31
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
It seems that He Wenxin can't save him.

32
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Although this is hard,

33
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
He Jingzhong has been with me for so many years.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We still have to think about it.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If we really can't do it,

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
we can't even connect the Ministry of Justice to the chain.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Luckily, you're here.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You've been in charge of many things.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This time, you can realize that the Ministry of Justice may have made a mistake.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
How can I let you do it?

41
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Although Ban Ruo is a female,

42
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,500
she always has the chance to go to the military court.

43
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Now, I'm glad that you're here

44
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,500
to give me the chance to be the crown prince.

45
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
I'm willing to do it.

46
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Okay.

47
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Is His Highness here?

48
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Is there anything wrong, Your Highness?

49
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
You've been working all day.

50
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
It's time to go to bed.

51
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

52
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Come in.

53
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Greetings, Your Highness.

54
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Your Highness.

55
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Your Highness.

56
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
The Marquis is here.

57
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Did you hear that Yang Liuxing has been in charge of the murder case?

58
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,500
The case of Zheng Feng's murder has always been a good one.

59
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
The capital has already been changed.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Unfortunately, the son of He Jingzhong, Fan An,

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
if he can pull this off as my one piece, that would be great.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,500
This case is indeed very far away.

63
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,000
It has nothing to do with us.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Your Highness,

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
shouldn't your time of duty be in these lockers?

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Time of duty?

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Your time of duty is to make Noble Consort Hui's position.

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,500
Prince Yu has a empress in the palace.

69
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,500
We are now all blind and blind.

70
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
I'm not in a hurry.

71
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
Mother and father...

72
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,500
The Marquis is here.

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
The most exciting game of the day.

74
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Marquis Hu, Marquis Hu II,

75
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
the Queen of the Rites,

76
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
the Royal Capital,

77
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
the Royal Capital,

78
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
the Royal Capital,

79
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
the Royal Capital,

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
the Royal Capital,

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
the Royal Capital,

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
the Royal Capital...

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If...

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
if you are able to make it,

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
it alright by yourself?

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Your Highness.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
One more month.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Therefore, we are at new age.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
With this year-end Meiji,

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,860
it's the most important

91
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,860
Ã®n replied to our capricious mother.

92
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,860
You are not in the position to pay the price.

93
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,060
What's the relationship between you and me?

94
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,060
Grandmother!

95
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,060
Son!

96
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,060
Grandmother!

97
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,060
You are back!

98
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,060
Come, let me see you.

99
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,060
Let's go to the house.

100
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,060
We will talk.

101
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,060
Thank you, my lord.

102
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,060
My lord,

103
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,060
it's been three years since you came to the house.

104
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,060
He has been receiving money,

105
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,060
and he has been giving away the gold,

106
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,060
and he has been thinking about it.

107
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,060
This is a very simple thing.

108
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,060
It's not like the people who came to your house.

109
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,060
My lord,

110
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,060
this matter is all about your hands.

111
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,060
My lord,

112
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,060
do you want to talk about it here?

113
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,060
My lord,

114
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,060
please come to the study room to have tea.

115
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,060
Please.

116
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,060
My lord, do you mean

117
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,060
you are only a minor in the middle of the year?

118
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,060
In terms of etiquette,

119
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,060
His Majesty is the emperor of the world.

120
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,060
Second Concubine is now in the palace.

121
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,060
She is not allowed to go on stage to attend the ceremony.

122
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,060
It's not right for her to go on stage, right?

123
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
Yes.

124
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,060
As the crown prince's crown prince,

125
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,060
I am the emperor's wife.

126
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,060
After the ceremony,

127
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,060
I need to serve my parents and my family.

128
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,060
I am a filial son.

129
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,060
Right?

130
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,060
Yes.

131
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,060
Look.

132
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,060
How do you know where the princess is?

133
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,060
Is she the crown prince's mother?

134
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,060
Or the first concubine?

135
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,060
Should she be on stage to attend the ceremony,

136
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,060
or to kneel to the outside?

137
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,060
Is there any difficulty in this?

138
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,060
This is not a matter of defense.

139
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
Because...

140
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,060
What did you say?

141
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,060
It's not a matter of defense.

142
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,060
My lord,

143
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,060
should I think it over

144
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,060
and then say it?

145
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,060
You can say it.

146
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,060
Please, my lord.

147
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,060
I am not trying to embarrass you, minister.

148
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,060
I just want you to be a good emperor.

149
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,060
The rules of this ceremony are important to the court and the royal family.

150
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,060
Whether it is smooth or not,

151
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,060
we can't be too careful.

152
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,060
The rules of the ceremony are very important.

153
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,060
How should I explain it?

154
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,060
Your minister Li

155
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,060
speaks the most.

156
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,060
Am I right?

157
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,060
You mean,

158
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,060
it's not good to arrange the ceremony for the annual committee?

159
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,060
Your majesty,

160
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,060
it's easy to say.

161
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,060
This is the position of the imperial concubine.

162
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,060
It's a bit difficult.

163
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,060
Your highness, as the crown prince's mother,

164
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,060
if the position of the imperial concubine is kneeled to the outside,

165
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,060
I'm afraid there will be a problem with the royal family.

166
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,060
If it is arranged on the stage,

167
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,060
it will be a mess.

168
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,060
The palace will be in trouble.

169
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,060
Your majesty,

170
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,060
the Duke of Ningguo asked to see you.

171
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,060
He said that the phoenix edict

172
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,060
would come to the northwest to return to the imperial palace.

173
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,060
Good thing that you are back today.

174
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,060
I forgot that

175
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,060
he came here.

176
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,060
He is from the tribe of Buxianggan.

177
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,060
Ask him to come in.

178
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,060
Yes.

179
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,060
Get up.

180
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,060
I'm here to thank you, Duke of Ningguo.

181
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,060
I'm from the northwestern military base in the capital,

182
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,060
please allow me to introduce you to your majesty.

183
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,060
I'm from the northwestern military base in the capital,

184
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,060
please allow me to introduce you to your majesty.

185
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,060
It's not urgent.

186
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,060
Please leave the memorial paper.

187
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,060
I'll take my leave.

188
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,060
Your majesty is in the business.

189
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,060
I'll take my leave.

190
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,060
Since you are here,

191
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,060
I want to ask you something.

192
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,060
Do you think

193
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,060
if the position of the imperial concubine is kneeled to the outside,

194
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,060
there is something wrong?

195
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,060
I dare not say much about this internal palace.

196
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,060
I ask you,

197
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
you just answer.

198
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,060
I think

199
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,060
the crown prince is virtuous.

200
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,060
The imperial concubine is very good at the imperial palace.

201
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,060
If the imperial concubine is not in the palace,

202
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,060
then the position of the imperial concubine is more important.

203
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,060
The position of the imperial concubine is more important.

204
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,060
There was also a misunderstanding.

205
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,060
It's just because of your family business,

206
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,060
so no one dared to explain it.

207
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,060
The county is back to business.

208
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,060
It's a good thing.

209
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,060
But it's a decree.

210
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,060
I wonder what's the point.

211
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,060
You don't know that the more you are guilty,

212
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:26,060
the more you are guilty.

213
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,060
I'm worried that if I set up a free will,

214
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,060
I will be in a difficult situation.

215
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,060
Father,

216
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,060
I would like to ask you for forgiveness.

217
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,060
Please accept my gratitude.

218
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,060
Your Majesty,

219
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,060
if it's because of this,

220
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,060
I think it's better to set up a free will.

221
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,060
What do you mean?

222
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,060
Your Majesty, please think carefully.

223
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,060
If the princess is kneeling,

224
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,060
it's a matter of time between you and me.

225
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,060
If the person is still in the position,

226
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,060
he will be in a dilemma.

227
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,060
It's not my fault.

228
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,060
Didn't you already order to punish the crown prince

229
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,060
to the crown princess?

230
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,060
To the princess,

231
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,060
it's a great favor.

232
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,060
Moreover,

233
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,060
there's no outsider here.

234
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,060
Just say it.

235
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,060
I'm a soldier.

236
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:30,060
I'm the most powerful and powerful soldier in the army.

237
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,060
Your Majesty,

238
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,060
you should take this matter into account.

239
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,060
You're not that kind of person.

240
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,060
You think too much.

241
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:46,060
I think that the army was in the capital.

242
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,060
Why didn't you get the job early?

243
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,060
What do you mean?

244
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,060
Your Majesty,

245
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,060
you're not the most powerful and powerful soldier in the army.

246
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,060
I think

247
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,060
you should take the position of the princess

248
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,060
and punish the crown prince.

249
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,060
Xun,

250
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,060
take the position.

251
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,060
Yes.

252
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,060
Your Highness.

253
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,060
Get out.

254
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,060
Your Highness,

255
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,060
please take care of yourself.

256
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,060
It's you.

257
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,060
Is there anything wrong?

258
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,060
I've already made you

259
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,060
the first-rate minister of the royal family.

260
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,060
I'd like to see if you have anything else to say.

261
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,060
You know my mother's name the best.

262
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,060
She's always satisfied.

263
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,060
Today,

264
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,060
I should do as you say.

265
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,060
Yes.

266
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,060
The maid in the mansion is not in good condition.

267
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,060
She's my uncle.

268
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,060
Please don't be angry, Your Highness.

269
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,060
It's not a matter of the maid.

270
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,060
Father ordered

271
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,060
to take the position of the princess.

272
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,060
Father ordered to

273
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,060
take the position of the princess.

274
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,060
Then,

275
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,060
what about the queen mother?

276
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,060
She's more angry.

277
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,060
She always likes you.

278
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
She's always been in the palace.

279
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,060
Please advise her.

280
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,060
Yes.

281
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,060
Although the woman in the mansion is not a good girl,

282
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,060
she's too fast.

283
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,060
She's only been alive for a few days.

284
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,060
Did we have to kill ourselves in Nanjing?

285
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,060
We're so embarrassed to be in the capital.

286
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,060
Your Majesty, you're right.

287
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,060
I was not there when I was in the palace.

288
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,060
I felt sorry when I came back.

289
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,060
The crown prince was free.

290
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,060
Now, Consort Yue is back.

291
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,060
What's the problem?

292
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,060
Yes.

293
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,060
Do you really think I'm not angry?

294
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,060
I just read it.

295
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,060
It's better to stay in Nanjing

296
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,060
and be more suitable.

297
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,060
Sister, how about this?

298
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,060
I'll go and find Mr. Su.

299
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,060
He has the most tricks.

300
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,060
I'll let him come up with some ideas.

301
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,060
I'm done.

302
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,060
What's wrong with you?

303
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,060
What do you want?

304
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,060
You don't know the news about Consort Yue's return.

305
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,060
The news has been published.

306
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,060
I just came back from the Prince of Mu's Mansion.

307
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,060
Prince of Mu is angry.

308
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,060
He's coming to bite the mute's tail.

309
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,060
It's a good bite.

310
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,060
Fei Liu said it.

311
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,060
The mute is soft.

312
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,060
It's a good bite.

313
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,060
You...

314
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,060
Have one.

315
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,060
I'll take it.

316
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,060
I'll take it.

317
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,060
I'll take it.

318
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,060
I'll take it.

319
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,060
I'll take it.

320
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,060
I'll take it.

321
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,060
Have one.

322
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,060
Don't make trouble.

323
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,060
Uncle,

324
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,060
you don't have any surprise

325
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,060
about Consort Yue's return.

326
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,060
What surprise?

327
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
Even if she's guilty,

328
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,060
it's not true.

329
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,060
The emperor never

330
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,060
puts others' suffering on the heart.

331
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,060
You don't know that?

332
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,060
No need to say that.

333
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,060
No matter what,

334
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,060
it's about the anniversary.

335
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,060
What's the connection

336
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,060
between the anniversary and the memorial?

337
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,060
According to the first point,

338
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,060
the crown prince is a good man.

339
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,060
He needs to serve his parents.

340
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,060
That's why Li Bu said

341
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,060
there should be a place

342
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,060
for the Yue family on the stage.

343
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,060
Is there no mother-in-law?

344
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,060
I don't need to serve the family here.

345
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,060
Your mother just recovered.

346
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,060
Go with her.

347
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,060
Thank you for your kindness.

348
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,060
Don't worry.

349
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,060
I'll be at the Prince of Mu's Mansion

350
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,060
to apologize to you.

351
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,060
What are you doing?

352
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,060
I can't remember.

353
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,060
You're the crown prince's

354
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,060
crown prince's crown prince.

355
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,060
You're the only one

356
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,060
who's hurt.

357
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,060
Understand?

358
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,060
Yes.

359
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,060
You don't need to go to the Prince of Mu's Mansion.

360
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,060
I'll send someone to.

361
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,060
According to the first point,

362
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,060
the crown prince should serve

363
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,060
the emperor and the empress

364
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,060
after he's drunk.

365
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,060
That's the real truth.

366
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,060
Am I right?

367
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,060
But...

368
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,060
But the past year...

369
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,060
The past year's memorial.

370
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,060
Because the Yue family is a royal family.

371
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,060
They're rich and well-off.

372
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,060
They're qualified

373
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,060
to fight with the empress

374
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,060
and establish a family.

375
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,060
That's why they're called

376
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,060
the Emperor's Family.

377
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,060
They're called the Emperor's Family.

378
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,060
They're called the Emperor's Family.

379
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,060
They're called the Emperor's Family.

380
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,060
They're the Emperor's family.

381
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,060
That's why the crown prince

382
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,060
is the most wealthy.

383
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,060
That's why they're called the Emperor's Family.

384
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,060
That's why they're called the Emperor's Family.

385
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,060
Even the most sensitive

386
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,060
part of the memorial

387
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,060
doesn't mean anything

388
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,060
to the crown prince.

389
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,060
Don't expect

390
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,060
other people

391
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,060
to realize the difference.

392
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,060
There are so many

393
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,060
changes in the memorial.

394
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,060
How should we

395
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,060
understand it?

396
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,060
The memorial should be the most clear.

397
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,060
Since Mr. Chen

398
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,060
has already written the letter,

399
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,060
I think

400
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,060
he should have

401
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,060
his reason.

402
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,060
Chen Yanzhi?

403
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,060
Since we're here,

404
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,060
we should

405
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,060
understand him.

406
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,060
You want to write the memorial?

407
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,060
The Eastern Palace

408
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,060
is standing up

409
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
at this moment.

410
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,060
Think about it.

411
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,060
Who's that?

412
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,060
It's quite sweet.

413
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,060
Minister Li, the minister of the court,

414
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,060
is still at the memorial.

415
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,060
He's been sent to me

416
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,060
and has already checked it.

417
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,060
Minister Li is very surprised.

418
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,060
Please rest assured.

419
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,060
Okay.

420
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,060
I'm Tian Dezhi,

421
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,060
from the capital, Yushan.

422
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,060
I'm here to report.

423
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,060
What is it?

424
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,060
I'm here to talk

425
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,060
with Minister Li,

426
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,060
Chen Yanzhi, and Minister Chen.

427
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,060
How dare you!

428
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,060
You're the minister of the court.

429
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,060
How dare you talk nonsense!

430
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,060
As Yushan,

431
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,060
Tian Dezhi has the right to talk.

432
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,060
He hasn't even started to say it.

433
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,060
How did the crown prince

434
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,060
know he was talking nonsense?

435
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,060
Tian Mingxing wants to talk to

436
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,060
Minister Chen.

437
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,060
What's his crime?

438
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,060
As Minister Li,

439
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,060
he has known the court for years

440
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
and has been in the process.

441
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,060
He has been in the process

442
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,060
but has not been in the process.

443
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,060
He is a failure.

444
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,060
The palace's Noble Consort

445
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,340
has been in the process of

446
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,340
killing the central palace.

447
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,060
The crown prince of the Eastern Palace

448
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,060
is not in the state of the empress.

449
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,060
He is filial.

450
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,060
Minister Li has never said

451
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,060
a word to the eunuch.

452
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,060
It's even more suspicious.

453
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,060
He wants to investigate the emperor's crime.

454
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,060
He wants to punish the emperor.

455
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,060
How dare you!

456
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,060
The court has always

457
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,060
arranged for Minister Li.

458
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,060
You're a jade.

459
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,060
Why do you say that?

460
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,060
It's a big mistake.

461
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,060
The Noble Consort

462
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,060
has always been in the process of

463
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,060
killing the central palace.

464
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,060
I have no evidence.

465
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,060
Moreover,

466
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,060
His Majesty is talking nonsense.

467
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,060
How dare you

468
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,060
to accuse the court of treason!

469
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,060
Who dares to do this to you?

470
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,060
The crown prince is angry.

471
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,060
In front of the emperor,

472
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,060
he is not louder than anyone.

473
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,060
I think

474
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,060
the words of the imperial edict

475
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,060
are not as profound as the words of the eunuch.

476
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,060
It's worth investigating.

477
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,060
Father.

478
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,060
I am willing to take the position of minister Li.

479
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Minister Li has been in the court for decades.

480
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,060
It's not as clear as he

481
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,060
is about the rules of the court.

482
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,060
Father, you are right.

483
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Father, you are right.

484
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,060
The court is more reasonable

485
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,060
than Minister Chen.

486
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,060
But the country of Li

487
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,060
is not as good as the country of Li.

488
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,060
I think

489
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
it's not clear.

490
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,060
Since the two sides are fighting,

491
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,060
we should ask for the

492
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,060
highest level of respect.

493
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,060
Let's talk to Minister Chen

494
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,060
about the court.

495
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,060
Let's see

496
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,060
whether the rules of these years

497
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,060
are clear.

498
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
Let's also ask

499
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,060
whether the people of the harem

500
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,060
are not as good as the people of the harem.

501
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,060
Jin Huan.

502
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,060
Are you going to

503
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,060
talk about the court?

504
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,060
It's a matter of the legal status of the court.

505
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,060
It's a matter of the sacredness.

506
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,060
The late crown prince, the eunuch,

507
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,060
and the eunuch are in the age of the eunuch.

508
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,060
The court has the legal status of the court.

509
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,060
The eunuch is still a person of the eunuch.

510
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,060
Please allow me to ask for your permission.

511
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,060
Father.

512
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,060
Father.

513
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,060
The late crown prince, the eunuch,

514
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,060
is still in the harem.

515
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,060
Who gave you the idea

516
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,060
of the court's debate?

517
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,060
What?

518
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,060
Mother, you think it's inappropriate?

519
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,060
Although you are strong,

520
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,060
you are worthy of the emperor's grace.

521
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,060
I'm afraid

522
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,060
you will be upset.

523
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,060
The eunuch

524
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,060
didn't put me in the eyes of the people of the harem

525
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,060
for the end of the rule.

526
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,060
It's because of the emperor's grace.

527
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,060
Mr. Su is right.

528
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,060
The emperor's dissatisfaction

529
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,060
can be gradually restored.

530
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,060
But as long as we win this debate,

531
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,060
we will greatly respect the mother and mother

532
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,060
and suppress the eunuch.

533
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,060
More importantly,

534
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
we can force the court to a point

535
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,060
that we can gradually ignore.

536
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,060
What point?

537
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,060
Everyone has forgotten

538
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,060
that the eunuch is concubine.

539
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,060
Even if the crown prince is his legitimate son,

540
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,060
he is just a concubine.

541
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,060
If the emperor wants to abolish the crown prince

542
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,060
and change him,

543
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,060
everyone will not think he is a small monster.

544
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,060
He is a great enemy.

545
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,060
He can't be bothered by anything.

546
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,060
I was the one who

547
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,060
gave you the chance

548
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,060
to enjoy the beauty of the eunuch.

549
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,060
A while ago,

550
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,060
I saw a new eunuch

551
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,060
and sent him to the harem.

552
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,060
I didn't return to the harem in time.

553
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,060
I hope you won't be surprised.

554
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,060
You are welcome.

555
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,060
I am sorry.

556
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,060
After you came to the capital,

557
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,060
you have been in great pain.

558
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,060
But I have never seen you

559
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,060
have a grudge against me.

560
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,060
You are really a great eunuch.

561
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,060
I just saw a lot of blood on the sand.

562
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,060
Seeing these eunuchs fighting,

563
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,060
I was a little worried.

564
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,060
I don't want to think too much.

565
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,060
Wellâ¦

566
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,060
I don't know what you want me to do.

567
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,060
Over Wars

568
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,060
sing a much better song.

569
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,060
But,

570
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,060
it was all his fault.

571
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,060
In that case,

572
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,060
I'm afraid there are people who are not in the court.

573
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,060
I'm afraid there are people who are not in the court.

574
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,060
It seems that the Noble Consort Yue is in a state of concubineship.

575
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,060
Your anger hasn't been enough.

576
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,060
It's not like that.

577
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,060
Prince Yu and Crown Prince are fighting for the throne.

578
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,060
I heard that you also participated in it.

579
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,060
I asked them all at random.

580
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,060
I want to hear your opinion.

581
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,060
Which one do you prefer, the court or the court?

582
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,060
Empress Wu Zi.

583
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,060
Prince Yu is in the west.

584
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,060
Even though he hasn't been conferred as Crown Prince,

585
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:07,060
it seems that his identity is more precious than others.

586
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,060
It just seems that his identity is precious.

587
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,060
His Majesty doesn't have a legitimate son.

588
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,060
Whether it's Crown Prince Prince Yu or Prince Ning or Prince Jing,

589
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,060
we are all sons.

590
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,060
If we want to discuss the future,

591
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,060
no one can say who will be the first.

592
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,060
Prince Jing?

593
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,060
Since you want to fight with Noble Consort Yue again,

594
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,060
do you want to give me a chance to share your thoughts?

595
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,060
I want Mother to help me.

596
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,060
What can I do for you?

597
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,060
It seems that the court's argument won't be resolved.

598
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,060
Although Father's face is ugly,

599
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,060
he still agreed to Prince Yu in the end.

600
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,060
He will have to arrange it.

601
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,060
The argument is always right.

602
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,060
His Majesty has to agree to it.

603
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,060
I think that this Wu is a brother.

604
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,060
He must have prepared it.

605
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,060
Mother, what should we do?

606
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,060
The court's argument...

607
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,060
No one knows who will be the first.

608
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,060
Mother,

609
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,060
Old Wu is always an innocent person.

610
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,060
It's not easy to get rid of Li Jing Wen.

611
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:29,060
She's put in a lot of effort in this.

612
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,060
So what?

613
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,060
You are the crown prince of the Eastern Palace.

614
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,060
You have your own territory.

615
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,060
Prince Yu wants to fight with the emperor.

616
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,060
Prince Yu can ask for the famous Da Ru.

617
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,060
Can't we just invite him?

618
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,060
What you mean is...

619
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:52,060
As long as you don't use the wealth to steal the dowry from the Eastern Palace,

620
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,060
the Da Ru we invited might not be as hot as Prince Yu.

621
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,060
These are all the great scholars of the Degao King.

622
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,060
They are the guests I invited.

623
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,060
We must not be too late.

624
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,060
Yes.

625
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,060
It's cold.

626
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,060
It's all old people's fault.

627
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,060
We need to be careful.

628
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,060
We are careful.

629
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,060
We haven't cut off the charcoal.

630
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
Okay.

631
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,060
We must use the gold to burn the gold.

632
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,060
We can't use silver to burn it.

633
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,060
And we must be careful.

634
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,060
We must be careful with the food and clothing.

635
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,060
Yes.

636
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,060
Go and make arrangements.

637
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,060
Your Highness.

638
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,060
Your Highness.

639
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,060
He invited so many people.

640
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,060
Yes.

641
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,060
The Crown Prince has invited so many people.

642
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,060
He is raised in the Eastern Palace.

643
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,060
Not only is he so generous,

644
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,060
he goes to see the gifts every day and night.

645
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,060
Xiao Jingxuan is really a bloody man.

646
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,060
Yes.

647
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,060
The Eastern Palace invited these people.

648
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,060
They are not as weak as we are.

649
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,060
Although we are standing in the right place,

650
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,060
we will still be able to take the face of His Majesty.

651
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,060
When the two sides get together,

652
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,060
if His Majesty is a little bit more timid,

653
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,060
even if we don't lose,

654
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,060
it will be hard to turn into a mess.

655
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,060
It will be a disaster.

656
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,060
I have made the decision.

657
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,060
I have offended my father.

658
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,060
If I can't take the big deal,

659
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,060
I will be in trouble.

660
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,060
I didn't expect that

661
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,060
the Crown Prince can invite such a person.

662
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,060
I am sorry.

663
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,060
But the court will change tomorrow.

664
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,060
It's not like that.

665
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,060
I really have no bottom.

666
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,060
If Mr. Zhou can come,

667
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,060
what do you think?

668
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,060
Mr. Zhou?

669
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,060
Mr. Zhou Quanqing?

670
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,060
Impossible.

671
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,060
He has been in the court for many years.

672
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,060
He has been in the court for many years.

673
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,060
No matter if he is a royal or a palace relative,

674
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,060
who wants to see him in the East?

675
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,060
How can he be in the Eastern Courtyard and enter the imperial city?

676
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,060
I heard that

677
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,060
Mu Qing has already paid the price of the car.

678
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,060
Mr. Zhou will be in charge of the private sector.

679
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,060
Mu Qing?

680
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,060
It's not only you who is unhappy

681
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,060
about the position of the Noble Consort.

682
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,060
You are right.

683
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,060
The Princess is really unhappy.

684
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,060
So tomorrow's court's order

685
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,060
will be to invite Mr. Zhou.

686
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,060
Mr. Zhou is so famous.

687
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,060
If he is willing to stand in my room,

688
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,060
he will be in great danger.

689
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,060
But with his old identity,

690
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,060
how can Mu Qing be invited?

691
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,060
You are right.

692
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,060
Let him have a try.

693
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:50,060
It's not a bad thing.

694
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,060
Mu Qing?

695
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,060
Mr. Zhou said that his death issue

696
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,060
has long dwindling.

697
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,060
You are not seen asane.

698
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,060
Please giveï¿½ï¿½ing back.

699
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,060
I'm not a fool like you.

700
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,060
I don't have the right to do that.

701
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,220
You can't do anything.

702
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,260
Whether it's a bow or a gift,

703
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,380
Mr. Zhou won't even look at it.

704
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,060
I think he will.

705
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,860
This is Mr. Zhou's old friend's letter.

706
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,300
You must not know him.

707
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,700
But Mr. Zhou knows him.

708
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,380
Give this to him.

709
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,900
I'll be waiting for you.

710
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,100
Keep it.

711
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,220
Be careful.

712
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,180
Don't worry, Sister Wen.

713
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,820
I'll be there.

714
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,300
Starring...

715
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,140
Your son Ling Yubong?

716
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,340
He won't look at it to me.

717
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,820
Good.

718
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,220
Are you thinking too much

719
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:16,840
That...

720
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,420
QinGa is trying to get his mind resolved

825
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440

Bye.

829
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,440
Do you know that I used to play the horse

830
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,440
before?

831
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
But now I can only

832
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,440
play the dragon.

833
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,440
Jingyan, what's wrong?

834
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
I've already started to

835
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,440
participate in the game.

836
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,440
You want to join the crown prince

837
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,440
or the prince of the prince?

838
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
It's my own.

839
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
I want to get it

840
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
for the brother of the prince,

841
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,440
for the uncle,

842
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
for everyone.

843
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,440
I want to get the position of the emperor.

844
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:21,440
Then join my army.

845
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,440
It's decided.

846
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
It's decided.

847
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,440
It's hard to do that.

848
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,440
I know.

849
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,440
Don't you want to join the army?

850
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,440
But mother

851
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,440
Don't worry about me

852
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,440
Cheng Yihao

853
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,440
I will do it

854
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
As long as you and me are together

855
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
What's the use of it?

856
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,440
My lord

857
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,440
You said you wanted to bring the jade tea

858
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
The one who gave me the jade tea

859
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,440
He wants to wait outside the city

860
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,440
Yes, he said he would take you to the forest to the forest

861
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Mr. Zhou

862
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
Is this jade tea yours?

863
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
Yes

864
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Who gave it to you?

865
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,440
It's Mr. Li Chong

866
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,440
Please

867
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,440
Who is Li Chong?

868
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,440
I was taught by Mr. Li

869
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
At that time

870
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,440
Mr. Li was a great man

871
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
But he never lived in the ordinary

872
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,440
He was taught in the palace

873
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,440
The emperor was the most important

874
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
But he had no one to support him

875
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,440
I have seen it

876
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
But we have never met

877
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,440
But we have never met

878
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,440
But we have never met

879
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,440
Please

880
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,440
I will see you

881
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,440
Goodbye

882
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,440

883
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,440
