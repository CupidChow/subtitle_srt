00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 13

2
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,680
Shen Nan, it's me.

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,080
I don't know what you're doing.

4
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,320
You're going to fight with Prince Yu in your mouth.

5
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,200
How can you fight with him?

6
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,920
It seems like

7
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,960
it's a disaster again.

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,600
Don't worry.

9
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,240
Instantly find theid

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,000
and we'll figure it out.

11
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,160
Maybe we will make the same mistake.

12
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,200
I'm just afraid that the chance will be missed.

13
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,800
I've done no such thing

14
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
because I doubt if we should

15
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,840
call the Odent King.

16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,500
What are you talking about?

17
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,580
independently.

18
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,080
Sorry, my singinggon.

19
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,740
Earth that can beshaped withоже overal are like a

20
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,080
lamp from a person being tasted by someone

21
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,200
next time i find hans

22
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,860
Red and color

23
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,260
but he's old and rich.

24
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,260
I don't like him.

25
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,620
It's cold.

26
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,260
I'm a little bit sick.

27
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,540
Since you're sick,

28
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,540
then today...

29
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,540
I don't like him.

30
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,700
I really don't like him.

31
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,380
I'm not sick.

32
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,740
I know what you're up to today.

33
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,100
The Wuyin Hall has been opened

34
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,620
since the morning.

35
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,140
Commander Meng came to tell me.

36
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,140
Commander Meng came.

37
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,140
I heard I'm sick.

38
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,300
No.

39
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,300
He heard I was in the Wuyin Hall.

40
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,740
He came to see me.

41
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,740
Commander Meng knows it.

42
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,500
I'll go.

43
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,900
You've been so busy lately.

44
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,340
Don't worry about these trivial things.

45
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,740
What are you talking about?

46
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,180
I really can't do anything

47
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,380
when I have to deal with it.

48
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,060
I'll handle it for the later half.

49
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,060
I'm in his place now.

50
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,580
Being sick is my specialty in this country.

51
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,700
Please don't.

52
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,060
I bright me up.

53
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,980
Father sent a highly technical messenger.

54
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:03,940
It's illegal.

55
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,580
현 is Follow Qin вечor and nadzieję

56
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,500
resources for him to attack

57
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,340
to defend himself by the Dragon.

58
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,740
He's right.

59
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,460
If you believe me,

60
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,460
I'll be at ease for another two days.

61
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,460
There's a thunderbolt on the road.

62
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,460
It's about to blow up.

63
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,460
It's definitely going to blow up the top of the jade king.

64
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,460
A thunderbolt on the road?

65
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,460
Master, did you do something that didn't know?

66
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,460
The five talismans that were injured this time

67
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,460
were not in the Jiangzuo area.

68
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,460
I got the news that they weren't fast enough.

69
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,460
So this time, I didn't try to do anything for you.

70
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,460
This is my loss.

71
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,460
You're saying that because I'm sorry?

72
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,460
It's all my fault.

73
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,460
I couldn't resist the jade king in front of my father.

74
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,460
That's why I'm in this situation.

75
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,460
Your Highness, please make a move.

76
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,460
The first jade king in the capital of Aumei, Yu Le City, 949466.

77
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,460
The most exciting game on the line.

78
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,460
The horse is running. The horse is running.

79
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
The gold queen is awarded.

80
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,460
The gold king is looking for treasure.

81
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,460
The gold king is looking for treasure.

82
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,100
super price economically

83
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,460
more rewards

84
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,460
getting more and more opportunities

85
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:19,820
hurry up

86
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,940
but won't throw a fit at

87
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,720
the emperor feels that there would be no words without the jade king.

88
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,820
this is also the inevitable effect of won diagram.

89
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,500
ே

90
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,460
jade king is acutally unstoppable.

91
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,300
I don't want to learn.

92
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,300
You've worked hard.

93
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,300
His Majesty has been a favor to Prince Yu for a long time.

94
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,800
It's not that he can change anything.

95
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,300
I hope that you can be patient.

96
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,300
It's not that I'm not patient.

97
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,300
It's just that the situation in front of me is really unbearable.

98
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,300
I was too early.

99
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,300
I was too young.

100
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,300
Your Highness, please calm down.

101
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Although we lost the immortal skill,

102
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,300
we're still in good luck.

103
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,300
A few days ago, something happened.

104
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Maybe it could help us to change the situation.

105
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,300
Is that the thunder you were talking about?

106
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,300
Five days ago,

107
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,300
a man sent a message to Prince Yu through the Fuzhou.

108
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,300
He was taken to the Jians.

109
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,300
He was taken away.

110
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,300
It's just that he was taken away to the Prince Yu's escort.

111
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,300
I'm afraid he won't be able to get any help.

112
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,300
If His Highness knew who the person was,

113
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,300
he wouldn't say that.

114
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Who?

115
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
The Yuezhou Manor.

116
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,300
Yuezhou?

117
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,300
Yuezhou is the most serious one.

118
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,300
The rumor has been that he was starving to death.

119
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,300
Yuezhou Manor can still store the wealth to the Prince Yu's escort?

120
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,300
Now that the Crown Prince is weak,

121
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,300
the local officials of Prince Yu

122
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,300
are warning that this man is not letting go.

123
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,300
The gift he sent this time is not clear.

124
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,300
There are 5,000 silver coins left.

125
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,300
I'm in the wrong.

126
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,300
I can't have Prince Yu's help.

127
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
Since we have evidence,

128
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,300
what do you want to do?

129
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
I want to ask you to make the report.

130
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,300
You're sick again.

131
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
This time, I'm not sick.

132
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,300
It seems that this is the next plan.

133
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,300
The Crown Prince and Prince Yu have been in the state for so many years.

134
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,300
His Majesty may not know.

135
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
He's just trying to hide it.

136
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,300
Even if His Highness reports about the Yuezhou Manor,

137
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,300
His Majesty will still be in the state.

138
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,300
His Highness has reported about the Yuezhou Manor

139
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,300
to His Majesty.

140
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,300
He's just being so shameless.

141
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,300
He can't change anything.

142
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
But now, besides His Majesty,

143
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
who else can be more persistent?

144
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,300
Except for Huang Quan, Ming Xin, and Ming Yi.

145
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,300
I've already arranged it.

146
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
In less than two days,

147
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,300
this ugly thing will spread to the streets of Yuezhou.

148
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,300
Five thousand taels of silver is not much for the Emperor of the High Court.

149
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,300
But it's not that easy to accept the fact that it's not worth it.

150
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,300
That's right.

151
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
Once the Ming Qin's will is done,

152
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,300
it will definitely touch the most important court face of His Majesty.

153
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,300
At that time,

154
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,300
even if he's the one who's going to make Prince Yu,

155
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,300
he won't be able to keep an eye on him and prevent the whole army's security.

156
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,300
The Prince Yu and Prince Yu

157
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
are the most common methods

158
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,300
to make the Prince Yu

159
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,300
take the lead first.

160
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Then, he'll deduct another title from the title of the Crown Prince

161
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,300
to let the Emperor's grace and grace be his.

162
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,300
But this time,

163
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,300
the silver of the Prince Yu hasn't been paid yet.

164
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,300
I'd like to see

165
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,300
what else Prince Yu can find.

166
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
How dare you steal the money from the Prince Yu

167
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,300
and go to the Yuezhou Manor to collect the silver?

168
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
What silver are you collecting?

169
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,300
It's the silver that I've been given to you.

170
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,300
The Zhou's Manor is under arrest.

171
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,300
Even the officials are unwilling to obey.

172
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,300
The people are even more willing to go to the Fuya Manor to collect the silver.

173
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,300
The thousands of people have already reached the end of the world.

174
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,300
Now, not only in Yuezhou,

175
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,300
but also in the whole of the Zhou's world,

176
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,300
even the capital,

177
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,300
all the bandits and the concubines are all pointing to you.

178
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
You

179
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,300
are really making me look like a fool.

180
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,300
Father, I'm wronged.

181
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,300
I didn't know why the Yuezhou Manor was given to me.

182
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,300
He never gave it to me.

183
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,300
I don't understand.

184
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
According to the Prince's words,

185
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,300
when he was in the Feng年,

186
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,300
the Yuezhou Manor has never been given to the capital.

187
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,300
This year, almost every year,

188
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,300
the whole of Yuezhou is not well-known.

189
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,300
Why does the manor of the Manor

190
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,300
want to do this?

191
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,300
If that's the case,

192
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,300
he's very smart.

193
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,300
I don't know how he became the official of the Manor.

194
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,300
Wang Nian,

195
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
you should take some reasonable action.

196
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
If you don't go too far,

197
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,300
I won't take care of it.

198
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
But what kind of a plan is this year?

199
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,300
How can I not know how to train you?

200
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
Father,

201
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,300
there are so many princes in the capital.

202
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Why did they give these bandits' words

203
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,300
to me

204
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,300
when they were in the capital?

205
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,300
I'm really not convinced.

206
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,300
Your Majesty,

207
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
I'm afraid that the rumors

208
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,300
will be out of the question.

209
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,300
I've wronged you.

210
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
So,

211
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,300
send a urgent report to the Ministry of Revenue

212
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,300
and order the He Jian Xun Mansion

213
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,300
to immediately go to Yuezhou for a check-up.

214
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
This is a report from the Ministry of Revenue.

215
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,300
Please take a look.

216
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,300
This is the old-time Li Dan

217
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,300
and the letter from Qin'an,

218
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,300
the manor of Yuezhou.

219
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,300
Your Highness,

220
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,300
do you want to see the truth?

221
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,300
Father.

222
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,300
All right.

223
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,300
Stop talking.

224
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
I didn't know what you wanted.

225
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
Your Majesty.

226
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
This is the case.

227
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,300
The people's will is hard to get back.

228
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,300
If you continue to be a burden,

229
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
you will be punished.

230
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,300
You don't care about this matter.

231
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,300
Father,

232
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,300
I just want...

233
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,300
What else do you want?

234
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,300
This whole year,

235
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
it's all messed up.

236
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,300
I've never been so quiet.

237
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
It's been two months.

238
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,300
It's the end of the year.

239
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
I don't want to be a burden.

240
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,300
Just calm down for a few days.

241
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,300
Don't do anything that will ruin your reputation.

242
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
If that's the case,

243
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,300
I won't be so tolerant to you like this.

244
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,300
Yes.

245
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,300
I understand.

246
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,300
Go to the Prince of Jing.

247
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
Yes.

248
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,300
Prince of Jing.

249
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,300
Your Highness.

250
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,300
You're here.

251
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,300
It's good that you're here.

252
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
Give me a drink.

253
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,300
Your Majesty,

254
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,300
you've been quiet for a few days.

255
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
You're really quiet.

256
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,300
What's the use of being drunk in your own house every day?

257
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,300
I'm not drunk.

258
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,300
I'm not drunk.

259
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,300
I'm not drunk.

260
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
What's the use of being drunk in your own house?

261
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Prince of Jing has been in the town for half a month.

262
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
The whole thing is being delivered.

263
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,300
He's only busy with the horse-riding and the horse-riding.

264
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,300
Your Highness,

265
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,300
can you really hear it?

266
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
I can't hear it.

267
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,300
He's been with Shen for a day.

268
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
He's the new guy in the town.

269
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,300
Your Highness,

270
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,300
I'm sorry for all the complaints.

271
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
All the things down there

272
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
must be sealed.

273
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
Prince of Jing is being taken by the horse-riding.

274
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,300
I don't believe it.

275
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,300
Such a big fat man.

276
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Xiao Jingyan can only do it without a clue.

277
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,300
He can't do it without a clue?

278
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,300
Who knows?

279
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,300
Even if Xiao Jingyan is a real man,

280
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,300
he can still take all the talents of everyone.

281
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,300
By then,

282
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,300
he can kill a few people

283
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,300
and then withdraw a few people.

284
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,300
Can he manage the whole thing

285
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,300
in one go?

286
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,300
No matter how he does it,

287
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
no matter if he can get the long-term benefits,

288
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
he's already in control of the situation.

289
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,300
The situation is at this point.

290
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,300
Shouldn't you hurry up and think of a way to counterattack?

291
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,300
How to counterattack?

292
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Teach me how to counterattack?

293
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,300
Don't stay in the mansion for days.

294
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,300
I've carefully calculated

295
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,300
who can use the hand-killing.

296
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,300
Suddenly, I found that

297
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
no one in the court

298
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,300
would listen to me

299
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,300
if they found out about the six steps.

300
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Shen Zui didn't put me in the eyes

301
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,300
and acted like a coward

302
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
and even made a team with me.

303
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,300
The order was made.

304
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,300
That's a old fox who's been caught.

305
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,300
He's still watching the wind.

306
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
He doesn't say anything now.

307
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,300
What's the use of the rest of the Da Li people?

308
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
Under such circumstances,

309
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
I'll never counterattack.

310
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
To get the talent of Qilin

311
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
and to get the world,

312
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,300
Wolf Pavilion is really unparalleled.

313
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,300
Last autumn,

314
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
I saw the wolf just entered the capital.

315
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
What's your situation?

316
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
What's the situation of Prince Jing?

317
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
It's been more than a year.

318
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,300
Who got the talent of Qilin?

319
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Isn't it a long story?

320
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
Your Highness,

321
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,300
have you ever been suspicious?

322
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,300
When Prince Jingyan was the King of Jin,

323
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
I felt something was wrong.

324
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,300
But...

325
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,300
Meichang Su has made a lot of contributions.

326
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
He once made the medical report for me

327
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
about Xie Yu.

328
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,300
He took away my words.

329
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
Meichang Su made Xie Yu?

330
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,300
Is it really for you?

331
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Who did Xun Fang fall into?

332
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,300
Who did Xun Fang fall into?

333
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
Your Highness,

334
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
don't think about it.

335
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,300
I can confirm that Prince Jing has got Meichang Su.

336
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,300
By now,

337
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,300
do you still need me to get the evidence?

338
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
It's amazing that this Meizongzhu

339
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,300
is really amazing.

340
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,300
It's definitely worth choosing.

341
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,300
It's also a good choice.

342
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,300
Your Highness and Prince Jing were in the middle of the day.

343
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,300
But he was chosen to be released

344
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,300
for many years.

345
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,300
Without his help,

346
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,300
when will Xiao Jingyan

347
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,300
be able to make the right choice?

348
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,300
The situation in the palace has changed.

349
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,300
Noble Consort Yue is still alive.

350
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
Consort Jing is still alive.

351
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
She's been in the dark for so many years.

352
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,300
How can Her Highness put her in the eyes?

353
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
It's not like she's the one who's been in the dark.

354
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
It's just that she's the one who's in the dark.

355
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
Yes.

356
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,300
Consort Jing,

357
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,300
she was really a little girl before.

358
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,300
Her Highness the Empress is soft and firm.

359
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
But she's like a cotton bud.

360
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,300
She's not soft and firm.

361
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,300
She's not weak at all.

362
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
I underestimated this girl.

363
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,300
I thought she was just a sheep.

364
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,300
But she's a wolf.

365
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
Since you know that she's a wolf,

366
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
what are you going to do?

367
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Are you going to admit defeat?

368
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
Of course not.

369
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
Xiao Jingyan is a good girl.

370
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
She can do anything.

371
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
I can even defeat the Crown Prince.

372
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
I can't believe

373
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,300
He Chou is not a wretch.

374
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
After this disaster,

375
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,300
Prince Jing has a new palace.

376
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,300
I'm afraid His Majesty will go back to his home again.

377
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,300
At that time,

378
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,300
Prince Jing is completely different from you.

379
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,300
He's completely different.

380
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,300
Prince Jing is very brave.

381
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
He's very good at playing with the heart.

382
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,300
But Mei Changsu is too dangerous.

383
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
If he doesn't pack up

384
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,300
his gang and his gang first,

385
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
I'm afraid that

386
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
you won't be able to take Prince Jing.

387
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
It's not easy to deal with Mei Changsu

388
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
and his gang.

389
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
I'm afraid that

390
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
he's not good at playing with the heart.

391
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,300
I'm afraid that

392
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,300
your red sleeve move

393
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,300
will be severely damaged by them.

394
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,300
My red sleeve move has already been destroyed.

395
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,300
I've lost this game.

396
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
But I lost it doesn't matter.

397
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,300
Your Highness,

398
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,300
you can't destroy the pawn in this game.

399
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,300
Think about the long-term deceit and advantage.

400
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,300
Can you bear this evil spirit?

401
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,300
It seems that

402
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,300
you're here to act as a general.

403
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
Fine.

404
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,300
If you want me to focus on

405
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
dealing with Mei Changsu,

406
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,300
you can report him to your red sleeve move.

407
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,300
I understand.

408
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
Whether it's hatred

409
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,300
or not, I don't hate them more than you do.

410
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,300
But the court has already changed.

411
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,300
It's not just about Mei Changsu.

412
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,300
What you mean is...

413
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,300
If it's a year ahead,

414
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
as long as we get this pawn,

415
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Prince Jing will be in trouble.

416
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
But now I'm not the one

417
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,300
who's going to take the blame.

418
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,300
It seems that there's no answer.

419
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,300
The court's support is actually very stable.

420
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,300
It's not just a Mei Changsu.

421
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,300
Your Highness,

422
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
do you want to let Mei Changsu go?

423
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,300
Of course not.

424
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,300
But no matter how powerful Mei Changsu is,

425
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,300
he's always just a model.

426
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,300
Instead of dealing with Mei Changsu first,

427
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,300
it's better to take the initiative to deal with Prince Jing.

428
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,300
Without the main emperor,

429
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,300
and the pawns of the Seven-Spirit Palace,

430
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,300
we're all like wild dogs that are being raised by the media.

431
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,300
Then where are you going to start?

432
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,300
Where?

433
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,300
I don't know about Mei Changsu's weakness,

434
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,300
but Xiao Jingyuan's pain is clearly white.

435
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Over the past ten years,

436
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,300
he's been abandoned by the father and is now with the family.

437
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
Is he stupid?

438
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,300
Is he not a scoundrel?

439
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,300
Or did he make any mistakes?

440
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,300
Not all.

441
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,300
On the contrary,

442
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
he's a strong warrior.

443
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,300
He's not a hard-working man,

444
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,300
but he's not a scoundrel.

445
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,300
And the reason for that is

446
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,300
that he's not willing to let anyone get away with the old case

447
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,300
even if he's still in the heart of the Fu Zimen.

448
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,300
That's right.

449
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,300
Prince Jing's pain

450
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:30,300
is indeed the secret case of Prince Qi and the Seven-Spirit Palace.

451
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,300
And I'm getting more and more depressed.

452
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,300
Mei Changsu and Prince Qi are also related.

453
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,300
How can you be so stubborn?

454
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,300
I'm just a feeling right now.

455
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,300
But the more we're rivals, the more we can be on the same side.

456
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,300
I believe that Mei Changsu's strange behavior

457
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
will not be without end.

458
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,300
Now that Xiao Jingyuan is not in the capital,

459
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,300
I can have a good look at her.

460
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,300
Just let her go and make some hard money.

461
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,300
When she comes back,

462
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
she'll know I'm strong.

463
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,300
If you want to reopen the old case,

464
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,300
it's indeed a good starting point.

465
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,300
But you can't just do whatever you want.

466
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,300
You can't let Prince Jing find out.

467
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
You have to think about it all at once.

468
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
The better the blood is.

469
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,300
It's easy to say,

470
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,300
but you have to think about it carefully.

471
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,300
This old case is not just Prince Jing's pain.

472
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,300
It's also the father's chance.

473
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,300
I'm afraid I can't easily mention it.

474
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
If I can have another chance,

475
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,300
I'll be fine.

476
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,300
A chance?

477
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,300
If you can't see it,

478
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,300
I'm afraid you can't let Prince Jing have it.

479
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,300
But I'm afraid you can't let Prince Jing have it.

480
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,300
But I've thought about a great helper for you.

481
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,300
Who?

482
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,300
Xuan Jing Si, the chief of the capital, Xia Jiang.

483
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,300
The case is still in the air.

484
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,300
But as long as the letter of Xie Yu is still in Princess Liyang's hands,

485
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,300
I can't help but attack.

486
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,300
Princess Liyang is after all the chief of the capital.

487
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,300
You still have to be careful.

488
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
Yes.

489
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,300
Stop.

490
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,300
Hurry up.

491
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,300
Yes.

492
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,300
I'm afraid it's not working.

493
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,300
Why not?

494
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,300
Xuan Jing Si has a traditional system at the beginning of his establishment.

495
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,300
He never set up a party.

496
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,300
I've never heard of an exception.

497
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,300
Even if I fought with the crown prince that year,

498
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,300
it was so terrible.

499
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,300
I didn't have any.

500
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,300
Xuan Jing Si is not on the court.

501
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,300
It's the king's plan.

502
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,300
He's clearly in the political situation.

503
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,300
How can he be so good at it?

504
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,300
Many things can't be seen only on the surface.

505
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,300
Xuan Jing Si has been ungrateful for hundreds of years.

506
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,300
He's not a good man.

507
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,300
I'm afraid he can't do it without a party.

508
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,300
But he used to be...

509
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,300
He used to be...

510
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,300
He didn't fight with the crown prince.

511
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
It's not strange.

512
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,300
But it's different now.

513
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,300
Your opponent is the king.

514
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,300
You probably won't forget.

515
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:57,300
Who was the chief of the Chiyan case that year?

516
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,300
Although it was a life sentence,

517
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,300
the action that Xia Jiang did in this old case

518
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,300
was really very serious.

519
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,300
I'm afraid the king will not let him off easily.

520
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,300
Xia Jiang is not a fool.

521
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,300
He knows very well

522
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,300
the relationship between the king and the Chiyan.

523
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,300
That matter is clear.

524
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,300
It's a new chapter.

525
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,300
If you say it in a serious way,

526
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,300
it's a grudge.

527
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,300
Xia Jiang can be seen by anyone

528
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,300
who is in the position without a bet.

529
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,300
But he can't be the king.

530
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,300
Even if he's in the position,

531
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,300
he has to consider his future.

532
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,300
It's true.

533
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,300
Xia Jiang can tolerate anyone.

534
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,300
He doesn't care who can be the king

535
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,300
of the crown prince and me.

536
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,300
But he can't...

537
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,300
He can't be the king.

538
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,300
Your Highness,

539
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,300
do you want to think about

540
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,300
the power of Xuanjing Bureau

541
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,300
and think about the trust of the emperor and Xia Jiang?

542
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,300
Isn't he a great help

543
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,300
to deal with the king?

544
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,300
Even so,

545
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,300
but even if Xia Jiang has to deal with the king,

546
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,300
he may not be able to cooperate with me.

547
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,300
What if he only wants to be in touch with me?

548
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,300
If you want to test Xia Jiang,

549
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,300
do you have the will to cooperate?

550
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,300
You can be a little more gentle.

551
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,300
You?

552
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,300
The old man who was in charge of Xia Jiang

553
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,300
was the master of the family.

554
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,300
Aren't you a descendant of the Hua Clan?

555
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Your master is...

556
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,300
Have you ever heard of the name of the Xuanji Palace?

557
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,300
You...

558
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,300
You were the disciple of the Hua Clan's eldest princess, Qin Xuanji.

559
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,300
Your Highness, the royal secretary of the Inner Court, please come in.

560
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,300
Yes.

561
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,300
Your Highness, please come in.

562
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,300
Greetings, Your Highness.

563
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,300
Greetings.

564
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,300
Why did the royal secretary come here to take action in the cold weather?

565
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,300
What's the matter?

566
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,300
He just wants to send the children to do it.

567
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,300
What are you talking about?

568
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,300
What are you talking about?

569
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,300
How can the children do it in the palace?

570
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,300
They are all smart children from the royal secretary.

571
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
They can't do anything.

572
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,300
Your Highness, you're overreacting.

573
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,300
Your Highness, what is this new thing about?

574
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,300
It's just a tea flower that I just picked.

575
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,300
I've made a test paper.

576
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,300
It's not a new thing.

577
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,300
The newly-picked tea flower has to be picked by the mountain.

578
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,300
It's a new thing.

579
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,300
It's a new thing.

580
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:58,300
Only Your Highness can do this.

581
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,300
It's all just a simple thing.

582
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,300
The royal secretary is overreacting.

583
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,300
Hurry and bring the things for Your Highness.

584
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,300
Let Her Highness have a look.

585
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,300
The cold weather is getting worse.

586
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,300
The fresh fruits of the south are getting less.

587
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
I'm afraid it's going to be a disaster in a few days.

588
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,300
This is the fruit of the dry fruits of the capital.

589
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,300
I think Your Highness can make a lot of desserts.

590
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,300
You'll be able to make them in time.

591
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,300
I've picked some good products for you.

592
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,300
Please have a look.

593
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,300
The good things I've brought you last time

594
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,300
are not finished yet.

595
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,300
I just made desserts.

596
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,300
I just came to give you time.

597
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,300
How can I use so much?

598
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,300
The royal secretary should be able to do this.

599
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,300
Your Highness, you're so kind.

600
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,300
I can use it for a few days.

601
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,300
Please keep it.

602
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,300
Okay.

603
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,300
This one.

604
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,300
This one.

605
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,300
And this one.

606
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Forget about the rest.

607
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,300
Thank you for your kindness.

608
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,300
You're welcome.

609
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,300
Be careful. Take them away.

610
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,300
Yes, Your Highness.

611
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,300
Come with me.

612
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
Your Highness, I'm already old.

613
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,300
I'm not as stupid as I used to be.

614
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,300
I used to be in a place

615
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,300
where I often had to wait for my mistakes.

616
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,300
I'll tell the servants about the matter

617
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,300
in the future.

618
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,300
There will be trouble in the future

619
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,300
for the royal secretary.

620
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,300
I'll leave it to you.

621
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,300
You're welcome.

622
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,300
If you have no other orders,

623
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,300
I'll take my leave.

624
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,300
Your Highness,

625
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,300
isn't the needle from the interior

626
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,300
that you sent out not too good?

627
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,300
Why are you asking so much?

628
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,300
In the past,

629
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,300
you had to make a needle-picking

630
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,300
in the next few days.

631
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,300
I'll tell you more about the next few days.

632
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,300
You'll have more chances to repay me.

633
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,300
Join us soon.

634
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,300
The door is open to the public.

635
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,300
Come.

636
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,300
But the ones you sent out

637
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,300
are all the other things

638
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,300
you've chosen recently.

639
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,300
So I think

640
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,300
it's not good to make a needle-picking.

641
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,300
The taste of the new year has changed.

642
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,300
I'll make something else for her.

643
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,300
Here.

644
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,300
Drink the medicine.

645
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,300
Okay.

646
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,300
It's bitter.

647
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,300
How about you help Brother Su drink it?

648
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,300
Can I?

649
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,300
Sure.

650
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,300
Give it to me.

651
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,300
Don't listen to them.

652
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,300
I'll tell you later.

653
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,300
Don't listen to them.

654
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,300
You have to drink it yourself.

655
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,300
That's the best way to use it.

656
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,300
You're lying.

657
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,300
There's still a while before the medicine is ready.

658
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,300
Have a seat.

659
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,300
You'll have to sleep well later.

660
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
But don't sit too long.

661
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,300
I know.

662
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,300
Okay.

663
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,300
You're almost done?

664
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,300
You know that before Prince Jing came back,

665
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,300
you didn't have the snack.

666
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,300
I know. You said it before.

667
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,300
Prince Jing came here specially for the food.

668
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,300
It's all snacks and candies from the village.

669
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,300
But it's not enough for us to fly.

670
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,300
Chief, is there something wrong with the food box?

671
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,300
It seems that you have some worries

672
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,300
when you fly here every time.

673
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,300
When I was little,

674
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,300
Consort Jing often gave me snacks.

675
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,300
I ate whatever she made.

676
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,300
I liked everything.

677
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,300
But I couldn't eat anything.

678
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,300
That's the confectionery.

679
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Even if it's a little bit,

680
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,300
I can't tell.

681
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,300
I have red hair and I have to close the medicine.

682
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,300
I'll have it spit out.

683
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,300
This young master Lian specially made it.

684
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,300
So I've checked every time.

685
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,300
I've never let the confectionery go.

686
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,300
That's why I'm worried.

687
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,300
I'm afraid that

688
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,300
Consort Jing has noticed my identity.

689
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,300
But

690
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,300
it's not something that you often use.

691
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,300
If Consort Jing doesn't let it go,

692
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,300
there shouldn't be any strange things.

693
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,300
You don't know

694
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,300
that the confectionery is Prince Jing's favorite snack.

695
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,300
Consort Jing will make it almost every time.

696
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,300
Because of this,

697
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,300
I've found a chance

698
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,300
to pass the message to Prince Jing.

699
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,300
Well.

700
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,500
This marriage

701
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,300
kız two years later

702
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,300
you've chosen many motes.

703
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,300
Your highness.

704
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,300
Let you prepare the對不對 for Li enjoyment?

705
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,300
Give me the right one.

706
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
The two matter the same.

707
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,300
What's right or not?

708
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,300
Together?

709
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,220
That means,

710
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,780
Consort Jing is worried that

711
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,580
if you make a mistake,

712
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,780
both of you will be in the same position

713
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,820
and won't be able to put on a body.

714
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,940
Consort Jing has never even seen the princess.

715
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,180
How did she know

716
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,580
the true identity of the princess?

717
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,620
She must have found some clues

718
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,820
in the book in the box.

719
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,540
But,

720
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,820
the princess has been

721
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,700
not so good lately.

722
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,620
So now it seems

723
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,100
that Consort Jing should

724
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,460
keep this secret for me.

725
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,540
The sky is so dark.

726
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,460
The snow is not that big.

727
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,100
It seems that the flower of Prince Jing's house

728
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,140
is not bad either.

729
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,940
Who taught you this?

730
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,460
No.

731
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,820
I didn't see any other one

732
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:34,580
butKoushy.

733
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,780
I kinda miss him.

734
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,800
At that time,

735
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,780
when he visited Laozhou,

736
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,340
I was bewildered.

737
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,460
My Lady.

738
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,620
Your highness.

739
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,340
Is Kingavic's body some sort of

740
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,780
internal hatred?

741
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,460
The princess,

742
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,260
you few guys are dressed!

743
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,100
Ah...

744
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,700
ako

745
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,560
ellio

746
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,420
long

747
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,160
а

748
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,140
aint

749
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,040
are

750
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,760
the

751
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,220
font

752
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:27,000
home

753
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,880
why it's important to help

754
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,840
the person who tries to move.

755
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,320
Masterwhel,

756
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,320
It's not convenient for you to come.

757
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,320
The moon-time shop in Xi City has been open for half a year.

758
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,320
It's not a place to hide.

759
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,320
It's more convenient to go there if you have something to do.

760
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Yes.

761
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,320
There's nothing to do here.

762
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
You can go back.

763
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
I'll take my leave.

764
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,320
Anything else?

765
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
Sir.

766
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,320
The new woman I'm visiting is called Ju Niang.

767
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,320
Has she changed her name?

768
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
She's already passed on to Xian Zhou.

769
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
She's indeed as she said.

770
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
She's a kind-hearted woman.

771
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
She's a good person.

772
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
She's a good person.

773
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,320
She's a good person.

774
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,320
She's a good person.

775
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
That's good.

776
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
What's good?

777
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
I said she's not a suspicious person.

778
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
That's good.

779
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
She's not suspicious,

780
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
but she's a good person.

781
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
At least she has some good friends.

782
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Yes.

783
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Go.

784
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,320
Brother Su.

785
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,320
It's so cold.

786
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,320
Why are you here?

787
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
Yujin.

788
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
Marquis Yan is in the house.

789
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,320
I have something to discuss.

790
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
Yes.

791
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
Please come in.

792
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,320
Brother Su.

793
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
I...

794
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,320
What's wrong?

795
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
I'm sorry.

796
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
I'm sorry.

797
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
I just...

798
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
I suddenly remembered

799
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,320
when I first met Brother Su.

800
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
Although it's only been a year,

801
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,320
the time has changed.

802
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
People are not willing to look back.

803
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,320
Yes.

804
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,320
I wonder if Jingrui's in the south.

805
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
She and I have been talking about

806
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,320
the same thing for a long time.

807
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,320
She and I have been close for a long time.

808
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,320
Everything is fine.

809
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,320
Please don't worry.

810
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,320
Brother Su.

811
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
No matter what you discuss with my father today,

812
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
what my father will do,

813
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
I think

814
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,320
he has his own reason.

815
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,320
Please come in.

816
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,320
I'm sorry.

817
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,320
I'm sorry.

818
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,320
I'm sorry.

819
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,320
I'm sorry.

820
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,320
I'm sorry.
