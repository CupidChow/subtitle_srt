Episode 1

2
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The dinner is at Lingling Pavilion.

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Be careful when you serve the dishes.

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Have you set up the plates?

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes.

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay, go ahead.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why do you always come and go on a date?

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm tired of it.

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, I'll share half of your gift.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You're so polite.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Take all the gifts that you like.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's rare to see you dressed like this.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Look at your new clothes.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They're embroidered with a rose.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And they're made of gold threads.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Brother, don't say anything else.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're really a fool

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
to wear these clothes.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Enough.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
My mother is a flower girl.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But I don't know what you're talking about.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My lord.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Princess, Your Highness and Madam Zhuo, please go.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay, I see.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Remember, after you come back, share half of it.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can't forget it.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's go.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Young master,

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Mr. Yan and Miss Gong are here.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Today, you really took Miss Gong's place.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
How about this guy

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
come and pick me up anytime?

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm the only one who's going to look for him.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Miss Gong, the Fang family is here.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We have a meeting today.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Please come in.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Did you see me?

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You should come in.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We haven't said we have a meeting yet.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay, okay.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Young master Yan,

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I have a meeting today.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You two are really in a good mood.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's all my fault.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If we didn't have a meeting,

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
we would have beaten you 800 times.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Can you beat me?

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Please come inside.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't be mad.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What?

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll go find some coins.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Miss Gong, please.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
There are still some time.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Please come to the yard to see your mother first.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Although the rain is raining,

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
it's just a season.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I came to your mansion to help you.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You are so noble.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
How dare you come in?

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Although my mother is a bit cold-hearted,

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
she is not a kind person.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
She is a good person.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
She has a good reputation for you.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
She said that

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
you should go in first

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
when she comes.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let her see you first.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Even so,

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I will be your guest.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Please.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Your Highness,

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I have something to do.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Mei Changsu

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
should be going to the Marquis's Mansion.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's get ready

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
to go to the capital.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Commander Meng is here.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I am so happy to see you here.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I am so happy to see you here.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I am so happy to see you here.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You are welcome.

85
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,000
Thank you for the??

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ah,

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
it must be my title.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Prime Minister Meng

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
In the game.

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The fourth one was Ma Jianghu.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,100
Second,

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
scope theaja Huang,

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Badminton,

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
top of the listå‘¢.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
to earn the advantage of the rewards,

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You can overwhelming chances as many times as you wish.

97
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,400
Join the forces immediately,

98
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,960
Babauka Yule City 994466, come.

99
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,240
Father.

100
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
I don't know.

101
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
Jingrui, you didn't tell me.

102
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
This...

103
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
You are really joking.

104
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,240
I came in as a report to the princess.

105
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
I was walking in the courtyard.

106
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,240
Don't tell me you think I'm not like a female guest?

107
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Mr. Xia Dong is really funny.

108
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Mr. Su Zhe, Mr. Su is here.

109
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Mr. Su is here.

110
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Mr. Su, Mr. Su is here.

111
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
Mr. Su, Mr. Su is here.

112
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Mr. Su, Mr. Su is here.

113
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Mr. Su, Mr. Su is here.

114
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Mr. Su is here.

115
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,240
The leader of the alliance.

116
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Yu Jin.

117
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Yu Jin, what are you looking at?

118
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
I'm looking at what gifts Mr. Su gave Jingrui.

119
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
Hurry up and sit down.

120
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
What if he makes us wait?

121
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
Let's go.

122
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Yu Jin, Xie Bi, hurry up.

123
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,240
Let's go.

124
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Okay.

125
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,240
What is this?

126
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
What good things did you find?

127
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Give it back to me.

128
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Jingrui is so pitiful.

129
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Give it to me.

130
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
What good things did you find?

131
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
It's not Xie Bi who took it.

132
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
It's you who took it.

133
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
I'm telling you.

134
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,240
The little one that Miss Dong gave you

135
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
is so petty.

136
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
Yu Jin, you're talking nonsense again.

137
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
Miss Dong is really generous.

138
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
We're close to the door.

139
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
It's not as expensive as the Red Gate.

140
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
I'm afraid the whole set of the goods you gave me

141
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
will cost me a month.

142
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,240
Mr. Su, what is this?

143
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,240
It smells like a drug.

144
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,240
I can leave the house in a hurry.

145
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:56,700
We've set up ten

146
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,220
You like me the most, right?

147
00:07:59,220 --> 00:07:59,720
Right?

148
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
What are you doing?

149
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,220
Isn't your birthday in July not here yet?

150
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,720
What July?

151
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
It's July, July, July, winter.

152
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
July and July are not far away.

153
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
They are far away.

154
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
Enough, Yu Ji.

155
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Stop making trouble.

156
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,220
Jing Rui is a half-baked man.

157
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,720
She's always walking around.

158
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
You're always with her in the capital.

159
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,720
This Hu Jin Dan is really useless to you.

160
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Exactly.

161
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
It's useless.

162
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
Jing Rui.

163
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Jing Rui.

164
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
Father.

165
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Let the guests stand up.

166
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
Let's have a seat.

167
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Yes.

168
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
Come on.

169
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Please.

170
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
Brother Su.

171
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Yu Ji.

172
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
Sit.

173
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
I'm here to see you.

174
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,720
I'm sorry to have you all here.

175
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
I don't deserve to be your guest.

176
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
I've been drinking a cup of wine to show respect.

177
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
I'll drink it first.

178
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Please.

179
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Since it's a private banquet,

180
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
I'm sorry you're all here.

181
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,720
I've never been able to treat my guests well.

182
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Please take your time.

183
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
You can be your own guest.

184
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Please.

185
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Commander.

186
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
I'll drink it first.

187
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
I'll drink it first.

188
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
Thank you, my lord.

189
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
Please.

190
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
My lord said

191
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,720
we should treat it as our own home.

192
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Is that true?

193
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Of course.

194
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,720
What do you mean?

195
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
I just want to say

196
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
I've always been a good person

197
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
in my own home.

198
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,720
But there's something wrong with it.

199
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,720
I'm sure you won't blame me.

200
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,720
You're so handsome.

201
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
What's the good thing about being a good person?

202
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Good.

203
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
I'm a master of the Jiuyang Sect.

204
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
I'm a great martial artist.

205
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,720
I'm lucky to have you today.

206
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Please forgive me.

207
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,720
I'm sorry.

208
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
Good.

209
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
You're really great.

210
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
Please sit down.

211
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Please.

212
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
Great.

213
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
You're really great.

214
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Although you two have only been in the Jiuyang Sect

215
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,720
you have a wonderful appearance.

216
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Your internal power and your swordsmanship

217
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,720
are all very important.

218
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,720
I've opened my eyes today.

219
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,720
You're really a great martial artist.

220
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
You're so filial.

221
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
Where?

222
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,720
You're the one who's been in the Jiuyang Sect.

223
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
I'll be sorry

224
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,720
if I have to take a few more steps.

225
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
You're a great martial artist.

226
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
You're really great.

227
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Come on.

228
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Let's toast to you two.

229
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,720
I'm so glad to have you here today.

230
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,720
I'd like to offer a toast to you.

231
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
Please.

232
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Please.

233
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
Mr. Xia Dong is really a good person.

234
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
I'm glad to hear that you're here.

235
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
Mr. Xia Dong is really a good person.

236
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,720
Please have a toast to Mr. Xia Dong.

237
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,720
I hope you can be here anytime.

238
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
Jing Wei.

239
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Are they in the Jiuyang Sect?

240
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,720
Should we help them?

241
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
I don't want to go.

242
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,720
If they drink too much,

243
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,720
you're the first one to get hurt.

244
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Everyone.

245
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,720
The banquet is not over.

246
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Miss Gong Yu is here.

247
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
Why don't you invite her to play a song

248
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
and let me be the one to be punished?

249
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,720
Great.

250
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Great.

251
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,720
You're too kind.

252
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Although you're not talented,

253
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
I'm willing to help you.

254
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Mr. Xia Dong.

255
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
Mr. Xia Dong.

256
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Please.

257
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Please.

258
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Please give me a chance.

259
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
Are you the one who was

260
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
investigated by His Majesty by this case?

261
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
The Jiuyang Sect must have been prepared.

262
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,720
There's not much chance.

263
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Please.

264
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
Please give me a chance.

265
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Please.

266
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
Please.

267
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
Please.

268
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Please.

269
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
Master.

270
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Go and call the door.

271
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Miss Gong's Fengqiu King.

272
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,720
It's a long story.

273
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,720
It's so touching.

274
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
It's so touching.

275
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Miss Gong Yu is really talented.

276
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
But today is a happy day.

277
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
Please play a song

278
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
that's a little bit faster.

279
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Yes.

280
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
My Lord.

281
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
My Lord.

282
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
My Lord.

283
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
My Lord.

284
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
My Lord.

285
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
My Lord.

286
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
My Lord.

287
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
There's a guest outside.

288
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
What guest?

289
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
The imperial decree is in place.

290
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
Didn't I tell you

291
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
that you're going to close the door?

292
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
I can't stop them.

293
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
They're coming in.

294
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
You've been saved long ago.

295
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Brother Zhuo.

296
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Why are you so stubborn?

297
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Is it because you're staying in the Duke's Mansion

298
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
to avoid my challenge?

299
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
Lord Yue.

300
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
Do you know

301
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
that the place you're staying is my private residence?

302
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
You're so impulsive

303
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
and rude.

304
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,720
Who am I?

305
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Don't you know

306
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
the imperial decree

307
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
in the south?

308
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
I'm wronged.

309
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Lord Yue has resigned

310
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
in half a month.

311
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,720
He's only a white doctor now.

312
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
He's so busy.

313
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
If you're dissatisfied with him,

314
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
you can just leave him alone.

315
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
But don't just

316
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,720
come to the imperial court in the south.

317
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
My Lord.

318
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
You're from the imperial court, aren't you?

319
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
You're also here with me.

320
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Don't you know how to be polite?

321
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
I'm not here.

322
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
I know it clearly.

323
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
We're not together.

324
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,720
I heard that you're the subject of the Young Prince.

325
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
You're a familiar person.

326
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,720
So I came to help you.

327
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,720
I'll ask for a favor from Lord Xie.

328
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
I'm not welcome to your residence

329
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,720
without any help.

330
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
Please leave as soon as possible.

331
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Otherwise,

332
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
I'm not being polite.

333
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
You're trying to be polite.

334
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
You're the rules of the world.

335
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,720
I even resigned from the imperial decree.

336
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,720
If you're to give me a push,

337
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
at least you can say something soft.

338
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,720
If you're to be so kind as to protect others,

339
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,720
it's not what I know.

340
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
I'm not the one who's going to say anything soft.

341
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
I'm the one who knows you.

342
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Since you and Lord Xie became relatives,

343
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,720
you're no longer a member of the martial arts world.

344
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Zhuoding Feng is here to protect you.

345
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,720
So he's hiding his sword in the right-hand corner.

346
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,720
But he's going to fight with Yuexiu.

347
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,720
The battle between the masters is only a matter of time.

348
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
It's hard for him to hide his sword.

349
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Zhuoding, please.

350
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Xie Yu's mistake seems to have caused a lot of trouble.

351
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Yuexiu is just not being polite.

352
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,720
But the rules of the world are not wrong.

353
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,720
It's not dangerous to make mistakes.

354
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
But if you don't fight,

355
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,720
you'll really damage the reputation of the Heavenly Sword.

356
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,720
What is Lord Xie doing today?

357
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,720
Why is he not allowing others to compete?

358
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
Yuexiu,

359
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
is it my birthday today?

360
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Will you be in the hospital tomorrow?

361
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
No.

362
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Why?

363
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,720
My Majesty has only been in the court for six months.

364
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
Within six months,

365
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,720
he can fight freely outside.

366
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
What about tomorrow?

367
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,720
You won't be in such a hurry, will you?

368
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,720
It's a long night.

369
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,720
Who knows what will happen tonight?

370
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Who knows if there's still tomorrow?

371
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,720
When we meet,

372
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
we can't stop.

373
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,720
It's not a big deal.

374
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,720
Is it possible that you'll be in trouble?

375
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,720
Then you mean

376
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,720
you'll be in the hospital at this moment?

377
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
Yes.

378
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
Let go of me.

379
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Today, I'm going to have a feast.

380
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
I'm going to be in the hospital.

381
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
You're not to be bothered.

382
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
Thank you, My Lord.

383
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,720
The battle of the Heavenly Power and Evil Cloud

384
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
is not something you can see.

385
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
I don't mind.

386
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,720
You can also watch it.

387
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Lord Xie, what do you think?

388
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,720
I'm looking forward to this.

389
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Of course, you won't mind.

390
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Today, there's a female guard at the battlefield.

391
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,720
I'm afraid that the weapon won't work.

392
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Come on.

393
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Yes.

394
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
Brother Luo,

395
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
are you here to challenge or to make trouble?

396
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
You know it best.

397
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
Are you going to fight?

398
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Please give me a answer.

399
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
Lord Hong.

400
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Yes.

401
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Brother Luo,

402
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
what do you think of me?

403
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Stop.

404
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,720
Brother Xie, I'm a martial artist.

405
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,720
Brother Yue and I are in the Wolf'sç‰™.

406
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,720
I can't give up his challenge.

407
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
But today...

408
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,720
Don't worry.

409
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,720
I will do my best.

410
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Okay.

411
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Brother Luo,

412
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,720
you must be careful.

413
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Qingyao.

414
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Father.

415
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Take my sword.

416
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
Yes.

417
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,720
I will do my best.

418
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,720
I will do my best.

419
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
I will do my best.

420
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,720
I will do my best.

421
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,720
I will do my best.

422
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,720
I will do my best.

423
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,720
I will do my best.

424
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,720
I will do my best.

425
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,720
I will do my best.

426
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,720
I will do my best.

427
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,720
I will do my best.

428
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,720
I will do my best.

429
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
Stop.

430
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Go.

431
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,720
I will do my best.

432
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
Father.

433
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
Brother Hao,

434
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,720
why are you here?

435
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,720
It's not about Brother Yue.

436
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
I just had a last move.

437
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
I was a bit careless.

438
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
What's wrong with the wound?

439
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
What's wrong with the wound?

440
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Come here.

441
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Go and ask the doctor.

442
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
No need to ask the doctor.

443
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
It's just a skin injury.

444
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Qingyao,

445
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
take some herbs and make it better.

446
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
Okay.

447
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,720
Have you checked the patient?

448
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
He had a concussion.

449
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,720
Now he has a pulse.

450
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
He is killed by a murder

451
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,720
and is in the Marquis's manor.

452
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,720
He is still dead.

453
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Brother Luo,

454
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
I lost this battle.

455
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,720
I lost this battle because of my evil spirit.

456
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,720
I will try to win the battle.

457
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
I told Brother Yue

458
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,720
to call me anytime.

459
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,720
So he is in the manor tonight.

460
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,720
I am sorry for your misdeeds.

461
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
Brother Luo,

462
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,720
I know the rules of the martial arts world.

463
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,720
You are injured now.

464
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
Go to rest.

465
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Father.

466
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Please wait.

467
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Prince Ling,

468
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
what do you want to do?

469
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Prince Ling,

470
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
the soldiers have arrived.

471
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Is there anything else?

472
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
Not yet.

473
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,720
When did Yuwen Xuan enter the Marquis Manor?

474
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,720
About half an hour ago.

475
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,720
It's not that fast.

476
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Wait a minute.

477
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Yes.

478
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Sorry for disturbing you.

479
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Uncle Yue,

480
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
I have asked you to challenge

481
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
the battle in advance.

482
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,720
Now it's my turn.

483
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
My father just got injured.

484
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
Do you want to take the throne?

485
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
You want to go out?

486
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
Go to me.

487
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Don't misunderstand.

488
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
I am not saying that the injury is not a competition.

489
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,720
It's just that I can beat the King of the martial arts world.

490
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
I mean,

491
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,720
the next move,

492
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,720
you should stay and see.

493
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,720
It's so ridiculous.

494
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
Brother Luo,

495
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
don't bother him.

496
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
Go to rest.

497
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
Jingrui,

498
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,720
take a nurse's pill first.

499
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Yuji,

500
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
here.

501
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
You are in a state of rest.

502
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
You are in a state of pain.

503
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
You are not in a state of rest.

504
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,720
You are still in a state of difficulty.

505
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,720
You are in a state of pain.

506
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,720
You are still in a state of crisis.

507
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,720
I hope you can take care of yourself.

508
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
Yini,

509
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
you came here for them, right?

510
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Go ahead.

511
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
Don't be afraid.

512
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,720
I am here.

513
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
Brother,

514
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
I am Niannian.

515
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
My brother misses you a lot.

516
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,720
Come with me to Nan Chu.

517
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
Okay?

518
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,720
Brother,

519
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
you really are my brother.

520
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
I am your sister.

521
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
I am your sister.

522
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
I am your sister.

523
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
I am your sister.

524
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
I am your sister.

525
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
I am your sister.

526
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
You are really my brother.

527
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Look at me.

528
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
Look at my face.

529
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Don't say that.

530
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
They look alike.

531
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
Princess.

532
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
Princess.

533
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
Princess.

534
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,720
Princess.

535
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
Go.

536
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
Go back for a while.

537
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Right.

538
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
Okay.

539
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
I was the daughter of the late Princess Yuwen Nian,

540
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
the daughter of the late Princess Yuwen Nian,

541
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,720
my uncle.

542
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
More than twenty years ago,

543
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
when I was in the Imperial Gui State,

544
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
I was in the state of the eldest princess.

545
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,720
When I heard that the eldest princess was pregnant,

546
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
I was dying to leave.

547
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,720
I couldn't bear the danger of the late Empress Dowager.

548
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
These years,

549
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
I couldn't forget the eldest princess

550
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
at all times.

551
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,720
I couldn't forget her and you.

552
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
This child.

553
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
Nian Nian,

554
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
you are a concubine.

555
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Go and greet the eldest princess.

556
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Nian Nian,

557
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
greet the eldest princess.

558
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Thank you for taking care of father.

559
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
Father,

560
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
the eldest princess,

561
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
you have a son.

562
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Can you give him back to me?

563
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
Let me take him back to Nan Chu.

564
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
Mother,

565
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,720
what they said is true.

566
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,720
Xiao Jingrui is the son of the late Princess Yuwen Nian.

567
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
The eldest princess

568
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,720
is going to hide it forever.

569
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
Mother,

570
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,720
what they said is true.

571
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Sister,

572
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,720
what they said is true.

573
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,720
The eldest princess is going to hide it forever.

574
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
I will get back to you.

575
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
I will get back to you.

576
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
I will get back to you.

577
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
Brother Jingrui.

578
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
Brother Jingrui.

579
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Brother Jingrui.

580
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Brother Jingrui.

581
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Brother Jingrui.

582
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
Brother Jingrui.

583
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,720
Brother Jingrui.

584
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
Don't be afraid.

585
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
Brother Jingrui.

586
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
Can you not talk?

587
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Jingrui.

588
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Brother Jingrui.

589
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
Miss Gong.

590
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
What's wrong with you?

591
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,720
It turns out

592
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
that the life of our family

593
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
was actually like this.

594
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,720
What did you say?

595
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
Thank you, my lord.

596
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
Your Highness.

597
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
There is still no movement.

598
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
Did they not come out

599
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
after Yuexiu and the others entered?

600
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
No.

601
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
They are about to be assigned to the appointed time.

602
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
No matter what happens,

603
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
they will leave at any time.

604
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
They are hiding in the alley

605
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,720
outside the Marquis's mansion.

606
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
They are not allowed to act without my order.

607
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
Yes.

608
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
I will go to the Marquis's mansion

609
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
and ask him to come with me.

610
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
I will go to the Marquis's mansion

611
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
and ask him to come with me.

612
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,720
I will go to the Marquis's mansion

613
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
and ask him to come with me.

614
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
I always thought that

615
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
why you must kill my father.

616
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
I finally knew that

617
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
it was because of my late father's negligence

618
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
that I was ordered to kill

619
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
the illegitimate son of Madame Ling.

620
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
I didn't expect

621
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
that I would kill the children of the Zhuo family.

622
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
She didn't complete your plan.

623
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,720
What did you say?

624
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Let's fight this game now.

625
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
Good player.

626
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
I'll kill you.

627
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
Let him finish it.

628
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,720
Who killed my child?

629
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Madam.

630
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Calm down.

631
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,720
Brother Xie, let Miss Gong finish it.

632
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,720
If she blames me, I can't spare her.

633
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,720
The dead baby was not hurt.

634
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,720
I'm sure you're right.

635
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,720
If you want to know more details,

636
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,720
you can ask your Highness.

637
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,720
Your Highness knew that you were going to kill your child,

638
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,720
but you couldn't question her.

639
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,720
She was so stubborn and stubborn.

640
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Luckily,

641
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,720
someone knew that the demon was with her.

642
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,720
What a nonsense!

643
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,720
Come on!

644
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
Qingyang!

645
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
Qingge!

646
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,720
The Wei Ying Army is here to kill the demon.

647
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,720
Kill the demon!

648
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Yes, sir!

649
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Father!

650
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
Brother Xie, what are you doing?

651
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
The demon is in danger.

652
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
The law is in action.

653
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,720
Brother Luo, if you protect her,

654
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
I have to take care of her.

655
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Brother Xie,

656
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
you know my intention.

657
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,720
I want her to tell the truth.

658
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,720
And I don't want to destroy her.

659
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,720
You're doing this because you're so stubborn?

660
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Brother Luo,

661
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,720
don't force me.

662
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
Mother!

663
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
Is Lord Xie not here

664
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
as the leader of the Alliance?

665
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,720
Yes.

666
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,720
Lord Xia,

667
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,720
you have to think for him.

668
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,720
Of course, he knows that he's not clear about killing people

669
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
in front of the Wei Ying Army.

670
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,720
But he has to do this.

671
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
Why?

672
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
Since it's night,

673
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
Xie Zhuo and his family are destined to be together.

674
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,720
If we don't do it now,

675
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,720
I'm afraid Lord Xie will have no chance

676
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
to kill people again.

677
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Lord Xie,

678
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,720
are you going to kill this woman

679
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
or me?

680
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,720
The imperial court has arranged

681
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,720
to kill the demon immediately.

682
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
The demon woman is in my house

683
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,720
and is confused with the people of Qin Yue.

684
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,720
Brother Luo,

685
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,720
this is my manor.

686
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
I have the responsibility to kill her.

687
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,720
Commander Meng,

688
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,720
Lord Xia Dong,

689
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,720
please don't mind the situation

690
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,720
of both of you tonight.

691
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,720
Finally, there's a movement.

692
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,720
I think it's already over.

693
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,720
How could the enemy of the assassin

694
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,720
not be over?

695
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Even if the wind of Zhuo Ding Feng is strong and wide,

696
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
and he still has the temper,

697
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,720
the enemy will be the new one in the middle.

698
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
I'm afraid Xie Yu will never believe him again.

699
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,720
Lord Xie,

700
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
you can say what you want.

701
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
You must see blood today.

702
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,720
Since both Lord Xia and I are here,

703
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,720
I will never let you down.

704
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,720
Lord Xie, please don't mind the situation.

705
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,720
Commander Meng,

706
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
Lord Xia Dong,

707
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
I will never hurt you.

708
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
This is a very dangerous situation.

709
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
I will not let you down.

710
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
The situation will be in the future.

711
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
You have your words.

712
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,720
I have my own way.

713
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,720
At that time, let's see who His Majesty will believe.

714
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,720
The party of the demon girl and her sister,

715
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,720
I'm afraid you won't be able to save her tonight.

716
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
He's not lying.

717
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
The army of the Yi-Ping army

718
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
has eight soldiers in the army.

719
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,720
It's hard to deal with them.

720
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
If we wait until the strong slave

721
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
gets all the weapons,

722
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
I will be the most confident.

723
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
If we wait until the strong slave gets all the weapons,

724
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,720
I'm afraid it will be hard to deal with them.

725
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
Li Yang,

726
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,720
the next thing is that you don't interfere.

727
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Don't worry.

728
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,720
I won't hurt Jing Rui.

729
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
If I want to hurt her,

730
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,720
I will kill her long ago.

731
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
I just hope you understand.

732
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,720
Everything I did

733
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,720
is for you.

734
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Prince Ling.

735
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
Thank you, my lord.

736
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,720
I was just worried about her brother.

737
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,720
If you don't move,

738
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
I won't let him get away with it.

739
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,720
I won't let him get away with it.

740
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,720
I won't let him get away with it.

741
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
What's the point

742
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
of dealing with them?

743
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,720
Fine.

744
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
Prince Ling,

745
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
I accept your request.

746
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,720
You finally think of Su Mou.

747
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,720
Looks like tonight,

748
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,720
you want to push Su Mou

749
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,720
into the Ghost Gate?

750
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
By the way,

751
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
where's Fei Liu?

752
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,720
Fei Liu?

753
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,720
Finally, someone has come up with Fei Liu.

754
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,720
My lord,

755
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
I'm still waiting for you to ask me.

756
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,720
When I was entering the gate,

757
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,720
did you notice that I had a guard

758
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,720
around me?

759
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,720
My lord, my lord, something's wrong.

760
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
All the credit for the strong slave army

761
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
were cut off by someone.

762
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,720
What?

763
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,720
You're useless.

764
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Fei Liu,

765
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,720
is it fun?

766
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,720
Yes.

767
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,720
Su Zhe,

768
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
you think you're not a strong slave anymore?

769
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Can't I keep my people?

770
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
As for the clothes and the monkey's clothes,

771
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,720
you're too weak to be a talented man.

772
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,720
Maybe.

773
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720
But everything in the world has a cause.

774
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,720
No matter how you fight,

775
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,720
everything that happened tonight

776
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,720
is all up to you.

777
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
You can only think

778
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
of the fruits in the end.

779
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,720
I'm a person who doesn't believe in the heavens.

780
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,720
I've seen the great waves.

781
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,720
Do you think you can

782
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,720
help me tonight?

783
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
I know.

784
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,720
You're a person who doesn't believe in the heavens

785
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,720
and doesn't want to be a man.

786
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,720
What are you afraid of?

787
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,720
I'm not as afraid as you are.

788
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,720
Since you came to the manor today,

789
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,720
you're prepared for it.

790
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,720
I think the guards of Prince Yu

791
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,720
are already outside the door.

792
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,720
I'm afraid that

793
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
they might come out of the door.

794
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,720
Prince Yu's guards are already outside the door.

795
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,720
If they can't wait for me to go out,

796
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,720
they might mess up the inside of the manor.

797
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,720
I'm afraid that they might not bear to

798
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,720
come in and save me.

799
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,720
I believe that

800
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,720
for a small matter like yours,

801
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,720
Prince Yu will be the one

802
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,720
to serve my manor.

803
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,720
For a small matter like mine,

804
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,720
of course it's not worth it.

805
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,720
But if you can take the monkey

806
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,720
off the court,

807
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
will Prince Yu be able to do it?

808
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,720
Guards.

809
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,720
Yes.

810
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,720
Look outside.

811
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,720
Is what he said true?

812
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,720
And...

813
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,720
Yes.

814
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,720
I'm afraid that

815
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,720
Prince Yu will be the one to serve my manor.

816
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,720
I'm afraid that

817
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,720
he might come out of the door.

818
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,720
I'm afraid that

819
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
he might not bear to come out of the door.

820
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,720
I'm afraid that

821
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,720
he might not bear to come out of the door.

822
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,720
I'm afraid that

823
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,720
he might not bear to come out of the door.

824
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,720
I'm afraid that

825
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,720
he might come out of the door.

826
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,720
I'm afraid that

827
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,720
he might come out of the door.

828
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,720
I'm afraid that

829
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
he might come out of the door.

830
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,720
I'm afraid that

831
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,720
he might come out of the door.

832
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,720
I'm afraid that

833
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,720
he might come out of the door.

834
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,720
I'm afraid that

835
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,720
he might come out of the door.

836
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,720
I'm afraid that

837
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,720
he might come out of the door.

838
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,720
I'm afraid that

839
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,720
he might come out of the door.

840
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,720
I'm afraid that

841
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,720
he might come out of the door.

842
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,720
I'm afraid that

I'm afraid that

847
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,720
he might come out of the door.

848
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,720
I'm afraid that

849
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,720
he might come out of the door.

850
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,720
I'm afraid that

851
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,720

852
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,720
