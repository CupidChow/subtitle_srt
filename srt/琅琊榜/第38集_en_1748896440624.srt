00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 14

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Tell me.

3
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,000
Where is Wei Zheng?

4
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,000
He has gone to the capital.

5
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Impossible.

6
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,400
I went to the palace five days ago,

7
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,800
and I was ordered to guard the four doors to check the past.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,800
I couldn't let him out even if I put him in the water.

9
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,400
Then, Prince of Jing was taken away by the power of the Jie.

10
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
The capital is more like a iron plate.

11
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Wei Zheng can't go out unless he has the power to stop him.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,400
That's a big deal.

13
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,400
Even if it's a iron plate,

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,400
it's still possible to get out.

15
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,600
As long as someone can get out of the capital,

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,200
Wei Zheng will have a chance to escape.

17
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,400
I know how serious Wei Zheng's injury is.

18
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,000
He can't stand up and walk.

19
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
And these days,

20
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,800
he has never been out.

21
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,200
The carriage and the carriage.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,600
He can't pretend to be a man.

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,600
I even ordered them to come to the theater to check.

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Tell me.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,400
How did Wei Zheng get out?

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you really want to know?

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Of course.

28
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,400
Your men did check the emergency room.

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
But they still have to get out.

30
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
Absolutely not.

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,600
For example,

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,200
Xuan Jing Si's own man.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,600
I'll go to the prison.

34
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,600
Yes.

35
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,800
Who's going out?

36
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Master Kun Bin.

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,200
I just received a letter from my father.

38
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going back to visit him.

39
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,800
But Xuan Jing Si's matter is more important.

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,000
I can't go back.

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
I just need to prepare some things.

42
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,400
I don't want to be in trouble.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I should.

44
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Get ready.

45
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Yes.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,200
Master Kun Bin.

47
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,000
You're really good at

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
putting the daughter-in-law of Wei Zheng

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
into Xia Chun's shoes.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,400
I don't believe you.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,400
Xia Chun's wife was from Wudang Sect.

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,400
When she left the capital yesterday,

53
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,600
she was accompanied by a man named Li Xiaoyao.

54
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,000
He's a江湖人.

55
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,800
He was once honored by Jiang Zuo Meng.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,600
He asked her to bring a picture of the capital

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,400
to Langzhou.

58
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,800
She wouldn't even think about it.

59
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,600
Moreover,

60
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,600
everyone thought

61
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,800
Xuan Jing Si was the same as before.

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,400
He never fought.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How could he be so arrogant?

64
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,600
Master Zou Zun would stand by Prince Yu's side

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,400
and be my partner.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,800
Someone!

67
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,600
Someone!

68
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,200
Yes.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,400
Master Zou Zun, what can I do for you?

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mr. Xia,

71
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
don't worry.

72
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,000
Wei Zheng has been out for a whole day.

73
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,800
Where are you going to find the Wang Mang River?

74
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,400
Is it still dead?

75
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,600
Xiao Yu Jin.

76
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,600
Your Highness.

77
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
What's the matter?

78
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
I haven't seen you in a day.

81
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
You miss me again.

82
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,200
Come on.

83
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:23,600
Lunar Morning either you attend the Spring Festival or the Festival Dancing Festival!

84
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Are you listening or watching me?

85
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Your Highness.

86
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
It's so mysterious.

87
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Can I talk to the left and right?

88
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
It seems that something really happened.

89
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Wait a moment.

90
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Yes.

91
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Sit.

92
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Go.

93
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Go.

94
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
I think His Highness knows that

95
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,600
the Prince of Jing has been

96
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,600
suddenly taken to the Imperial House by His Majesty.

97
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
You care about this?

98
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
Is your Yan Mansion...

99
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
It has nothing to do with Yan Mansion.

100
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
It's just that the Prince of Jing has been taken to the Imperial House

101
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
to make me feel uneasy.

102
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,600
It's a reason for the Prince of Jing.

103
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
There's no clear explanation in the palace.

104
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
The court has said that it's a different story.

105
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
At the end of the day,

106
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
it's still because Xuan Jing Si

107
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
lost a criminal.

108
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
It's true.

109
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Xuan Jing Si caught a criminal who was not even convicted.

110
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
He was also taken away by a group of criminals.

111
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,600
The Prince of Jing said that

112
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,600
His Majesty must be furious.

113
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,600
He ordered the Prince of Jing to be in the Imperial House

114
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,600
to wait for the investigation results of the Prince of Jing.

115
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
After Xuan Jing Si lost his criminal,

116
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,600
he was in the Imperial House and was drawing pictures.

117
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,600
He was also investigated and sent to the capital.

118
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,600
I went through that place today.

119
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
I didn't expect...

120
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
I didn't expect what?

121
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Please look at me.

122
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Please look at me.

123
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
This person...

124
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
This...

125
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Do you think this person is that person?

126
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
I think it's him.

127
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
He's very accurate.

128
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
The criminal who was taken away by the Prince of Jing

129
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
was him.

130
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
This... this is strange.

131
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
If it was the Prince of Jing that Xuan Jing Si

132
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
took him away,

133
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
then...

134
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,600
Then how could this be possible with Xia Dong?

135
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
It's okay.

136
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
You can leave.

137
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Yes.

138
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Mr. Xia.

139
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Have you ever thought about it?

140
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
I knew you wanted to catch me.

141
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
But I didn't run away.

142
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
I didn't hide.

143
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Do you know why?

144
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,600
You think I can't get you?

145
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Of course you can't get me.

146
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
And I'm not afraid of you.

147
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,600
You're so weak and weak.

148
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I can't stop you.

149
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
If you're so weak,

150
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
you can beat me to death.

151
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,600
But if I die in your Xuan Jing Si,

152
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600
no matter what the Emperor thinks,

153
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,600
I won't let you go.

154
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Plus, I have several people in the martial arts world.

155
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Besides my brother,

156
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
there are many friends.

157
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Although you have a high rank,

158
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
but the martial artists are everywhere.

159
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
If they fight for their lives,

160
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
they won't play with me.

161
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Mr. Xia.

162
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Are you really willing to be chased by the whole martial arts world

163
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
for my life?

164
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,600
I can only tell you the good things about me.

165
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
You can know more things you want to know.

166
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
And there's something you must know.

167
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,600
I can't keep my body in Xuan Jing Si's hands.

168
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,600
I'll do anything you ask me.

169
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
But what I said

170
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,600
is really useful to you.

171
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
You can't control me.

172
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
You dare not tell me anything

173
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
but the Emperor's instructions.

174
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Because you're afraid.

175
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
You're afraid I'll say something

176
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,600
that's against you in front of the Emperor.

177
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Su Che.

178
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
I'm not good at making trouble.

179
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
You're now in my hands.

180
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
I'll do whatever I want to do with you.

181
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
You must remember this clearly.

182
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Mr. Xia.

183
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Of course I know.

184
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Just tell me whatever you want.

185
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,600
I don't want anything else.

186
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,600
I just want you to tell me the truth.

187
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,600
I just want you to tell me the truth.

188
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Mr. Xia.

189
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,600
I just said that everything is true.

190
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
I really colluded with Prince Jin

191
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
to save Wei Zheng.

192
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
I also sent people to beat you up.

193
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Everything is true.

194
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Mei Chang Su.

195
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,600
You know what I mean.

196
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Why did you choose Prince Jin?

197
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Why did you choose Prince Jin?

198
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Compared with Prince Yu and the Crown Prince

199
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,600
Prince Jin is the best.

200
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Prince Jin is the best?

201
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Isn't that so?

202
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,600
You didn't choose anyone.

203
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
You're the first to be a leader in the world.

204
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
You're the best.

205
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,600
You can control the world by your own means.

206
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,600
But why did you come to the capital?

207
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Why?

208
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
My lord.

209
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Why don't we go together?

210
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Why do you bother about things?

211
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,600
His Majesty is suspicious.

212
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
I'm not good to you.

213
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,600
But my lord.

214
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
It's not just about the palace.

215
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
It's about the truth.

216
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
His Majesty still believes me.

217
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
He doesn't believe me.

218
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
He doesn't believe me.

219
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
I don't care about the future.

220
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
My lord.

221
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
It's all my fault.

222
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
If it weren't for that day,

223
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
I would have taken you to visit Miss Gong Yu.

224
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,600
It has nothing to do with you.

225
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,600
I'll tell the emperor in a hurry.

226
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
I'll be quick.

227
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
My lord.

228
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Okay.

229
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Go back.

230
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
I don't know.

231
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Xuanjing is the world.

232
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
How did you get to the capital?

233
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Don't you know?

234
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
The talents of Qilin

235
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,600
are known to the world.

236
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,600
I thought you were forced to chase the prince

237
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
and the prince.

238
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
You can't get into the capital.

239
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
But after this battle,

240
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
I'm sure

241
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,600
it's a terrible thing.

242
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,600
With your knowledge,

243
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,600
if you don't want to be cornered

244
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
by the emperor,

245
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
who can force you to do so?

246
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Your majesty, you're right.

247
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,600
I'm grateful for your help.

248
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,600
What do you want in the capital?

249
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,600
It's the wealth of the Wei State.

250
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,600
It's the power to force the world.

251
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,600
It's the reputation of the whole world.

252
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Can I take all the three points you said?

253
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,600
You're alive.

254
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
You're doing this for something else.

255
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,600
You're doing this for something more real.

256
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Only the prince can help you achieve it.

257
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Right?

258
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Your majesty.

259
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,600
The emperor has entered the palace.

260
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Go and inform the commander.

261
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,600
Yes.

262
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Will the next person

263
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,600
think this is related to the Wei State?

264
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
Of course it is.

265
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
It's easy to see

266
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
that the best strategy

267
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
is to ignore the rules.

268
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
The most ridiculous and unreasonable way

269
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
is to make the people

270
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,600
suffer from the injustice.

271
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Why do you choose the worst method?

272
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Because I can't stop the prince.

273
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Since I can't stop him,

274
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,600
I can only help him.

275
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Once I succeed,

276
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
the prince will trust me.

277
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,600
I will be different

278
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
in the position of the prince.

279
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Is that all?

280
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Of course there's another reason.

281
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
What is it?

282
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Because I believe.

283
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,600
I believe that even if I choose the next strategy,

284
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
I can beat you.

285
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Do you think you won?

286
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Did I lose?

287
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
Don't forget that you still have the money in my hand.

288
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,600
That's because I'm willing to do it.

289
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
I just want to see how long

290
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
you can keep my hand.

291
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,600
I also want to see how you can deal with me.

292
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Looks like

293
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
you really have nothing to fear.

294
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Mei Changsu.

295
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Are you afraid of death?

296
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Afraid?

297
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Why do you still live if you're not afraid of death?

298
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Right.

299
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,600
You're dead and nothing else.

300
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Life is the most important thing.

301
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Do you know what this is?

302
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Is it medicine?

303
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
It's so cold.

304
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
It's snowing.

305
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,600
It's a year-end vacation.

306
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,600
It's good that you have a warm place.

307
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Why do you come here?

308
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Brother Huang, you're really a good brother.

309
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,600
It's not enough to say that I'm lazy.

310
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,600
You know how lazy I am.

311
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
You're quite sensible.

312
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
You can leave now.

313
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Yes.

314
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,600
What brings you here today?

315
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Tell me.

316
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
I know one thing.

317
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
If I don't report it to Brother Huang,

318
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,600
I'll feel uneasy.

319
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,600
What? Who else dares to make you feel uneasy?

320
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,600
No, no. No one dares to make me feel uneasy.

321
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
It was the first day of the dance.

322
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,600
I didn't feel anything.

323
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,600
But the news came out in a hurry.

324
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I felt a little uneasy.

325
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
The first day of the dance?

326
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
What happened?

327
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Tell me.

328
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Tell me clearly.

329
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Mr. Su is so crazy.

330
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
This is indeed not a medicine.

331
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
It's poison.

332
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
You want to poison me?

333
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
This is not your fault.

334
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
This medicine is called the Wu Jin pill.

335
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
It will be used in seven days.

336
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,600
If it's in seven days, it won't die.

337
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
I understand.

338
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
If His Majesty is looking at me,

339
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
I'll make you happy.

340
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
You'll give me the antidote.

341
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Otherwise, there's only one way to die.

342
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Right?

343
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Very correct.

344
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Why should I believe you?

345
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,600
What if you don't admit it?

346
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Because you only believe me

347
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
because you're in my hands.

348
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Another way to say it.

349
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
Why should you believe me?

350
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,600
To get the antidote, I'll admit you.

351
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
If I've reached the end of my life

352
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,600
for the sake of the King of Jin,

353
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,600
because you're not here to

354
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
be the center of the King of Jin,

355
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,600
you're here to think of your real purpose.

356
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Although I don't know what it is,

357
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I'll know one day.

358
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Lord Xia,

359
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
can you believe that

360
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,600
you can't turn around in front of His Majesty

361
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,600
just because of your speculation?

362
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Of course not.

363
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
I'll have the full preparation.

364
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
It's good that you're in a hurry.

365
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
You can't disobey the high-ranking.

366
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
When you arrive in the jade,

367
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,600
if you dare to speak in your own way,

368
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,600
and you can't wait until you finish it,

369
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,600
people will be like him.

370
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
You dare to kill people in front of His Majesty?

371
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Even if I'm free,

372
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
I'll have a distance between you.

373
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
I won't touch you.

374
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
How can I say I killed him?

375
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Lord Xia,

376
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
you're bullying me to not know martial arts.

377
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
With your power,

378
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
you can't kill me

379
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Of course not.

380
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Don't forget.

381
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,600
You've already captured Wu Jin Wan.

382
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,600
As long as I use the easiest method

383
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
to point out your natural blood,

384
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Wu Jin's poison will be released immediately.

385
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,600
You can't even say a word.

386
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Everything will end.

387
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
But he'll definitely investigate

388
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
if he kills people in front of His Majesty.

389
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
If you come out,

390
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
you won't be hurt.

391
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
At the end of the conclusion,

392
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,600
you're a self-defeated murderer.

393
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Don't you suspect that you'll kill me?

394
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
If I want to kill you,

395
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
I have time and opportunity to kill you.

396
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Why do I have to take you into the palace

397
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,600
to kill His Majesty?

398
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
What's the point of that?

399
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,600
It seems I'm not allowed to die.

400
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I can't die.

401
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Just think about it.

402
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,600
What should I say?

403
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Xia Dong?

404
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
You really saw it clearly.

405
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,600
He didn't have a face or a look.

406
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,600
I'm sure I'll recognize him.

407
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,600
How can a criminal who was taken away from the Dali Temple

408
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,600
fall into Xia Dong's hands?

409
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,600
And the transfer in the box?

410
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Xuan Jing Si?

411
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
What is he doing?

412
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,600
I don't understand.

413
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
But you said that you have to tell me

414
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
what happened to him.

415
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
To be more careful,

416
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
you should ask Xia Dong

417
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,600
for Xuan Jing Si's personal information.

418
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Maybe he can explain it clearly.

419
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
Gao Zhan.

420
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Yes.

421
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Send someone to the Dali Temple.

422
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Yes.

423
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Yes.

424
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Cui Yun.

425
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Bring Meng Zhi to my home.

426
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Mr. Su, you've considered the box.

427
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Have you thought it through?

428
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Sheng Xian often chooses the wrong question.

429
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,600
What's more, it's me.

430
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Sheng Xian never chose to die.

431
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,600
They only advise others to die.

432
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,600
When this Wujing pill is in your stomach,

433
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,600
you'll know that life is always the most important thing.

434
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Mr. Xia, I'm in your hands now.

435
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
It seems that you have to take this pill.

436
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Wait.

437
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,600
I'll do it myself.

438
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
Let's think it through.

439
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,600
Mr. Su.

440
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,600
What's the use of you taking this pill?

441
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
This is a new place.

442
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,600
I can't let you go.

443
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
You can't go.

444
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,600
What's the use of you taking this pill?

445
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,600
You can't go.

446
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,600
I'm not going.

447
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,600
I'm going to take it.

448
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
I'm going to take it.

449
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
I'm going to take it.

450
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
I'm going to take it.

451
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
I'm going to take it.

452
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,600
What's the use of it?

453
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,600
This is Xuanjing Temple.

454
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Who else will come to save you?

455
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
That's not certain.

456
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
What if someone comes to save me?

457
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,600
I can just let me have a little more time to massage.

458
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
After I take this pill,

459
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
I'll become your spy.

460
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
You tell me what to say, I'll say what to say.

461
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,600
It feels so uncomfortable.

462
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Mr. Su, you can understand this.

463
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
You're still a smart person.

464
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
I've said before,

465
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Xuanjing Temple has no criminal against it.

466
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Either you listen to me,

467
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
or you die,

468
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,600
there's no way out.

469
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,600
It seems that I'm still the first to be a spy.

470
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
I should have known that I ran away.

471
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Mei Changsu,

472
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,600
since you've decided to make a decision to go down the side,

473
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,600
to help Prince Jing to get the title of the Wei State,

474
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,600
you've decided that every step is a trap.

475
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,600
You will never have a good life.

476
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Mr. Xia,

477
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,600
can I ask you another question?

478
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

479
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Rise.

480
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

481
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,600
I wonder what Your Majesty's order is.

482
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Meng Zhi,

483
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,600
you personally go to Xuanjing Temple.

484
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Bring Xia Dong here to see me.

485
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Xia Dong?

486
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
Remember,

487
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
if you want to go to the temple soon,

488
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
you must hide.

489
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Don't be a coward.

490
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
After you see Xia Dong,

491
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
don't let him contact anyone.

492
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Especially Xia Jiang.

493
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

494
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,600
You just asked me

495
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,600
why I didn't stay in Jiangzuo for a long time.

496
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,600
I was going to the capital to get a job.

497
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,600
Now I want to ask you,

498
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
the position of the imperial guard in Xuanjing Temple

499
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,600
is always unseemly.

500
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
The emperor's trust in you

501
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,600
is not limited to ordinary people.

502
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
But I'm afraid that

503
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
you will be in danger.

504
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Your Majesty,

505
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,600
why do you want to take the enemy's soul?

506
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,600
To arrest the criminal is the responsibility of Xuanjing Temple.

507
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,600
It's also the center of your loyalty.

508
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Then you just have to lock Wei Zheng in the prison

509
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
and wait for the year to pass.

510
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,600
You can just take him out of the court.

511
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Why do you take so much effort?

512
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
You have such a big situation.

513
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,600
You are trying to get rid of it.

514
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,600
You want to show the true face

515
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,600
of the traitor's disciple.

516
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,600
You didn't say the truth.

517
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
But it's okay.

518
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,600
I just want to ask you casually.

519
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Actually, I understand everything.

520
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
What do you understand?

521
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,600
I know why you must know the king and the emperor.

522
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Tell me.

523
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Because you are afraid of him.

524
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,600
Who are you afraid of?

525
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
The king?

526
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,600
Why do you have such a ridiculous conclusion?

527
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Why do I have to be afraid of the king?

528
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
You are afraid of the king

529
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,600
just like you were afraid of the king.

530
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
More than ten years ago,

531
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,600
the king of Qi was in the court

532
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,600
and planned to withdraw Xuanjing Temple.

533
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Is that true?

534
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Father,

535
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
the real Ming army

536
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,600
doesn't need a structure like Xuanjing Temple.

537
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,600
The court should be in agreement.

538
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Father,

539
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
I think

540
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Xuanjing Temple will be like the Grand Court.

541
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,600
It should be in agreement.

542
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Stop it.

543
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
What is this?

544
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
Who taught you this?

545
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
Nonsense.

546
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Don't mention this idea again.

547
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Although the emperor has taken back this suggestion,

548
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
you know it very well.

549
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Even if this plan is over,

550
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,600
it will happen when the emperor is in the court.

551
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
But after the emperor is dead,

552
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,600
your threat will be removed.

553
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
After all these years,

554
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Prince Jing is still a great emperor.

555
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
He is a great emperor.

556
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Xuanjing Temple is even more unkind.

557
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Maybe at that time,

558
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Prince Jing withdrew Xuanjing Temple

559
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,600
and considered how to settle you.

560
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,600
But for Prince Jing,

561
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,600
he has already expanded your division.

562
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Prince Jing is willing to hate Xuanjing Temple.

563
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,600
He won't hate me that much.

564
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Then you should ask yourself what you did.

565
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
To protect Xuanjing Temple,

566
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,600
you should protect the power of the hand.

567
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,600
If you don't want to kill the dead,

568
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,600
you should let Qi Wan and Chen Yuanjun die in the beauty.

569
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
If you do this,

570
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
will you never know what will happen?

571
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,600
You...

572
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
I understand.

573
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,600
You are not here to assist Prince Jing.

574
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,600
You are here to defend Xiao Jing.

575
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Uncle,

576
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
who are you?

577
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Are you the savior of the Prince of Qi's Mansion?

578
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,600
I am just a person who cares about Prince Qi.

579
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Until now,

580
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,600
the whole world is still caring about him.

581
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
You should know that

582
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
you are not the one who cares about him.

583
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,600
What kind of talent is this?

584
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
What kind of a person is Jiang Zuo Meilang?

585
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,600
I will see how long you can be able to be a hero.

586
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Mr. Xia,

587
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,600
do you still have any intention to force me to take medicine?

588
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
I have already said this.

589
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
How dare you let me see His Majesty?

590
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
You can go see His Majesty.

591
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,600
But you don't have the chance to talk.

592
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,600
I just want you to die now.

593
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,600
But you won't die in Xuanjing Temple.

594
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Until now,

595
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
you still remember where I died.

596
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
That's right.

597
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
You are too good.

598
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
You are too good to let me remember.

599
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
You are too good to let me tell His Majesty

600
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
whatever you say.

601
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Because I am afraid that I will not be able to see the real situation.

602
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
You are too good.

603
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,600
But what's the use of leaving here?

604
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
I still have that saying.

605
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,600
You will die and everything will be gone.

606
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,600
I admit that I can't move you now.

607
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,600
But I can take your life.

608
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,600
When I finish you,

609
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,600
I will go to deal with Prince Jing.

610
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Who?

611
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,600
What are you doing here?

612
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,600
The master left the palace that day.

613
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
He locked me in the room.

614
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,600
I couldn't get out of there.

615
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Fortunately, the two brothers still have the same feelings for me.

616
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
I can't let them go.

617
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,600
I can't let them go.

618
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
I can't let them go.

619
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,600
I can't let them go.

620
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
I can't let them go.

621
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
I can't let them go.

622
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,600
Fortunately, the two brothers still have the same feelings for me.

623
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
I don't care about them.

624
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
I have been in the prison for many years.

625
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,600
If I don't even have the ability to get out of here,

626
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,600
what else can I do?

627
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
When did you come here?

628
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,600
When master wasn't so excited, I came here.

629
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
I always thought that

630
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,600
the order to take revenge on the two generations of Xuanjing

631
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,600
was the Central Military Army, the Palace Government,

632
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,600
and the imperial court to remove the order.

633
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
You always taught us this.

634
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,600
But today, what you did,

635
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,600
I can't understand.

636
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
You can leave now.

637
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
I will go now.

638
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Even if he is a criminal,

639
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
when did you start?

640
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Xuanjing can take poison and kill the criminal's mouth.

641
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
The two generations of Xuanjing are all Five-star Pond.

642
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,600
It's not your master's own creation.

643
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,600
You don't know, it's just because he hasn't sent it to you.

644
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,600
It's very important to deal with a very common person.

645
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
You still don't understand.

646
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
Don't ask more.

647
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
I can't ask many things.

648
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,600
But I have to ask you about today.

649
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,600
The case of the King of Qi

650
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,600
was related to me.

651
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
I just want to know

652
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,600
what kind of character you played in the middle.

653
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
Let go.

654
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Do you have any idea?

655
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,600
You have made me disappointed.

656
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Is it because of the fact that the King of Mei Changsu is so confused?

657
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,600
The King of Qi is trying to get you.

658
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Have you forgotten?

659
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Your husband died in the hands of Lin Xie because of this.

660
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
Master.

661
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,600
I beg you for the last time.

662
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Give the antidote to him.

663
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Go back.

664
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,600
The heaven is so cruel.

665
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,600
If you still don't know the misunderstanding,

666
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,600
you can go back to the palace.

667
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
If you still don't know the misunderstanding,

668
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,600
even if you kill ten Mei Changsu,

669
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,600
you will be fine.

670
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Master.

671
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Master, please check the map.

672
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Don't say it.

673
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,600
Take Xia Dong back to his own room.

674
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,600
Take care of the family.

675
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Yes.

676
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Wait.

677
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Master.

678
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,600
I don't understand what happened these days.

679
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Dong, what did he do wrong?

680
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Why did you punish him so?

681
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,600
I don't need to explain to you.

682
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
From now on,

683
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,600
I will not let him see me.

684
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Master.

685
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Yes, master.

686
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
Don't say it.

687
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Master just wants to teach me something new.

688
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
But I don't know how to learn.

689
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
I don't want to learn.

690
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
So I am angry.

691
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,600
Master taught me something new.

692
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Did I already learn it?

693
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Let's go.

694
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
Master.

695
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Greetings, Commander Meng.

696
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Please wait.

697
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
I...

698
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
Commander Meng,

699
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,600
why did you come to Xuanjing Temple?

700
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Of course.

701
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
I am here to see you.

702
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,600
I want to see you in the palace.

703
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
I have no choice.

704
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Commander,

705
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,600
what is the matter with the imperial edict?

706
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
It has nothing to do with you.

707
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
Commander Xia Dong,

708
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
please.

709
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Come.

710
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
Junior.

711
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
Lord Xia Chun.

712
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Do you want to resist?

713
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
I don't dare.

714
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,600
I will tell the master.

715
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
I will tell him.

716
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Your Majesty,

717
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,600
Xia Dong is here.

718
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

719
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Xia Dong.

720
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
It's the first day of the year.

721
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
Xuanjing Temple was abandoned by the rebels.

722
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Where did you go?

723
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,600
I went to the city

724
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,600
to clean up the house for the Prince.

725
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
When did you come back?

726
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
It's late.

727
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
Nonsense.

728
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
It was the afternoon of the first day of the year.

729
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Someone saw it in person.

730
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
You were...

731
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
What was your name?

732
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Deng Jia Xiang.

733
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Yes.

734
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Yes.

735
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
What did you do in Deng Jia Xiang?

736
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,600
I didn't go to Deng Jia Xiang.

737
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Someone must have seen it wrong.

738
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Xia Dong,

739
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
I saw you.

740
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,600
You brought a few people with you.

741
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,600
Although there was no official official in Xuanjing Temple,

742
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,600
they were all listening to your order.

743
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
I saw it clearly.

744
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
Can I lie?

745
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
The Prince said

746
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,600
he saw you taking a person

747
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,600
who looked like Wei Zheng away.

748
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,600
What explanation do you have for this?

749
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
Xia Dong.

750
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
Xia Dong.

751
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
In front of me,

752
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,600
you are so stubborn.

753
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,600
Are you still my master?

754
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
In your eyes, except your master,

755
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,600
do you still have me?

756
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,600
I dare not.

757
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,600
I believe the Prince will not blame you.

758
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,600
Tell me.

759
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,600
What did you do in Deng Jia Xiang?

760
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,600
Xia Dong.

761
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
His Majesty is in a critical condition.

762
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,600
Prince Ji is with you.

763
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
It's not fair.

764
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Tell me what you have to say.

765
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,600
I indeed went to Deng Jia Xiang.

766
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,600
The person who was taken away

767
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,600
was Wei Zheng?

768
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Yes.
