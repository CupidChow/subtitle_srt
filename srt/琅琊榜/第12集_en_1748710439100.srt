00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,100
Episode 36

2
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,780
During the Trinity,

3
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,320
him, as his realf hat isn't Kyawari,

4
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,780
becameboard himself over Taizu outside Gong force.

5
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,560
But he's got the virtue and the life of his country.

6
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,320
I've been there.

7
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,320
But we seem to never meet each other.

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,320
I was not surprised by your kindness.

9
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,320
I've been taught for ten days.

10
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Of course you don't recognize me.

11
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
Fine.

12
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Fortunately, I have a letter from Li.

13
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,320
I'm here. I'm Li Dangbangbang.

14
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,320
But I've seen you for ten years.

15
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,320
It's true that you're from the court.

16
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,320
You were in the capital and were taken away.

17
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,320
You were so full of your anger that you didn't turn back.

18
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,320
I wonder if you really agree with me.

19
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,320
I was so impulsive back then.

20
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,320
But I don't know how to speak.

21
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,320
This is how I learned from you.

22
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,320
I was thought that everything is true.

23
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
But it's not.

24
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,320
It's not because of the forest.

25
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,320
It's because of the temple.

26
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,320
As long as it's pure, it's not a theory of thought.

27
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
It's not a matter of the past.

28
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Why do you think it's true?

29
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,320
I wonder if you know the meaning of Li's legacy.

30
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,320
It's a story of the dead.

31
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
It's a long story.

32
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,320
It's a story of the truth.

33
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320
It's a story of the past.

34
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,320
It's a story of the past.

35
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,320
I didn't expect that I would see Li's great master again.

36
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Yu'an is enough.

37
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Bring the body of the body here.

38
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
It's such a rare opportunity.

39
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,320
You're not good at it.

40
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,320
You're going to be a monk in the future.

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,320
I'm very grateful.

42
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,320
Seeing this, I can walk the capital city.

43
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,320
I'll let you do whatever you want.

44
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,320
All right.

45
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,320
I've done my best.

46
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,320
I should go back to the temple to rest.

47
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
I'll take my leave.

48
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
Take care, Mr. Zhou.

49
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,320
I'll see you in the temple.

50
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,320
Childishcore again.

51
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Delicious.

52
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Chinese TV劇心

53
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:32,360
Chinese

54
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,720
A talent like me is too far back.

55
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,280
What a pity.

56
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,580
Now this person won't see us again.

57
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,640
So this didn't happen?

58
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,460
Hurry!

59
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,460
Hurry!

60
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,520
Something is still there!

61
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,520
Quickly jaunty!

62
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Song Chun, are you okay?

63
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,840
He's here.

64
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,400
I don't know why.

65
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Ni Huang has been working hard lately.

66
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,080
He's been chasing after me.

67
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,080
He's been trying to get me out of here.

68
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,120
I'm afraid I can't keep it.

69
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,600
If Ni Huang has been in this mess,

70
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
I'm afraid it will be inappropriate.

71
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Ni Huang has a son.

72
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,520
He's different from others.

73
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
If he can't keep it,

74
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,040
let me persuade him.

75
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,920
Chief.

76
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
It's not right to be a rich man.

77
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
We've been working hard lately.

78
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
If we can't keep it,

79
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
we will have to go back to the same place.

80
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
You're not afraid of me?

81
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm afraid that I will keep it.

82
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
I'm afraid that I will keep it.

83
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Do you think it's a deal?

84
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
I don't think so.

85
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
I'm afraid it will be inappropriate.

86
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
I'm afraid it will be inappropriate.

87
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,400
I don't think so.

88
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
I'm afraid it will be inappropriate.

89
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I'm afraid it will be inappropriate.

90
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Why do you come here in person?

91
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
You're also a good person.

92
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
I'm from the East.

93
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
I'm willing to marry you.

94
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,400
It seems that Jiang Zomeng's strength is really beyond imagination.

95
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Jiang Zomeng is just a matter of time.

96
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm willing to meet my brothers.

97
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
I'm always the first.

98
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
I don't ask about my birth.

99
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
I don't ask about my future.

100
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
I just had a few days.

101
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Are you trying to tell me

102
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,400
that the person who sent you to help me practice water battles

103
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,400
is also a person who doesn't know his identity and doesn't know where he is?

104
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
That doctor,

105
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
from Jiang Zomeng,

106
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
you don't know him, do you?

107
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
If you don't know his origin,

108
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,400
then it seems that I know him more than you do.

109
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
What else do you know?

110
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Although he changed his name

111
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
and became a good person,

112
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
I still recognize him.

113
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Don't you want to know who he is?

114
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Who is he?

115
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
He's not lucky.

116
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
His name is Wei Zheng.

117
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
He was the vice general of the Cheyenne Army

118
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
and the general of the General's Army.

119
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
He's a courtier.

120
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
He's a wolf-eared man.

121
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Jiang Zomeng is a wolf.

122
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
You're the first wolf in the world.

123
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
And Wei Zheng is under your command.

124
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
If you don't know his identity,

125
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
how can I believe you?

126
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
How to believe?

127
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
How to not believe?

128
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Then please tell me,

129
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,400
is there only Wei Zheng and a Cheyenne rebel in Jiang Zomeng?

130
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Do you also believe that Cheyenne is a rebel?

131
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I don't know.

132
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
I was still young then.

133
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
But I believe

134
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
that those people I know

135
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
won't betray me.

136
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Since you're so kind,

137
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
why do you ask?

138
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Now you're talking about what's the point of betraying and not betraying.

139
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
The peace is fixed.

140
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Crown Prince and Prince Yu won't rebel for the Cheyenne Army.

141
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Because this case

142
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
is their most important solution.

143
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
That's right.

144
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Who would order Crown Prince and Prince Yu to rebel?

145
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,400
There's only one way to achieve it.

146
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Prince Jin?

147
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
So you've always wanted to help him.

148
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
It's really Prince Jin.

149
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Your Highness, the weather is cold.

150
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Please be safe.

151
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Okay. You should go and rest.

152
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Yes, Your Highness.

153
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Sister Chen Fei,

154
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,400
I've decided to take a road of danger this year.

155
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
The world is in danger.

156
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
The future is in danger.

157
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
If you have the power to do so,

158
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
please protect me.

159
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Yes.

160
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Only Prince Jin can do it.

161
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
But it's too hard.

162
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
If you don't be careful,

163
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
you'll be in trouble.

164
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
You'll never be able to go back.

165
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Who would have thought I'd go back?

166
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Who would have thought I'd go back?

167
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Have I thought I'd go back?

168
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Wei Zheng is different.

169
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Wei Zheng is a Cheyenne savior.

170
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
He wants to take his own fate.

171
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
But you...

172
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Who are you?

173
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
I've just arrived at the capital.

174
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Many people asked me

175
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
who I am.

176
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Someone asked me in person.

177
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Someone asked me in secret.

178
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
They soon got the answer.

179
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Has anyone ever asked you?

180
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
No.

181
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
No one has ever asked me.

182
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
No one has ever asked me.

183
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
No one has ever asked me.

184
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
Who am I?

185
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
I didn't expect

186
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
you'd ask someone like that.

187
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
How do you want to do it?

188
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
To save people

189
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
like Wei Zheng.

190
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
If you're a Cheyenne savior,

191
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
why don't I recognize you?

192
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
You've always recognized him.

193
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
You've always recognized him.

194
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
But I recognize Wei Zheng.

195
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
He's the deputy commander of the Cheyenne army.

196
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
He can listen to you.

197
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
I don't believe you're a commoner.

198
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
We're just trying to kill him.

199
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Wei Zheng is not good at this.

200
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Moreover,

201
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
he can't be exposed.

202
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Do you know Uncle Lin?

203
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
I know him.

204
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
He's really dead.

205
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Yes.

206
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Where is he?

207
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
The Meiling.

208
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Where is the dead body?

209
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
The soul of the seven souls.

210
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
The world is a dream.

211
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
The soul of the seven souls.

212
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
The world is a dream.

213
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
No one knows his body.

214
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
He's still alive.

215
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
The war is tragic.

216
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
The enemy is like a mountain.

217
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Who can recognize who is Uncle Lin?

218
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
I know what the battlefield is.

219
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
But if you're a Cheyenne savior,

220
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
why didn't you call me

221
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
a Cheyenne savior?

222
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
Why did you call me that?

223
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,400
It's just a nickname.

224
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Whether it's Uncle Lin or Cheyenne savior,

225
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
or any other important thing,

226
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
it doesn't matter.

227
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
There's a letter here.

228
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
There's a letter here.

229
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
The wind is cold.

230
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
The wind is cold.

231
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
The wind is cold.

232
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
The wind is cold.

233
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
I know that

234
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
you are my Uncle Lin.

235
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,360
What am I claimed to?

236
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:01,260
In the red eyes the ordinary people are optionals.

237
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,700
Interrogate myself forever.

238
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,280
Woman always thinks I'm so unreasonable.

239
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,180
Tired.

240
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,400
No fear nor hatred ever.

241
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,600
As far as I know,

242
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,480
No wonder why I cry

243
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:29,360
I take courage toNow I move

244
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,060
the flower of theектор

245
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,220
inụo

246
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,060
for your drama

247
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,220
and my love

248
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,220
Don't leave me again.

249
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,220
You will never leave me again.

250
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,220
But I'm no longer the same Lin Shu.

251
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,220
I've been taking care of you for a long time.

252
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,220
I should have taken care of you.

253
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,220
I thought I could take care of you all the time.

254
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,220
You've been taking care of me.

255
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,220
Ever since I was in Nanjing,

256
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,220
I've been their support for Qing'er and Yunnan.

257
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,220
But every time I meet any difficulties,

258
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,220
you are my support.

259
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,220
I believe you are by my side.

260
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,220
I believe you will come back.

261
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,220
Just like when I was little,

262
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,220
I couldn't run away from you.

263
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,220
My Lin Shu brother will always be taken by me.

264
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,220
But before the accident,

265
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,220
I'm afraid I'll never be able to come back.

266
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,220
How could you be like this?

267
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,220
You were never afraid of cold.

268
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,220
You were a little boy.

269
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,220
What have you been through these years?

270
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
What kind of cruel thing is it?

271
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,220
Can you erase all the traces of someone?

272
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,220
To make you look like a piece of paper?

273
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,220
Don't ask me first.

274
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,220
I'll tell you the truth.

275
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,220
When I come back,

276
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,220
I'm in danger.

277
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,220
I can't expose my Lin Shu brother.

278
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,220
I know.

279
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,220
Especially Dong Jie and Jing Yan.

280
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,220
They can't know.

281
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,220
I understand.

282
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,220
But why can't you tell me?

283
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,220
When I come back,

284
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,220
I can't let the past be my own.

285
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,220
Not you.

286
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,220
What can I do for you?

287
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,220
From now on,

288
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,220
I'm still a Suzhe.

289
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,220
You're still a princess.

290
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,220
I can't let the death be my own.

291
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,220
Okay.

292
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,220
I can wait.

293
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,220
Wait until you turn back to my Lin Shu brother.

294
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,220
Mother is back soon.

295
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,220
Don't let her see you crying.

296
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,220
It's not good.

297
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,220
I'm leaving.

298
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,220
Brother Lin Shu.

299
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
I can still go to Suzhai.

300
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,220
To see you.

301
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,220
If you really want to see me,

302
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,220
then come.

303
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,220
Master.

304
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,220
Master.

305
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,220
Come.

306
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,220
Doctor Yan.

307
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,220
How is he?

308
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,220
He's not feeling well.

309
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,220
He's having a cold.

310
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,220
He's in a critical condition.

311
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,220
He needs to be relieved and rest.

312
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,220
Is he a medical doctor?

313
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,220
What is a medical doctor?

314
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,220
He can't live until tomorrow.

315
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,220
If he's always so unwell,

316
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,220
and lights up the room,

317
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,220
he'll be fine.

318
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,220
But he's not well.

319
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,220
If he's always so unwell,

320
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,220
and lights up the room,

321
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,220
he'll be fine.

322
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,220
He won't be fine this time.

323
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,220
Next time.

324
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,220
We know that.

325
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,220
But the princess is so lucky.

326
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,220
Luckily you're here.

327
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,220
If we were to be alone,

328
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,220
I'm afraid we can't stop him.

329
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,220
Your Highness.

330
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,220
Master Shen.

331
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,220
You just took care of the Ministry of Revenue.

332
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,220
You should be busy.

333
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,220
Why are you still out?

334
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,220
I've been cleaning up the Ministry of Revenue.

335
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,220
I found something wrong with the grass.

336
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,220
So I'm here to help you.

337
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,220
I'm sorry.

338
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,220
I'm sorry.

339
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,220
I'm sorry.

340
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,220
I'm sorry.

341
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,220
I'm sorry.

342
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,220
I'm sorry.

343
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,220
I'm sorry.

344
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,220
I'm sorry.

345
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,220
I'll go to the dock to check on the wood.

346
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,220
The grass is good.

347
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,220
Brother Zhang.

348
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,220
What's this?

349
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,220
Why is the fruit so heavy?

350
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
It's like a metal skin.

351
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,220
It's sealed.

352
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,220
Why are you asking so much?

353
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,220
I'll give you a lot of money.

354
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,220
The brothers are divided.

355
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,220
My Lord.

356
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,220
According to the Ministry of Revenue,

357
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,220
the ship should be the sacred fruit.

358
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,220
Let's help them.

359
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,220
Okay.

360
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,220
Hurry up.

361
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,220
Although the weight is not related to the weight of the goods

362
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,220
that are reported by the official,

363
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,220
it's not that heavy.

364
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,220
It's not that heavy.

365
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,220
I'm afraid I'll be hungry.

366
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,220
Good.

367
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,500
It seems that the secret of the

368
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,220
grass-dried fruit is hidden in the coffin.

369
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,220
No matter what the secret is,

370
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,220
the old man in the building

371
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,220
is not very concerned with the official.

372
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,220
You have to be careful.

373
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,220
Don't worry.

374
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,220
I'll take care of it.

375
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,220
If you need help,

376
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,220
I'll ask His Highness to come and see you.

377
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,220
Okay.

378
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,220
Let's go.

379
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,220
Brother Zhao,

380
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,220
two official ships are about to enter the port.

381
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,220
Keep an eye on them.

382
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,220
Brother Zhao,

383
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,220
these two official ships are also wearing black.

384
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,220
Six official ships are wearing black.

385
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,220
My brother is not like that.

386
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,220
Who is Xiao Yu?

387
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,220
I don't know.

388
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,220
What is the place where these black goods are in the last place?

389
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,220
They must have chased after me.

390
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,220
The black goods are in the capital.

391
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,220
It's absolutely not a good thing.

392
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,220
The chief is now in the capital.

393
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,220
Hu De.

394
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,220
Yes.

395
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,220
Be careful.

396
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,220
Master Zhao, you're back.

397
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,220
Is His Highness back?

398
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,220
Yes, His Highness is back.

399
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
You have to take the goods back to the capital.

400
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,220
Be careful.

401
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,220
Don't let it get in the way.

402
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,220
Father.

403
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,220
You're back.

404
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,220
Go and do it.

405
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,220
Yes, Your Highness.

406
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,220
I'll send someone to pack up the stuff.

407
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,220
No need.

408
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,220
The officials are still going to be here for a few days.

409
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,220
I'll pack up some things when I'm back.

410
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,220
I'll be going now.

411
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,220
Master, everything is packed up.

412
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,220
Okay.

413
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,220
Father.

414
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
It's good that you're here.

415
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,220
But the sand is really hard to eat.

416
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,220
What do you know?

417
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,220
Yijin.

418
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,220
Father.

419
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:31,220
Do you still have enough money in your house?

420
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,220
Master Li.

421
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,220
What is it?

422
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,220
Prince Yu sent someone to bring some gifts.

423
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,220
He's already returned it twice.

424
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,220
Why is he still sending it?

425
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,220
Is he still annoyed?

426
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,220
Give it back.

427
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,220
This time it's not something expensive.

428
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,220
It's some kind of trick.

429
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,220
It's for the concubines.

430
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,220
Leave it.

431
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,220
I'll go and pack it.

432
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,220
Leave it.

433
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,220
Yes.

434
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,220
Prince Yu.

435
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,220
You've lost to me this time.

436
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,220
You've lost to Suzai?

437
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,220
Okay.

438
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,220
The court has changed.

439
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,220
The imperial court is in great danger.

440
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
We have to help each other.

441
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,220
I can't thank him.

442
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,220
But the gold, jewelry,

443
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,220
and the ancient words are still not familiar.

444
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,220
Or do you have a way

445
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,220
to let Prince Yu's Li Xiang enter his door?

446
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,220
I just know that he has to do it.

447
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,220
Suzai's unfulfilled child

448
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,220
has a weak sense of security on the surface.

449
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,220
But in fact,

450
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,220
like his younger brother,

451
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,220
he's not easy to get away with.

452
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,220
But he can still get away with

453
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,220
and move on with his feelings.

454
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,220
Don't be modest.

455
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,220
I still have that word.

456
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,220
Thank you for your help these years.

457
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,220
Come on, get in the car.

458
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
Yes.

459
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,220
Are you going out?

460
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,220
Although your gift is a good one,

461
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,220
it's still a toy.

462
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,220
It's too light.

463
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,220
I heard that Mei Changsu is sick.

464
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,220
I'd better go and visit her.

465
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,220
You're really thoughtful.

466
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,220
What's going on?

467
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
The brothers have been following us all the time.

468
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,220
But they lost the gun after they got the gun.

469
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,220
Where did they lose it?

470
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,220
The Shizi Street.

471
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,220
Hurry.

472
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,220
They lost it?

473
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,220
Sixth Su船 was sent here.

474
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,220
It was so much fire.

475
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,220
How could they lose it?

476
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,220
What fire?

477
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,220
Someone killed the suspect.

478
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,220
The fire was not in the government's house.

479
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,220
According to the court's law,

480
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,220
only those who don't know

481
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,220
can get out of the house.

482
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,220
The fire is made by the fire

483
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,220
that is used by the fire department.

484
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,220
The rest are the only black fire.

485
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,220
Brother Zhao,

486
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,220
how much is this piece of fire?

487
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,220
Not much.

488
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,220
But the Sixth Su船 is really a waste.

489
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,220
The fire department is not clear.

490
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,220
I sent people

491
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,220
to look for the black fire.

492
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,220
Who knows

493
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,220
if they lost it?

494
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,220
I don't know.

495
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,220
I don't know.

496
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,220
But they lost it.

497
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,220
Didn't they say

498
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,220
there was a large group of fire

499
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
that was not aware of the direction and the purpose of the city?

500
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,220
The fire is dangerous.

501
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,220
The chief always walks around the city.

502
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,220
Mr. Shi San,

503
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,220
I can't rest assured.

504
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,220
You must find out where the fire is.

505
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,220
You don't have enough people.

506
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,220
I'll send a companion to help you.

507
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,220
Yes.

508
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
We need to report this to the chief.

509
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,220
We need to make him more careful.

510
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,220
Now that everyone is in the big house

511
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,220
you can probably find your companion when you go out.

512
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,220
I'll catch him when I get home.

513
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,220
Greetings.

514
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:38,220
ゲ 二 三。

515
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,220
Your nastiest day

516
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,220
Back in our days,

517
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,220
I'm a little bit worried about the harem.

518
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,220
I can't take care of it alone.

519
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,220
Consort Xu.

520
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,220
I'm here.

521
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,220
You're the only one in the palace.

522
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,220
Sister Yue and Sister Yuan are three different concubines.

523
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,220
Your age is the longest.

524
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,220
You should be more respectful.

525
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,220
Help me to do some things.

526
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,220
Yes.

527
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,220
Do do. Hurry up and join us.

528
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:49,220
The first lady of the palace, Yu Le Cheng 94466. Come.

529
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,220
What's wrong, Empress?

530
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,220
Is there something wrong with the title?

531
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,220
You're just hoping I'm wrong, right?

532
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:04,220
I don't mean that.

533
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,220
Mother.

534
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,220
I used to be a good person.

535
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,220
I was a good person.

536
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,220
Your Majesty is so dissatisfied with this.

537
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,220
From now on...

538
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,220
From now on...

539
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,220
Your Highness.

540
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,220
Your Highness.

541
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,220
Your Highness.

542
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,220
Your Highness.

543
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,220
How do you feel?

544
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,220
I just got a cold.

545
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,220
Thank you for coming in person.

546
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,220
I'm really sorry for your visit.

547
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,220
I don't like the outside.

548
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,220
I can't take it seriously.

549
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,220
I'm in a big trouble.

550
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,220
Please take care of yourself.

551
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,220
Your Highness.

552
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,220
Your Highness.

553
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,220
Something bad has happened.

554
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,220
Something bad has happened.

555
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,220
Your Highness.

556
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,220
Your Highness.

557
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,220
Go and check.

558
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,220
Yes.

559
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,220
Fei Liu.

560
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,220
Let her go.

561
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,220
Your Highness.

562
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,220
Your Highness.

563
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
Something bad has happened.

564
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,220
What's bad?

565
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,220
The palace is in a mess.

566
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,220
Empress...

567
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,220
Empress is sick.

568
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,220
What?

569
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,220
Don't worry, Your Highness.

570
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,220
Just go and check.

571
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,220
Go.

572
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,220
Take care of yourself.

573
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,220
Go.

574
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,220
Please.

575
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,220
The capital is so big.

576
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,220
At first, there was no way to go.

577
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,220
Then we went to the same road.

578
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,220
We went to investigate the recent

579
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,220
transport of the Cao Yun.

580
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,220
From the clear view,

581
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,220
the ships are all fresh,

582
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,220
fragrant, and rare.

583
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,220
The new products of Guihuan family.

584
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,220
The types are very diverse.

585
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,220
The direction is also very bad.

586
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,220
Many households have a prediction.

587
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,220
Who can find out who has the biggest suspicion in the world?

588
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,220
But the normal people

589
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,220
can't do the transport.

590
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,220
There should be a royal official involved.

591
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,220
You're right.

592
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,220
But most of the ships are old.

593
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,220
People with a big suspicion are not fully recovered.

594
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,220
It's hard to find out at once.

595
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
I didn't expect that there is no small mistake.

596
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,220
I actually...

597
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,220
You just said the result.

598
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,220
I didn't have time to listen to you.

599
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,220
Yes.

600
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,220
We found that there are four firewoods

601
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,220
and they were transported to the north side.

602
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,220
One of them was trapped in a big yard.

603
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,220
There is a private kitchen.

604
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,220
A private kitchen?

605
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,220
The annual government will hold a price explosion.

606
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,220
The private kitchen is sold and the goods are carried out.

607
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,220
But the private kitchen of the official

608
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,220
will be in the stock.

609
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,220
The Ministry of Revenue will stay.

610
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,220
So the top-ranked building

611
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,220
will secretly open the private kitchen.

612
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,220
They will transport the goods and sell them.

613
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,220
All the income is a little bit less.

614
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,220
The crown prince will be the one to take the lead.

615
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,220
I understand.

616
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,220
Although the building is closed,

617
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,220
the crown prince won't let go of this package.

618
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,220
So the private kitchen is still in operation.

619
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,220
These black goods

620
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,220
must be transported to the capital

621
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,220
to make the firewood.

622
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,220
At the same time, we found out

623
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,220
the new minister of the Ministry of Revenue,

624
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,220
Mr. Shen,

625
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,220
and sent people to investigate.

626
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,220
This is a small case.

627
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,220
We should report it to the governor.

628
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,220
Mr. Shisan, let me go.

629
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,220
I can do it.

630
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,220
I bought a piece of vegetable garden in Xi City.

631
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,220
The same road is now

632
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,220
responsible for sending vegetables to the house.

633
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,220
The governor has ordered

634
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,220
that there is a direct message

635
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,220
that the same road is responsible for it.

636
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,220
Once we find out the information

637
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,220
about the private kitchen,

638
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,220
we can send it to Mr. Shen.

639
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,220
I understand.

640
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,220
We will cooperate with Mr. Shen.

641
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,220
Go.

642
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,220
Chief,

643
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,220
the news from the imperial hospital said

644
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,220
that the Empress is not in a serious condition.

645
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,220
Not in a serious condition?

646
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,220
Yes.

647
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,220
Then why is the person in the Prince's Mansion

648
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,220
in such a panic?

649
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,220
It's because of the illness.

650
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,220
The symptoms at first

651
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,220
seemed to be very serious.

652
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,220
So it caused a panic.

653
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,220
But according to the doctor's statement,

654
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,220
it's indeed not serious.

655
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,220
Please ask the princess

656
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:37,220
to investigate the name of Wen'an.

657
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,220
I can figure out a way

658
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,220
to get a prescription for the doctor.

659
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,220
The chief suspects that

660
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,220
the Empress is infected.

661
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,220
Who is it?

662
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,220
It's a coincidence.

663
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,220
I'm not worried.

664
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,220
If we want to kill the Empress,

665
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,220
then the most possible thing

666
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,220
must be the princess and the crown prince.

667
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,220
It's because they can kill the Empress.

668
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,220
So it's not easy to get a prescription.

669
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,220
The Empress and the princess

670
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,220
fought in the palace for so many years.

671
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,220
They were very careful about her.

672
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,220
When the princess was in the middle of the day,

673
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,220
she couldn't do anything to the Empress.

674
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:20,220
It's impossible for them to get a prescription now.

675
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,220
The Noble Consort of Yue just recovered.

676
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,220
Moreover, she has experienced the court's trial.

677
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,220
I'm afraid the primordial spirit

678
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,220
hasn't fully recovered yet.

679
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,220
And the Empress is not in a good mood.

680
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,220
If it's really the crown prince and the Noble Consort,

681
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,220
they won't be so close.

682
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,220
They will get a prescription,

683
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,220
but they don't know the Empress is dead.

684
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,220
This is definitely not their way of doing it.

685
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,220
What you mean is

686
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,220
that the Eastern Palace is innocent?

687
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,220
Now, any conclusion is still on the line.

688
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,220
Maybe the Empress won't attend the memorial.

689
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,220
I didn't expect anything good to happen.

690
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,220
Maybe the Empress is really just sick.

691
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,220
But there are no more days left until the memorial.

692
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,220
If the Empress can't recover in time,

693
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,220
it will be a disaster.

694
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,220
So we must hurry up and investigate.

695
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,220
Yes.

696
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,220
I always have a feeling

697
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,220
that there is a deep doubt behind this.

698
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,220
Did I ignore any of the concerns?

699
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,220
I'm sorry.

700
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,220
Empress Yan.

701
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,220
Empress Laofan is here to say hello.

702
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,220
Empress is not in a good mood.

703
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,220
But the imperial doctor said

704
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,220
that Empress needs to recuperate for several days.

705
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,220
She can't get tired.

706
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,220
Please go back to your room.

707
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,220
If so, we won't disturb Empress to recuperate.

708
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,220
Wait.

709
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,220
Miss Qi Hong.

710
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,220
Is this the tea that Empress used for the past days?

711
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,220
Yes.

712
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,220
It's so delicate.

713
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,220
Your Highness.

714
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,220
Are you okay, Empress?

715
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,220
The imperial doctor said that she's fine.

716
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,220
Her Highness is also recovering.

717
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,220
She should be fine.

718
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,220
Then she's fine.

719
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,220
I'll go back to the room.

720
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,220
I'll go to the room.

721
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,220
I'll go to the room.

722
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,220
I'll go to the room.

723
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,220
I'll go to the room.

724
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,220
I'll go to the room.

725
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,220
I'll go to the room.

726
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,220
Thank you, Your Highness.

727
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,220
But no matter what illness,

728
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,220
there must be a reason.

729
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,220
Your Highness.

730
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,220
I'm sorry.

731
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,220
I'm sorry.

732
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,220
I'm sorry.

733
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,220
I'm sorry.
