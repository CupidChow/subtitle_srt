00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 14

2
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Jingyuan.

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You haven't fought for so many years.

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I didn't know that your food is so good.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I want to see

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
if Consort Jing has such good food.

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
All those things that she did

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
were all thrown away.

9
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Do one thing for me.

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't let anyone else know about it.

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Your Majesty, just tell me.

12
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll arrange it.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You're a consort for Consort Chen.

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You should be a consort.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Bow down.

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Listen to me.

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Your Majesty.

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're always in charge of the harem.

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why is everything going wrong?

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What are you doing?

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Your Majesty.

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm really incompetent.

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Although I'm trying to control the harem,

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm not sure if I can control it.

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Consort Jing is trying to

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
take advantage of the situation

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
of the criminal Lin Yueyao.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She's so agitated.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Until today,

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I just found out

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
that I'm a bad person.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What did Consort Jing say?

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Consort Jing knew that she was guilty.

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
She was caught and

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
she was killed by the criminal.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Consort Jing is here

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
to take advantage of the situation of the criminal Lin Yueyao.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The two of you should be in charge of the harem.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's obvious that you're always in charge of the harem.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Even though you're always in charge of the harem,

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you're not exposed to the outside world.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How did you know

50
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
that you're in charge of the harem?

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Consort Jing's maid

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
is not in charge of

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
the harem.

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
She's here to report to the harem.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The harem is in charge of the harem.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Who's the maid?

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Ah!

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Come on!

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're a traitor!

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How could you do this?

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Come on!

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Take her out of here.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Kill her!

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes!

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Consort Jing!

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Consort Jing!

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Kill her!

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Kill her!

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Wait!

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Your Majesty,

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm from the Lohong Palace.

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm very bold.

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
May I please

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
please take care of myself?

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're so despicable.

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You can't be so soft-hearted.

77
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I understand.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Your Majesty,

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm being entrusted by Your Majesty

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
to manage the harem.

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Of course, I'm not to blame

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
for all the wrongs I've done.

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Consort Jing's crime

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
is not a problem.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm a guard of the harem.

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I can't be too harsh.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Your Majesty treats Consort Jing

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
as if she had other plans.

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Please let me know

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and ask for my permission.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Otherwise,

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll be in a hurry.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You said you'd let her know?

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Such a trivial matter.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You want to know?

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You want the world to say

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
my harem is not well?

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This is what you've done

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
to help me.

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The harem should be

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
settled and well-off.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't you understand?

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Your Majesty, you think it's a trivial matter.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't dare to be a trivial matter.

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Consort Jing is involved in the harem

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and she's a criminal.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
She's clearly a guard of the harem.

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
She's been investigating the matter

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
and she's really surprised.

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Please take the responsibility

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
for what happened today.

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Consort Jing,

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
do you know your crime?

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I know my crime.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I was innocent

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and I was a criminal.

118
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I didn't kill the emperor.

119
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But I don't follow the rules.

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Your Majesty,

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the Empress says you're a criminal.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You said it was just a matter of

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
saving the harem.

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Is this a crime?

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's clearly not a crime.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Guards!

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Consort Jing is a criminal.

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
She's been investigating the matter.

131
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
She's not responsible.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
She's not allowed to leave the harem.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Think about it when you're done.

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
When will you come back?

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Your Majesty.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I've been dealing with you.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What else do you want?

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Such a big crime.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Is it enough?

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What do you plan to do?

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You want to kill Bai Ling?

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You'll be punished.

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'll go to the harem.

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You'll be punished.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You'll be punished.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're so messy.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can clean up.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I understand.

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll leave the harem.

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The Empress is tired.

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You can go back to the harem.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I've been in many trouble lately.

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What do you want to learn from me?

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Get up!

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Get up!

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Your Majesty.

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Are you going back to the Wuyin Hall?

159
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Gao Zhan.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Don't you think

161
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
something really strange happened today?

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You mean...

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The King of Jing is interrogating the Palace.

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The Empress is going to attack Consort Jing.

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You mean Consort Jing and her son are having a meal today?

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're so stupid.

167
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You're so stupid.

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You're so stupid.

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You're so stupid.

170
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're so stupid.

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I told you, you don't understand.

172
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Father.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The Empress is in a hurry.

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Lady Hao Gong is a big monster.

175
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
She can't do anything.

176
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Come on.

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You can go back to the Wuyin Hall.

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Where did you say you were going?

179
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm going to the Wuyin Hall.

180
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm going to the Wuyin Hall.

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm going to the Wuyin Hall.

182
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm going to the Wuyin Hall.

183
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm going to the Wuyin Hall.

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm going to the Wuyin Hall.

185
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Where did you say you were going?

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The Dali Temple.

187
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes, Dali Temple.

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's talk about Dali Temple.

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Stand up and talk.

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Thank you, Father.

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
After I tried to get rid of Xuanjing Temple,

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
the subordinate changed his mouth

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
and said that the meal was in the Dali Temple.

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Is that right?

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I didn't change my mouth.

196
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I started...

197
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Fine.

198
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Fine.

199
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Even so,

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
do you mean

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
my patrol camp is also in the Dali Temple?

202
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's a famous place.

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's a mess.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It prevents you from chasing after people.

205
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The patrol camp is in a conflict with the noble.

206
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is the truth.

207
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Even if the subordinate

208
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
has the right to sue me for this,

209
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I admit that

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I have the right to punish you.

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But in the Dali Temple,

212
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
the patrol camp

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
has no connection with the subordinate.

214
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Do you still want to

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
punish me

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
for losing the criminal?

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Jingyan.

218
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I've been there

219
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
when the subordinate came in.

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
He didn't say anything.

221
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's just that he's been accused of

222
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
being a criminal.

223
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And the patrol camp

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
has been arrested

225
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
by the subordinate

226
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
outside of Xuanjing Temple.

227
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
As for the person

228
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
who is behind the scenes,

229
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
it's the father's order

230
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and the one who is watching.

231
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That's why I'm here to ask you to come.

232
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
If you're really innocent,

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
just say it out loud.

234
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why do you force the subordinate

235
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
so much?

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Please ask,

237
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
is the crime scene here?

238
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
No.

239
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So you're saying

240
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
you're trying to stop the patrol camp?

241
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No.

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Since you're not the witness,

243
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and you're not the patrol camp,

244
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
it's because of this.

245
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The father is here.

246
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Why are you so anxious

247
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
to get rid of the subordinate?

248
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm just saying a fair word

249
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
for the subordinate.

250
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You're the one

251
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
who's angry with me.

252
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The one who's anxious

253
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
is you.

254
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The father said you're innocent.

255
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I think you're right.

256
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
As the brother,

257
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
do you really have to say that to me?

258
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You're just a useless person.

259
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You can't get away from this.

260
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Who is Wei Zheng?

261
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He's the father of the criminal Lin Shu.

262
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You were close to that Lin Shu

263
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
like your brother.

264
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Who doesn't know?

265
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Who else in the whole of the capital

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
can get such a big motive

267
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
except you?

268
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Your Majesty,

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I didn't get the evidence.

270
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I didn't mean it.

271
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I just don't dare to say

272
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
what you said.

273
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But in front of such a crime,

274
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Prince Jing will have to be very careful.

275
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If you keep fighting like this,

276
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
there will be no result.

277
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You're right.

278
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The police and the subordinates

279
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
of the official official's office

280
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
have such a big motive.

281
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's not that we're fighting here.

282
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
We can find the truth

283
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
if we don't stop.

284
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Please let me investigate.

285
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
At that time,

286
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
some people

287
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
will not be able to get away from this.

288
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Your Majesty,

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
people are lost in Xuanjing Temple.

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I have no other choice.

291
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't want to say anything

292
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
about the truth.

293
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But it's too complicated.

294
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's too dangerous to be involved in the royal family.

295
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I want to ask Your Majesty to give me a decree

296
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
so that I can be the official official

297
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and the subordinates of the official official's office.

298
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Since that's the case,

299
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
you can't find the result

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
if you fight in the hall.

301
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Xia Qing.

302
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

303
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The case of Wei Zheng

304
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
is your idea.

305
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You and I

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
must find it out.

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I understand.

308
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I accept your decree.

309
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But

310
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm sure

311
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
no one in the royal family

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
will be able to get away from Xuanjing Temple.

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If you want to hurt someone,

314
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
you must tell him

315
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
to avoid the conflict.

316
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Jingyan.

317
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're a suspect.

318
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You must understand

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
that Xia Qing

320
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
has no reason

321
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
to get away from Xuanjing Temple.

322
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You must not stop her.

323
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

324
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

325
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm going to

326
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
remind a person of Jin Yao

327
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
to come to Xuanjing Temple.

328
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Your Majesty, please allow me to leave.

329
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This person is very clever.

330
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He can be a good example.

331
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm afraid that

332
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
he will run away

333
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
if he goes a step further.

334
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Who is he?

335
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The leader of the Jiangzu Alliance.

336
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Mei Changsu.

337
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Mei Changsu?

338
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Fei Liu.

339
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You always

340
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
pick flowers

341
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
when you don't want to.

342
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's all the leader of the Alliance.

343
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
For me?

344
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Brother Su likes it.

345
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Zhen Ping.

346
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Where do you think

347
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
this flower is?

348
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It looks good.

349
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Master.

350
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Mei Changsu?

351
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Do you remember?

352
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Of course, I do.

353
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I ordered Mei Changsu

354
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
to lead the royal family.

355
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This person

356
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
is very talented.

357
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
He has the heart of a country.

358
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
If he's not in good health,

359
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'll use him.

360
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What?

361
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You mean

362
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
he's in the capital

363
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
and is going too far

364
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
with Jingyan?

365
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Your Majesty.

366
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I haven't been back for a long time.

367
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I dare not say anything.

368
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But everyone knows

369
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
who Mei Changsu is.

370
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Who?

371
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Let's see what's the plan.

372
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Mei Changsu

373
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
was rewarded by his father.

374
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Jincheng and Xian Guili

375
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
were in a fight with him.

376
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
There was a long time

377
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
when he was in the court.

378
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Princess Ni Huang was very proud of him.

379
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The Xia Dong and Xia Chun

380
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
in Xuanjing

381
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
went to Suzhai for a lesson.

382
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Even Suzhai's courtyard

383
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
was recommended by

384
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Commander Meng.

385
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
The number of times

386
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
that he went to Suzhai's room

387
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
is a few times more than mine.

388
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
In terms of

389
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
the gifts that were sent to Suzhai's room,

390
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
the first one

391
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
should be the one

392
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
of the late and the late.

393
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
To be honest,

394
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
it's me.

395
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I haven't

396
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
given any of the same gifts

397
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
to him.

398
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
How can I say

399
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
that in the end,

400
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
the Xia Shouzun

401
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
went to his father

402
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and that's me.

403
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That's great.

404
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Since Mei Changsu

405
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
is not the one who was in charge of Prince Jing,

406
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
it's better to do it.

407
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'll make this person

408
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
more suspicious.

409
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Xia Qing,

410
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
since he hasn't

411
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
gone too far

412
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
for the past few years,

413
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
why did you

414
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
suggest him to do it?

415
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Your Majesty,

416
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
in the assault

417
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
of Xuanjing Temple,

418
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
all of them

419
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
are skilled masters

420
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
who are very skilled.

421
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And they are able to

422
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
organize

423
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
so many skilled people

424
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
in the whole capital.

425
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Who else

426
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
can be the leader of the Jiangzuo Alliance?

427
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I believe

428
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Mei Changsu

429
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
will definitely

430
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
get the reward.

431
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What do you mean?

432
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You're talking nonsense.

433
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The world can be a miracle.

434
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's actually a

435
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
very difficult task.

436
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If Xuanjing Temple

437
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
is all about

438
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
the feeling,

439
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
aren't you afraid of

440
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
the world's subordinates?

441
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's just that

442
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Prince Jing is

443
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
very nervous.

444
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
This Mr. Su

445
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
is also

446
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
a guest of His Majesty.

447
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
How about me?

448
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
As long as he makes it clear,

449
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
it's not his business.

450
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I guarantee

451
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
that when he leaves

452
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Xuanjing Temple,

453
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
it will be fine.

454
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Is that okay?

455
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Father,

456
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
you know

457
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
that Mei Changsu

458
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
is not well.

459
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He is a person

460
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
who is well-known in the world.

461
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The court is

462
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
very talented

463
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
and he is a very smart person.

464
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This Wu Gen Wu You

465
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
is just a common name

466
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
that can be passed on to the public.

467
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Moreover,

468
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Xuanjing Temple

469
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
is only a pre-created

470
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
and always in a formal manner.

471
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
If the behavior is wrong,

472
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
what the world

473
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
is doing is not

474
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
the subordinates' duty,

475
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
but your father.

476
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You are too insensitive, Qingyan.

477
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
According to your words,

478
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Mei Changsu and I

479
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
are quite close.

480
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't think so.

481
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
In the world,

482
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
he is still a member of the court.

483
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
He has nothing to touch.

484
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The person who is the subordinates

485
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
can be trusted by his father.

486
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Can't you trust him?

487
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
In the end,

488
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
it's just that

489
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
you are just asking

490
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
for Mei Changsu's opinion.

491
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's worth your effort.

492
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Now, let alone

493
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
his father,

494
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I even start to doubt you.

495
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Xia Qing,

496
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
as you wish.

497
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Go and investigate.

498
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I am sure.

499
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You must thoroughly investigate.

500
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Don't come back

501
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
if you don't want to know anything.

502
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I will.

503
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Father,

504
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I think...

505
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Shut up.

506
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Do you know

507
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
whether you are suspicious

508
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
or not?

509
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You are afraid

510
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
of the royal heart of your father's court.

511
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
No matter what,

512
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
your Xu Fangying

513
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
has already been involved.

514
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I will investigate

515
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
how to return your innocence.

516
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Send a decree.

517
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yes.

518
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Xu Fangying

519
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
will be in charge of the military department.

520
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Prince Jing will return to the capital.

521
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If he doesn't get the decree,

522
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
he will not be allowed to enter the army.

523
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yes.

524
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
When Xia Jiang comes,

525
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
take Feiliu away.

526
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
He can't resist.

527
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Prince Jing...

528
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
All right.

529
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Prince Jing,

530
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yan Fu,

531
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and the alliance

532
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
in the alliance,

533
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
will be in charge of the military department.

534
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yes.

535
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And

536
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
this flower

537
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
will be taken care of.

538
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
If I find

539
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
a leaf missing

540
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
when I return,

541
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I will not be able to spare you.

542
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yes.

543
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Master.

544
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Enter.

545
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Enter!

546
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,520
The

547
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,000
General

548
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
of the

549
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
General's

550
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Army

551
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
is in the

552
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
capital.

553
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The

554
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
General's army

555
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
is in the capital.

556
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The

557
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
General's army

558
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
is in the capital.

559
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
The

560
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
General's army

561
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
is in the capital.

562
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The

563
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
General's army

564
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
is in the capital.

565
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The

566
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
General's army

567
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
is in the capital.

568
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The

569
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
General's army

570
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
is in the capital.

571
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The

572
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
General's army

573
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
is in the capital.

574
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We

575
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
cannot

576
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
forget that

577
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
that

578
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,300
that

579
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,240
Stand up.

580
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,480
Stand up and talk.

581
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,400
It must be strange on you.

582
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,900
It seems that Imperial Concubinerai Chen does not have this Sizhe of Three Answers powers.

583
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,660
Why did Your Majesty make him put up to

584
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,680
palace affairs?

585
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Your Highness the Empress must be thinking about this too.

586
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,680
But she surely can't figure out the reason.

587
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
But you...

588
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
You are so smart.

589
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,680
You should understand it now, right?

590
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

591
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

592
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,680
His Majesty has been dreaming for years.

593
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,680
He is so thoughtful.

594
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,680
He is still in the illusion.

595
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,680
He is still in the palace with Consort Chen.

596
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,680
So I ordered him to set up a special sect for him.

597
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,680
It's a good thing that he is calm.

598
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,680
It's a coincidence.

599
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,680
Since he set up this sect,

600
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,680
His Majesty has been sleeping peacefully at night.

601
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,680
So it's your medicine.

602
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,680
You still care about me?

603
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,680
Think about yourself.

604
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,680
How are you going to punish me?

605
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,680
Two ways.

606
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,680
One is to send you to the temple.

607
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,680
Covering the white cloth to take you out of the palace.

608
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,680
The other one is to let you go.

609
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Let you get out of this palace.

610
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
There are different ways.

611
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,680
There are different conditions.

612
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Yes.

613
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,680
I don't understand why you suddenly suspect me

614
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,680
and set up this sect for me.

615
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
I have always been a good person to you.

616
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,680
I am not a bad person.

617
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,680
As long as you are active, you are a good person.

618
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Where exactly am I wrong?

619
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,680
Last time, you went out of the palace to beg for help.

620
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,680
Then you cried to Prince Jin.

621
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:54,680
At that time, I knew that you were by my side.

622
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Why?

623
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,680
Which words am I wrong?

624
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,680
All my actions were in vain.

625
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,680
Even if you suspect the whole thing is a trap,

626
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,680
I am just a person who is used and misled by the trap.

627
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Prince Yu, Xiao Jin, even Consort Hui,

628
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,680
they are the people you should suspect.

629
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,680
You have already said the key to the matter.

630
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,680
Don't you think so?

631
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,680
As you said, this whole thing is a trap.

632
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:39,680
It is a trap that is set up to make Prince Jin and Mr. Su

633
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,680
a relationship.

634
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,680
In this trap, no matter how the process develops,

635
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,680
how many shops are set up, how many people are to be picked up,

636
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,680
the ultimate goal, the most important part,

637
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,680
is the bitter tears of your last against Prince Jin.

638
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,680
If you are just a person who is used and misled by them,

639
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:07,680
then how should they control the last step?

640
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,680
They have lost all their minds.

641
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,680
Even Empress is in danger of being punished.

642
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:20,680
The last key is to put down a person who is not worthy of being punished.

643
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,680
Is that possible?

644
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,680
If this little girl forgets to tell Prince Jin,

645
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,680
if she is stopped by me all the time,

646
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,680
if she doesn't follow the order she heard,

647
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,680
and complete the process of turning the whole thing?

648
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Xiao Xin,

649
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,680
since you are the key to the whole thing,

650
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,680
then you must be their person.

651
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,680
I have never doubted this.

652
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
As of now,

653
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,680
why do I still have the second path?

654
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,680
I don't like killing people.

655
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Since you have no threat to me,

656
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,680
why do I have to take your life?

657
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,680
But you still have the condition.

658
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
Yes.

659
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,680
What condition?

660
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,680
I want you to take care of the whole thing.

661
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,680
How to connect the whole thing,

662
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,680
how to act,

663
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,680
how to act,

664
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,680
how to act in a lie,

665
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,680
what is the purpose of it?

666
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,680
I want you to take all the details of this world

667
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,680
out of your hands.

668
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,680
It's already been done.

669
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,680
Why must you listen to this?

670
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,680
It's not me who should listen.

671
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,680
It's Jin Yan.

672
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,680
He must listen.

673
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,680
I don't want to listen to this.

674
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,680
I don't want to listen to this.

675
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,680
I don't want to listen to this.

676
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,680
I don't want to listen to this.

677
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,680
I don't want to listen to this.

678
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,680
I don't want to listen to this.

679
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,680
I don't want to listen to this.

680
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,680
I don't want to listen to this.

681
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,680
I don't want to listen to this.

682
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,680
stirred

683
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,680
Give him more soap soap.

684
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,680
This person is very weak.

685
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,680
And he is frozen before the firstALT input.

686
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,680
Yes.

687
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,680
Teacher, I won't orientate him today.

688
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,680
First, let him live here for a long time here.

689
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,680
to taste the flavours.

690
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,560
Hence, don't bless them with their scent

691
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,080
Mmmmmm

692
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,360
Suchー

693
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:35,800
A new single

694
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,320
Are you ok

695
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,220
Well.

696
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,840
You mean?

697
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,660
What do you mean?

698
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,840
What do you mean?

699
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,020
Before I quit school,

700
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,660
my father told me to be prepared.

701
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,100
Maybe my mother would get involved in the war.

702
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,280
But then he said...

703
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,180
he said he will keep him.

704
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,220
And?

705
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,300
What else?

706
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,300
It's nothing.

707
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,300
We'll talk about it later.

708
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,300
He brought the flowers back.

709
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,300
He didn't say anything.

710
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,300
Did he...

711
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,300
He would have gone to the river to protect him.

712
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,300
The hand of the river is poisoned.

713
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,300
I'm weak.

714
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,300
Can he bear it?

715
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,300
No.

716
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,300
No.

717
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,300
I have to go to Xuanjing Temple.

718
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,300
Your Highness.

719
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,300
His Majesty ordered you to enter the house.

720
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,300
You're going out now.

721
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,300
But I'm the one who did the imperial edict.

722
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,300
How can I let others take me?

723
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300
I know.

724
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,300
I only believe in Mr. Su's arrangement.

725
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,300
He's the one who's afraid of you.

726
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,300
I think Mr. Su's plan

727
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,300
can be taken down.

728
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,300
I'm worried that it's not his plan.

729
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,300
Yes.

730
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,300
I understand.

731
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,300
But, Your Highness,

732
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,300
if Mr. Su stands here,

733
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,300
will he agree to your act of innocence?

734
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,300
The most exciting game on the line

735
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,300
is the Ma Jiang Hu.

736
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,300
Ma Jiang Hu.

737
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,300
Ma Jiang Hu.

00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,300
Ma Jiang Hu.

739
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,300
Ma Jiang Hu.

740
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,300
Ma Jiang Hu.

741
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,300
Ma Jiang Hu.

742
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,300
Ma Jiang Hu.

743
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,300
Ma Jiang Hu.

744
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Ma Jiang Hu.

745
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,300
Old Lady,

746
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300

when you give me the purple一定

765
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:44,540
and the prince will have you in the middle of the tears

766
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,460
me and my love

767
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,640
and the sheep

768
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,940
and you

769
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,540
and you

770
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,640
exactly

771
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,360
why are you waiting so much for me

772
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:06,920
This is great fate today.

773
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,120
I'll make sure to pray to god.

774
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:18,620
May he love the 결과 again.

775
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:25,980
I'm afraid to die today.

776
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,980
Allω l inherently need to take this generations turn and make them lead their gather.

777
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,380
I'm relieved.

778
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,020
Good.

779
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,340
I didn't expect that the first

780
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,020
leader of the world

781
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,340
would be so delicate and delicate.

782
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,900
I can't compare with you.

783
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,900
You look like

784
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,700
the chief of Xuanjing Bureau.

785
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,460
Mr. Su, you've learned to drive five cars.

786
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,660
You've seen a lot of things.

787
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,380
Do you know what that opens?

788
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,100
Di Yu,

789
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,100
there's no one

790
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,860
in such a place

791
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,740
to put food on you.

792
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,980
Miss, we're overdue.

793
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:20,580
My job is to avoid evasive

794
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,940
and be patient with them.

795
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,980
Please have a seat.

796
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,980
Thank you.

797
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,980
I'm not inviting anyone here.

798
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
Once I invite them,

799
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,980
unless I let them go,

800
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,980
or they won't be able to fly out.

801
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,980
I didn't want to fly out either.

802
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,980
Mr. Jing knows the news about this.

803
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,980
But he's not sure about it now.

804
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
I'm afraid he can't come to save you.

805
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,980
Mr. Xia,

806
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,980
your tea tastes too much.

807
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,980
How much did you spend on this tea?

808
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,980
Why don't you try it?

809
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,980
I know you're a genius.

810
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,980
You're not as good as others.

811
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,980
But I've seen a lot of things

812
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,980
that you can't tell me.

813
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,980
I'll listen to your advice.

814
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,980
I'll listen to you.

815
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,980
I'll listen to you.

816
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,980
Remember the case

817
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,980
when I used to act as a slave

818
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,980
to the military.

819
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,980
At that time,

820
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,980
I was a general in the Jiujing Market.

821
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,980
I was as strong as a cow.

822
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,980
I was as stubborn as a pig.

823
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,980
But I stayed here for two days.

824
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,980
And I got the list of the accomplices.

825
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,980
You did?

826
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,980
How did I know he was crazy?

827
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,980
You were crazy after you got him.

828
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,980
I wouldn't have let him go before you did.

829
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,980
I was very smart.

830
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,980
I don't know what you were thinking.

831
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,980
Did you do it on purpose?

832
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
Or did you learn to do it

833
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,980
for two days more?

834
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,980
I did it.

835
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,980
Is the prince here?

836
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,980
Yes.

837
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,980
He's in the study room.

838
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,980
He's in the small hall.

839
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,980
What do you want me to do?

840
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,980
To collude with Prince Jin?

841
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,980
Okay, I admit.

842
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,980
I've colluded with Prince Jin long ago.

843
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,980
The case of Wei Zheng this time

844
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,980
is a matter of order.

845
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,980
I'm planning it.

846
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,980
The first time we went to Xuanjing Bureau

847
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,980
we found that the guards there were very relaxed.

848
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,980
They were sure to be a trap.

849
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,980
Then they withdrew.

850
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,980
Of course, during the withdrawal,

851
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,980
thanks to the cooperation of the patrol camp,

852
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,980
they were able to withdraw.

853
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,980
Then you came back.

854
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,980
I found that you were very suspicious of the situation.

855
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,980
So I followed you.

856
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,980
I didn't expect to follow you to the Dali Temple.

857
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,980
I found Wei Zheng was there.

858
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,980
So, we were happy

859
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,980
to have the subordinate, Mr. Xia,

860
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,980
to report to you.

861
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,980
We fought a battle.

862
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,980
Finally, we got rid of this criminal.

863
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,980
The whole thing was like this.

864
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,980
Do you still have any idea?

865
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,980
Do you know what you've done just now?

866
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,980
I know.

867
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,980
You can write down what I said

868
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,980
as a confession.

869
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,980
When I'm done,

870
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,980
you can go to His Majesty.

871
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,980
Then the case is over.

872
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,980
We can all be careful.

873
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,980
So, you're talking about this idea.

874
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,980
I'm already holding it in my hands.

875
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,980
What else can I do?

876
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,980
This case is too big to be a matter of concern.

877
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,980
I don't have any evidence.

878
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,980
If we follow your confession

879
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,980
and go to the Dali Temple,

880
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,980
His Majesty will ask you to go there.

881
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,980
When you're in the Dali Temple,

882
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,980
you can ask the Dali Temple to control my situation

883
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,980
and ask you to be careful.

884
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,980
Maybe,

885
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,980
His Majesty will really be suspicious.

886
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,980
Of course, you're really thoughtful.

887
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,980
You can even think of such a wise way

888
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,980
to teach me.

889
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,980
Wei Changsu,

890
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,980
don't be too proud.

891
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,980
You're still so stubborn.

892
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,980
Do you really want to try my method of Xuanjing Temple?

893
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,980
Mr. Xia,

894
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,980
I don't understand what you're saying.

895
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,980
I've already done everything.

896
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,980
Why are you still saying I'm stubborn?

897
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,980
Look.

898
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,980
I'm so weak.

899
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,980
I don't want to try your method of Xuanjing Temple.

900
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,980
I've already said it.

901
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,980
Everything is up to His Highness.

902
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,980
What else do you want me to say?

903
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,980
Is it that Mr. Xia still wants to

904
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,980
drag other people in?

905
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,980
Do you want me to do it together?

906
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,980
You're making a thorough move.

907
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,980
Tell me.

908
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,980
Where is Wei Zheng now?

909
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,980
He's already in the capital.

910
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,980
Impossible.

911
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,980
I'm a man of my word.

912
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:50,980
I'm a man of my word.

913
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:56,980
I'm a man of my word.

914
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:04,980
I'm a man of my word.

915
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,980
I'm a man of my word.

916
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:29,980
Yunfang.
