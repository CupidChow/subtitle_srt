00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 19

2
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Jingwei, look.

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What's that?

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's just a basket.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
They threw it here.

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yujin, did you get scared today?

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Are you okay?

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I was thinking...

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
when you were looking for Cuiyue Pavilion under the police,

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
those women were right next to you.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I thought they were shouting in my heart.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm half a Jianghu person.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I might not have been scared.

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Jingrui.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Send her back.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll be there in a minute.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You're not Marquis Yan's son.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You're always so carefree.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I wouldn't send you if I didn't want to.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why did you say I was your father?

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's go.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I didn't say I wouldn't send you.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll send you.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Brother Su.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You go ahead.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Fei Liu is following me.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Fei Liu?

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't worry.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He must be nearby.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll go first.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yujin, wait for me.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yujin.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yujin.

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Stop!

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Who's there?

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Stop!

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Who's there?

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I met a big man here.

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What a coincidence.

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What's the coincidence?

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You knew I'd come to you in this hour.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I came to see you.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You really don't know

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
such a small child?

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Of course not.

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I just want to see

47
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
who will attack me.

48
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Who is it?

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
How is it?

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There's only a small guard nearby.

51
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If it's not for the Commander Meng,

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I can take it.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Commander Meng, please come in.

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Come on in.

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The Aomeng Fairy Pujing Entertainment Center 94466.

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Come.

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Did he find you?

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No.

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll go out of here immediately.

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
There's only one guard nearby.

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This Mei Chang Su

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
is so suspicious.

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He's not suspicious either.

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That Fei Liu is really a great martial artist.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The two of us

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
came together

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and took him in an hour.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He was the only one to take him.

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He took a bunch of guards with him.

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Brother Zhu,

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
take this little guard away from him.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You have a way, right?

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Mei Chang Su is looking everywhere.

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It seems he can't live in your house for long.

75
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Is it possible

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
to get rid of him before he leaves?

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll do my best.

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Your Highness,

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
the Ministry of Revenue wants to see you.

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What is he doing here?

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let him in.

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes.

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes.

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Your Highness, please protect me.

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What happened?

86
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You want me to protect you?

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Your Highness,

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
have you heard that

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
in the blue circle of Cheng Xi,

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
there are more than ten female guards?

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This matter has been passed down.

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I know it.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I know.

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What's going on with this case?

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Your Excellency.

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Have you found out the blue circle?

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Your Excellency,

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I went to the shop

99
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and found out that the blue circle was already visible.

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The circle was transferred to two people this year.

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
They were all people who were not related.

102
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The body of that person

103
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
should have been there for at least seven or eight years.

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Who was that person at that time?

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
His name is Zhang Jin.

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know his background.

107
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He only knows about business.

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He used to have many fengyue restaurants in the capital.

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He was low on people,

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
but he was very good at selling his wealth and people.

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Four years ago, he was sick and died.

112
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He was unwell and his business was also very bad.

113
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is why

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
he was sold out.

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Later,

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I sent people to bring back

117
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
all the people who are now in the blue circle.

118
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
They are now in the middle of the court.

119
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
There is no other way.

120
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Blue circle.

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The blue circle was originally

122
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
a person named Zhang Jin.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He was a secret agent.

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Your Highness, you know that

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
the court is lawful.

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The officials are not allowed to act.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Of course, there are some people

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
who dare not enter the fengyue restaurants

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and rely on Zhang Jin to make arrangements.

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There is nothing about a secret agent.

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
There are many people who went there.

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I just don't understand

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
why they dig out so many female stones.

134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
These girls are all Zhang Jin.

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They are more dangerous than the flowers

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
in the green building.

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
They were only to fight and help.

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But after a long time,

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
they sometimes get scared and lose their weight

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and kill a couple of girls.

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The loser in the cry is...

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Minister Lou,

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
you have this kind of life?

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Just two or three of us.

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You are just being nice.

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You like this kind of play.

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You even showed your hand to me.

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Zhang Jin died four years ago.

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Lan Yuan was also panicked.

150
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I didn't put it in my heart.

151
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I just didn't expect

152
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
that he would be so noisy.

153
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He just threw it at the police.

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I...

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Forget it.

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't worry too much.

157
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I am old and old.

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I am not poor.

159
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You are the second-ranking member of the court.

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who dares to mess with you?

161
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I...

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Minister Lou,

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
what else do you have in your hands?

164
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Your Highness,

165
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I have found out

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
that this man is called Shi Jun.

167
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He is the new head of the Lan Yuan family.

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
After the Lan Yuan case,

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
someone wanted to kill him.

170
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
He came to the palace to protect His Highness.

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
To protect him,

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
he must have some grudge.

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He said that

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Zhang Jin recorded all the things

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
that happened in Lan Yuan

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
in one of his name.

177
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He gave it to him before he died.

178
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Does this name

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
work for me?

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He didn't want to give me his name,

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
but he said his name.

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Who?

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Minister Lou.

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There is another name.

185
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
How could there be another name?

186
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You are too careless.

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I didn't expect

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Zhang Jin would do this.

189
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
After the corpse was turned out,

190
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I was so anxious.

191
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I thought that Shi Jun

192
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
was a witness.

193
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So I sent someone to seal his mouth.

194
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Who knew that he was escaped?

195
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
At that time,

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I only knew

197
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
that there was another name.

198
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Where is Shi Jun now?

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Prince Yu's Mansion.

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You...

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The Mirror of the House.

202
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The letter of the Ministry of Revenue.

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The previous generation of Crown Prince.

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The Mirror of the House.

205
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What a good man.

206
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He bought a garden

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and gave me a gift.

208
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You are right.

209
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The palace of the Princess

210
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
couldn't be separated

211
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
from the palace of the Minister of Revenue.

212
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's really effective.

213
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Noble Consort Yue was put in a position

214
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
as a judge.

215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The Eastern Palace

216
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
has already died

217
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and prepared to be killed.

218
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Who knew that

219
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
he would be so arrogant

220
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and give the Crown Prince

221
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
such a big ear.

222
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Mei Chang Su?

223
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's this Mei Chang Su again.

224
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He didn't find the garden of the Manjing City.

225
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He found this one.

226
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
He was walking on the road

227
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and fell into the well.

228
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Didn't he do the same to me?

229
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Your Highness, don't be angry.

230
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We have lost the chance.

231
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But it's not a place to return to.

232
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Prince Yu has Shi Jun.

233
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But how can we use it?

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's a difficult question for him.

235
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What do you mean?

236
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
If Prince Yu's surname is Ji,

237
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Shi Jun and Ming Ce will be brought to Yu Qian directly.

238
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's easy.

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I see.

240
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Father is very wise.

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Prince Yu is more anxious

242
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and wants to kill him.

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Then he will think

244
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
it's not that easy.

245
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
How can the Seven Pearls King

246
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
take the case

247
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
and personally control the human and political affairs?

248
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Once His Majesty

249
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
takes this as a fight between Prince Yu and the East Palace,

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
he won't take care of the case.

251
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
In this way,

252
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
maybe the top of the building

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
can still fight for a chance

254
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and not know it.

255
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If Prince Yu thinks it's right,

256
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
then Shi Jun will give it to the Golden Zhaoyin Manor.

257
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If that's the case,

258
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Your Highness,

259
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
we will have to fight hard.

260
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Then we will see

261
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
which house

262
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
the Golden Zhaoyin Manor will buy.

263
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's been two days.

264
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
There's nothing to be worried about.

265
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I've asked the descendant of the Zhang family

266
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
about it.

267
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He doesn't seem to know

268
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
what he wants to ask.

269
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Think about it.

270
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The garden in the capital

271
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
has a dozen female servants

272
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
hidden in the capital.

273
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
They were even transferred by two Shi's servants.

274
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No matter which one,

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
they are all greedy.

276
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Now, this case is in chaos.

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
They just took me there.

278
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
They forced me to break the case.

279
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What about you now?

280
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You only need to find out

281
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
such a few things.

282
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
How can I deal with them?

283
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Your Excellency,

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
we need to find out

285
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
such things.

286
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
We can't wait.

287
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Who is that?

288
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'll go down and take a look.

289
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Do you know

290
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
the name of the garden in the capital

291
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
is not easy to find out?

292
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What's your request?

293
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Come on.

294
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I don't have any requests.

295
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm just asking you.

296
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm just asking you.

297
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm just asking you.

298
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm just asking you.

299
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't have any requests.

300
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
How dare you!

301
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Are you here to take my money?

302
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Guards!

303
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
No, no, no.

304
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm here to investigate.

305
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What are you investigating?

306
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Guards are crying.

307
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
There are three ways to get in this house.

308
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Through the whole house.

309
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
How about it?

310
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Are you satisfied with the place

311
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I chose for you?

312
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Ever since you found out

313
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
the crying and hiding case,

314
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
no one in the capital knows

315
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
that you want to change the house.

316
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I heard that

317
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Prince Yu chose several houses

318
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
to give you as a gift.

319
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You didn't even have one.

320
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You even want to spend money

321
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
to buy the house I recommended?

322
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You're so generous.

323
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You're a generous man.

324
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Who dares not to give you a face?

325
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I came out of the capital

326
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
because I wanted to fight

327
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
with Fei Liu.

328
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Fei Liu.

329
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Fei Liu.

330
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What's wrong with your family?

331
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
They don't want to see you.

332
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Why?

333
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Fei Liu.

334
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Do you like Uncle Meng?

335
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
No.

336
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Why?

337
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Fei Liu can't fight.

338
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You're so young.

339
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You can't afford to have this kind of cultivation.

340
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I heard that

341
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
he defeated Xia Dong

342
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
a while ago.

343
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Your progress

344
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
is too rapid.

345
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
How do you know

346
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
he defeated Xia Dong?

347
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Xia Dong said it himself.

348
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Xia Dong trained

349
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
the new person

350
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
in Xuanjing Temple.

351
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
No one knows that.

352
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Someone said

353
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
if you defeat me

354
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
like Fei Liu,

355
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
you don't need to train.

356
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You've been training for a long time.

357
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You've changed the whole capital.

358
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You don't know that?

359
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Fei Liu.

360
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Someone wants to challenge you.

361
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Come on.

362
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Tell the crown prince to come.

363
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
How did the crown prince

364
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
send the order to the capital?

365
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Stop guessing.

366
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You'll know when you go out.

367
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Wen De's capital

368
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
suddenly posted a crime of crying and hiding.

369
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He was mistaken and was caught.

370
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
He was the crown prince.

371
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
He can't be questioned.

372
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
He ordered to take the high-ranking

373
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
and enter the capital tomorrow.

374
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He was in the process of the crime.

375
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
He was in the process of the crime.

376
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
He was in the process of the crime.

377
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I, Gao Sheng,

378
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
ordered the crown prince to come.

379
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
My lord.

380
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
How did the crown prince

381
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
ask about this case?

382
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's not that simple.

383
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's possible that it's a trap.

384
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Bring the ten soldiers

385
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
to the capital immediately.

386
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Only you and me.

387
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Secretly.

388
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yes.

389
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
How is the house?

390
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Tell me.

391
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's your choice.

392
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Don't think I don't understand what you're saying.

393
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You're making fun of me.

394
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's right.

395
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The scenery of this house is a little bit worse.

396
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But I know your thoughts the best.

397
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I wasted the time

398
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
to find you such a place.

399
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Why didn't you have any courage?

400
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm grateful for what I've done.

401
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's not a great chance.

402
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But I still have to

403
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
fix this garden.

404
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Otherwise, people will think it's weird.

405
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I chose this place

406
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
because I had no choice.

407
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But

408
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm glad that

409
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I've been through a lot.

410
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Brother Meng,

411
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
you know my thoughts the best.

412
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I've found it out by accident.

413
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I said the wall behind this yard

414
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
is so close to the wall

415
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
of Prince Jing's mansion.

416
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's a small area.

417
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
There's no way to get there.

418
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The house is full of trees.

419
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The most important thing

420
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
is that these two houses

421
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
have different access to each other.

422
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If you didn't jump into the air,

423
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
you wouldn't have noticed

424
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
that these two houses

425
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
are in the same neighborhood.

426
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Brother Meng,

427
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
how did you find it?

428
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I found it on the way.

429
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm so worried about you.

430
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's okay. I often jump.

431
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Let me tell you.

432
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
When you find a good man

433
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
in the mansion,

434
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
you can dig a secret passage

435
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
to Prince Jing's mansion.

436
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Prince Jing

437
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
can't meet you

438
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
even if he's not with you.

439
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
He can also

440
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
come to you with this secret passage.

441
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Can you change it?

442
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Shi Jun has entered the Jinzhao Silver Manor.

443
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The operation of the Eastern Palace

444
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
is not slow.

445
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Next,

446
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
let's see how long

447
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Gao Sheng can last

448
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
until he becomes

449
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
a smart man.

450
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Ban Ruo,

451
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I still feel

452
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
uneasy.

453
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Until now,

454
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Mei Changsu has been

455
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
trying to

456
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
serve me.

457
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But the house

458
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
that Prince Jing

459
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
sent to you,

460
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
he didn't take it.

461
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You mean he still has a place

462
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
to stay?

463
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Mei Changsu is different from

464
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
ordinary people.

465
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
In general,

466
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
even if he doesn't choose anyone,

467
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
he should be at least

468
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
guilty.

469
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But after the calculation,

470
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
he seems to be

471
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
not giving

472
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
any respect

473
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
to the house.

474
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The Duke of Qin

475
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
has already made a clear

476
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
and clear statement.

477
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The Princess

478
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
is not in favor of

479
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
the house.

480
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Now,

481
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
the Lan Yuan Cang case,

482
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
although the house

483
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
is the biggest one,

484
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
after all,

485
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
both sides

486
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
are involved.

487
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Could it be that

488
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
he is testing

489
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
the relationship between

490
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Prince Jing and me?

491
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The Lan Yuan Cang case

492
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
was

493
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
discovered by you

494
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
on purpose

495
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
or did you

496
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
make it on purpose?

497
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What do you think?

498
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't know why.

499
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The smarter you are,

500
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
the more worried I am.

501
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I don't know

502
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
what you are thinking.

503
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
For me?

504
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Here.

505
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Eat it.

506
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You don't want to eat it?

507
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm not giving it to you.

508
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Why are you so sour?

509
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That's why I'm giving it to you.

510
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Not only is he testing

511
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
our temperament,

512
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm afraid he still needs

513
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
to show his ability.

514
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
The general's

515
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
attitude

516
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
is always strange.

517
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Recently,

518
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I met a young princess

519
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
who is very old.

520
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
She would like to try it.

521
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's not strange.

522
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That's right.

523
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
If we go to this place,

524
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
the Crown Prince will never

525
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
change his attitude

526
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
and he will be more cautious.

527
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
He will take the mirror of the building

528
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
and show that he is never biased.

529
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Then

530
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
when Mei Changsu is in the heart,

531
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
he will be moved by her.

532
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Once Mei Changsu is used

533
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
by the Eastern Palace,

534
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
he will first make a few contributions

535
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
and make a move on the day.

536
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Then

537
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
we will surely be the first.

538
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
This person has no mind.

539
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
He must not let the Crown Prince

540
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
take the risk.

541
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
If you dare to

542
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
take Mei Changsu

543
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
as your subordinate before the Crown Prince,

544
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
then

545
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
you can be willing to trust him

546
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
with no doubt.

547
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
If you can't even

548
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
remember Mei Changsu,

549
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
what are you talking about?

550
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You are really generous.

551
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Mei Changsu is a coward.

552
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I will give him a chance.

553
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You asked me to meet His Majesty

554
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and ask Prince Jing

555
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
to investigate the case of the Qing State.

556
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Although this matter is done,

557
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I don't feel bad.

558
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You don't feel bad even if I am here.

559
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Of course I am relieved that you are doing this.

560
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I am just worried

561
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
that he will offend people

562
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
no matter what he does.

563
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
He is not allowed to offend people.

564
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It is impossible

565
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
to get into this circle.

566
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It depends on

567
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
whether this case is worth it.

568
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
If we can do this case well,

569
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
we can gain people's hearts.

570
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
We can gain power from the second one.

571
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
We can show

572
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
his talent and ability

573
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
in the third one.

574
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
If we stand far away,

575
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
no one will know

576
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
his existence.

577
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
You must have your reason.

578
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's a good thing to say.

579
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I just told His Majesty

580
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
that I am not bad

581
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
if you teach me.

582
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
He really thought about Prince Jing.

583
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Why?

584
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Because His Majesty

585
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
has no better choice.

586
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And

587
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
he doesn't love Jing Yan that much.

588
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Because he doesn't love Jing Yan,

589
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
he doesn't care

590
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
how many people

591
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
will offend Jing Yan

592
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and how many will be in love.

593
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I didn't put him

594
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
in the mood.

595
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So,

596
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I thought about choosing him.

597
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Since it's so hard,

598
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
you still want him to do it.

599
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
He will always

600
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
step out of this first step.

601
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
But

602
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
once he steps out,

603
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
he can't go back.

604
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Be careful, Mother.

605
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You've been with me for a day.

606
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Don't send me in.

607
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Take a rest.

608
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yes, Mother.

609
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Mr. Su

610
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
was led by Commander Meng

611
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
to come out of the door.

612
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Could you come back?

613
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I've come back early.

614
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You can leave now.

615
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yes.

616
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'll be back.

617
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Go.

618
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Go.

619
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Go.

620
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Who are you?

621
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
How dare you break into my house?

622
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Go.

623
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Stop him.

624
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Go.

625
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Go.

626
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Brother Su.

627
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Brother Su.

628
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Who is it?

629
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Young Master Xiao.

630
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Chief Li.

631
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Where is Brother Su?

632
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Jingrui.

633
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Brother Su.

634
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Are you okay?

635
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm fine.

636
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Jingrui.

637
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Forget it.

638
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Don't look at me.

639
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
No difference

640
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
whether you look at me or not.

641
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Young Master Xiao, you know him, right?

642
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
He's a guard by my father's side.

643
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I didn't expect you would come to see me

644
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
at this late hour.

645
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I suddenly felt a little uneasy.

646
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
So I came to see him.

647
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Now it's quiet outside.

648
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The big mansion

649
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
has such a big movement in the middle of the night.

650
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
No one seems to be able to hear it.

651
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It's snowing.

652
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Snowy like this

653
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
is the most suitable to kill.

654
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
With the snow all night,

655
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
everything can be covered.

656
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
There won't be any snowfall in half a day.

657
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I saw a garden today.

658
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It was introduced by Commander Meng.

659
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
At the Changzhi House,

660
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
the place is still quite spacious.

661
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
So I asked for some.

662
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's good that I can start over.

663
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I'm not afraid of the snow.

664
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's good that I can start over

665
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
and have a rest.

666
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I should move out, too.

667
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Move out?

668
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I should move out.

669
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
The snow road

670
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
can't be stopped.

671
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Jin Rui,

672
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
you didn't come to the snow road this night.

673
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Everything is still like it was before.

674
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
After you go back, don't think about it.

675
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So that your mother won't worry.

676
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Can everything really be like it was before?

677
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I don't want to know why father wanted to kill you.

678
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
But I want to know

679
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
why you have to go into the Jinling's Xuanwo Sect.

680
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You are a...

681
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I...

682
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I envy the most people in the world.

683
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
There are countless people who are free and free.

684
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
There are no free and free people in this world.

685
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
As long as you have the desire

686
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
and the emotion,

687
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
you can't be free and free.

688
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But you can avoid it.

689
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I know you have this ability.

690
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You can...

691
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
It's not me.

692
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Don't make a judgment for me.

693
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'll leave tomorrow morning.

694
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Thank you for taking care of me these days.

695
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
After my heart is settled,

696
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
as long as you are willing,

697
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I will always welcome you.

698
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Just like when we were in Langzhou.

699
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Langzhou at that time?

700
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
As the son of Liangxing,

701
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I always had the power to be outside.

702
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I was free and free.

703
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Come.

704
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
There is no need to be so hard to get over.

705
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Just like the snow outside,

706
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
the more it rains, the bigger it is.

707
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The more it rains, the more it is busy.

708
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
But we all know

709
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
it will stop eventually.

710
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Master,

711
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Young Master Xiao has left.

712
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
For Jingrui,

713
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
this is just a beginning.

714
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I hope he can stop it in the end.

715
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Mr. Shi San is here.

716
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Did you ask him to come?

717
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I haven't seen him for years.

718
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's rare to see snow so quiet today.

719
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Please come in.

720
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Yes.

721
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Mr. Shi San, please.

722
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Mr. Shi San.

723
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
The sky is blowing.

724
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I hope you can see the master today.

725
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Mr. Shi San,

726
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I hope you can see the master today.

727
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But...

728
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But I miss you.

729
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I have no idea how to describe you.

730
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I feel...

731
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I feel so sad.

732
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I feel so sad.

733
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I came to the capital

734
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
to feed the dragon and tiger.

735
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
To make a world.

736
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
You don't have to be so sad.

737
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Although I have already had the honor

738
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
to bring the stars to the sky,

739
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I will remember it.

740
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Please.

741
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Please.

742
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Mr. Shi San,

743
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
these years,

744
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
you and Gong Yu have been in the Miaoying House.

745
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
You have been watching the red embroidered pictures

746
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
for me.

747
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
That's a great help.

748
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I have the honor

749
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
to have you here.

750
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Tell the master.

751
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I am sorry

752
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
for the poor figure.

753
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I am afraid

754
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
she is not the master of Prince Yu.

755
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Sir.

756
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Come in.

757
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Sir, it's late.

758
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Please have a good rest.

759
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Yes.

760
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Sir.

761
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You...

762
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Sir.

763
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
The red embroidered pictures

764
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
were made 30 years ago.

765
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
The Chinese Xuan Ji Princess

766
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
who was killed 30 years ago

767
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
saw it.

768
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
When she died,

769
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
she sent the picture

770
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
to her disciple, Qin Ban Ruo.

771
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The way she handled the hair

772
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
is so old.

773
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
She has the style of the Xuan Ji Princess.

774
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Princess Xuan Ji used

775
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
the internal organs

776
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
to control the court.

777
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Qin Ban Ruo is the same.

778
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Did you find out

779
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
which people

780
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
have been controlled by her?

781
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
There are 15 people at present.

782
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
The machine of the court

783
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
is under her.

784
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
She is also

785
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
very well-informed

786
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
in all parts of the intelligence network.

787
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
But the public

788
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
has successfully

789
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
searched our people

790
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
on her website.

791
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
As long as the assistant

792
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
orders,

793
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
13 people are confident

794
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
to destroy her power.

795
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
No need.

796
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Qin Ban Ruo is

797
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
a very useful pawn.

798
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I must keep it.

799
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Perhaps it is not convenient

800
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
to send the message to Prince Yu directly.

801
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
She will send it.

802
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Tian Qian's secret

803
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
is what she told Prince Yu.

804
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
If Qin Ban Ruo is smart and clever,

805
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
she will be very secretive.

806
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Only because I am in the dark

807
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
and she is in the dark,

808
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
I can control her in the situation.

809
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
In the future,

810
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
if you want to give her the message,

811
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
the internal organs

812
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
must be cautious.

813
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I cannot be careless.

814
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Yes.

815
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So,

816
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
you are Prince Yu's person.

817
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I am sorry.

818
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I understand

819
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
what Prince Yu said.

820
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But...

821
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Lord Gao.

822
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You misunderstood.

823
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I came to visit you

824
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
not for Prince Yu,

825
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
but for you, Lord Gao.

826
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
For me?

827
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Lord Gao

828
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
has been in the dark

829
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
and hidden in the dark.

830
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
But there are two reasons.

831
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Why not try to retreat?

832
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Maybe there is another world.

833
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Lord Gao,

834
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
you are so concerned about this case.

835
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
How can I retreat?

836
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
You are a very good person.

837
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Since you have the royal army,

838
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
and you have asked the people,

839
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
then

840
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
is it not easy

841
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
to do the next thing?

842
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It's just a person.

843
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
How can I deal with it?

844
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Whether it's easy or not,

845
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
you should think about it.

846
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Of course, you will understand.

847
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
As long as you can

848
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
deal with this case,

849
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I think even if

850
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
you are in trouble,

851
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I am afraid

852
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
he will have no other choice.

853
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
The moon is full.

854
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I will be the wind.

855
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I will send you to the Ministry of Justice.

856
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
The fire in the fire

857
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
will not be thrown out.

858
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Will it stay in the east?

859
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It's very dark.

860
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It's snowing heavily outside.

861
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Uncle Shisan,

862
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
you should go back.

863
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Since I am in the capital,

864
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
we will meet again.

865
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
The little master is in the capital.

866
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
He must be unable to sleep.

867
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
This is the sleeping box

868
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
that Gong Yu has been in for a few months.

869
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
He asked me to bring it here

870
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
to help me.

871
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I hope you

872
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
don't mind him.

873
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I will share the money

874
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
with him.

875
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It will be a good dream.

876
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Put it down.

877
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Thank Gong Yu for me.

878
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Okay.

879
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Okay.

880
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Then,

881
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I will take my leave.

882
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Goodbye.

883
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Miss Gong Yu is the most considerate to you.

884
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I always think of you...

885
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Go to sleep.

886
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
The fire in the fire

887
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
will not be thrown out.

888
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Will it stay in the east?

889
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Will it stay in the east?

890
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Will it stay in the east?

891
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Will it stay in the east?

892
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Will it stay in the east?

893
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Will it stay in the east?

894
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Will it stay in the east?

895
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Will it stay in the east?

896
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Will it stay in the east?

897
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Will it stay in the east?

898
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Will it stay in the east?

899
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Will it stay in the east?

900
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Will it stay in the east?

901
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Will it stay in the east?

902
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Will it stay in the east?

903
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Will it stay in the east?

904
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Will it stay in the east?

905
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Will it stay in the east?

906
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Will it stay in the east?

907
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Will it stay in the east?

908
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Will it stay in the east?

909
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Will it stay in the east?

910
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Will it stay in the east?

911
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Will it stay in the east?

912
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Will it stay in the east?

913
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Will it stay in the east?

914
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Will it stay in the east?

915
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Will it stay in the east?

916
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Will it stay in the east?

917
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Will it stay in the east?

918
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Will it stay in the east?

919
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Will it stay in the east?

920
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Will it stay in the east?

921
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Will it stay in the east?

922
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Will it stay in the east?

923
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Will it stay in the east?

924
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Will it stay in the east?

925
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Will it stay in the east?
