00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The first time I saw a man with a black hat, I thought he was a man with a black hat.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I thought he was a man with a black hat, but I thought he was a man with a black hat.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I thought he was a man with a black hat, but I thought he was a man with a black hat.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I thought he was a man with a black hat, but I thought he was a man with a black hat.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I thought he was a man with a black hat, but I thought he was a man with a black hat.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I thought he was a man with a black hat, but I thought he was a man with a black hat.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I thought he was a man with a black hat, but I thought he was a man with a black hat.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I thought he was a man with a black hat, but I thought he was a man with a black hat.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I thought he was a man with a black hat, but I thought he was a man with a black hat.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I thought he was a man with a black hat, but I thought he was a man with a black hat.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I thought he was a man with a black hat, but I thought he was a man with a black hat.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I thought he was a man with a black hat, but I thought he was a man with a black hat.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I thought he was a man with a black hat, but I thought he was a man with a black hat.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I thought he was a man with a black hat, but I thought he was a man with a black hat.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I thought he was a man with a black hat, but I thought he was a man with a black hat.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Episode 1

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Brother Su, no matter what you discuss with my father today,

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and what my father will do,

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think he has his own reason.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Please come in.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Father, I will leave first.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Wait.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Please sit down.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No matter what you discuss with me today,

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
you can listen to me.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now that the crown prince is in a bad mood,

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Prince Yu is finally in the royal court.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He is in a good mood.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why does he look so angry and upset?

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Brother Su is an old man. He will return to the Eastern Courtyard soon.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You are so young.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You are actually an old man.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's because you are young and don't know how to take care of yourself.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You are also worried.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's really hard for you.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You are not feeling well,

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
but you still have to come out and take Prince Yu's side.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's really hard.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You just said that Prince Yu is a good man.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Is it true?

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
How can it be not true?

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You have been in the court for decades.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Besides being afraid of the law,

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
you are also not able to take care of yourself.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
How is Prince Yu now?

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Can't others see it?

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Can't you see it, Your Highness?

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The crown prince is in a bad mood.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Prince Yu feels lonely and wants to look for another opponent.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Your Highness, please.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Mr. Su,

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you were always there when you were in the first place.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But I said that Prince Yu and the crown prince are not like me.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I will not help anyone.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I hope that Mr. Su will not forget what I said.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I remember what you said.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's just that we have been in the same situation.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Now that Prince Yu is in a bad mood,

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
the real opponent is no longer the crown prince.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I will not help Prince Yu to deal with the crown prince.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I will not help Prince Yu to deal with Prince Jin.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I haven't finished yet.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
How can you decide that I will ask you to help Prince Yu today?

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's Prince Yu.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Isn't it to help Prince Yu to deal with Prince Jin?

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I came to visit my father.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Do you want to help Prince Jin?

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You are willing to do so?

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,920
You are moreα

70
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,000
Thanks!

83
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,780
Under this situation, Prince Jin has no right to Prince Yu.

84
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,180
My Anju mansion is considered a rich and virtuous man.

85
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,380
But you let me enter a battle of no right.

86
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,380
Yes.

87
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,580
I am the empress of today.

88
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,580
Prince Yu is the empress's son.

89
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,380
You let me help Prince Jin deal with Prince Yu and Qin Li.

90
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,580
Indeed.

91
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,180
If Qin Li is not with Qin Li, there is no right to him.

92
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,380
Why do you ask me this?

93
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,380
My Lord.

94
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,380
Are you willing to do so?

95
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,980
I am willing.

96
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,780
Your Highness, this place is used by the summer emperor.

97
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,580
It's really cold in winter.

98
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,780
Although the time is not right,

99
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,780
but this place is a good place for a private meeting.

100
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,180
Are you sure Xia Jiang will come?

101
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,380
Your Highness, I am sure he will come.

102
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,980
No matter what Xia Jiang and your master are,

103
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,580
if it's not for Prince Jin,

104
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,180
how can Xuan Jing Si come to the private meeting with the prince of the battle?

105
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,580
It's not for me.

106
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,580
No matter what, as long as he is willing to come.

107
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,580
Thank you for your willingness.

108
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,180
The choice I made just now, you didn't think it was a surprise.

109
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,180
My Lord, you were born in the family of Zan Ying.

110
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,980
You were a great man back then.

111
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,980
You are so hot-blooded. How could you become cold-blooded?

112
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,180
I am not cold-blooded. I am just a little cold.

113
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,780
It's because you are so cold-blooded to His Majesty, Crown Prince and Prince Yu.

114
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,380
I know that you will definitely agree.

115
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,980
Yu Jin.

116
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,980
Father, I don't understand how the court will be.

117
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,580
But I am born in the family of Yan.

118
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,980
I can be kind and I can be concubine.

119
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,780
As for Father, why did you agree to Mr. Su?

120
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,180
I understand.

121
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,380
I made such a decision today.

122
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,380
I don't know if I will be successful in the future.

123
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,780
If something goes wrong,

124
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,780
we will be blood-sucking together.

125
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,980
It's hard for us to get in touch with you.

126
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,080
Father, even if we are blood-sucking together,

127
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,780
why do we have to talk about it and get in touch with each other?

128
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,780
Father will follow any of my decisions.

129
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,780
I will never regret it.

130
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,180
Yan family.

131
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,980
Three emperors and two servants have passed.

132
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,580
Some things have already been cleared and no need to be discussed.

133
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,980
Yu Jin, you may not be able to make a move,

134
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,380
but your eyes and chest are not ordinary and peaceful.

135
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,780
Please rest assured, Father.

136
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,380
I will do my best not to let you both get into the danger zone.

137
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,380
A man's life is like a piece of paper.

138
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,180
There is nothing else to worry about.

139
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,380
If you need anything, please tell me.

140
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,180
The situation between Prince of Jing and Prince Yu is already clear.

141
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,780
I fear that the people will be convinced by the court.

142
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,380
According to Prince of Jing's information,

143
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,580
Prince of Yu and Prince Yu will not be able to win.

144
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,580
The party will be in danger.

145
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,780
The party will be in danger.

146
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,580
The party will be in danger.

147
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,780
The party will be in danger.

148
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,580
But...

149
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,380
I understand.

150
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,580
Although Prince of Jing is unwilling to fight,

151
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,980
the court has its own ideas.

152
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,980
We should know them in time.

153
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,780
Now, the government is in a hurry.

154
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,180
If Prince of Jing and Mr. Su have any inconvenience,

155
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,580
I will take you two to investigate.

156
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,580
If you investigate well, you will be able to stop the matter.

157
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,180
No one will be able to see you.

158
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,180
Prince of Jing will be greatly concerned about your help.

159
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,180
You are too much.

160
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,580
I was just not aware of your intention.

161
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,780
I want to ask you something.

162
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:07,580
Was Mr. Su the old man in Prince of Qi's Mansion?

163
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,180
Father, why did you ask so suddenly?

164
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,380
Why was he the old man in Prince of Qi's Mansion?

165
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,780
Prince of Qi was in his mansion more than ten years ago.

166
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,780
Isn't that already...

167
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,180
Yes.

168
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,380
The question just now was indeed a bit too much.

169
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,180
But I really can't figure it out.

170
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,180
What other reasons can you help Prince of Jing?

171
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,580
I have no idea.

172
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,780
It's probably all the reason.

173
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,180
Although I only have two sides with you,

174
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,980
but based on my observation,

175
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,380
you are too small.

176
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,980
It's not your own decision.

177
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,580
I'm over the moon.

178
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,980
You are too much.

179
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,180
You are too much.

180
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,780
You are too much.

181
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,380
Of course, you won't be able to see it.

182
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,780
I'm thinking about it carefully.

183
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,780
It's only possible because of the past.

184
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,180
I once was a young man who was raised by the Emperor.

185
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,180
I was born in Prince of Qi's Mansion.

186
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,180
I was never able to save myself today.

187
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,180
That's why I have the current Meichang Su.

188
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,180
That's all.

189
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,180
I was too much.

190
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,180
I was too much.

191
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,180
I was just asking casually.

192
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,180
I was too much.

193
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,780
I was just asking casually.

194
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,780
Please don't mind me.

195
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,980
What's the matter?

196
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,180
If he doesn't come, we don't have to wait.

197
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,180
If you still have the patience to disturb the Emperor,

198
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,180
you won't be in a hurry.

199
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,580
How many Emperor's wealth can there be?

200
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,380
How many can you really give back to me?

201
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,780
As long as the Second Battle is on, I will know how long it takes.

202
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,780
Is Xia Jiang able to do it?

203
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,780
It seems that Prince of Yu isn't confident enough with me.

204
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,980
The next one will come.

205
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:22,800
Viz

206
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,160
And I...

207
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,400
As long as I help you get rid of Prince Jing,

208
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,240
the position of the Crown Prince is not yours.

209
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,240
It's yours, too.

210
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,480
The most trusted and trusted Prince of Liliang,

211
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,800
Xuanjing Si,

212
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,360
as long as he comes to the throne,

213
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,560
I'm sure he won't be an exception.

214
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,280
With Prince Yu and Xia Shouze joining hands,

215
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,600
what's the point of the world?

216
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,760
Father,

217
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
since many years,

218
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:11,040
it's been devoted to the

219
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:11,200
Great Treasures and the Hall ofñasal and Yu

220
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,680
by Qing,

221
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,720
and all myogic have all been drawn up into

222
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,240
cuisines.

223
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,640
Oddly enough,

224
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,000
what has Talismans been done

225
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,260
By the offence of игры The

226
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:45,160
Skeleton king's weakness has been

227
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Since we are now helpless,

228
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
we should naturally make some mistakes first.

229
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You really have a way.

230
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It seems that you already have the opportunity to open the old world.

231
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Chief, you are tired today.

232
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You should rest early.

233
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Since Tong Lu is here, let him come in and say something.

234
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
If there is nothing urgent, you will handle it.

235
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I will go to sleep.

236
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Let him in.

237
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes.

238
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Come in, Tong Lu.

239
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I saw you, Chief.

240
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The cold air in this body,

241
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
go ahead and heat it up.

242
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I have been too anxious to stay in the cold air.

243
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Chief, please try to cool it down.

244
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm not afraid.

245
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Let's have a cup of hot tea first.

246
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Okay.

247
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What are you looking for?

248
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Be careful.

249
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's okay.

250
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Chief, there is not much to do today.

251
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I came here with 13,000 soldiers.

252
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Only two things will be reported to the chief.

253
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
After Xie Yu was arrested,

254
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
the police has been sending people to follow him.

255
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Recently, there have been several attacks on the secret police.

256
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But they are not too cruel.

257
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Maybe they have been too greedy to be a detective.

258
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
As long as Princess Liyang is still holding the gun,

259
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I dare not let Xie Yu die easily.

260
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Princess Liyang,

261
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
you should arrange more people and take care of her.

262
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You must make Prince Jin's patrol camp

263
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
strengthen the defense of Princess' Mansion.

264
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Now Jingrui is not with her.

265
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You should be more careful.

266
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What about the second thing?

267
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
13,000 soldiers have been found out.

268
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The wife of Nian Feng, Xia Dong,

269
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
has not been in the capital for the past few months.

270
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
She has gone to Jiaxing Pass.

271
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Jiaxing Pass is not ready to be arrested.

272
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Xie Yu has been the left-hand general.

273
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
She was in the prison seven years ago.

274
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Xia Dong must be looking into it.

275
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Do you know the case of Wei Qi?

276
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But before Mrs. Nian arrived at Jiaxing Pass,

277
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Wei Qi suddenly left the house.

278
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Did you find out who killed her?

279
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It should be Xuanjing Si Dan.

280
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Actually, when Xie Yu was arrested,

281
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Wei Qi was not there.

282
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
There were not many internal emotions.

283
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Xia Jiang even wanted to kill her.

284
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I really don't want to let Xia Dong know.

285
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Xia Jiang is indeed a wise man.

286
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Although Dong Jie did not show any interest,

287
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
he still has a doubt.

288
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Fortunately, Xia Jiang only knew that

289
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
he had a doubt about this disciple.

290
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
He did not know that he had heard

291
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Xie Yu's confession.

292
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Otherwise, I'm afraid he would not have been so gentle.

293
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Dong Jie's safety.

294
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You should be more careful.

295
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes.

296
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Tong Lu, if there is nothing else,

297
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
you should go back early.

298
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Tell Mr. Shisan that

299
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Qing Ban Ruo will not give up easily

300
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
and let him be careless.

301
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes.

302
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What's wrong?

303
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Say something.

304
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Chief, do you think that

305
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Tong Lu seems to be in a bad mood recently?

306
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What's wrong?

307
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I think she seems to have been very alert recently.

308
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
She has been here every time.

309
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
She always wants to stay for a while.

310
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
She feels very busy these days.

311
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
She is in a hurry to leave.

312
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
She is different from before.

313
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What do you think?

314
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Do you think something is wrong?

315
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I don't think anything is wrong.

316
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But Zhen Ping is always

317
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
able to see where others can't see.

318
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Zhen Ping is always careful.

319
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If there is anything wrong,

320
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
there must be some reason.

321
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Let Mr. Shisan pay more attention.

322
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yes.

323
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Alright.

324
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's so late.

325
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You're still here.

326
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
פר one path to the wall,

327
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Li Zhi also from it.

328
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Xiang Zhen is waiting you.

329
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You're not...

330
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You think it's annoying?

331
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You know it's not.

332
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Thank you for waiting for me.

333
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
If I don't like you every day,

334
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I feel empty in my heart.

335
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You must be busy today.

336
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You're back so late.

337
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I thought you must be hungry.

338
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'll go and get some food for you.

339
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yunniang.

340
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
My marriage is my uncle's.

341
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll tell him tomorrow.

342
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I want to marry you.

343
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm not a widow.

344
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Your uncle...

345
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
He's not my uncle.

346
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Can your uncle agree with our marriage?

347
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
My uncle is not a person who is jealous.

348
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Besides,

349
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
he knows you.

350
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
How did he know me?

351
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
When you moved to this street,

352
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I told him you were fine.

353
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He said you were fine.

354
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I think my uncle will be a little upset.

355
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
But in the end, he will agree.

356
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'll listen to you.

357
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Greetings, Master.

358
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Tell me.

359
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
After Master Xia Dong left Jiaxingguan,

360
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
he went to Lingjiang Manor for three days.

361
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
He didn't contact anyone.

362
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Then he went south.

363
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What happened next?

364
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
He broke his record.

365
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
He just chased after him.

366
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
He didn't move.

367
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
How could he lose his memory?

368
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Master, please don't be angry.

369
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Master Xia Dong is the head of the capital.

370
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's hard to compare.

371
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Give me the Yan family in the capital.

372
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
If he's ready to return to the capital,

373
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
report to me immediately.

374
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Yes.

375
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
How is Princess Li Yang doing?

376
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Princess Li Yang has been doing two magic tricks

377
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
for Empress Dowager and Empress Dowager.

378
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Xie Qi has done two magic tricks.

379
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
She is almost out of control.

380
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Xun Fangying has also strengthened

381
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
the situation near the Palace.

382
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I didn't find the right opportunity to do it.

383
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Xie Yu was just released.

384
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
If Li Yang is in trouble at this time,

385
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm afraid His Majesty will think

386
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
that someone did it on purpose.

387
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You first stop.

388
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Watch the head of the Palace.

389
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yes, Your Highness.

390
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Go.

391
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Yes.

392
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Since I came here today

393
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
to join Your Highness,

394
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I should be able to get something.

395
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I can't give up the 13 years ago

396
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
such a report.

397
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
But if I do it,

398
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I can't wait to return to the capital

399
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
with a wrong hand.

400
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I'll let it fall into the ancient land again.

401
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Master Xia, you are so confident.

402
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You are so confident.

403
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You can see that you are not

404
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
a small thing.

405
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Please give me a chance.

406
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Do you remember

407
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
the young master of the Lin Mansion

408
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
who was in charge of the test?

409
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
How can I forget?

410
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
In the capital,

411
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
who else could cover the

412
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
wind of that genius young master,

413
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
and he finally had a solution.

414
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I think it's too much.

415
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
There are two vice generals around the Lin Mansion.

416
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Do you remember them?

417
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't remember them.

418
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I think they have a surname Wei.

419
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Wei Zheng.

420
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
The test was not solved

421
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
by the secret guard.

422
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Whether it's the Lin Mansion or his vice general,

423
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
they should have been punished.

424
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
When the test was over,

425
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I, Feng Sheng Ming,

426
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
was also the one who was in charge.

427
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Although the situation at that time

428
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
was the most clear,

429
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
there were 18 generals under the Lin Xie camp.

430
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It was almost considered

431
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
to be full of military service.

432
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But the body was severely damaged.

433
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It was hard to distinguish.

434
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Among the people who participated in the test,

435
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
even the test guards

436
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
couldn't find any of them.

437
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
One of them was Wei Zheng.

438
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I suspect that

439
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
this criminal Wei Zheng

440
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
escaped.

441
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm not sure.

442
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Wei Zheng is still alive.

443
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Where is he now?

444
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Your Highness, have you heard of the Western Mirror Medicine Valley?

445
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
The Medicine Valley master, Su Tian Shu,

446
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
was ranked seventh in the Langya Fughao Sect.

447
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
The world has so many medicines.

448
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
How would I not know?

449
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Su Tian Shu has a meaning

450
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
that he never knew.

451
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
He started to deal with the Medicine Valley

452
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
recently.

453
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
His name is Su Xuan.

454
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Have you heard of it?

455
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
That's a bit of a question.

456
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Although the young master of the Medicine Valley

457
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
didn't think much about it,

458
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
he married a family of doctors.

459
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
The Yun family's daughter, Yun Piao Liao,

460
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
is a good girl.

461
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Even in the palace,

462
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
there are many people talking about it.

463
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The so-called great cause

464
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
is the central cause of the court.

465
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Su Xuan has such a identity

466
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
and has the soul of this person.

467
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
He has blinded Xuan Jing Si's eyes.

468
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I haven't noticed him in these years.

469
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Is Su Xuan

470
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Wei Zheng?

471
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Good.

472
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Good.

473
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
You're not dead yet.

474
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
You're still alive.

475
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
This is just a Heaven's help.

476
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Where is this person now?

477
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Wei Zheng

478
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
is a god of medicine.

479
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
His speed is fast.

480
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
The Medicine Valley can't be controlled.

481
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
So I sent someone to check

482
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
the time when he went out

483
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
to give the medicine.

484
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I asked the little disciple to go down the hill

485
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
to get the clothes.

486
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
There will be news about this in a few days.

487
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That means

488
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
we can't

489
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
determine whether Wei Zheng is able to catch him.

490
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
What's wrong, Your Highness?

491
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Don't you believe Xuan Jing Si's ability?

492
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
He's still recovering.

493
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
The next few days

494
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
will be very dangerous.

495
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
From now on,

496
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
close the door and close the door.

497
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
No matter who comes,

498
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
don't see him again.

499
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
The wind is so strong.

500
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
It seems that the snow outside

501
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
is not small.

502
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
People who are still

503
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
in the outside world

504
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
might not be able to handle it.

505
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
The words you just said

506
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
are very confident.

507
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Maybe this snow

508
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
hasn't stopped yet.

509
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Wei Zheng,

510
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm afraid you can't

511
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
handle it.

512
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm afraid you can't.

513
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
If the snow hasn't stopped yet,

514
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Wei Zheng will be able to catch up.

515
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I personally made

516
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
the plan to stop Wei Zheng.

517
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
He sent Xuan Jing Si to be more experienced.

518
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
He's definitely not going to fail.

519
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
No one is thinking

520
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
to touch him before he enters the capital.

521
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It's been a long time since he's been reported.

522
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Fan Ruo,

523
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
when Wei Zheng is in the capital,

524
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
how are you going to use this

525
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
to help Prince Jing?

526
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'd like to hear your opinion first.

527
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Although Wei Zheng is

528
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
a good opportunity to start an old case,

529
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
he still has nothing to do

530
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
with Prince Jing.

531
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
If you want to take Wei Zheng to be a witness,

532
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
you should first make a confession to him.

533
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
He said he has been

534
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
secretly protecting Prince Jing.

535
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
There's a reason

536
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
to put Prince Jing in this case.

537
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I'm afraid he can't.

538
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
If it's someone else,

539
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
maybe His Majesty won't give him

540
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
a chance to make a confession.

541
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It's a matter of time.

542
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
What's Prince Jing's identity?

543
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
If he wants to hide the criminal,

544
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
it's not enough to make a confession.

545
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Besides, it's fake.

546
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
If His Majesty wants to

547
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
personally interrogate Wei Zheng,

548
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
it's a big deal.

549
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Uncle Xia,

550
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Prince Jing and Uncle Lin

551
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
were close.

552
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You said that Wei Zheng has been running away for years.

553
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Could it be that Prince Jing

554
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
really helped Prince Jing?

555
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
If I can find out

556
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
the traces of Wei Zheng and Prince Jing

557
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
that were connected,

558
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
we don't need to discuss it here.

559
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Prince Jing doesn't know that Wei Zheng is still alive.

560
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I've confirmed this.

561
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It's really hard to do that.

562
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
He caught Wei Zheng,

563
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
but only caught a fugitive.

564
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
He's not a good man.

565
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
How can he pull Prince Jing in?

566
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I think we have an idea.

567
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Since that's the case,

568
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
we don't need to sell the coffin.

569
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Tell us the truth.

570
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Isn't that better?

571
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Prince Yu,

572
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Prince Jing is your brother.

573
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I don't know

574
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
how much you know about him.

575
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
What do you mean by that?

576
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Prince Jing doesn't know

577
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
that Wei Zheng is still alive.

578
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Until now,

579
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
we can't catch any of his men.

580
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Right?

581
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's hard to find out.

582
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
What about after that?

583
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
After Prince Jing knows

584
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
that Wei Zheng is still alive

585
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
and is in our hands,

586
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
what will he do

587
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
to know Prince Jing?

588
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I can't help but

589
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
save him.

590
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Exactly.

591
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Your Majesty,

592
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I can't sleep.

593
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I have a good night's sleep.

594
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Your Majesty,

595
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
close your eyes.

596
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You're so kind.

597
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'll go to bed.

598
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'll go to bed.

599
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I'll go to bed.

600
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I'll go to bed.

601
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I'll go to bed.

602
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I'll go to bed.

603
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I'll go to bed.

604
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I'll go to bed.

605
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I'll go to bed.

606
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Last night,

607
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I dreamed of the Empress Dowager.

608
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Last night, I dreamed of the Empress Dowager.

609
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And...

610
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
The day after tomorrow is the day after tomorrow.

611
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
The day after tomorrow is the day after tomorrow.

612
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Your Majesty,

613
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I dreamt of him

614
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
and I think he's still

615
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
in heaven.

616
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Your Majesty,

617
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I dreamt of him

618
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
and I also Sixth Prince

619
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Scientific diagnosing

620
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,000
since the给的

621
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
have been archero journey.

622
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
It was a dream.

623
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
According to the rules,

624
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
You are so kind.

625
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
You are dangerous.

626
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Bring me the high tent.

627
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I have prepared it long ago.

628
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's so cold.

629
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
The imperial court is not as good as the palace.

630
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Your Majesty,

631
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
you should take good care of yourself.

632
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You should know

633
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
that I am a good person.

634
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I am a good person.

635
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I am a good person.

636
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You are considerate of me.

637
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
How can you not considerate of His Majesty?

638
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I heard that the Empress is in trouble.

639
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
The Empress is in charge of the six palaces.

640
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
She is in charge of the six palaces.

641
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
She has the right to teach the imperial edict.

642
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
How can she be in trouble?

643
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You are so kind.

644
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
You are a good person.

645
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The Empress is the Empress after all.

646
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
If she is not too good,

647
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
you are far away from her.

648
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You can bear to bear it.

649
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
But if you can't bear it,

650
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
you should tell me.

651
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Although it's not true,

652
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
but hearing His Majesty say this,

653
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I feel so grateful.

654
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
You are so kind.

655
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
It's been more than 30 years.

656
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It's not a big change.

657
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
If she can be like you,

658
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
how good would it be?

659
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
But she was born

660
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
and she is the one who is in the palace.

661
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I am not sure.

662
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Have you ever dreamed of her?

663
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I have never dreamed of Her Majesty.

664
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
You know that

665
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I am not talking about Her Majesty.

666
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I have never dreamed of her for the past few years.

667
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But this time,

668
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
she is standing by the Empress Dowager's side.

669
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Have you ever dreamed of her?

670
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Tell me.

671
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,000
What is she like in your dream?

672
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
She is still the same as before.

673
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
She is standing under the plum blossom tree.

674
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
She is not talking.

675
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
She is always smiling at me.

676
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,500
PrincessOULD

677
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Let me just say that

678
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,020
Her Majesty is sincere,

679
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,000
very skillful and kind.

680
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,600
YiJingYan will not show her aperture as well.

681
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Although we have met

682
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,720
If he doesn't have any more tricks,

683
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,880
but as long as he does something,

684
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,440
we can make it work.

685
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,000
If we can do that,

686
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
it's good.

687
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,840
But I don't know why

688
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm always worried.

689
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,840
Worry what?

690
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,880
Prince Jing is in the imperial court now.

691
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,680
His Majesty is very grateful to him.

692
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,800
He's very kind.

693
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
But he doesn't know what to say.

694
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,200
He's just a little father who was with Uncle Lin

695
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,280
and he's just a little child.

696
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,600
With Prince Jing's position now,

697
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,560
he's just a little character who doesn't care about the situation.

698
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,120
Is he going to take the risk of being a traitor

699
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,400
and anger His Majesty?

700
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,520
You don't know that Prince Jing is so born-to-be.

701
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,480
He didn't do such a stupid thing before.

702
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,880
Prince Jing's mood is also very weak.

703
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,040
It's just that he saved Wei Zheng from Prince Jing.

704
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,040
But once he loses,

705
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,920
all his good deeds will be gone.

706
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,280
Li Bi De's situation is so different.

707
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,360
Could it be that Prince Jing really won't hesitate?

708
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,640
What Wen Ruo said is not completely reasonable.

709
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,080
Now Prince Jing is not the prince who was out of the state.

710
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,600
He has the power to fight.

711
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,920
He might not be willing to risk his life

712
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,600
to take the risk of losing.

713
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,000
Prince Yu,

714
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,920
it seems that you don't know enough about yourself.

715
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,640
Don't worry.

716
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,880
I have some other things to do.

717
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,960
I have some eyes to look at.

718
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,080
The reason why I'm sitting in front of you today is

719
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,360
because Xiao Jing Yan is such a person.

720
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,640
He won't change.

721
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,280
The eyes of the next generation will surely not be wrong.

722
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,400
But you have lost someone.

723
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,000
Who?

724
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,480
Jiang Zuo Meilang.

725
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,680
Is that so-called Qilin talents?

726
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,560
I, Xia Shouzun, owe this Qilin talent to Xiao.

727
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,640
Prince Jing is now all thanks to him.

728
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:50,000
Even if Prince Jing is still so stubborn and unresolved,

729
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,600
Mei Changsu is definitely not the person who is thinking about it.

730
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,000
When he sees Wei Zheng's case, he is only a shadow.

731
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,160
As long as Prince Jing doesn't touch him, he won't be in danger.

732
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,280
That Mei Changsu will definitely not let Prince Jing act rashly.

733
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,040

734
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,520
If you want to deal with Mei Changsu, it's hard.

735
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,840
Unless...

736
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,480
Unless Prince Jing doesn't want to listen to the advice of Mei Changsu.

737
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:05,680
The sword, the farewell, the red eyes

738
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:12,680

When we look up and look up

746

The кредition is regret

748
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,940
But there are signs of a rough past

749
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,340
The禁 Meetings can't be separated

750
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,340
