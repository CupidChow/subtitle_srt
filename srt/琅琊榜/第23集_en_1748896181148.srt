00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 1

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Xia Jiang is really loyal to father.

3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's why I really don't understand

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
why he wants to jump out and think of Xie Yu first.

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What if Xie Yu does something for him?

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It must be him.

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He is really a god.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What's the relationship between Xia Jiang and Xie Yu?

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It must be Xie Yu who has some tricks in Xia Jiang.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Xia Jiang is loyal to Xie Yu.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Xie Yu is not strict with his words.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's a deal.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's definitely a deal they made when they met in the prison.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't be so excited, Your Highness.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I just have a plan.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If I want to investigate, I must go ask them in person.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You want to ask Xie Yu yourself?

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Your Highness, there are some things in the prison.

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Can you help me arrange it?

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's not hard.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But it's the heart of the Chai Lang.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's important to keep it safe.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm afraid it's not right to say anything.

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Then what should I say?

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Master.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Dong Er, what else do you want to do these days?

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm afraid to be against your orders.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He's really in the prison these days.

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I know you brothers are in a good relationship.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Don't even try to fool me.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't dare.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Dong Er, you're not sure.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You should look after him more.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
His Majesty is in a bad mood recently.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You should let him stay here.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't make trouble for me.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, right.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When will Qiu Er come back?

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He wanted to tell me about the news a few days ago.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He said things were going to be very fast.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Master, what's wrong?

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I always feel that someone is here.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Someone?

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No one?

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Master, you can rest assured.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
There's a master in Xuanjing Temple.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think even if he's the master of Lang Ya Gang,

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
he wouldn't dare to come here easily.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Don't be so heartless, okay?

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm the one who's in the prison now.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Chunxiu.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Why are you here?

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Did no one find you?

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Do you want to go back to your letter?

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Tell Mr. Su that I'll go.

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Come.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay.

60
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We're in the prison.

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The person who came in from that door

62
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
was never a big person before.

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But they were the famous Taoists who went through the prison.

64
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
How many people didn't cry, Father and Mother?

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
From Master Guan to the next door.

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's weird.

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But some people didn't cry.

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Look over there.

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That Han Zi Hao, the official emperor.

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Now, although it's a long-term war,

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
a few years ago,

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
the eldest son, Prince Qi,

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
was just in there.

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Father, have you seen him?

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I have.

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You're a hero.

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Mr. Su, come in.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Come in.

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Han Dan Dan.

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Is it here?

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This is Han Zi Hao,

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
the official emperor.

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is the prison.

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Please, Mr. Su.

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let me hear you mention Prince Qi.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Be careful. I'll break your bones.

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Please be careful, Mr. Su.

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If the cause is not careful,

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I can't explain to Prince Yu.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Please.

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Mr. Su, this is the room.

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Please change yourself.

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll wait outside.

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's Master An's turn.

95
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Wait outside.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Please.

97
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Thank you, sir.

98
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's been a while.

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Why haven't you seen him for half a month?

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You don't recognize him?

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Of course I do.

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
When you first came to the capital,

103
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
you didn't live in my house

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
as a guest?

105
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes.

106
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yes.

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It was the first time I saw you.

108
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You were so beautiful.

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You were so handsome.

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The imperial court's position

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
was so unbearable.

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So you came today

113
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
to give me a chance

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
to live in the capital.

115
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is not a good idea.

116
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm so busy today.

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I can't bear to die.

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't you think

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
you're a petty person

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
who's been chasing after you?

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You know

122
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
that there are petty people in the world.

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're not a petty person.

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But what's wrong with you?

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We all know

126
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
that when the wind blows,

127
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
every arrow is on the mountain.

128
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You've been on the road.

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Now you're fighting with your life

130
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
to save your life.

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But you're just

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
protecting the Xia River.

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why are you laughing?

134
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm so anxious.

135
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Mr. Wang Xiao

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
has mentioned the Xia River so quickly.

137
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Have you

138
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
not been able to

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
make any decisions?

140
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Prince Yu can't do it.

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Otherwise,

142
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
you won't be

143
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
in the trouble

144
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
of your own life.

145
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I came to visit my lord.

146
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
How can I call you a criminal?

147
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm sure you can't

148
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
bear to think

149
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
how you're going to lose to me.

150
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Am I right?

151
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You must want to know

152
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
which step you've made wrong.

153
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Which step you've lost.

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
How can you

155
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
develop

156
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
to such a level?

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You've been in the deep of your heart.

158
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You've become a petty person

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
who's been chasing after you.

160
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Actually, you don't have to think too much.

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I came here today

162
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
to tell you

163
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
how you've lost to me.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The reason you lost to me

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
is because you're stupid.

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I...

167
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Because I'm smarter than you.

168
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What are you thinking?

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I can see it all, but if you turn around,

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
you can't see through me.

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
How could you not lose?

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And in the end,

173
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
you don't even know how to lose.

174
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Isn't that stupid?

175
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
By the way,

176
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
do you know that there's another person who's smarter than you?

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Xia Jiang.

178
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He's smarter than you.

179
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You think that everything will be over after you lose to me?

180
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
As long as he's around,

181
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
you'll keep losing.

182
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Let me tell you

183
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
how this smart person will deal with you.

184
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
First of all,

185
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
he'll come here to visit you,

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and make a deal with you.

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
As long as you keep his secret,

188
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
he'll keep your life.

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Of course, this deal is real.

190
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
He'll definitely think of a way

191
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
to make you leave this prison alive.

192
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
When you leave this place,

193
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
and don't betray your death,

194
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
his promise will be fulfilled.

195
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Then,

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
you'll become a common prisoner,

197
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and be sent to the place where Yao Yuan's suffering is.

198
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And at the same time,

199
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
you'll have no value.

200
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The case is over.

201
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
No one will interrogate you anymore.

202
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And no one will listen to you.

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Even if you have more secrets about Xia Jiang,

204
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
there's no chance for you to escape.

205
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
From the capital to Yao Yuan's underground,

206
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
this long road,

207
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
you'll have no place to become a common prisoner.

208
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Think about it.

209
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
If a prisoner is killed by Liu Fang,

210
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
how many people will care about him?

211
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
How many people will care about him?

212
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
If you're dead,

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
you'll have all the secrets about Xia Jiang

214
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
in the grave.

215
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
From now on,

216
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
the smart person like Xia Jiang will be fine.

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
No one will worry about him anymore.

218
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
This sounds good.

219
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Thank you, my lord.

220
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'll have a good chat with you today.

221
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
How is it?

222
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Prince Yu's arrival is far away.

223
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You're welcome, my lord.

224
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I wonder what you have to say.

225
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The spring tea is already served.

226
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But the summer tea is still in the tea.

227
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's so good.

228
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The emperor gave it to me.

229
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm not afraid to lose it.

230
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You're so good at it.

231
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm really looking forward to it.

232
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You're too kind.

233
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Actually, I'm not here for a big deal.

234
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's just that my father ordered me to deal with

235
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
the Duke of Ning.

236
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Some of the details in it

237
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
were leaked to the subordinate.

238
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So I came to ask.

239
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It was leaked to me?

240
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's a secret.

241
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Your Highness, please.

242
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
In the 17th year of the civil war,

243
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Xie Yu's order was blocked.

244
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He killed a monk in Xianzhou, Li Chongxing.

245
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He was killed for the subordinate.

246
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I want to know if it's true.

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He killed for me?

248
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Xie Huoyan,

249
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
the less opportunities you have to talk,

250
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
the less you can catch one.

251
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Tell me.

252
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Did I make any sense?

253
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Even if you don't need it,

254
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
that's the worst situation.

255
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Xia Jiang should believe me.

256
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
He knows that as long as he saves me,

257
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I will never stop him.

258
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I didn't betray him.

259
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's not good for me.

260
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But everything in this world is a thousand times better.

261
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?

262
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Even if you didn't betray Xia Jiang,

263
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
he would rather believe you

264
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
than a dead person.

265
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's the style of his subordinate.

266
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I also want to think about myself.

267
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Why did he kill Zhuo Dingfeng at that time?

268
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Isn't that the only reason?

269
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I had no relationship with Xia Jiang.

270
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
He knew me.

271
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I also knew him.

272
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Now,

273
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I can only bet on the last one.

274
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If I don't believe him,

275
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I will have to believe you.

276
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Why can't you believe me?

277
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Believe you?

278
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I can have the power to do everything you want.

279
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
If I believe you,

280
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'd rather die quickly.

281
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You didn't do everything I want today.

282
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You did it on your own.

283
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But I told you to believe me,

284
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and I didn't believe you.

285
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Xia Jiang killed you for a reason.

286
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But I didn't.

287
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You didn't?

288
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Mr. Zhu,

289
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
you'd rather die quickly than be able to do anything.

290
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm too selfish.

291
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You just left this prison

292
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
to make a living.

293
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You have no difference

294
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
between you and me.

295
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I was the one who was against you.

296
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You were dangerous to Prince Yu.

297
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But now that you're a disciple of the emperor,

298
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
you have no relationship with the emperor.

299
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
No relationship with the emperor?

300
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Since you have no relationship with the emperor,

301
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
why do you still have to go to the prison?

302
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What?

303
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Mr. Wen,

304
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm not interested in you at all.

305
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm interested in Xia Jiang.

306
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Xia Jiang?

307
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Mr. Zhu,

308
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
you're really good at joking.

309
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Xia Jiang is my last hope.

310
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You actually want to use me to deal with Xia Jiang?

311
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You're so stupid.

312
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I want to use you.

313
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You should be happy

314
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
when you're still being used.

315
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
If you're useless,

316
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
you'll only have to live to die.

317
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Mr. Zhu,

318
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

319
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'll still be able to hide from Xia Jiang

320
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
and make him believe me.

321
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
He's my last hope.

322
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm really sorry.

323
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I've already killed the only hope

324
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
that the emperor has.

325
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What did you say?

326
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Did Zhuo Ding Feng say it?

327
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yes, Zhuo Ding Feng said it.

328
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Xie Yu had already confessed,

329
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
but it's very strange.

330
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
After Xia Shou Zun returned to the capital,

331
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
he suddenly changed his mind in two days.

332
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
He said he killed himself

333
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
because of him.

334
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Since Xie Yu has already confessed to me,

335
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
why do you still have to ask me?

336
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Let's go to the court.

337
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I want to hear from Xia Shou Zun

338
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
that this matter has nothing to do with you.

339
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's better to record it.

340
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
This matter

341
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
has nothing to do with me.

342
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Li Chong Xin?

343
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What Li Chong Xin?

344
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Zhuo Ding Feng killed him.

345
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But he doesn't know why he killed him.

346
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I've never said this.

347
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I've never said this has anything to do with Xia Jiang.

348
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I know you haven't said it,

349
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
but what will Xia Jiang think?

350
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
How did Prince Yu know

351
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Li Chong Xin's death has anything to do with Xia Jiang?

352
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Did I figure it out?

353
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You're the only one who knows the truth.

354
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Of course you did.

355
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I didn't say it!

356
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I've already decided.

357
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm afraid Xia Jiang has already decided

358
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
that you'll betray Li Chong Xin

359
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
in this matter.

360
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Maybe he'll believe that you didn't mean it.

361
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
In order to keep more secrets,

362
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
he'll still save you.

363
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But you're not a person

364
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
who's been in Xia Jiang's heart for a long time.

365
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Your mouth

366
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
can't be as old as a dead person.

367
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
In order to keep the future of the prison,

368
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
you've come to the moment

369
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
when you leave the prison.

370
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Xie Huo Yan,

371
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
you still have to

372
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
hope that Xia Jiang will keep your life.

373
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Because he's already

374
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
heartless about you.

375
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I didn't get the chance.

376
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I didn't get the chance.

377
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I have a grudge with you.

378
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You're going to hurt me

379
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
in this hell!

380
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What grudge?

381
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Xie Huo Yan,

382
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
we've never been able to save the master

383
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
in order to achieve our goal.

384
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Don't you think it's funny

385
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
that I can only give you one chance?

386
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I still believe in Xia Jiang.

387
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You choose.

388
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'll take it.

389
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
All right.

390
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You tell me.

391
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What should I do?

392
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I want to know why Xia Jiang

393
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
wants to kill Li Chong Xin.

394
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You know this doesn't make sense.

395
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Why doesn't it make sense?

396
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
With Xia Jiang's trick,

397
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Prince Yu doesn't need to worry.

398
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Prince Yu doesn't need to worry?

399
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Xie Huo Yan,

400
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
you're the most important man in the Crown Prince's life.

401
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Xia Jiang has been trying to save you.

402
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm sure the Xuanjing Bureau

403
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
that is not in charge of the party

404
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
is already standing in the Eastern Palace.

405
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I've already said it.

406
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Xia Jiang is not related to me

407
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
or the party.

408
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
That's good.

409
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
With Xia Jiang's trick,

410
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Xuanjing Bureau

411
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
can be used as Prince Yu's.

412
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You think Xia Jiang is too simple.

413
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
He won't use it as you guys.

414
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
How can I use him?

415
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You don't have to worry.

416
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'll tell you all these.

417
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
What can I do for you?

418
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Live.

419
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
There's Prince Yu in the capital.

420
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
There's Jiang Zuo Meng in the pugilistic world.

421
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I can definitely save you.

422
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
13 years ago,

423
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Li Chong Xin wrote a letter for Xia Jiang.

424
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
She said that

425
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
it was Nie Feng's handwriting.

426
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Who is Nie Feng?

427
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Who is Nie Feng?

428
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Nie Feng

429
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
was the first general of the Chiyan Army.

430
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
He was also the husband of Xia Dong in Xuanjing Bureau.

431
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So,

432
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Xia Jiang can easily get it.

433
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Nie Feng wrote the book of the Wulun Dynasty

434
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and gave it to Li Chong Xin.

435
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
He wrote a letter with no seal.

436
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Even Xia Dong can't tell the truth.

437
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
What did he write?

438
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's a letter with no seal.

439
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
He wrote that

440
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Zhu Shuai Lin wrote the letter with no seal.

441
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
He wrote that

442
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
he would never be able to escape

443
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and never enter the dead.

444
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
He wrote that he would never enter the dead.

445
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So,

446
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Nie Feng

447
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
was the one who

448
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
used the letter to capture the Wulun Army?

449
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You tried to save Nie Feng

450
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
because it was too late.

451
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It was also fake.

452
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Nie Feng

453
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Nie Feng

454
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You are Nie Feng.

455
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
When you were in the Wulun Army,

456
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
you asked this unknowing

457
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
former general to be in the dead.

458
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You took his half-dead

459
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and went back to the capital.

460
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You used Li Chong Xin's fake letter to prove

461
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
that you told His Majesty and Xia Dong

462
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
that he was killed by Zhu Shuai Lin.

463
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Is that so?

464
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
It was soon

465
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
that the Wulun Army

466
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
was ordered to

467
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
survive with Prince Yu.

468
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You should

469
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
capture this letter?

470
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
At that time,

471
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
only me and Xia Jiang knew that the letter was fake.

472
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
He had his own purpose.

473
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I had mine.

474
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
In order to prevent his disciple from going to the East,

475
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
he didn't use Xuan Jing Si's power.

476
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
He used me as a bait.

477
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I ordered Zhuo Ding Feng

478
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
to kill Li Chong Xin.

479
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
That's how things went.

480
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It has nothing to do with the party. Are you satisfied?

481
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Mr. Zhu!

482
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I will take my leave.

483
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I will take my leave.

484
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I will take my leave.

485
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I'm sorry.

486
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Uncle won't blame you.

487
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Why are you here?

488
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I came to see my mother.

489
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Father knows that I'm just being responsible.

490
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
What's wrong?

491
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Are you in a bad mood?

492
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
What happened outside?

493
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Mother.

494
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I'm thinking about it.

495
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm sorry.

496
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'm sorry.

497
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I'm sorry.

498
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I'm sorry.

499
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm sorry.

500
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'm sorry.

501
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm sorry.

502
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I'm sorry.

503
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I'm sorry.

504
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I'm sorry.

505
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm sorry.

507
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm sorry.

509
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm sorry.

510
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Do you want to eat?

511
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yes.

512
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Yes, I've never seen a chief like this.

513
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Dr. Yan, why don't you go in and have a look?

514
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yes, yes. You go and have a look.

515
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Let him be like this for another two hours.

516
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I'll go and have a look.

517
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Dr. Yan, why don't you go in and have a look?

518
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Yes, I'll go and have a look.

519
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Dr. Yan, why don't you go in and have a look?

520
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Yes, I'll go and have a look.

521
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Now we can confirm that Xia Jiang has not involved parties.

522
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:31,320
He and Xia Dong are now involved in천

523
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,840
We have a time of suspicion.

524
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,160
We can finally

525
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,320
stop thinking about him.

526
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,440
What's wrong, Your Highness?

527
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,720
I heard the truth about Xie Yu's journey today.

528
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,120
This is what you thought.

529
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,640
For years,

530
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,480
we were a group of soldiers required by the fear 씨.

531
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,760
The plan didn't give sense.

532
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,800
Besides,

533
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,640
Xia Jiang now is not our enemy.

534
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,560
In order to stop Wu Yi's piracy,

535
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,800
I had received my duty as the commander.

536
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,560
Only a work huh?

537
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,200
Do you know that

538
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,080
the times at Nhi viewing HerOOOO

539
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,720
were the days

540
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,900
the $100,000 soldiers evenly judged

541
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,100
for treason?

542
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,100
Now, even this head is fake.

543
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
It means that this case of breaking the heavens

544
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,100
has not only been a black hole,

545
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,100
but also the crimes of the King and Ling family.

546
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,100
There is not only a huge blame,

547
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
but you,

548
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,100
you only think that it is just a matter of time.

549
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,100
Did you know that today,

550
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:50,100
the King and Ling family are in a grudge?

551
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,100
In my opinion,

552
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,100
you should have been so stubborn.

553
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,100
They didn't betray you.

554
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,100
I...

555
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,100
I used to be the only one who was stubborn

556
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,100
to be the King and Ling family's father.

557
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,100
But today...

558
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
But today,

559
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,100
you found a clue

560
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
that you didn't know

561
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,100
about the truth of the White Four-Five.

562
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:24,100
What will you do next?

563
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,100
Of course, I will investigate.

564
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,100
I will find out

565
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,100
how they framed the King and Ling family.

566
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Then...

567
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Then...

568
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Then...

569
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,100
Then, with the truth you found,

570
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,100
you went to His Majesty's court,

571
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,100
and let him take the blame for the crime he committed

572
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,100
and punish those people again?

573
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,100
Shouldn't you do this?

574
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,100
You are not a criminal.

575
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,100
Shouldn't you do this?

576
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,100
Do you really think that

577
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,100
with just one Xia Jiang and Xie Yu,

578
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
you can kill a prince who is a good-looking man

579
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:08,100
and then you can be a good-looking man?

580
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,100
I will find out

581
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,100
how they framed the King

582
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,100
and Ling family.

583
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,100
Then...

584
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,100
Then...

585
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,100
Then...

586
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,100
Then...

587
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,100
Then...

588
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,100
Then...

589
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,100
Then...

590
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,100
Then...

591
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,100
Then...

592
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,100
Then...

593
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,100
Then...

594
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
Then...

595
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
Then...

596
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,100
Then...

597
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,100
Grandmother!

598
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,100
Grandmother!

599
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:20,100
Ji Yang, Ji Yang, Ji Yang

600
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:33,100
Xiaosheng, Xiaosheng, Xiaosheng

601
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:48,100
I understand what you mean

602
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,100
But why?

603
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,100
Why?

604
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,100
Even if the King of Qi is in the court and is in charge of the case

605
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,100
There are more evidence against the court than father

606
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,100
But he is a man of nature and has no idea of the reaction

607
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,100
Father is not as good as to guess his whereabouts

608
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,100
Is he a father?

609
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,100
The Emperor is not a father

610
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,100
We are not the same as the Emperor

611
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,100
I think

612
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:37,100
There is aработ in the picture

613
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,100
But I couldn't recognize the state because of the family

614
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:44,100
We had troubles

615
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:49,100
In that case, when I heard XiaJiang's name

616
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,100
He went straight to pillar

617
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,100
We went from level to explanations

618
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,100
Tell me

619
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,100
The old father believes it?

620
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

621
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Is it because of your hatred?

622
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,100
According to the Emperor's personality,

623
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,100
I guess he really has a heart.

624
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,100
That's why he's so cruel.

625
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,100
He's so unkind.

626
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,100
No matter what,

627
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,100
if it wasn't for my own feelings,

628
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,100
such a word

629
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,100
could only be found in the capital.

630
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,100
What's more,

631
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,100
I hate that I wasn't in the country.

632
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,100
Luckily, you weren't in the country.

633
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

634
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,100
Is it because of your hatred?

635
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

636
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,100
Is it because of your hatred?

637
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:41,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

638
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,100
Is it because of your hatred?

639
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

640
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,100
Is it because of your hatred?

641
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

642
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,100
Is it because of your hatred?

643
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

644
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,100
Is it because of your hatred?

645
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

646
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,100
Is it because of your hatred?

647
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

648
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,100
Is it because of your hatred?

649
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

650
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,100
Is it because of your hatred?

651
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

652
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,100
Is it because of your hatred?

653
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:21,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

654
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,100
Is it because of your hatred?

655
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

656
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,100
Is it because of your hatred?

657
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

658
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,100
Is it because of your hatred?

659
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

660
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,100
Is it because of your hatred?

661
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,100
I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

662
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,100
Is it because of your hatred?

I'm afraid that I'll be punished by the King of Qi.

664

676
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:22,100
The End
