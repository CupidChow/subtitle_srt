00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,900
Episode 24

2
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,900
I'm a selfish person.

3
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,900
For your own son,

4
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,900
I've been lying to you for so many years.

5
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,900
Now I have nothing to say to myself.

6
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,900
It's just that my daughter, Qi'er, is innocent.

7
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,900
She has returned to your doorstep.

8
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,900
Even though you two have no feelings for us,

9
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,900
I have nothing to say to myself.

10
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,900
I'm sorry for the child's loss.

11
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,900
I'm sorry for her.

12
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,900
Zhuo Jia is a martial arts person.

13
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,900
I know he's willing to be separated and not be implicated by the future generations.

14
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,900
Qi'er is my daughter-in-law.

15
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,900
If he can return to his father's house,

16
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,900
he will have his own treatment.

17
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,900
Please don't worry about it.

18
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,900
Master Zhuo and his family are injured.

19
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,900
It's getting late.

20
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,900
I'll go to rest first.

21
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,900
Please.

22
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,900
Father, mother.

23
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,900
Father.

24
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,900
Jingrui, get up.

25
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,900
Jingrui.

26
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,900
You're a good boy.

27
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,900
Jingrui,

28
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,900
why can't you blame your father for what happened?

29
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Please don't make yourself suffer.

30
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,900
I'm sorry.

31
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,900
Xie Yu.

32
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,900
Xie Yu.

33
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
Do you hate me?

34
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,900
I don't blame you for what happened in the past.

35
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,900
Come.

36
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,900
You don't hate me?

37
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,900
Even if you don't come,

38
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,900
they will come in tonight.

39
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,900
Besides,

40
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
I'll kill them all.

41
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,900
I think you're so arrogant.

42
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,900
You want to kill me, too.

43
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,900
I know what you did.

44
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,900
It's not what I can do to protect you.

45
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,900
I can ask you,

46
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,900
what will happen if you do it?

47
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,900
People die.

48
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
It's the end of the world.

49
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
The word is useless.

50
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,900
When things come to this,

51
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
the palace is ruined.

52
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
Xie's clan is under the ground.

53
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,900
What will they think?

54
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,900
The king is in trouble.

55
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,900
Since ancient times,

56
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,900
how can the Xie people not know?

57
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,900
Didn't you think

58
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,900
you'd protect Xie's clan and not the Meng Chen?

59
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
Xie's era is a civil war.

60
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,900
A clear future.

61
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,900
Can you bear it?

62
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
If I look at it,

63
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,900
what can I do?

64
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
I can do it for you.

65
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,900
I can do it for you.

66
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,900
What you did for Xie's clan

67
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,900
is only one thing.

68
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Since the night is white and there is no way out,

69
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,900
it's better to die.

70
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,900
It's better to prevent you from being angry.

71
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
If I die,

72
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
I can really be free from the world.

73
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,900
At least I won't let him come up to the surface.

74
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,900
The king is the enemy, not the enemy.

75
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,900
You are his target.

76
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,900
He doesn't want to destroy Xie's clan.

77
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,900
Xie is the only one.

78
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,900
I will ask the emperor to allow me to leave the family

79
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,900
and take the children away from the capital.

80
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,900
From now on, the Xie family and the Xiao family

81
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,900
have nothing to do with the family.

82
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,900
I can't protect your life.

83
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,900
But I can protect your life.

84
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
If you are alone,

85
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,900
I will come and accompany you when I have the children.

86
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,900
Okay?

87
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,900
I will go to the capital.

88
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,900
You...

89
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,900
Li Yang.

90
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,900
Li Yang.

91
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,900
I remember what you said to me.

92
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,900
For so many years,

93
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,900
I really like you.

94
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,900
But Li Yang,

95
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
I don't want to die now.

96
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,900
I have no intention to go to the mountains and rivers

97
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,900
and go to the endless time.

98
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,900
Who knows what will happen to the king in the end?

99
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
If people die,

100
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,900
then there is nothing more.

101
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,900
Then there is nothing more.

102
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
I can't lose a clean one.

103
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,900
What if Xie's clan doesn't have anything to do with it?

104
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Even if I die,

105
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,900
I will die of the same feeling.

106
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,900
I forgot.

107
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
You were always like this.

108
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,900
Since you have decided that,

109
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
that's good.

110
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,900
I will go to the capital.

111
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,900
I will go to the capital.

112
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
Protect the Anzhi and Zhuozhuang's clan well.

113
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,900
Yes.

114
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,900
I will send someone to send Mr. Su back to the mansion.

115
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,900
Thank you, Your Highness.

116
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,900
The next thing is not a request.

117
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,900
I hope you can help me with the night.

118
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,900
You don't have to worry about me.

119
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,900
If Zhuo Dingfeng is in the hands of this person,

120
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,900
why should we be worried?

121
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
This time, you have done a great job.

122
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,900
But the weather is not warm in April.

123
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,900
If you are cold,

124
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,900
that's not good.

125
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,900
Take me back and send the imperial physician to see if it's good.

126
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,900
No need.

127
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,900
I have a doctor in my mansion.

128
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,900
This time, Commander Meng is not as good as this.

129
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
He has realized that he has been using us.

130
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
Your Highness, go back to the mansion.

131
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,900
Let me explain to him.

132
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,900
Commander Meng is a loyal person.

133
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,900
When you explain to him,

134
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,900
you must be careful.

135
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,900
At such an important moment,

136
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,900
we must not be against him.

137
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,900
Yes.

138
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
Goodbye.

139
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
Commander Meng.

140
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,900
Thank you.

141
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,900
Thank you, Mr. Su.

142
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,900
The weather is cold.

143
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
Mr. Su's body is so weak.

144
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,900
You should go back to your mansion.

145
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,900
I am a little cold.

146
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,900
But I am fine now.

147
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,900
I will be fine.

148
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,900
I will be fine.

149
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
I will be fine.

150
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
Now, I am fine.

151
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,900
I am fine.

152
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,900
I am not very well.

153
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
Commander Meng, can you give me a ride?

154
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,900
Your Highness is waiting for us in the mansion.

155
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
That's good.

156
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
Mr. Su.

157
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,900
Please.

158
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
Thank you, Commander.

159
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
Commander Meng.

160
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
Good job.

161
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,900
You are really good at riding.

162
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,900
You are the best today.

163
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,900
Even if the child is a tiger,

164
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,900
he will lose his appetite

165
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
and his teeth.

166
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,900
He can only be begotten in the cage.

167
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
Congratulations, Your Highness.

168
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,900
By the way, Banzhuang.

169
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,900
Do you think that

170
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,900
between Meng Zhi and Mei Changsu,

171
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,900
the relationship between them is not the same?

172
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
Chu Que and Mei Changsu

173
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,900
chose the house that Commander Meng recommended.

174
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,900
Other things are not the same.

175
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,900
Maybe I am too much.

176
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,900
Send someone to organize a separate yard.

177
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,900
Take good care of the Zhuo family.

178
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,900
Don't be a coward.

179
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,900
I understand.

180
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
I think it's dangerous tonight.

181
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Are you all right, Mr. Su?

182
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
Thanks to Commander Meng,

183
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
although there are many accidents,

184
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,900
I am still fine.

185
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,900
But tonight,

186
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,900
I am really a little bit shocked.

187
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,900
When Mr. Su told me,

188
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,900
I felt that I was calm.

189
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,900
Besides,

190
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,900
the people who are in the house

191
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,900
must be a little bit proud.

192
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,900
By the way,

193
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,900
the secret of the princess' death

194
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
was a fatal death.

195
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,900
The royal family knows everything.

196
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,900
Did Prince Yu ask you

197
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
how you know?

198
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,900
I didn't find out.

199
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,900
Prince Yu found out first and told me.

200
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,900
What?

201
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
Prince Yu found out.

202
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
But Mr. Su

203
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
found out because of him.

204
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Don't make trouble.

205
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,900
The more you talk, the more confused I am.

206
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,900
Tell me now.

207
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,900
I started to

208
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,900
talk about this matter years ago.

209
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,900
The so-called human language

210
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,900
and the taste of it

211
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,900
I have been a man

212
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,900
in the palace and in the palace.

213
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,900
I told the princess

214
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,900
about the past.

215
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,900
I talked about

216
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,900
how much the Prince of Nan Chu

217
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,900
and Xiao Jingrui look like.

218
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,900
Did you ever hear the empress say

219
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,900
that more than twenty years ago,

220
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,900
the royal family of Nan Chu

221
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,900
sent a son to Jinling?

222
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,900
Indeed.

223
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,900
With these two clues,

224
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,900
Qing Banruo was enough to

225
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,900
investigate.

226
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,900
By the way,

227
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,900
last month,

228
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,900
the palace maid killed Xie Yu.

229
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,900
Of course, the plan

230
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,900
didn't work out.

231
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,900
The palace maid was injured.

232
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
She hid under the tree.

233
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
To thank Qing Banruo's life,

234
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,900
she told him

235
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,900
the secret of Xie Yu's murder.

236
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,900
I see.

237
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Prince Yu knows so many things.

238
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
He will come to you

239
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
and discuss with you

240
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,900
how to use them.

241
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,900
So, you helped him

242
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,900
to get through this

243
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,900
in Jingrui's birthday banquet.

244
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,900
That's so great.

245
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,900
But,

246
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,900
what about Yuwen Xuan and them?

247
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,900
Yuwen Xuan came to the capital.

248
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
Prince Yu's order was to wait.

249
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,900
Naturally, he would meet Yuwen Nian.

250
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
The girl and Jingrui

251
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,900
look alike.

252
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
He would know what's going on.

253
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,900
Plus,

254
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,900
Prince Yu's ability

255
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,900
to let them come

256
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
to Jingyue

257
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
is not a difficult thing.

258
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,900
That's right.

259
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,900
It's a bit cruel.

260
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,900
But,

261
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
it's a rare opportunity.

262
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,900
And,

263
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,900
the man in the south,

264
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,900
the marriage of the couple,

265
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,900
he is also a good man.

266
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
He is a great man.

267
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,900
I'm afraid it's hard

268
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
to say whether he is a great man

269
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,900
or a man.

270
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,900
The people of the Zhuo family

271
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,900
have been in a daze for so many years.

272
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,900
And,

273
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,900
Jingrui's young man,

274
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,900
tell me,

275
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,900
how will he be in the future?

276
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,900
He saw

277
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,900
the effect of you

278
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,900
in the whole thing.

279
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
No matter what,

280
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
you are friends.

281
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
Will he blame you

282
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,900
for being too cruel?

283
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
If you don't want to be cruel,

284
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,900
how can you get close

285
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,900
to the relationship between

286
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,900
Xie Yu

287
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,900
and him?

288
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,900
There is a reason.

289
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
Jingrui's son

290
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,900
will face it.

291
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,900
Your Highness,

292
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,900
tonight,

293
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,900
is there anything else

294
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,900
important?

295
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,900
Mr. Su,

296
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,900
the play

297
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
that I planned

298
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,900
was not my fault.

299
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,900
But,

300
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,900
I want to see

301
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
the ending of Xie Yu.

302
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,900
I think

303
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,900
you are worried about

304
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Prince Yu's army.

305
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,900
I'm afraid that tonight

306
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,900
there will be any danger.

307
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,900
I'm afraid that

308
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Mr. Su will have

309
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,900
any trouble.

310
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Well, Mr. Da,

311
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,900
I think

312
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,900
you should go to the court.

313
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,900
Well, Mr. Da,

314
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,900
the day after the emperor's death,

315
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
there is a strong battle at the scene.

316
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
The south-west team

317
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,900
will definitely participate.

318
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,900
You should find a chance

319
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,900
to fight with Wenxuan.

320
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,900
In case he thinks

321
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
the five generals in the Great Liang court

322
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,900
are the ones

323
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,900
who are so weak

324
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,900
to make trouble.

325
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,900
Good.

326
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,900
Mr. Su,

327
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,900
you are busy.

328
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
For your health,

329
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,900
you should not

330
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,900
care about

331
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,900
such a trivial matter.

332
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
It's not a trivial matter.

333
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,900
If it's not for tonight,

334
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
why would I

335
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
have the chance

336
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
to see the battle in the court?

337
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,900
Your Highness,

338
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
you are not saying that.

339
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,900
Is Mr. Su still wrong?

340
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,900
The crown prince and Prince Yu

341
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,900
have been fighting with Wuji long ago.

342
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,900
No one in the world knows.

343
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
Besides,

344
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,900
I think the south-west team

345
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,900
has a lot of such things.

346
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,900
Right?

347
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,900
At least these years,

348
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,900
the south-west team has been in a good mood.

349
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,900
They have been working together

350
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
to make a good result.

351
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,900
Except for the chaos,

352
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,900
there is no big problem.

353
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,900
If the south-west team

354
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,900
keeps on fighting,

355
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:48,900
if they lose their power

356
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
to the south-west team,

357
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,900
they will be in trouble.

358
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,900
Mr. Su,

359
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,900
you are being too harsh.

360
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,900
Since you and Mr. Su

361
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,900
are talking about it,

362
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,900
I will go out tomorrow.

363
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,900
Mr. Su, don't worry.

364
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,900
If you are in the hunting ground,

365
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,900
you will definitely

366
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,900
get rid of our guards.

367
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,900
Let Yuwen Xuan

368
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,900
have a good look at the sight.

369
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,900
It's getting late.

370
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,900
Mr. Su should rest.

371
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
Oh, right.

372
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
Your Highness, please take a step forward.

373
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,900
We will go out together.

374
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,900
It's not convenient.

375
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,900
I have to go.

376
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
Did I say something wrong?

377
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,900
He is the main soldier.

378
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,900
You must find the relationship well.

379
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,900
You have no sense of justice in front of her.

380
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Don't try to protect me like this.

381
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,900
Okay.

382
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
I'll listen to you.

383
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
Uncle.

384
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,900
Seeing Jingrui like this,

385
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,900
you're not feeling well, right?

386
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,900
Okay.

387
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,900
I said something wrong again.

388
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
I said something wrong again.

389
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,900
Xie Yu.

390
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,900
Xie Yu.

391
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,900
Xie Yu, Xie Yu.

392
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
I really...

393
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,900
have never trusted him for so many years.

394
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
Xie Yu is very good at disguise.

395
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,900
No one in the court thinks he's the loyal general and the court's assistant.

396
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,900
If it weren't for Xie Zhuo and his family's old past,

397
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,900
I wouldn't have thought that

398
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,900
the case of assassinating the internal guards in the palace

399
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
was done by Xie Yu's art.

400
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,900
Don't mention that he's afraid of being disobeyed

401
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,900
and using the Tianquan Manor to create a new level of justice.

402
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
He's used the court's power to assassinate the people.

403
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,900
He's committed a lot of crimes and is very guilty.

404
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,900
His father is very kind to him.

405
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,900
He's never been so kind to him.

406
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,900
Have you figured out the confession of Zhuo Dingfeng?

407
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Yes.

408
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,900
But...

409
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,900
What?

410
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,900
According to Zhuo Dingfeng's confession,

411
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,900
Xie Yu was in a lot of illegal activities.

412
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Aunt Li Yang didn't know about it.

413
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,900
So I thought that

414
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
since aunt Li Yang is a very old woman,

415
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,900
her son is also a bloodbath of the royal family.

416
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,900
So I'm willing to ask father to start the crime of being shameless.

417
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,900
It's a pity that you have this filial piety to your elders.

418
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,900
Empress Dowager and Empress Dowager are in a bad health.

419
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,900
To make her live up to her life,

420
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,900
I can't let Li Yang suffer for Xie Yu.

421
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,900
Fortunately, Li Yang has his own family.

422
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,900
He's married into the Duke of Ning.

423
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,900
Let him take his own child

424
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,900
to the Palace of Princess.

425
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,900
Yes.

426
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,900
All right.

427
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,900
I'll give you the order to settle Xie Yu's case.

428
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,900
You must act carefully and investigate it thoroughly.

429
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,900
Xie Yu can't let go of the crime.

430
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,900
But he didn't do it.

431
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,900
Remember,

432
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,900
don't let anyone else go against you.

433
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,900
I accept your order.

434
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,900
Doctor Qin.

435
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,900
Minister Qin.

436
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,900
You're the one who's grown up.

437
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,900
I'm begging you.

438
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,900
Please save him.

439
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,900
The imperial guards are unwell.

440
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,900
The blood is running out.

441
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,900
Plus, there's a death penalty.

442
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,900
I'm afraid that I'll be in danger.

443
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,900
Minister Qin.

444
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,900
How is it?

445
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,900
Princess,

446
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,900
the child's shoulder has been exposed.

447
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
I'm afraid that you can't keep it.

448
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,900
But the child can still be kept.

449
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,900
My daughter is still alive.

450
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,900
What are you doing?

451
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,900
Please.

452
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
Please.

453
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,900
Please.

454
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
I'm with you.

455
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,900
Don't be afraid.

456
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
Please.

457
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,900
Please.

458
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,900
Please.

459
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,900
Please.

460
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,900
Please.

461
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,900
Please.

462
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
Please.

463
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,900
Please.

464
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,900
Princess.

465
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,900
The eldest lady Xie's father died last night.

466
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,900
How about the child?

467
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,900
The child is still alive.

468
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
Prince Yu is in danger.

469
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
He sent the child to Qingyao.

470
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,900
It's a pity that he died too late.

471
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,900
He didn't see the last time.

472
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,900
But the eldest lady told him to take the child away.

473
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,900
She said it was the wish of the eldest lady Xie.

474
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
Princess.

475
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
I'll go and ask Dr. Yan.

476
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
Princess.

477
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
Princess.

478
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,900
Princess Su is not feeling well.

479
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,900
How are you?

480
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,900
I'm fine.

481
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,900
Do you know why?

482
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,900
Because I'm feeling better.

483
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Princess.

484
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,900
Princess.

485
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,900
Princess.

486
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,900
Xuanjing Temple is in the middle of the river.

487
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,900
I just came back.

488
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,900
Greetings, master.

489
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,900
Dong'er.

490
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,900
Dong'er.

491
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,900
Dong'er.

492
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,900
Since Xuanjing Temple was established by the Crown Prince of the Imperial Court,

493
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,900
what responsibility do you have?

494
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,900
I only obey the order to find out the evil evil.

495
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,900
I don't borrow the court and don't set up a political party.

496
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,900
Since you know that I don't set up a political party,

497
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,900
why did you go to the Duke of Ning's manor that night?

498
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,900
I was ordered by His Majesty to go to the Duke's manor

499
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,900
to investigate the case of the spy.

500
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,900
The case of the spy?

501
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,900
How did you find out the Duke of Ning's manor?

502
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,900
I've long suspected Zhuoding Feng.

503
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,900
I just hope that the family can be honest.

504
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,900
Honest?

505
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,900
Yes.

506
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,900
What about the honest one?

507
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
Why didn't you leave the Duke of Ning's manor?

508
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,900
Why did you go to the back?

509
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,900
Master, you don't know.

510
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,900
The situation at that time...

511
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,900
The situation at that time was...

512
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,900
Xuanjing Temple is in the middle of the river with me.

513
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,900
What do you think?

514
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,900
As the head of the imperial family,

515
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,900
you know what to do.

516
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,900
We only obey the order to find out the cause of the crime.

517
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,900
Once we find out the cause of the crime,

518
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,900
we'll report to His Majesty.

519
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,900
We should not interfere with the matter.

520
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,900
Don't you know?

521
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,900
I think that if Zhuoding Feng is exposed,

522
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,900
His Majesty might not believe that we...

523
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,900
Xuanjing Temple only needs to report the result of the investigation to His Majesty.

524
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,900
As for His Majesty's trust in the state,

525
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,900
how can we deal with it?

526
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
It's not your or my fault.

527
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,900
The Duke of Ning's manor is clearly the battle between Prince Yu and Crown Prince.

528
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,900
You have already committed the responsibility of Xuanjing Temple.

529
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,900
The Emperor of Ning's Manor

530
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,900
You must be ready to go to the Imperial Palace

531
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,900
and make the best of your ability.

532
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,900
I will take your leave.

533
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

534
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,900
You finally come back.

535
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,900
Get up.

536
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

537
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

538
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,900
It's been a long time since I last saw you.

539
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,900
Fortunately, the children are able to share their worries with me.

540
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,900
Your Majesty,

541
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,900
I am really ashamed of the children.

542
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,900
I have already been in the capital, Xia Dong.

543
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,900
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

544
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,900
In the capital?

545
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,900
Why is that?

546
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,900
In the Duke of Ning's manor,

547
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,900
Xia Dong was too stubborn.

548
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,900
It's not that Xuanjing Temple should be the capital.

549
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
You are too harsh.

550
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,900
Xia Dong is investigating the case for me.

551
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,900
I think

552
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,900
the incident that happened that night

553
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,900
is no longer just a case.

554
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,900
Xuanjing Temple is a power building.

555
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,900
It can only be found in your hands.

556
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,900
Don't think about anything else.

557
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,900
You mean

558
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,900
there is someone in this world?

559
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,900
I am just suspicious.

560
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,900
There is no evidence.

561
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,900
I just remind Your Majesty

562
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,900
that what crime Xie Yu committed is a crime.

563
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,900
But how did these crimes come out?

564
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,900
It's another matter.

565
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,900
It's another matter.

566
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,900
It's not a small matter

567
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
for a person in the Duke of Ning's manor.

568
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,900
You must investigate this matter.

569
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,900
Yes.

570
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,900
Xie Yu's crime has been committed.

571
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,900
I don't want to see him.

572
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,900
Since you are back,

573
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,900
please come with me.

574
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,900
Ask him if there is anything else

575
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,900
he wants to say.

576
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,900
Is there anything else?

577
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,900
I'm afraid that Prince Yu

578
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,900
won't be able to help him.

579
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,900
94466, come.

580
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,900
I'm coming.

581
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,900
Xie Yu's son,

582
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,900
you finally came back to the capital.

583
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,900
I've told you not to come to the capital too early.

584
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,900
I'm sorry.

585
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,900
I'm sorry.

586
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,900
I'm sorry.

587
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,900
I'm sorry.

588
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,900
I'm sorry.

589
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,900
I'm sorry.

590
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,900
I'm sorry.

591
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,900
I'm sorry.

592
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,900
I'm sorry.

593
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,900
I'm sorry.

594
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,900
Say again.

595
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,900
Are you faithless?

596
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,900
Trust now then.

597
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,900
That was my plan.

598
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,900
Such a big screw.

599
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
Maybe it can make a difference

600
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,900
if isn't very much the shallower.

601
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,900
You have come

602
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,900
so carefully to look at me.

603
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,900
You just want me to know

604
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,900
Do you know how I got this root?

605
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,900
What's the point?

606
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,900
You're a disciple of the hundred now.

607
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,900
Not only does it have no existence, but it's also life.

608
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,900
You're back, Master Xia.

609
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,900
So you're fine.

610
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,900
What's your intention?

611
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,900
What's your intention?

612
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,900
You're a servant of Jin.

613
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,900
I guarantee you won't die.

614
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
That's all.

615
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,900
That's all.

616
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,900
His Majesty is suspicious.

617
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to take it.

618
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:06,900
I hope you can make this promise.

619
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:21,900
I've never made the promise between you and Xie.

620
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,900
Five days ago, the emperor returned from the throne.

621
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,900
He was rewarded with 20 gold and 20 gold beads.

622
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,900
He was rewarded with a lot of money and a lot of money.

623
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,900
These days, the emperor and the emperor gave the emperor a gift.

624
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,900
The officials followed him and went to the gate.

625
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,900
But the emperor only received a few gold beads.

626
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,900
He said he didn't have any brotherly guilt.

627
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,900
He didn't receive any other ones.

628
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,900
Mr. Shizan ordered the emperor to take care of the traces of Qin Ban Ruo

629
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,900
in the bottom of the court.

630
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,900
Some of them were found when they were searching for the intelligence.

631
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,900
Some of them were caught by the private case.

632
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,900
Some of them were cut off.

633
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
Some of them were cut off.

634
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,900
Any other news?

635
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,900
There's no news about the others.

636
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,900
No news?

637
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,900
No news about how to deal with Xie Yu.

638
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,900
I'm afraid someone is in a hurry.

639
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,900
Chief, Prince Yu is here.

640
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,900
You're so accurate.

641
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,900
I'll take my leave.

642
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,900
Mr. Su.

643
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,900
Your Highness.

644
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,900
You don't know that Father is so stupid.

645
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:56,900
What did you say?

646
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,900
I said...

647
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,900
I mean...

648
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,900
I don't know what Father is thinking.

649
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,900
Xie Yu is a good man.

650
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,900
He's a good man.

651
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,900
He's a good man.

652
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,900
He's a good man.

653
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,900
He's a good man.

654
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,900
What's the point of hesitating?

655
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,900
His Majesty hesitated.

656
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,900
He was fine the other day.

657
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,900
You don't know that

658
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Xuan Jing Si's guardian is back.

659
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,900
I don't know what's going on between him and Xie Yu.

660
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,900
I don't know what's going on between him and Xie Yu.

661
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,900
We'll see.

662
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,900
How can that be?

663
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,900
Xie Yu is in the middle of the mountain.

664
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,900
There's a clear line of Xie Yu in the mountain.

665
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,900
Zhuo Qing Yao's hand

666
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,900
is also drawn by Shen Zhui's painting.

667
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,900
It's a crime to murder the courtier.

668
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,900
It's not a crime to turn around.

669
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,900
He's a man.

670
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,900
But he's not a man.

671
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,900
So he's helped the Crown Prince

672
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,900
to make some big cases.

673
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,900
But he's involved in the murder.

674
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,900
He doesn't know the case of the royal family.

675
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,900
Yes.

676
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,900
He's a man.

677
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,900
He used Zhuo Ding Feng's power.

678
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,900
He's also known as Shen Zhui.

679
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,900
But he's just a man.

680
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,900
He's just a man.

681
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,900
He's just a man.

682
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,900
He's just a man.

683
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,900
It seems Xie Yu just wants to keep his life.

684
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,900
But it's true.

685
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,900
When the Crown Prince is on the throne,

686
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,900
he can still go back to the mountain.

687
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
He's just a man.

688
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,900
If he can't get rid of him this time,

689
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,900
wouldn't he have let the master

690
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,900
suffer for my painting?

691
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,900
Since you're so confident,

692
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,900
what about Xia Jiang?

693
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,900
You don't know.

694
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,900
Xia Jiang is very good at it.

695
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,900
His father trusts him.

696
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,900
He said he'd be in the cave

697
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,900
after he came back.

698
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,900
He said he shouldn't have helped me

699
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,900
with the investigation.

700
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,900
I'm really surprised.

701
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,900
Xie Yu and he

702
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:55,900
have no close relationship.

703
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,900
Why should we keep him?

704
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,900
Actually, you don't have to worry about it.

705
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,900
Although His Majesty trusts Xia Jiang,

706
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,900
he should be honest with His Majesty.

707
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,900
Will His Majesty be loyal to him?

708
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,900
It's not that easy for Xie Yu

709
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,900
to want to die.

710
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,900
Xie Yu is in danger now.

711
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,900
There's no difference between death and death.

712
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,900
It's a matter of His Majesty's attitude towards me.

713
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,900
It's really a strange sweat.

714
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,900
Although it's still warm,

715
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,900
it's still a long way from the conversation.

716
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,900
It seems like it's a bit far away.

717
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,900
Maybe you're too worried.

718
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,900
Now, the whole court

719
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,900
is under your control.

720
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,900
It's not easy to suppress

721
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
the Crown Prince's spirit.

722
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,900
You can't force it.

723
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,900
You're right.

724
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,900
I understand.

725
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,900
Did Xia Jiang go to Tian Lao to see Xie Yu?

726
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,900
I went to see her once.

727
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,900
She said it was a holy order.

728
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,900
She took all my people out.

729
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,900
I can't hear what they said.

730
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,900
I asked His Highness to let Zhuo Ding Feng

731
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,900
take out the list of the new year's jewelry.

732
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,900
Have you taken it?

733
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
I brought it today.

734
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,900
Please have a look.

735
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,900
Xie Yu is really bold and bold.

736
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,900
She did so many things

737
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,900
through Zhuo Ding Feng.

738
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,900
I'm so lucky

739
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,900
that I didn't get killed by her.

740
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,900
I'm afraid that

741
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,900
there are some people

742
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,900
who don't know

743
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,900
why Xie Yu is killed.

744
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,900
That's right.

745
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,900
Some people don't even know

746
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,900
what she's doing.

747
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,900
Maybe.

748
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,900
For example,

749
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,900
Li Chongxin

750
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,900
was killed in 2017.

751
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,900
It's been about 12 or 13 years.

752
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,900
A teacher.

753
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,900
It's been a long time.

754
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,900
Have you ever thought

755
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,900
that some people

756
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
might be killed by Xie Yu for others?

757
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,900
Others?

758
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,900
Didn't you say

759
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,900
that Xia Jiang and Xie Yu

760
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,900
are not close friends?

761
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,900
This time,

762
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,900
I'm sure that Xia Jiang

763
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,900
will protect Xie Yu.

764
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,900
I'm sure that there's another reason.

765
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,900
Xia Jiang is so smart.

766
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,900
You mean

767
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,900
he also trusted the crown prince?

768
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,900
Before the crown prince got the throne,

769
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,900
Xia Jiang wouldn't put him in the eyes.

770
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,900
He never set up a party.

771
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,900
So His Majesty

772
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,900
trusted him so much.

773
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,900
That's true.

774
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,900
I'm sure that Xia Jiang is loyal to his father.

775
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,900
That's why I really don't understand

776
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,900
why he wants to jump out

777
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,900
and influence Xie Yu.

778
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,900
What if Xie Yu did something for him?

779
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,900
I'm sure that Xia Jiang

780
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,900
