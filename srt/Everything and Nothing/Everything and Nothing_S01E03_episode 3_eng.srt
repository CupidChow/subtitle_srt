1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,710
   
Sodium metal in kerosene 

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:10,680
This time, we'll add phenolphthalein solution into each of these aqueous solutions.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,760
Now, do you guys know what this solution is, right?

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,390
This is the liquid I mixed in water the other day when we tested the natrium  (sodium)  explosion outside in the playground.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,270
Why are you so late in opening the door?

6
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:36,040


7
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,270
What a small world.

8
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,430
It's not even our neighborhood, and we meet all the way in Gangnam.

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,540
Um, I'm not sure what this situation is.

10
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:19,300
This is where I get tutored and my teacher said since I did well on the test,

11
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,450
he'll give me a reward. But the teacher's not here...

12
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,430
Don't play innocent. You opened the door.

13
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,550
No, that's—

14
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:36,130
Is this your first time for this?

15
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,930
Oh, I guess it is your first time.

16
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,390
It's completely your first time.

17
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,560
Okay.

18
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,410
Your tutor is funny...

19
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:30,180
But don't think about blackmailing me with this.

20
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,480
Then I'll be washing up first.

21
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,590
Ahn Seo Yeon, Jung Yoo Ri!

22
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,330
Hi!

23
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,970
Next time, listen carefully.

24
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,450
Were you sleeping?

25
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,440
You didn't hear the teacher.

26
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,180
What?

27
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,560
I really worked hard bringing him.

28
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,700
What do you care?

29
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,610
Whom do you mean?

30
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,490
Don't look.

31
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,850
I'm back home.

32
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,260
Where is everybody?

33
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,520
Seo Yeon, you're home?

34
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,130
How is it?

35
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,230
You like it, right?

36
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,330
What is this?

37
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,240
It's your first grand piano, why's your reaction like that?

38
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,320
Makes me sad.

39
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,560
Where'd you get it?

40
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,650
What do you mean from where?

41
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,280
I'll be going out so practice.

42
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,740
Where's my bed?

43
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:15,790
Your bed? There was no place for it, so I threw it out.

44
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,690
Threw it out?

45
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,560
Well, there's no other way. You can sleep in my room with me.

46
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,730
I'll be back.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,830
Your original piano, I sold that.

48
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,480
I paid a lot for it but I only got 800,000 won out of it.

49
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,960
And you, instead of seeing the piano, you see that your bed's gone first when you're a pianist?

50
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,930
My son, did you have a good time at school?

51
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,080
Did you drink?

52
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,760
Yea, since my son did well on the test, I treated some people.

53
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,040
What did you eat?

54
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,080
Pork ribs, with some ahjummas.

55
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,270
Which ahjummas?

56
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,670
You won't know.

57
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,450
But, Mom.

58
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,100
Yeah?

59
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,460
Is it okay if I stop tutoring for  math?

60
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,010
What are you saying? I'm going to wash up.

61
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,520
  Why are you so late in opening the door? 

62
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,490
  Then, I'll wash up first. 

63
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,710
 I'm done, if you haven't washed up, you should. 

64
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,710
  Select Destination 

65
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,870
 Select you destination 

66
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,080
 or please select the payment amount 

67
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,950
  Dae-chi 

68
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,410
  Dae-chi 

69
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,361
♪ Happy birthday to our beloved baby

70
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:39,171
♪ Happy birthday to you

71
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:43,601
I'll make a wish.

72
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,411
I'll blow the candles.

73
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:56,521
Now, today's gift is!

74
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:00,331
I can't believe this!

75
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,721
What a great time we had.

76
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:06,001
Ah, is that so?

77
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:12,531
Oh right!

78
00:09:15,461 --> 00:09:18,631
Here, it's not much, but use it as pocket money.

79
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,411
No, it's okay.

80
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:29,021
Oh you, if an adult gives it to you, you say 'thank you'

81
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:30,581
and accept it.

82
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:31,921
Of course.

83
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:36,771
If an adult says 'you're pretty' and gives it to you, you just accept it.

84
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:39,331
  You're really pretty. 

85
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:44,321
Seo Yeon.

86
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:50,631
Thank you.

87
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:59,351
Seo Yeon, you said you had something to say to Ahjussi when you meet him.

88
00:09:59,351 --> 00:10:00,701
What is it?

89
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:04,581
This kid, she says she has something to ask you.

90
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:12,831
Thank you... for the piano.

91
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:14,911
I thought it was something serious.

92
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:19,461
No, no, no, it's okay.

93
00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:30,981
If you want to go for a drive while practicing, give me a call.

94
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:40,881
Honey, hurry and get in.

95
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:50,031
There are five students called A, B, C, D and E. Each of them has F1 and F2...

96
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:02,391
How was she, good?

97
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:08,491
I meant, it was the first time using that app, so I was wondering how the girl was from that app.

98
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:14,511
Is that why you made me sign the memorandum?

99
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:20,091
Well, yeah. But it's because I'm a good teacher that your scores go up,

100
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:24,981
and after getting a reward, you try harder. It's a synergic effect.

101
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:28,971
Just go to a good college,

102
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:32,421
then instead of those trashy kids,

103
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:37,941
there will be much better and normal kids everywhere.

104
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:43,391
So, let's do well on the text exam. Okay?

105
00:11:43,391 --> 00:11:47,001
If she was good this time, I'll call her again next time.

106
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:50,081
Hey, look, grades,

107
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:54,211
because you did as I told you to, your score went up.

108
00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:56,581
You just have to do as you're told.

109
00:11:56,581 --> 00:11:59,791
Don't argue, don't ask questions. How easy is that?

110
00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:06,770
There's a saying, that if you listen to your elders well, you'll get a rice cake even in your sleep—

111
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,950
What are you doing?

112
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,770
I'm going to stop tutoring.

113
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,430
With this, it should be enough for today's lesson, right?

114
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,650
  Where are you? Hurry and come. 

115
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,530
Excuse me...

116
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,700
It's not that.

117
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
What's not that? Are you a gold-digger?

118
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,840
Let's hurry and go in.

119
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,990
What are you?

120
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,070
Ah, I have such poor luck!

121
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,820
Look. It's so easy. You just need to pick up the area and how much payment you want.

122
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,000
I chose like this when I ran into you as well. It was a coincidence to meet your tutor.

123
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,300
So, don't get into my business.

124
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,580
How much is it?

125
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,690
What is?

126
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,960
How much do you get?

127
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,910
I have money right now.

128
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,230
You're not going to run away today, right?

129
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,560
It feels like deja-vu.

130
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,730
What are you doing?

131
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,550
I'm tired.

132
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,780
You're not doing it?

133
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,470
Normally, what do you talk about?

134
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,740
About what?

135
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,700
When you come to these places. You don't talk?

136
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,130
We do... talk.

137
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,710
What do you talk about?

138
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,070
Usually about me. They typically ask about me.

139
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,000
Then what do you say?

140
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,660
My dad.

141
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,430
My dad had an affair

142
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,020
so my parents divorced.

143
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,410
My dad who cheated is marring that woman soon,

144
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,260
and instead, after the divorce, my mom kept changing guys.

145
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,300
But all those guys look at me.

146
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,450
Without mom knowing, they even touched my butt before.

147
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:39,680
Those kinds of men, they always gave me money afterward.

148
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,470
That kind of talk.

149
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,340
Then how do those people respond?

150
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,550
They say I'm pitiful. They're so easily fooled, even though it's a lie.

151
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,540
Why do you say that kind of lie?

152
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,230
Because I want to.

153
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,010
Whether it's a lie or not, how would they know?

154
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,540
No, what I mean is

155
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,930
I'm not asking why you lie,

156
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,400
but why you come up with that kind of lie.

157
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:26,240
Instead of lying that your dad had an affair, you could lie about something else.

158
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,960
But, why?

159
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,110
Hey, pay up.

160
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,770
All the other people heard this after paying. You didn't even pay half and you're trying to hear for free.

161
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,850
Hey, Go Min Jae.

162
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,180
My mom is also having an affair.

163
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,680
Are you copying me?

164
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,360
Do you think I'll believe you?

165
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,230
It's the truth.

166
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
It's true.

167
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,000
 RIOZEN
Hotel
Business 

168
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,380
Let's go together... home.

169
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,500
Why... together?

170
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,050
We live in the same direction.

171
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,050
Where are you coming from? You even had your phone off.

172
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:03,060
Where's the rest of the tutoring money? I heard you gave the teacher 900 dollars.

173
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,860
Earlier, the teacher called and say you said that and left

174
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,590
and I begged him to please continue with the tutoring.

175
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,160
But he says he doesn't want to.

176
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,470
He says he doesn't want to tutor a bratty kid like you. He even returned the 900 dollars.

177
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:26,750
Say something. Why are you being like this?

178
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,670
Your grades went up! But why are you saying you don't want tutoring?

179
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,740
I'm sorry.

180
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,970
Go in for now.

181
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,620
Who do you think it could be?

182
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,490
Hey, it's the same bag as Go Min Jae's.

183
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,030
Is that him?

184
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,920
Be quiet.

185
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,500
Hey, Go Min Jae. What's this? Huh?

186
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,610
- What? 
 - Look at this. Is it true?

187
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,980
  Grade 11, Go Min Jae and Ahn Seo Yeon, in front of a motel. Anonymous. 

188
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,420
No! Hey, why did you upload this? You didn't even check the facts!

189
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,360
Don't get angry with me.

190
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,640
I didn't know what to do but I could not upload it when there is evidence like this.

191
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,750
But what is this?

192
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,550
Is it true? You and Ahn Seo Yeon?

193
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,900
Then, at that time, instead of throwing out the condoms, you..?

194
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,990
I said it's not like that!

195
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,210
Everyone's here?

196
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:43,930
No morning meeting today. Go Min Jae, come see me.

197
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,070
 Counsel Room 

198
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,310
Why did you go there?

199
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,160
I went... to the chapel.

200
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,920
Chapel? At nighttime?

201
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,360
Mother, do they go to the chapel?

202
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,010
Yes.

203
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,160
Yes... yes.

204
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,250
Don't you usually go to chapels on the weekends? Why did you go at nighttime?

205
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,590
Because... I felt suffocated.

206
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:29,010
I told you to go practice at home when I let you get off the car there.

207
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:34,230
But you didn't come home. Where were you hanging around that such a picture was taken?

208
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,980
And what's up with that kid? We saw him at the train station too.

209
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,180
Is he your stalker?

210
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,140
No.

211
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,890
Then what is he?

212
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,800
Are you two dating?

213
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,200
It's not like that.

214
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,830
Then why were the two of you together?

215
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:04,440
Stop it. I said I'm sorry.

216
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,320
Stop it. I need to practice.

217
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,030
You told me to practice.

218
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:15,610
Tomorrow night, your dad's wedding,

219
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:20,720
I'm going to it, so don't wander around because I'm not here.

220
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,030
Practice at home.

221
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:26,290
And don't even think about going there.

222
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,290
Why are you going?

223
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,560
Do you think this is America?

224
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,860
The ex-wife going to the ex-husband's wedding?

225
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,960
If others see, they must think you guys had such a cool divorce.

226
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,270
Ahn Seo Yeon.

227
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,700
Why? Oh right,

228
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,120
but it wasn't that woman that took the married man

229
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,230
but the married man that went after that woman, so you can't even grab that woman's hair.

230
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,820
Stop it.

231
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:58,170
In a way, dad is amazing. To marry the woman he had an affair with.

232
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,610
Unlike someone, he doesn't keep changing women.

233
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:04,600
To dad, is that woman, what.. true love?

234
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,100
That kind of thing?

235
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,190
This little bitch...

236
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,620
Go Min Jae, why are you suddenly like this these days?

237
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,970
You're not a kid. Are you hitting puberty late?

238
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,280
Talk to me, Min Jae.

239
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,170
You're not doing anything weird these days, are you?

240
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,960
Talk to me!

241
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,420
I'm not.

242
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,310
If you like that girl, I can't do anything about your feelings,

243
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:00,250
but if you want to date someone, after you become an adult,

244
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,320
after getting into college, date them openly.

245
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,330
At that time, I won't care whatever you do.

246
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,010
No one will say anything.

247
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,290
I trust you, my son.

248
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,600
I trust what you said about going to the chapel.

249
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,030
But, let's keep doing things you can be proud of.

250
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,840
Got it?

251
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,220
Why's your toenail like that? Did you get hurt?

252
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,430
When? Let me see!

253
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,200
Stay still

254
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,580
We need to make a hole in the toenail and drain out the blood.

255
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,470
Otherwise, the toenail might fall off. It happened to me before.

256
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,500
When?

257
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,760
When I was your age?

258
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,320
Why did you get a bruise?

259
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,930
I don't know. I forgot.

260
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,310
Oh, sorry.

261
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,760
I was trying to see if the blood pooled inside.

262
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,220
Hurry and go to the hospital. Don't be afraid of getting a hold in your toenail.

263
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,460
It doesn't hurt.

264
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,740
Mom.

265
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,280
Yeah? What is it?

266
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,550
Mom, you like it when I go to the chapel.

267
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,360
What?

268
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,820
You get mad if I skip even one mesa for young group at church.

269
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,490
Even if I have an exam, you tell me to go to the chapel.

270
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:42,870
But, every Saturday when you send me to the chapel, what do you do, mom?

271
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,750
Why?

272
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,390
- We shouldn't go there, right?
 - You're right.

273
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,800
What a pervert.

274
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,340
What're you doing?

275
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,150
No, nothing.

276
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,460
My mom found a tutor yesterday.

277
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,480
So you don't need to tell me who your tutor is.

278
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,980
I'm sorry.

279
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,670
For what?

280
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,460
Is this beginning of my life with a tutor?

281
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,260
You told me you threw away  the thing I gave you last time.

282
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:53,490
Good job. That one was not good.

283
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,890
You are curious about how I know.

284
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,450
I became a real adult as of yesterday.

285
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,900
You know that girl, right? Jung Yoo Ri. Ahn Seo Yeon's best friend.

286
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,240
I guessed that she was so into me so I asked her

287
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,800
if she likes me.

288
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,380
And she said she liked me since middle school!

289
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,120
So, well.

290
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,340
But you, did you really do it with Ahn Seo Yeon?

291
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:29,540
Jung Yu Ri said she doubts it. That Ahn Seo Yeon doesn't even have a boyfriend.

292
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,920
You... have a girlfriend.

293
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,950
But why?

294
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:44,490
Girlfriend is a girlfriend. Jung Yu Ri says she likes me.

295
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,590
But if you tell Ahn Seo Yeon or Jung Yu Ri that I have a girlfriend, you're dead, okay?

296
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,900
Without an ID card, you can buy that. So next time, try buying something else.

297
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:59,560
But I feel like Ahn Seo Yeon won't do it with a kid without a license.

298
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,350
You really!

299
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,830
F**k.

300
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,370
Let go.

301
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,130
Let go of me.

302
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,930
Stop it.
