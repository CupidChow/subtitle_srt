1
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,380
Mom, where are you?

2
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,220
 I left $10 on the table. Buy dinner with it. 
   

3
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,800
  Everything and Nothing 

4
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,960
  Episode 1 

5
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,340
Yeah, Mom. Why shouldn't I register for cram school?

6
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,750
What? Yeah, right now. Okay.

7
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,660
Min Jae, what are you doing not packing up your stuff?

8
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,990
Oh, sorry.

9
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,840
Here you go.

10
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,590
You're going to stop cram school and get tutoring?

11
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,340
Yeah, the mock exam scores came out today and my mom met the teacher today.

12
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,920
Right. You got grade two on the math exam. Is that why you're going for private tutoring?

13
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,690
- I think so. 
- Do you have to go to private tutoring just because she thinks you failed once?

14
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,560
I was always getting grade three and my score just got  upgraded to grade two for the first time.

15
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,150
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you. Let's go.

16
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,160
My girlfriend asked me to go the Lotte World  (amusement park) . Do you think they'll call me mom if I skip cram school?

17
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,940
I'm not sure.

18
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,280
I wish there was one day in the week when we don't have cram school.

19
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,370
Oh, wait a minute.

20
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,320
Oh, sorry. Someone just requested us to post something on the school page.

21
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,740
Ha.

22
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,280
Look at this.

23
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,530
    

24
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,630
  Grade 10, Class 3's Jo In Sung is so handsome! Please ask him if he has a girlfriend. Anonymous. 

25
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,470
You're the admin of this page?

26
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,890
Yeah. From the class council, I said I'll be in charge of this page this year.

27
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,990
But, the moderator of this page knows the identity of the people who send messages.

28
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,350
Of course. Since they send their questions through messenger.

29
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,060
But since everyone asks to be anonymous, I'm keeping their secret.

30
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,170
Green light! I'll be going first. Bye!

31
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,310
You didn't apply for next month's cram school classes, right?

32
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,790
Yeah.

33
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,400
I met your homeroom teacher today.

34
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
I know.

35
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,010
Here, your card.

36
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,110
Tutoring starts tomorrow. In Daechi-dong Gangnam. (The most expensive tutoring)

37
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,720
Did the teacher say I need to start math tutoring?

38
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,990
No, the teacher is also worried but I'm the one telling you to do the tutoring.

39
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:35,820
Since he's a very popular tutor, I already put your name on a waitlist a long time ago. Every one of his student's grades improved so go and learn with enthusiasm.

40
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:43,210
As for how professional he is, he only accepts male students in the fear that his students might flirt with each other.

41
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,970
Mom.

42
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,890
If I go to college, are you going to move to Daegu and live with dad?

43
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,590
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

44
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:07,950
I mean, it was because of my school that you couldn't move with dad.

45
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:13,040
So, are you going to go live with dad after I go to college?

46
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:22,480
What would I do in Daegu? There's no one I know there. And, your dad has only lived in Seoul his whole life so he wouldn't have gone there if his company hadn't moved there.

47
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:29,450
Since he works for a government organization, he can work until retirement age, but that's going to be in ten years.  He'll come back after he retires.

48
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,810
But why do you ask all of a sudden?

49
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,030
No, just cause...

50
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,640
Wash up and study a bit before sleeping.

51
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:40,070
010-5208-1304

52
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,210
5208-1304

53
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,210
 My mom... is having an affair. 

54
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,230
The probability

55
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,450
is one hundred percent,

56
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,160
    

57
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,490
is what I think.

58
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,140
     

59
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,320
Min Jae,

60
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,500
this is the tutoring fee. They asked for cash because of tax issue, I guess.

61
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,610
Carry it safely.

62
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,100
It's 120 million won per month  (about 1200 dollars) .

63
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,630
You need to know that as well.

64
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:31,910
So, try your hardest. They say your grades will go up for sure, and once it goes up, won't go back down.

65
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,750
Who introduced them to you?

66
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,380
Just someone, you don't need to know.

67
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,260
Who is it?

68
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,130
Even if I told you, you wouldn't know.

69
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:45,220
Go there by subway after church. If you feel hungry, buy a snack with the money you have left.

70
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,220
Message me how the tutoring was afterward!

71
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,650
  Yes, I already ate. 

72
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,830
  Today's weather is so nice. 

73
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:10,540
He is with us. For those who wait patiently

74
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,280
and follow Him, He will give blessings to them.

75
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,220
    

76
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,260
 Please select the destination and price of your ticket. 

77
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,140
 After selecting a one-way ticket, 

78
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,980
 please choose the number of tickets you wish to choose. 

79
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,500
    

80
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,840
   

81
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,830
   

82
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:53,050
   

83
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,680
  Oido. The train for Oido is arriving now. 

84
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,210
  Please take a step back from the doorways. 

85
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:12,140
 Boarding will begin shortly.  

86
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,810
 Who is it? 

87
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:56,670
I'm here for tutoring, my name is Go Min Jae.

88
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,110
  The door has opened. 

89
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,540
  The door is closing. 

90
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,320
Welcome.

91
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,520
Wear this.

92
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,140
Come in.

93
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,740
You said you're Min Jae?

94
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,970
I'm Choi Soo Hwan. Let's do our best together!

95
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,300
Please take care of me.

96
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,090
Okay.

97
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,250
   

98
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,930
All my students fill this out. It's not much.

99
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:00,740
It's like a promise saying you'll never share what goes on here.

100
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,240
It could be orally but since I'm receiving it in writing,

101
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,340
don't be burdened by it.

102
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,300
Oh, the tutoring material?

103
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,340
I don't even have anyone to tell.

104
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,680
Is that so?

105
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,810
Read it and if it's okay, write your name here.

106
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,120
    

107
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,830
More. Do it more intensely.

108
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,830
As if you are in combat.

109
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,870
Fermata, watch the tension.

110
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,380
Now do it like a monologue as if you're speaking.

111
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,110
You must have practiced a lot. Seems like I can look forward to the upcoming concert.

112
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,940
But Seo Yeon, you played this at the entrance ceremony for the arts high school.

113
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,960
You played it well on the exam too. Why did you make so many mistakes then?

114
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,810
Seeing as how you were well at playing today, it's even sadder.

115
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,670
It was because of menstrual cramps.

116
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,050
Oh right, you said that was the reason.

117
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,150
But what can you do, taking care of your body is also a skill.

118
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,370
Teacher, thank you so much.

119
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,280
Here you go.

120
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,010
Thank you.

121
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,040
Your bag is so pretty! I also like these kinds of small bags!

122
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,670
Really?

123
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,040
I'm always amazed by your fashion sense.

124
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,850
Oh my...

125
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,130
I should follow you the next time you go shopping.

126
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,470
I would love that! When you have the time, teacher, give me a call!

127
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,110
Really?

128
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,690
I've never seen that bag before, where'd you get it?

129
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,240
   

130
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,840
Mom, do we have pads at home?

131
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,980
If we don't, let's go to the convenient store.

132
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,980
Why are we going this way?

133
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,880
Aren't we going home?

134
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,300
It's your second day of menstruation today.

135
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:48,450
The operation needs to be done within five days of menstruation so it is possible to do it today.

136
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,220
That's a relief.

137
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,690
Should we do it today?

138
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,470
That's why we came.

139
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,920
Okay.

140
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,980
Jung Seo is already this grown-up?

141
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,750
His face looks the same as his childhood days.

142
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,040
Oh my, he's so handsome!

143
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,890
You must have gone to his graduation.

144
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,950
Yes, I closed the hospital that day and went.

145
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:20,140
The east side of the US is so far. The long flights are exhausting.

146
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,670
I'm glad he's attending university on the west coast.

147
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,010
You should send Seo Yeon to somewhere close in the west coast.

148
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,470
It makes a big difference in taking the plane for fewer hours.

149
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,390
Is that so?

150
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,160
Where does Seo Yeon go for school?

151
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,930
Umm, she just goes to school in front of our house.

152
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:47,250
I don't have a husband, so I didn't want to send my only daughter away internationally for school.

153
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:55,040
Recently, I met Professor Ahn at the reunion

154
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,360
but since I was busy, I had to leave soon.

155
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:05,240
Oh, I see. You don't need to be careful just because we broke up.

156
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,380
I wouldn't have come to see you if that were the case.

157
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,120
That's right. I knew you were cool from the beginning.

158
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,790
Is that so?

159
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,510
Do you think it's anesthetized?

160
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,240
Yes.

161
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,310
This originally came out as a contraceptive.

162
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,560
With one operation, it lasts for about three years.

163
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,680
That's why people who want a gap between their first and child use it,

164
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,080
but these days, many students also come for it.

165
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,810
Especially if they have severe cramps, since they have a lot of tests and cramps can make them do poorly.

166
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,830
That's what I'm saying! Last year on the day of her school entrance exam,

167
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,340
she messed up on her test due to cramps.

168
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,940
Ah, so that's what happened.

169
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,160
You won't have to worry about that for some time now.

170
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,210
As for the symptoms I explained before, you may have some irregular bleeding for a few months.

171
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,300
We'll be starting now. There won't be any problems since we anesthetized the area.

172
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,240
Relax.

173
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,880
It's all done. All done.

174
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,960
    

175
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

176
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,270
I mean, that can happen while driving. Why do they glare at me like that?

177
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,720
Why all of a sudden?

178
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,700
There really isn't any.

179
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,540
Any of what?

180
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,440
I guess I used up all of my sanitary pads.

181
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,570
Do you think you can lend me just two? I'll pay you back tomorrow.

182
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,120
You only need to give me two.

183
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,350
Just take them all. And you don't need to pay me back.

184
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,540
You aren't going to use them? And what about this medicine?

185
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,520
You have severe menstrual cramps.

186
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,740
I don't need them.

187
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,160
It looks like the student council is doing something. Come look.

188
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,320
You all remember that this is an alkali metal, right?

189
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,880
Yes!

190
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,000
And atoms

191
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,580
- It's lunch time, what are we doing? 
- have electrons that move around them.

192
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,720
She's going overboard even for a rookie teacher.

193
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,980
Remember in college, this nateureum  (Korean word for sodium)  is called "sodium".

194
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,440
So remember that.

195
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,380
Kids call it "nateureum", and adults call it "sodium"

196
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,480
We're not going to major in chemistry in college.

197
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,680
He's right.

198
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,020
She treats us like kids. Did she forget she was a high school student in the past?

199
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,800
Anyway,  sodium is an unstable atom.

200
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,370
Just like you guys.

201
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,760
All of a sudden?

202
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,620
What are you saying?

203
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,690
It means that its reaction is very good.

204
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,370
It means that it's explosive.

205
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:14,750
So it has to be stored in either crude oil or benzene and kept away from oxygen.

206
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,810
As I've stated today, to see how sodium reacts with water,

207
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,400
we will do an experiment.

208
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,870
Aren't we doing this for a show?

209
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,890
I want to play soccer.

210
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,280
It must be class 3. Kang Ki Hyun is there.

211
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,050
I liked him in middle school.

212
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,330
Kang Ki Hyun?

213
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:48,220
I was going to confess on Valentine's Day, but he was already dating Jeong Eun Seo.

214
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,490
Would he have a girlfriend now?

215
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,460
If you're curious, why not ask anonymously about it on Yakjin's Secrets?

216
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,200
I can't! Kang Ki Hyun is the admin.

217
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,820
He knows who makes a request.

218
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,850
Just confess to him if you like him that much.

219
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,370
Still, he might have a girlfriend.

220
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,550
What does it matter?

221
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,050
Do you think he'll reject you saying he has a girlfriend if you confess?

222
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:17,530
Or, is it because he might dump her and say he likes you?

223
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:24,880
Both are terrible. If he has a girlfriend, she'd be so pitiful.

224
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,410
Of course she would be.

225
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:32,840
But you sounded as if he would go to you if you confessed. Even if he had a girlfriend.

226
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,290
I did not.

227
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:39,050
And by chance, if any chance we dated like that,

228
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,340
I don't think it will last long if it were an unfaithful relationship.

229
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,090
But I've seen people live happily.

230
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,560
That's so cool!

231
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,600
So freaking awesome.

232
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,700
Watch your language! What did you think about the explosiveness of the unstable atom?

233
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,570
It's freaking awesome!

234
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,380
Water, when it meets with sodium

235
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,280
because sodium is very reactive,

236
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,590
What are you guys doing?

237
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,600
So, sodium hydroxide and sodium gasses are formed.

238
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,810
What did you do just now?

239
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,530
So in that case

240
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:26,300
That is... a sodium explosion experiment.

241
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,730
Sodium? Why does it explode?

242
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,990
They say it explodes because when sodium meets water, it's very reactive.

243
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,750
I mean...

244
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,880
No, what I mean is... why does it explode?

245
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:46,130
That is... what did they say?

246
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:46,960
When water...

247
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,910
Because the condition is unstable.

248
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,440
Oh yeah, because it's unstable.

249
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,670
Why you ask? When heat is applied, then it explodes.

250
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:58,090
Now this time, we're going to drop a bigger piece of sodium.

251
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,520
Let's see how the explosion is different.

252
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,190
What is Ahn Seo Yeon doing?

253
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,250
She said she wants to test the explosion.

254
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,860
Hey, even if it doesn't look like much, it is a dangerous experiment.

255
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,760
The color changed because of the solution.

256
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,620
Then water becomes alkaline if sodium is added.

257
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,550
But since you can do the experiment again here.

258
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,640
After you drop it, you need to run away immediately otherwise you'll get hurt!

259
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,160
After throwing, run immediately.

260
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,870
Okay.

261
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,890
After throwing, run away immediately!

262
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,330
Teacher, she's bleeding.

263
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,460
  We're going to learn about probabilities. 

264
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:21,190
 Firstly, probabilities are like measuring the likelihood that event A will occur,  

265
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,510
 so it's called the probability of event A.  

266
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,020
  After throwing it, run away immediately! 

267
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:47,560
