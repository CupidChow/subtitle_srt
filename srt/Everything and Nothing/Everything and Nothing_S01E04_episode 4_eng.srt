1
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,080
 Yak Jin High School 

2
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,330
I heard you had a fight with Kang Ki Hyun.

3
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,870
My friend before, she started dating Kang Ki Hyun not too long ago.

4
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,880
That's why she was like that to you. Don't think about it too much.

5
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,330
Why?

6
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,620
No, it's nothing.

7
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,760
The kids are looking. Let's not say anything and walk.

8
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,950
You do that with any man,

9
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,880
but are you afraid of rumors spreading at school that you and I went to a motel together?

10
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,190
Go Min Jae.

11
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,620
You said you talk about yourself when you go to those places, right?

12
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,920
Then, let me ask too, Ahn Seo Yeon. Why do you live like that?

13
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,940
What?

14
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,780
What are you going to do if you get caught doing that near your house?

15
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,660
If it's not me, but your mom that you run into, what are you going to do?

16
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,760
My mom?

17
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,700
Sure. If you meet my mom, please tell her.

18
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,990
What her daughter has been up to!

19
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,000
You... right now...

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,580
So, are you hiding the truth because you're worried about me?

21
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,580
You're funny.

22
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,730
I'm not scared at all of the rumors spreading, so say it clearly!

23
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,010
I am sleeping around with men.

24
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,330
Hey, Ahn Seo Yeon!

25
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,490
Why do I do things like that?

26
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,030
Why? Can't I do those things?

27
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,740
Why? Why not?

28
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,150
You didn't even give me money, why are you butting into my business?

29
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,120
Money?

30
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,890
Money. Money!

31
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,830
Okay, here's money. I'll give it to you!

32
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,730
I gave you money, so I can talk now, right?

33
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,180
Do you feel at ease if you think you do those things with guys for money?

34
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,840
Then why did you go to confession at the church?

35
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,100
Didn't you go because you were in pain?

36
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,520
But did you even confess?

37
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,760
Didn't you tell a lie to pastor? Or did you went to confession room

38
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,360
to ask them to understand that you’re in so much pain, that you’re tormented, and that you’re regretting it?

39
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,840
You said you want your mom to know you do that kind of stuff? Don't joke with me!

40
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,290
Then why weren't you able to say anything to your mom after you had your picture taken with me?

41
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:09,550
Why are you so arrogant and what are you so afraid of?

42
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,160
 Mom, I'm sorry about yesterday. 

43
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,860
 Are you going there today? 

44
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,000
 You stay at home and practice. 

45
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:36,620
 Groom: Ahn Gil Hyeong
Bride: Na Se Na  

46
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,870
- Hello. 
 - Congratulations.

47
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,790
Oh yes. Thank you.

48
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,750
Oh, Seo Yeon, you came.

49
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,900
I thought you couldn't come. How'd you make it?

50
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,440
I should come. Congratulations.

51
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,110
Thanks. Really, thanks.

52
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,690
Dad,

53
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,870
can I play the piano later? When you are entering and exiting.

54
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,860
Well, that...

55
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,880
Oh! Your mom, she went on vacation, right?

56
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,590
What?

57
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,350
She didn't go?

58
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,310
Dad!

59
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,280
Oh, Joo Mi.

60
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,880
Greet each other. Seo Yeon is dad's—

61
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,100
I know. Nice to meet you.

62
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,800
I wanted to meet you, and we finally meet!

63
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,770
I heard you also play the piano! I did piano until last year too.

64
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,800
Oh, Joo Mi went to art school but all of a sudden she said she wants to be an ambassador.

65
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,620
So she entered a high school for foreign languages. She's second grade in Hanguk Foreign Language High.

66
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,670
She used to win piano contest a lot and played really well, I heard.

67
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,970
What a shame.

68
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,180
No, no.

69
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:20,430
 From now on... the two of us needs to live together. 

70
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,540
 You don't need that kind of dad, right? 

71
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,300
 But, Seo Yeon. Let's apply for art school with the piano! 

72
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,410
 Art school? You want me to major in piano? 

73
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,050
 You like to play the piano a lot. 

74
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,350
 I already looked into the teachers. 

75
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,320
 We're going to start lessons next week. 

76
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,230
 Oh, but I— 

77
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,600
 If you go to America and go to Music school, how great would that be? 

78
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,740
 I'm not going to think about your dad anymore 

79
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,760
 and only think about you, Seo Yeon. 

80
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,010
 It worked out for the better. 

81
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,400
 Seo Yeon, let's live happily 

82
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,340
 and well together. 

83
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,930
  So that was all because of you. 

84
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,180
  I guess my mom doesn't know though, that you stopped piano. 

85
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,490
 She should've known it better. 

86
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,710
What's this?

87
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,250
What kind of jerk did this?

88
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,760
Excuse me.

89
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,480
The doctor told me I don't be having a period after that.

90
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,600
What's this?

91
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,400
You were a student?

92
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Who are you?

93
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,500
Since that...

94
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,430
You got the wrong person.

95
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,990
What do you mean, the wrong person?

96
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,200
But since you're atudent, you shouldn't do this and study, okay?

97
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,030
What are you going to be when you grow up?

98
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,550
Become an adult. Is there anything else to become?

99
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,260
I was going to say things nicely, but it's not getting through to you, huh?

100
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,170
Does our mom know that you're doing these kinds of things?

101
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,190
My mom?

102
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,220
Yea, I wish she would find out!

103
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,250
That her daughter is doing these things

104
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,970
because my mom is seeing a lot of men so that I can play the piano.

105
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,610
So, go to my mom and please tell her!

106
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,930
Why does everyone know but my mom doesn't?

107
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,750
Is something wrong?

108
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,250
I thought it was a kid I knew, but I got the wrong person.

109
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,140
Are you okay?

110
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,700
Yes. I'm totally fine.

111
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,140
Just go away!

112
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,120
I came to buy something else.

113
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,460
I didn't come to buy a mask.

114
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,850
It's the truth.

115
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,230
I'm not lying, it's the truth!

116
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:23,890
I... I really want to die.

117
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,500
So what if they're adults?

118
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,110
I really want to die.

119
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,120
Me too.

120
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,820
Let's just die. Both of us.

121
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,650
 Paljeon
Hydrochloric acid (0.1 M) 

122
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,400
 Paljeon
Sodium metal in kerosene 

123
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,980
 Oido 

124
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:13,240
The face scar you got by doing the experiment, is it not going away?

125
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,670
They said it'll fade away in a few years and won't be noticeable.

126
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,580
Are you bleeding a lot?

127
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,000
Somewhat.

128
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,200
 Paljeon
Sodium metal in kerosene 

129
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:43,110
If I open it and jump into the sea... It'll cause a really big explosion, right?

130
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,240
Perhaps.

131
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:53,330
Since it exploded a lot when I threw a tiny one into the water before.

132
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,310
Then, will we die immediately?

133
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,340
It'll be the worst if we only get hurt and don't die.

134
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:19,050
The time I went to Dae-gu was because my dad is also there.

135
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:23,470
My mom told me she would stay there for a night, cooking for dad.

136
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,500
I went to see if she really went to Dae-gu.

137
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:36,380
My mom... I was wondering if she went to see her boyfriend by saying she was going to Daegu.

138
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,170
So did you confirm it?

139
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,960
No. My mom was really in Daegu.

140
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,460
Do you have evidence of your mom's affair?

141
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,220
Maybe you're thinking it wrong—

142
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,090
But I saw that guy today.

143
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,610
The guy that my mom's having an affair with.

144
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,870
I saw for the first time, by coincidence.

145
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,100
My mom... was smiling.

146
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't remember her smiling at home.

147
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:28,820
When I went to Daegu... no, even before that,

148
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:33,770
I looked at my mom's phone and her wallet

149
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:38,570
to find evidence of her affair

150
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,510
but when I actually saw with my own eyes...

151
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,060
At first... At first, I got angry

152
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:58,430
but after some time, now

153
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,400
I feel so sorry for my mom.

154
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,370
I just feel so sorry for her.

155
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,080
My dad got married today.

156
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,060
It's the truth.

157
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,350
With the woman he had an affair with, he got married.

158
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,940
My mom pretended to be cool and said she was going to the wedding and told me to not go.

159
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,750
But I went there after fighting with you today.

160
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:56,270
If my mom came, I was going to smile in front of her

161
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,960
and play the wedding march.

162
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,760
But,

163
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,290
she didn't come.

164
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,590
She never intended to go.

165
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,160
But that woman's daughter was playing the piano today.

166
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,000
She majored in piano in music school until last year.

167
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,410
That's how I knew,

168
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:36,500
why my mom

169
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,270
all of a sudden, told me to go to music school.

170
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,530
To major in piano.

171
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,100
The woman my dad had an affair with,

172
00:20:52,920 --> 00:21:00,310
the woman that my dad seduced, because her daughter played piano, to play better than her

173
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,730
and make it seem like we were living a better life.

174
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,400
But she said she quit piano to do something else.

175
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,490
But my mom doesn't know that yet.

176
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:32,550
I'm angry at my mom, too. I hate her,

177
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,830
but I feel sorry for her.

178
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,130
Why do I feel so sorry for my mom?

179
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,940
What is that?

180
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,730
It's all the money I got til now.

181
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,670
It includes the money my mom's boyfriends gave me.

182
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,290
I didn't spend any of it.

183
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,640
What are you going to do with it?

184
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,840
I'm not sure. I haven't thought about it.

185
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,000
I've only thought 'it's money I can't spend'.

186
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,610
What's wrong?

187
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,390
No, I suddenly remembered something.

188
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,320
What is it?

189
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,460
No, it's

190
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,560
when I was about three years old,

191
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,750
I went to the zoo with mom and dad.

192
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:34,450
I approached a monkey to feed water in front of the monkey cage.

193
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,030
But the monkey extended his hand through the bars...

194
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,760
He grabbed my hair really tight.

195
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,150
Really? Then?

196
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:49,090
My mom screamed and staffs rushed to me and it was chaotic.

197
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:55,030
But in fact, my mom bit the monkey's hand.

198
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,560
So it released my hair.

199
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:03,290
Really? She bit monkey's hand?

200
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,780
My mom is no joke.

201
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,680
No matter how urgent it was, how could she bite monkey's hand?

202
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:17,140
I went to a zoo for a field trip during kindergarten. My mom accompanied us.

203
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,080
But I think I disliked that she came with us.

204
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,800
When I look at the picture I took back then, I was making a face on all of them.

205
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,610
Without smiling at all.

206
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,550
You don't smile well even now.

207
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:38,800
In any case, when I look at those pictures, I'm curious to

208
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,380
why she came to filed trips.

209
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,560
Does my mom like me that much?

210
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,150
They must be so worried because we're missing, right?

211
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:04,050
With the fact that I attended my dad's wedding,

212
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,480
my mom may punish me by cut all of my hair off.

213
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,760
If you're bald, a monkey won't be able to grab your hair at least.

214
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,330
What? That's not funny.

215
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:24,250

Here we go.

219
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,350
One, two...

220
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,690
Three! Run!

221
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:01,310

♫  The night comes back and I am alone again  ♫

226
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,160
♫  how depressed   ♫

227
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:43,190
♫  I can remember the time  ♫

♫  Yesterday, today and tomorrow  ♫

00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:57,330
♫  Why am I the only one stay behind?  ♫

231
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,950
♫  It's not too late for us  ♫

232
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:06,510
♫  As if we're alone  ♫

233
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:11,220

♫  Cheer up  ♫

235
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,860
Let's stop here. Let's move on to study the basics of statistics.

236
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,520
Open to page 80.

237
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,560
 Probabilities 

238
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,690
 One fact I discovered later. 

239
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:29,400
 Oido is an island and a land at the same time. 

240
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:37,100
 It used be an island but people filled up 

241
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,710
 and connect it to the land. 

242
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,550
 Which means, Oido is not an island 

243
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,520
 nor a land. 

244
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,860
 Being seventeen is the same. 

245
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,620
 National Registary Office 

246
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,660
 It's the age that is not an adult nor a child. 

247
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:05,430
♫  Hope it will come true sometime  ♫

248
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,790
♫  I will be like it  ♫

249
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,270
 When will we become adults? 

250
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,090
 To my mom 

251
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:15,520
♫  I am dreaming  ♫

252
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,720
 Will it be a moment to turn into an adult? 

253
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:36,930
 I don't know it exactly but I at least know one thing. 

254
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:51,550
 Even though I don't know when I will be an adult and when is that moment. 

255
00:28:54,550 --> 00:29:03,130
 But we all turn into adults someday. 

256
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:14,620
♫  You must be having hard time  ♫

257
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:23,370
♫  I feel sorry for your sunken sholders  ♫

258
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:31,690
♫  To be honest, I know how lonely you feel  ♫
