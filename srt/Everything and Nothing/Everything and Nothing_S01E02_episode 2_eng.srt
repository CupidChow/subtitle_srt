1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:07,210


2
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,310
Min Jae,

3
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,790
your father is here.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,880
Dad came for a funeral.

5
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,310
He's going to sleep here tonight and leave by train at dawn.

6
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,440
You came?

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,220
Yeah, you're coming now?

8
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,730
You should at least leave a pair of my clothes here.

9
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,040
You said you won't be coming to Seoul and took it all.

10
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,540
- Water. 
 - Okay.

11
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,090
- It's salty! 
 - It's salty?

12
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,560
You didn't try tasting it?

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,790
I couldn't eat the yukgaejang (spicy beef soup) at the funeral because it was too salty.

14
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,710
Why does everyone make their food so salty?

15
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,840
Oh no... Hold on for a moment.

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,020
Never mind. I'll just put rice.

17
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,810
Go Min Jae.

18
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,620
Yes?

19
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,260
Are you studying hard?

20
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,200
I heard you started tutoring.

21
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,980
Yes.

22
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:14,050
  I'm going to go to Daegu and make some side dishes for your dad. 

23
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,750
  I'm going to stay one night there. 

24
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,550
  You should go with dad when he goes. Why go separately? 

25
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,770
  Okay. 

26
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,980
Are you feeling very sick?

27
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,370
Okay, you should go to the hospital. Rest well and I'll see you tomorrow. You can leave.

28
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,030
Yes.

29
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,890
Okay.

30
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,340
 010-5208 

31
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,750
 1304 

32
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,870
 Call  

33
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,790
 010-5208-1304  

34
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,000
 Dial  

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,800
 Connecting  

36
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,420
  Hello? 

37
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,390
  This station is Seoul station. 

38
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,990
 We are now approaching Seoul station.  

39
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,310
 Hello passengers.  

40
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,680
 We will be arriving  

41
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,480
 at Dongdaegu station shortly.   

42
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,080
 Please remain seated until then.  

43
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,910
Hello.

44
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,110
 Dongdaegu station 

45
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,090
 Hello to all our passengers. 

46
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:20,070
 Our crew will be doing its best to provide all passengers with a comfortable and safe trip. 

47
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,380
I forced you to join this useless competition just because I wanted you to gain stage experience.

48
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,890
You didn't even get first place but got second?

49
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,120
What does that make me?

50
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,920
Who do you feel so embarrassed in front of? Dad?

51
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,450
Why does your dad come out in this situation?

52
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,370
I can't stand straight in front of your teacher who worked so hard to teach you.

53
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,700
We give her money.

54
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,030
What?

55
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:56,010
You are paying her for the lesson. Why do you care so much about how she would think? She teaches me for money.

56
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,960
We got what we need for each other already. Why do you feel embarrassed?

57
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,900
You, really!

58
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,200
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

59
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,660
  Did you get home? 

60
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,490
  Lock the doors, and before going to tutoring tomorrow, 

61
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,830
  make sure to go to the chapel. 

62
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,540
  Okay. 

63
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,770
 We are approaching the last stop, Seoul Station. 

64
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:07,370
 Thank you all passengers for using KORAIL today. 

65
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,590
 KORAIL is doing its best to provide its passengers with a happy trip.  

66
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,930
 We're approaching our final destination, Seoul Station. 

67
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,950
Hi.

68
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,880
Hi.

69
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,200
Who is it?

70
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,390
A friend from school.

71
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,230
Hello.

72
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,840
Hi.

73
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,040
Hold this.

74
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,750
Let's go.

75
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,400
No. I'll go.

76
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,440
I don't know. I am so sad.

77
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,800
Let's talk when we meet.

78
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,960
See you soon!

79
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,930
I'm going to go somewhere. Take the taxi home first.

80
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,710
Where do you live?

81
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,050
Soo Yoo Dong.

82
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,580
Is that so?

83
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,630
Then go by taxi with your friend.

84
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,640
I'm going.

85
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,670
I'll take the subway home. Train line four takes me there.

86
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,630
I'm going.

87
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,980
Where did you go before?

88
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,270
What?

89
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,890
Where did you go? You didn't go to school?

90
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,780
I had something to take care of.

91
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,700
Where was it?

92
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,630
Dae-gu.

93
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,320
I also took the train from Dae-gu.

94
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:04,910
Really?

95
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,830
I didn't know. I was sleeping the whole time and saw you when we were about to get off.

96
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,640
I'm also going to take the subway.

97
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,770
Let's go together.

98
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,060
It's this way.

99
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,720
I know.

100
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,440
Have you been to Oido?

101
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,590
No.

102
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,140
Is Oido an island?

103
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,910
  Danggogae
Sanggye  

104
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,860
  Oido 

105
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,020
Probably?

106
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,800
Were we in the same class in eighth grade?

107
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,760
Also in ninth grade.

108
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,740
Really? Ninth grade too?

109
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,090
I don't remember.

110
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,750
You played the piano for our class during a singing contest

111
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,540
but you quit it because you had to prepare for artist high school.

112
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,990
Oh right.

113
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,110
 The 17th Daegu Music Federation Competition  

114
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,070
Want me to show this to you?

115
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,320
 Certificate of Award 

116
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,750
You received an award.

117
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,570
You heard everything before.

118
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,260
What?

119
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,370
But... I don't need it.

120
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,250
    
  Now, for Oido... 

121
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,030
    
  A train for Oido is coming.  

122
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,690
 Please watch out for your steps when you get on. 

123
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,590
You go first, I'm going to the convenience store.

124
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,500
Oh, okay.

125
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,320
Bye.

126
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,820
  Ahn Seo Yeon 

127
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,310
 Confessional 

128
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,210
You're doing well.

129
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:17,750
When the students' grade goes up, I give a reward so they'll do better the next time.

130
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,310
So look forward to it if you get first grade for this coming exam.

131
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,960
Look at your expression.

132
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,330
Are you saying you don't want a reward?

133
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,750
No, that's not what I mean.

134
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,380
When I looked up your school,

135
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,480
the student that placed 1st all three years

136
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,240
applied for Seoul University but he failed due to lack of SAT score.

137
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,690
It doesn't make any sense not getting 1st grade for school evaluation.

138
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,730
Once you receive a reward, you'll try harder to receive another one the next time.

139
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,700
So look forward to it, okay?

140
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,380
Solve it. I won't talk to you.

141
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,030
 Dad, what time did mom take the train? 

142
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,770
 Dawn Moss Cafe. 

143
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,570
  Americano, two cups. 

144
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,290
Min Jae.

145
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,120
You are here.

146
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,780
Did you go to tutoring?

147
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,630
Yes.

148
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,870
 How to solve cell phone lock patterns? 

149
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:29,180
 Dawn Moss Cafe 

150
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,950
  She left in the morning. Why? 

151
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,180
  Did she not arrive yet? 

152
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,870
  She arrived. 

153
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,160
 Happy Home 

154
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,060
 The end. No more. 

155
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,030
How can it be so hard?

156
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,290
You surprised me.

157
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,010
Go Min Jae, why are you leaving by yourself? Did you fail the test?

158
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,630
Just because.

159
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,920
I screwed up math again.

160
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,500
Do you want to play a game of soccer?

161
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,230
No.

162
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,960
Why not?

163
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,390
Just because.

164
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,110
Hey, why do you always say 'just because'?

165
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,170
Then, PC gaming?

166
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,030
Behind you.

167
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,380
Look around yourself.

168
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,360
Ah, right. I got my ID.

169
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,380
When is your birthday?

170
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,060
Next month. It's on May 13th.

171
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,260
Call me Hyung until then. You don't have an ID yet.

172
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,650
But, how old am I?

173
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,060
What?

174
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,900
When someone asked how old we are, we answer seventeen.

175
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,160
But some entered school at the age of eight, so we could answer we're eighteen.

176
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,750
But since our birthday hasn't passed yet, so we could be sixteen.

177
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,640
How old are we?

178
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,630
I don't know. In any case, you have to pass the seventeenth's birthday to get an ID.

179
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,900
It approves that I am an adult, and you're a minor.

180
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,580
That's all you need to know, Minor Go Min Jae.

181
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,050
Ah, right. I have something to buy.

182
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,540
How much does it cost?

183
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,980
You can't buy this.

184
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,060
Ah! Here you go.

185
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,950
No, you are a minor.

186
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,750
What? Why not?

187
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,080
I heard that once I get an ID, I am okay to buy it.

188
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,750
We don't sell it to minors.

189
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,000
Minors can also buy it.

190
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,220
Anyone can buy this regardless of age.

191
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,430
No, you cannot.

192
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,480
This is not permitted because of special function but a general type is okay for anyone.

193
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,660
Then, why don't you confirm it?

194
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,180
If you want to buy it, go get one with general types. Put this back.

195
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:48,010
Yes, that is okay.

196
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,250
I've checked. General types can be purchased without age restriction.

197
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,510
5,000 won, please.

198
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,600
Here. Thank you.

199
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,130
Okay.

200
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,710
Ahn Seo Yeon, thank you.

201
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,250
For what?

202
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,390
How do you know that? Have you bought it?

203
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,090
There is nothing difference an ID makes.

204
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,060
I know, right? I was going to buy this as a commemoration of getting an ID.

205
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,730
Oh, how unfair... But what did you come here to buy?

206
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,650
I am leaving.

207
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,360
Bye!

208
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,120
It's 1,000 won.

209
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,200
Ahn Seo Yeon is really awesome.

210
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,420
How so?

211
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,560
I thought she is a weirdo ever since that explosion experiment.

212
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,610
Did you read the question? Someone was asking if Ahn Seo Yeon has a boyfriend.

213
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,230
To be honest with you, it was made-up by me.

214
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,390
What? Why do you do that as an admin?

215
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,490
I'm curious if she has a boyfriend.

216
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,490
You have a girlfriend.

217
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,600
She is not a person who would let me use this.

218
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,840
What?

219
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,550
I don't know... Yesterday while talking to my girlfriend on the phone, I almost got caught by my mom.

220
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,630
I made up an excuse but I think she might have gotten the idea.

221
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,490
I messed up the test big time.

222
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,830
Once I get the test result, my mom will be mad at me.

223
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,150
Oh so annoying!

224
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,030
Anyways...

225
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,730
Ah, my girlfriend wants to see me.

226
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,170
Hyung is leaving! Bye!

227
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,190
This is a nice gift from Hyung!

228
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,550
What is this?

229
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,620
Kang Ki Hyun, you really...

230
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,320
He should've thrown it away by himself.

231
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,300
I am back home.

232
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,560
You came home after relaxing around because your test is done.

233
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,790
You did well on your Math test?

234
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,410
Well, just so so.

235
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,760
How can you say like that when you're getting so expensive tutoring. You could've said...

236
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,870
You're so like your father.

237
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,460
Does your voice wear out if you talk more?

238
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,640
Min Jae.

239
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,610
Sorry.

240
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,820
You need to wear fall uniforms from next week, right? Give me the jacket. Let me take it to a cleaner.

241
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,940
Why?

242
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,050
Nothing! Just go inside and study.

243
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:22,830
 Min Jae, I know that you have now grown up and I understand that you will be interested in such things. 

244
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:28,000
 But, please do it after you have gone to college when you have become an adult. 

245
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,060
 Got it? 

246
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:34,190
 I am not going to tell to Dad, please keep your senses, Go Min Jae. 

247
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,330
  It's a nice present from Hyung. 

248
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,930
 qMy friend was playing a trick, sorry. 

249
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:21,660
 I love you, son. 

250
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,820
 Me too. 

251
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,370
Chang Soo. Chang Soo, here's yours.

252
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,330
Min Jae, Min Jae... Oh, Min Jae!

253
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,930
You did well in your math test.

254
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,790
Good job.

255
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,110
Ki Hyun. What a shame.

256
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,420
You, study some more!

257
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,040
As I said during class, there was some trouble with balancing the difficulty of the math test.

258
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,320
Only eighteen people on ranks should get first grade, but there are four people scored the same on 18th rank.

259
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,120
So they all got second grade.

260
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,490
We have one person belonging to that.

261
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,350
I will work hard to make it up for the next test.

262
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,750
Today, go home and explain it well to your parents.

263
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,870
Got it?

264
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,370
Have a good weekend and I'll see you next week. Bye.

265
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,300
Thank you.

266
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,290
You all worked hard.

267
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,120
You got the first rank in the test, right?

268
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,860
Well, just like that.

269
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,550
Oh, congrats!

270
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,150
What the homeroom teacher said before, it's me.

271
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,890
The person who got second grade due to the same score.

272
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:02,610
Oh, darn it, if my mom gets to know, she will throw a fit.

273
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:07,720
I expected to get first grade this time but because of foolish homeroom teacher...

274
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,590
The test, didn't you say you failed it?

275
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,880
No, when I checked after I got home, I found out I calculated wrong.

276
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:25,870
I feel so depressed today. Treat me a game.

277
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,460
  The tutor told me to come tonight. 

278
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,160
  Why? For a lesson? 

279
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,330
  I think he's going to treat me to a meal. 

280
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,740
  He told me he'll give me a reward if I get first rank. 

281
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,720
 Okay, get there safely and tell him that we are grateful. 

282
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,880
 This stop is Daechi. 

283
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,510
 It's Daechi Station. 

284
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,020
 The exit doors are on your left. 

285
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,230
 This stop is... 

286
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:54,830
  I gave the keys to the front desk, so go on inside when you get there. 

287
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:22,470
  Min Jae, since you got first rank, I'll give you a reward like I promised. 

288
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,450
  Since I'm not coming here today, enjoy to your heart's content 

289
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,880
  and don't worry about cleaning up. 

290
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:33,830
 Use the bathroom for your convenience. Just remember that you wrote me a memorandum. 

291
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,610
 All my students sign this. 

292
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:06,220
 It's kind of like a promise that one will never reveal about what happened here. 

293
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:12,960
 Once you get a reward once, you will do even better next time because you want to get the reward again. 

294
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,960
 So, look forward to it. 

295
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:26,140

296
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:35,700
♫  Right, it must have been really hard for you  ♫

297
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,000
♫  Depressed  ♫
