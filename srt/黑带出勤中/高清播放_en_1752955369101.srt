FIRST PLACE
REGULAR PROMOTION TEST AWARD

2
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,170
Having fun is important to me.

3
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,880
Doing something fun makes me happy.

4
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,920
Happy people are healthy people,

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,720
which is why,

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,890
for the sake of my health and happiness,
I only do fun stuff.

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,520
And there's nothing I love more
than sports and e-sports.

8
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,730
Do you know why?

9
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,230
Because I always win.

10
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,380
The head!

11
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,770
The head!

12
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,240
Break!

13
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,280
Red wins!

14
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,910
Are you okay?

15
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,830
Great match.

16
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,120
Sure.

17
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,550
Enemy entering the compound.
One down. Another one down.

18
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,680
I'm down. Back me up quickly.

19
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,350
Hey! They're using smoke and moving in.
We can't keep them out.

20
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,970
-I'm down.
-I see one moving in.

21
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,140
-I'll throw a grenade. Fall back.
-Okay, I'm heading to the stairs.

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,940
Damn, I'm down.

23
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,270
They're closing in on you!

24
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,730
You're all dead meat.

25
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,150
Go, Diarrhea.

26
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,820
One down.

27
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,950
Be quiet, guys!

28
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,120
Quiet, you pricks!

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,240
One more down! I got them all!

30
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,040
DAD

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,080
Hey.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay, I'll come now. All right.

33
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,540
I'll be right back.

34
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,710
-Be quick.
-All right.

35
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,020
MIGHTY CHICKEN

36
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,230
-Be safe.
-Okay!

37
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,750
Hey, Auntie.

38
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,930
This is on the house.

39
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,430
Oh my. You read my mind.

40
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,680
Hey! Come get your roots done next week.

41
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,270
Should I?

42
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,570
Hey, I'm on my way now.

43
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,320
We're playing now.

44
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,780
Hurry up.

45
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,860
He wants you to hurry.

46
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,780
All right.

47
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,410
Stop. That's enough!

48
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,410
Fuck! Why are you messing with me?

49
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,330
Fuck you!

50
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,420
What do we have here?

51
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,970
You son of a bitch!

52
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,590
Come at me.

53
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,510
Bring it on. Goddamn it!

54
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:16,850
Son of a bitch.

55
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,270
Damn it! Get off me!

56
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,360
-Fuck, get off!
-Stop!

57
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,520
Fuck!

58
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,400
Let me…

59
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,110
Fine. I'll go.

60
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,700
Damn it.

61
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,370
I won't cuff you, so let's just go.

62
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,410
Okay.

63
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,630
Fuck!

64
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Fuck you.

65
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,590
-Fuck!
-Hey now.

66
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,970
You son of a bitch!

67
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,260
All right, stop! Break it up!

68
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,270
He's hurt.

69
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,810
Who the fuck are you?

70
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,690
You son of a bitch.

71
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,730
-You piece of--
-Stop.

72
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,490
Who is this jerk?

73
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,710
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

74
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,420
-Thank you.
-No problem.

75
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,670
You helped us prevent a crisis.
Thank you so much.

76
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,010
Sure. No problem.

77
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,340
On the count of three.

78
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,050
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROBATION OFFICE

79
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,640
Three, two, one.

80
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,600
-His physique is impressive.
-I know.

81
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,980
-Thank you so much.
-My pleasure.

82
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,230
-Take care.
-Thank you.

83
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,690
This is my manager.

84
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,690
I see.

85
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,730
-Jung-do. It's so nice to meet you.
-Hello.

86
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,240
I'm Kim Sun-min, manager
of the Electronic Monitoring Division.

87
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,450
I see.

88
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,080
Could you spare a few minutes?

89
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,990
Sure.

90
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,500
There are about 5,000 ex-cons
wearing electronic ankle tags nationwide.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,710
They've committed violent crimes
like sexual violence or homicide.

92
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,300
Their recidivism rate is high.
That's why probation officers like me…

93
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,880
MANAGER KIM SUN-MIN
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

94
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,220
…monitor them 24-7,
using GPS-enabled ankle monitors.

95
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,180
Then the guy I helped that day
must also be--

96
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,560
That was Mr. Cho,
our martial arts officer.

97
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,150
The ex-cons we monitor
cause trouble from time to time.

98
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,400
When that occurs,
we must rush to the scene promptly

99
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,070
and take care of it
to ensure public safety.

100
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,910
But middle-aged men
with beer bellies like me

101
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,910
aren't really capable of overpowering
or catching them, you know.

102
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,500
That's why each probation officer works
with a strong young partner.

103
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,670
We call them martial arts officers.

104
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,300
I see. "Martial arts officers."

105
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,720
What do you do for a living, Jung-do?

106
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,760
I work as a deliveryman
for my father's chicken joint.

107
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:05,810
Well, Mr. Cho said
it looked like you do tae kwon do or judo.

108
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,520
Is that true?

109
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,190
Yes. I'm a third dan
in both tae kwon do and judo.

110
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,320
Wow!

111
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,320
A third dan in kendo too.

112
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,530
Could I ask you a favor?

113
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,780
No.

114
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,080
Yes, of course. Ask away.

115
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,710
The thing is,

116
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,040
the martial arts officers in our division
are on a triple-shift rotation.

117
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,840
But with Mr. Cho injured,

118
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,840
the other two martial arts officers
must work 12-hour shifts for five weeks.

119
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,850
They'll work a 12-hour shift,

120
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,020
then return 12 hours later,
repeating the cycle.

121
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,390
-That's intense.
-Exactly.

122
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,270
Our work isn't easy.

123
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,940
Realistically, it's impossible
to find a replacement

124
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,780
for just the five weeks
Mr. Cho needs to recover.

125
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,900
But Mr. Cho told me

126
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,700
that when he saw you
take down the ex-con that day,

127
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:08,500
he thought it would be great
if you could lend us a hand.

128
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,000
Wait. But do I qualify?

129
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,760
You can apply
to become a martial arts officer

130
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,090
with a third dan or higher
in tae kwon do, kendo, judo, or hapkido.

131
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,300
You most definitely qualify, Jung-do.

132
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,100
But is it…

133
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,730
Well, is it fun? That's important to me.

134
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,110
The definition of "fun"
can be different for everyone.

135
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,900
But I promise you

136
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,530
that it's a rewarding job
that we're proud to do.

137
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,490
We're keeping innocent people safe,
you know?

138
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,620
Well, is that fun?

139
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,210
I think

140
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,380
you'll learn a lot while working with us.

141
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,390
I've researched extensively
for my stories.

142
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,520
People wearing ankle tags
are serious criminals.

143
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,520
Your job would be catching them,
so it might suit you well.

144
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,480
-Why?
-You love thrilling activities.

145
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,690
-I think you'd like it too.
-Right?

146
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,570
What's your take
on me as a martial arts officer?

147
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,660
-Triple shift sounds tough.
-Why would it be tough?

148
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,490
-It'll ruin his sleep cycle.
-Diarrhea is fit. He'll be fine.

149
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,410
-I'll be fine.
-It'd still be hard.

150
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,040
Can you stop being so indecisive?

151
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,620
How about you stop being bossy?

152
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,080
You're making me like that.

153
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,720
I'd have to go catch them
if things went south.

154
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,680
What do you think, Dad?

155
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,390
I'd be happy to see you
take on new challenges and learn.

156
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,980
You received a commendation.
I'm proud of you.

157
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,140
Really?

158
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,440
Give it a shot.

159
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,320
I'll manage this place. Don't worry.

160
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,780
All right.

162
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,580
Can I have your attention for a moment?

163
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,420
This is Mr. Lee Jung-do.
He'll help us while Mr. Cho is recovering.

164
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,550
Let's give him a warm round of applause.

165
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,010
Hello.

166
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,930
Meet Mr. Huh Dong-won,
our senior martial arts officer.

167
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,930
Hello.

168
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,150
Mr. Huh will show you
how to use the program.

169
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,060
Okay.

170
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,400
-Take good care of him.
-Don't worry, sir.

171
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,240
There. All those ex-cons
are under surveillance.

172
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,740
One of them raped a ten-year-old boy,

173
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,950
and another killed his own parents.

JANG HO-SIK
87%/HOMICIDE

175
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,670
When the ankle tag's battery drops to 30%,
these icons turn yellow.

176
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,760
Then we call them and ask them nicely
to recharge their ankle tags.

177
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,340
But what would you do
if they refused to recharge it?

178
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,220
Go there?

179
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,350
-Yes.
-Go there.

180
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,270
Right.

181
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,310
You'll be overwhelmed
if I explain everything now.

182
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,980
For now, if you're unsure of anything,
just ask Mr. Kim.

183
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,730
Okay.

184
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,730
Good.

185
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm just calling
because your battery is at 30% now.

186
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,460
You should recharge it.

187
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,840
You're out with a friend? I see.

188
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,170
-He's doing better than expected.
-Really?

189
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,180
I'm so glad to hear that.

190
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,980

DATE OF BIRTH - MAY 24, 2003

193
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,740
He's 20?

194
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,280
How did it go?

195
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,740
I told Choi Jong-hwa to go home.

196
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,500
But he swore at me and pushed me,
so I had to struggle a little.

197
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,390
Hello?

198
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,260
Is this Mr. Lee Yang-ho?

199
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,520
-Yes.
-All right.

200
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,020
I'm calling to remind you
to recharge your ankle tag.

201
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,230
-Who is it, babe?
-I didn't order any jjajangmyeon.

202
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,690
Wait…

203
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,280
Jjajangmyeon?

204
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,860
REDIAL

205
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,280
The call got disconnected.

206
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,540
I heard you, motherfucker. Beat it.

207
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,080
Hello?

208
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,510
This phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

209
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,050
Extra charges may apply.

210
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,260
-Send a text.
-Yes, sir.

211
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,180
-And--
-Mr. Kim.

212
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,020
We should go.

213
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,890
What? Go where?

214
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,860
Mr. Lee Yang-ho hung up on me twice.

215
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,400
-When was he released?
-Three months ago.

216
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,360
He seemed to be behaving
when we talked last week.

217
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,950
-Give Jung-do what he needs.
-Yes, sir.

218
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,330
-Let's meet in the parking lot.
-Yes, sir.

219
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,540
-Come with me.
-Sure.

220
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,220
-A stab-proof vest.
-Right.

221
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,130
It's heavy.

222
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,640
Can this really stop a knife?

223
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,640
It prevents cuts,

224
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,770
but a strong stab
can still cause bruising.

225
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,940
Don't forget to turn on your bodycam
before moving in.

226
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,190
Here's your Taser.

227
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,070
Can I actually use it?

228
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,200
If Mr. Kim permits, yes.

229
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
Put it in here.

230
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,700
How did he end up in jail?

231
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,370
He raped a middle school girl.

232
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,880
Whoa.

233
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,760
Is it okay if I use the Taser?

234
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,590
Only if it's absolutely necessary.

235
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:39,390
Our priority is to monitor the ex-cons
and keep them out of trouble.

236
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,390
Right.

237
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,660
What is it, Jung-do?
Did you see something?

238
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,870
This is unit 201, where Lee Yang-ho lives.

239
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,460
I've delivered to many buildings,
so I get the gist with a glance.

240
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,420
If you take a look,
there are no security grilles.

241
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,460
Look. This unit has them.

242
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,760
He removed them intentionally to escape.

243
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,050
If you knock on his door,

244
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,770
he'll probably sneak out through here,
so I'll wait here and catch him.

245
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,020
What if he uses the door?

246
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,270
Then I'll run in right away.

247
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,110
Yes.

248
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,830
Hey, stop.

249
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,210
Lee Yang-ho.

250
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,170
-Open the door.
-It's nothing.

251
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,970
I know you're inside.

252
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,430
You're inside, right?

253
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,310
-Fucking bastard.
-I know what's up.

254
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,020
Yang-ho, I know you're…

255
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,020
Fuck.

256
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,360
You son of a bitch!

257
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,990
Fuck, I told you not to come.

258
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,900
-Help!
-You piece of shit.

259
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,320
-Open it, and you're dead!
-Open!

260
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,410
-Get lost, fucking asshole.
-Lee Yang-ho.

261
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,660
Open the door now!

262
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,040
No!

263
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,160
What is it? What's wrong?

264
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,580
Open the door! Open up!

265
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,630
Mister, please help me.

266
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,090
-Shit.
-Please.

267
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,490
That's dope!

268
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,790
Mr. Kim.

269
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,130
Lee Yang-ho, you are under arrest
for violating electronic monitoring terms

270
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,380
and disobeying
your probation officer's instructions.

271
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,300
You have the right to remain silent.

272
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,720
Anything you say can
and will be used against you in court.

273
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,600
You have the right to an attorney.

-"What"?
-Yeah, what are you gonna do, huh?

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,290
Calm down. You need to relax.

288

I'm not trying to provoke you, moron.
Show me what you've got!

295
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,490
Don't be. That was cool.

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,200

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,700

How about a drink and some pork belly?

298
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,210
I'm supposed to meet up with my friends.

299
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,290
Another time, then.

300
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,080
Could you take us all out for dinner?

I'm Writer K.
I've heard so much about you.

00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,780
I'm Kim Sun-min. It's nice to meet you.

311
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,950
Hello, I'm Moisture.
Thank you for inviting us.

312
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,580
My pleasure.
Anyway, why are you called "Moisture"?

313
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,460
His nose is always wet.
That's why he is Moisture.

314
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,000
No one knows whether it's sweat or grease.

315
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,800
I say it's half-sweat, half-grease.

316
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,800
-And this is Earthworm.
-"Earthworm"?

317
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,890
I only squirm when I'm stepped on.

318
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,560
He's too nice. He never gets angry.

319
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,350
All right, guys. Take a seat.

320
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,270
Okay.

321
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,940
-Please, sir.
-Yes, of course.

322
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,860
What are you in the mood for?

323
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,030
We can start with the savory combination
of water celery and pork belly,

324
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,490
move to the spicy kimchi stew
to cut the grease,

325
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,330
and end with the crispy fried rice.

326
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,580
I think it's a perfectly balanced meal
with carbs, protein, and fat.

327
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,670
-Order anything you want.
-Thank you.

328
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,920
No problem.

329
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,670
Like he was telling a story.

330
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,130
-Twenty servings?
-And five servings of kimchi stew.

331
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,680
-Twenty-five servings in total?
-Yes, including five servings of stew.

332
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,180
Let me pour you one.

333
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,770
I don't have the enzymes
to break down alcohol.

334
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,440
But I party harder than the drunk.

335
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,150
Okay, all right. Here.

336
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,190
Thank you.

337
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,730
It's so nice to meet you, Moisture.

338
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,190
-Earthworm too.
-Likewise.

339
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,860
-All right, shall we drink?
-Yes.

340
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,370
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

341
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,420
I did some research on probation officers
while working on a script some time ago.

342
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,330
Right. I see.

343
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,260
It's a very stressful job
that involves dangerous tasks.

344
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,380
Why did you decide to become one?

345
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,680
I was in a car accident when I was little.

346
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,100
You see, our car wasn't even moving.

347
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,890
But this car came out of nowhere
and crashed into ours!

348
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,020
The rear doors caved in,
and I couldn't move as my legs were stuck.

349
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,820
Then the engine caught fire.

350
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,490
I was only ten.

351
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,030
A ten-year-old boy thought he was dying.

352
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,780
"Is this how I die?"

353
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:00,580
"If I'd known I'd end up like this,
I would've played more games!"

354
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,670
I had my money from New Years
saved up in a drawer.

355
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,130
I couldn't stop thinking about it!

356
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,000
Anyway, at that moment,

357
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,510
some cops showed up
and tore the door off to save me.

358
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,970
So I told myself
I'd become a police officer

359
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,560
to save people
and repay the favor I had received.

360
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,650
But the accident damaged
the growth plate in my left leg,

361
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:31,440
so it's shorter than my right leg.

362
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,950
I knew I wouldn't be able to run around
to catch criminals,

363
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,080
so I did a lot of thinking
to figure out what I could do.

364
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,500
That's when I learned
about probation officers.

365
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,670
Contributing to reducing recidivism
deeply motivated me.

366
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,220
After I got married and became a father,
my job became even more meaningful to me.

367
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,470
Why is that?

368
00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:00,220
Several of the ex-convicts we monitor
are child sex offenders.

369
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:05,640
I want to build a world where children
are always safe and protected.

370
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,370
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

371
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,250
Let's do this.

372
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,210
You know, what we want

373
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,210
is to call you our big brother.

374
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
Garlic too.

375
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,590
But in order to do so,
you have to pass a test first.

376
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,180
Add some more.

377
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:44,180
This lettuce wrap is filled
with loyalty, friendship, and sincerity.

378
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,560
All you have to do
is eat this in one bite.

379
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,150
Open up.

380
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,370
Big bro!

381
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,030
This is way too big!

382
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,330
Big bro!

383
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,850
LOW BATTERY DETECTED

384
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,680
HAN JUN-GU
30%/KIDNAPPING

385
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,730
This phone is turned off. Please leave--

386
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,690
Han Jun-gu's battery is at 30%,
but his phone is off.

387
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,280
What is this?

388
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,830
Who is it?

389
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,040
MIN DO-WOONG

390
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,250
Thank you for such a great meal.

391
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,080
-What are you guys doing?
-Thanks for the dinner, big bro!

392
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,330
You're making me blush.

393
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,250
You'd really be going wild
if I had treated you to beef.

394
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,550
ASSISTANT MANAGER YOON DONG-JU

395
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,010
Hey.

396
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,010
Sir, where are you?

397
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,970
What's up?

398
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,520
An ex-con is unreachable,
so we have to go to Bukrin-dong.

399
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,690
But Min Do-woong from Seorin-dong
is out and about after curfew.

400
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,770
He's not answering.

401
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,280
I'm actually in Seorin-dong now,
so I'll go.

402
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,240
What did Min Do-woong do time for?

403
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,490
Involuntary manslaughter, 20 years.
He was released three months ago.

404
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,950
Does he have a grudge
against someone in Seorin-dong?

405
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,950
I haven't figured that out yet. I'm sorry.

406
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,790
Okay. Got it.

407
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,420
Big bro, we can get there
in five minutes if we run.

408
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,510
One minute will do.

409
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,390
CRIME CATEGORY - MANSLAUGHTER

410
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,440
You guys stay in the car. It's dangerous.

411
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,020
-Yes, sir.
-We'll be back.

412
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,950
-That way.
-Okay.

413
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,580
What's happening?

414
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,290
He cut the tag off.

415
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,340
How do we find him?

416
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,380
-Let's go see.
-Okay.

417
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,220
Hey, over here.

418
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,180
He cut it off with a knife.

419
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,940
Should we call the cops?

420
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,070
No, he must be close. Let's find him fast.

421
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,700
Hey, Moisture has a drone.
Why don't we use it?

422
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,330
-Would it help?
-Let's give it a shot.

423
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,290
-You can view it here.
-Okay.

424
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,180
Here.

425
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,970
-Can you fly it here?
-Yes.

426
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:13,980
That must be him.

427
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,730
Where's he going?

428
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,360
-I'll go after him.
-I'll come with you.

429
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,900
No, I'll run over there and get him.

430
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,780
He's carrying a knife.

431
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,650
Don't worry about that.

432
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,200
A martial arts officer
must protect their probation officer.

433
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,240
I'll go.

434
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,500
What a fool.

435
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,460
Use the earbud. I'll give you directions.

436
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,380
Okay.

437
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,050
I'll be back!

438
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,460
Be careful.

439
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,680
Go straight. Keep going straight.

440
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,640
Make a left turn.

441
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,390
You went past it. Go back.

442
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,900
Hurry.

443
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,700
Jung-do. I'm really sorry,
but can you run a little faster?

444
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,280
You're almost there.

445
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,410
A little faster.
You can get him. Turn right there.

446
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,500
On your right…

447
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,170
On my right? Where?

448
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,540
Where? This way?

449
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,290
See the two buildings with rooftops?

450
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,380
He's right behind them.

451
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,380
Two rooftops?

452
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,550
Don't you see them?

453
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,260
One, two. Okay, got it.

454
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,860
Hey, bastard!
Come out, you son of a bitch!

455
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,610
Come out!

456
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,860
Ji Hyeok-jun, you bastard!

457
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,360
Come out, asshole!

458
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,200
I'll kill you! Come out!

459
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:55,740
Min Do-woong!

460
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,420
Who are you?

461
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,710
I'm…

462
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,880
I'm a martial arts officer.

463
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:09,880
Get lost.

464
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,140
I'm here to finish it all off.

465
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,060
That's why I'm here.

466
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,020
Let's go back quietly.

467
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,690
That's right.

468
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,200
Jung-do, what's wrong?
Jung-do, are you all--

469
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,830
You little…

470
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,430
You can come now.

471
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,100
Okay, I'm coming now.

472
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,610
Shit.

473
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,690
Hey!

474
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,990
Get lost, or I'll kill myself.

475
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,030
Bro, I need your help.

476
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,660
What's going on?

477
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,330
He's holding a knife to his own throat.

478
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,970
Hey, Jung-do. I need you to be my voice.

479
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,970
Sorry?

480
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,930
Repeat my exact words to him.

481
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,300
Leave!

482
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,310
Okay.

483
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,180
Mr. Min Do-woong.

484
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,890
"Mr. Min Do-woong."

485
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,110
You must've had a bad day.

486
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,400
"You must've had a bad day."

487
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,030
Did you get into a fight with a friend?

488
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,830
"Did you get into a fight with a friend?"

489
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:15,470
I'm trying really hard
to lead a good life.

490
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,220
But that son of a bitch

491
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:24,180
kept mocking me about my ankle tag
in front of everyone.

492
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:29,940
It's not fair. It makes me so angry
that I can't even sleep.

493
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,610
I'll kill that son of a bitch,

494
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,030
and kill myself too!

495
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,700
Mr. Min.

496
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,490
"Mr. Min."

497
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:45,540
"You were exhausted,
yet still had to endure such insults."

498
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,540
I understand why
you want to give up on everything.

499
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,210
"But if you do,

500
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,970
don't you think
spending more than 20 years repenting

501
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,510
would have been in vain?"

502
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,480
Let's just say you were upset today,
and had too much to drink.

503
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,270
I'll write a favorable report
so you receive just a minor penalty.

504
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,570
"I'll do my best."

505
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,320
"So please put down the knife."

506
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,750
You must not repeat the same mistake.

507
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,420
"To persevere is to win."

508
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:33,420
"Hang in there a little longer."

509
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,710
"Your ankle tag will be removed one day."

510
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,300
"I'll stay by your side
and help you until then."

511
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,310
I mean it.

512
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:47,930
"I mean it."

513
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,450
-I'm home.
-Welcome back.

514
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,790
-How was work?
-Not too bad.

515
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,250
Well, my manager…

516
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,260
He's a really

517
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,590
good guy.

518
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:24,890
Good.

519
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,930
-Wash up quickly and have an apple.
-All right.

520
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,310
Kang Ki-jung managed
to evade the police for four years…

521
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,690
KWON IL-YONG
FORMER POLICE PROFILER

522
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,230
…starting in May 1998,

523
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:40,280
and sexually assaulted
15 girls under the age of 13.

524
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,860
What a scoundrel.

525
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:48,240
…and has a history
of over ten convictions,

526
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:51,330
so we can say
that Kang has a higher risk of recidivism,

527
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:54,960
even compared to other sex offenders.

528
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,920
How should we organize the task force?

529
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,010
We need three teams,

530
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,180
with a probation officer
and a martial arts officer on each,

531
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,340
on a triple-shift rotation
to monitor Kang.

532
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,600
A triple-shift rotation?

533
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:11,810
Each probation officer has to monitor
over 20 ex-convicts at the moment.

534
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,730
If we monitor Kang Ki-jung on top of that,

535
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,020
we won't be able
to closely monitor the others.

536
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,900
I know you're all working very hard.

537
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,280
The problem is that it isn't easy
to increase the budget,

538
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,030
but I'll push harder for it.

539
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:33,620
Thank you. Come again. Have a nice day.

540
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:42,050
Hey, Auntie.

541
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,100
I'm very well, thank you.

542
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,980
Do you want to bleach your roots today?

543
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,190
Then what do you want to do?

544
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,570
I want a clean cut, Auntie.

Yes.

00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,290
You changed your hairstyle.

551
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,250
-I did.
-Nice. It looks great.

That's a nice hairstyle.

I saw this man on my way here.

563

A moment, please.

564
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:02,270
I saw him tip a young female server
and touch her hand.

565
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,610
He's on the move now.
Shouldn't we head there?

566
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,990
Maybe he's on his way home.

567
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,370
-Let's try calling him.
-Yes, sir.

568
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,420
I'm gonna do
whatever the fuck I want tonight.

569
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,090
We have a problem. Hurry!

570
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:37,970
What?

571
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
Did he cut it off?

572
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,980
I think he went into a place
with no connection.

Yes.

579
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,290
Which way did he go?

00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,710
Left or right?

581
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,170
I didn't see which way.

582
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,050
He said it was his birthday today
and invited me to his place,

583

Okay, got it.

-Yes.

589
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,360
He'll target a woman working alone.

Got it!

591
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,120
If it gets too hot, just let me know.

00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,120
-Hello.
-Excuse me.

593
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,040
You're okay, right?

594
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,120
Sorry?

595
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,080
No, never mind. Stay inside.

596
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,800
What do you need?

597
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,470
Why did you lock the door?

598
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,900
What do you want?

599
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,730
You did fucking tell me to come again.

600
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:38,700
Auntie!

601
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,070
You bastard!

602
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,460
Auntie, are you all right?

603
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,130
Okay.

604
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,300
Goddamn it!

605
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,470
Damn it.

606
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,120
Hey! Damn it.

607
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:55,940
You're…

608
00:41:59,110 --> 00:41:59,940
You're…

609
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,660
Against you.

610
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,660
The world's against you.

611
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,380
And you have the right.

612
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,090
Auntie.

613
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,350
Are you all right?

614
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,680
I'm sorry I was late.

615
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,350
I'm sorry.

616
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:33,890
No, it's okay.

617
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,530
Thanks.

618
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,030
Thanks.

619
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,970
-There you are.
-What?

620
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,350
Why are you up already?

621
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:10,260
I made breakfast for you. Come sit down.

622
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:13,770
Seriously?

623
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:17,060
Sun-jung dropped by the joint
and praised you.

624
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,060
Did her face look okay?

625
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:22,990
Well, it looked a little swollen,
but I think it's okay.

626
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,900
That's good to hear.

627
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,160
-Try it.
-All right.

628
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,330
I'm not sure how it'll taste.

629
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:37,670
It's good.

630
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,250
-Does it taste all right?
-Yeah.

631
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,590
Dad.

632
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:44,760
When you were my age,
what made you happiest?

633
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,550
When I was your age…

634
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,060
acting on stage made me happiest.

635
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,810
Gathering together to rehearse.

636
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,900
Sweating and exchanging lines.

637
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,650
All that hard work.

638
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:07,950
There's this joy
in seeing my work make others happy.

639
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:12,830
No matter how much fun you have alone,
nothing beats that joy.

640
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,790
There's this energy you feel

641
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,590
when the passion from your heart
reaches someone else's.

642
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,170
That's my biggest joy.

643
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:40,690
Two probation officers will be sent
to the task force handling Kang,

644
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:45,530
and we're approved to budget
for two more martial arts officers.

645
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:48,610
I asked for extra manpower
to implement the triple-shift rotation,

646
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,160
but it was declined.

647
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:51,820
I'm sorry.

648
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,950
Fourteen of the fifteen
sexual offenses committed by Kang

649
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,000
occurred immediately before
or after school hours.

650
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,750
The daytime probation officer's role
is crucial.

651
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,170
I'll work the daytime shifts.

652
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:10,550
But will you be okay with 12-hour shifts?

653
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:12,010
You have a kid at home.

654
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:17,020
I'll treat it
like I were protecting my own child.

655
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,560
Hello.

656
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,270

-Aren't you on the night shift today?
-Could I have a moment?

660
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:32,780
Go on ahead.

661
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:33,870
-Okay.
-Yeah.

00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,040

664
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,210
Yeah.

665
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:43,630
I want more of it.

666
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,630
-Seriously?
-Yes.

667
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,050

668
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,800
Ten days from now,

669
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:57,260
I'm moving to the team handling
Kang Ki-jung, a serial sex offender.

670
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,140
Do you want to come with me?

671
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,070
Bro, if you want me,
I'll go anywhere with you!

672
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:09,690
Hey. With you, I'm invincible!

673
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:18,290
Kang Ki-jung will be released today

674
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:21,620
after serving 20 years
for sexually assaulting 15 children.

675
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:25,830
He will wear a GPS-enabled
electronic tracking device for ten years.

677
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:28,920
What's that?

678
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,090
-Try it on.
-Is this mine?

679
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,100

684
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:24,810
Mr. Kang, you must never
intentionally take any action

685
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:27,100
that could remove, damage,
or disable the ankle tag,

686
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:30,940
such as using jamming signals,
manipulating data, or anything else.

687
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:34,860
After your release, you may be
under constant watch or be tracked

688
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,320
by our probation officers.

689
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:37,320
Do you understand?

690
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,070
Yes.

691
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,030
Put your preferred foot on the stool.

692
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,350
Now, put on your shoes and stand up.

693
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,810
You can use this
until you get your own phone.

694
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:18,780
We're leaving now.

Child sex offender Kang Ki-jung
will soon return to society

696
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,210
after completing a 20-year sentence.

697
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:34,630
Many locals and civic groups
have been waiting outside his house

698
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:36,130
since early this morning.

699
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:40,340
The police are preparing to prevent
any possible altercations.

700
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:42,640
Castrate Kang Ki-jung!

701
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:47,020
This is dangerous. Please stay calm.

702
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,940
Move aside. It's dangerous.

703
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,020
Give him the death penalty!

704
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,490
-It's dangerous. Make way.
-Just die!

705
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:02,320
Give Kang Ki-jung the death penalty!

706
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:09,580
Hey! Do we pay taxes
so rapists like him can get a ride home?

707
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:10,620
Fuck no!

708
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:15,420
Death penalty!

709
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:20,630
What? Why are you grabbing me?

710
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,840

Please move back. Stop pushing!

713
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,400
Hey! Fuck!

714
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,070
Stay back. Don't push.

715
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,530
Let go!

716
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,950
-Move out of the way.
-How dare you come here.

717
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:48,200
Mr. Kang, do you have a message
for your victims?

718
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,200
Hey, block them.

719
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:50,500
Mr. Kang!

720
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:51,920
-Walk faster.
-Mr. Kang!

721
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,290
Please answer my question, Mr. Kang.

722
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,920
Give us an answer!

724
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:06,180
Come on. Move it.

725
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,390
-Just shove him in there.
-Let's go inside.

This neighborhood was once peaceful.

00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,070
I know, right?

729
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:23,450
All clear?

730
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:24,700
Yes, I think so.

731
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,870
Officer Lee.
Let's patrol this block again.

732
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:28,870
Yes, sir.

733
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,290
-Did you see him?
-He was a big guy.

734
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:34,420
He has an intimidating face as well.

735
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,710
All the residents in this area
must be terrified to live here.

736
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,400
Look at you.

737
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:04,910
You've beefed up.

738
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:07,530
I had nothing to do but work out.

739
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,790
Put this on. It's a trendy jacket.

740
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:21,920
Let's go up for a smoke.

741
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:23,550
Damn you, dude.

742
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,010
Hey, I wore one for three years.

743
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,560
Movement within a building
can't be detected.

744
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:34,560
In fact, you can move
within a ten meter range.

745
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,310
GPS isn't that accurate.

746
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,130
Have you considered
what I wrote in my letter?

747
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:04,460

Where's he going?

751
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,530
Why don't I tail him?

752
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,910
-Now?
-Yeah.

753
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:37,910
Frankly, it'll be too late
if we wait for trouble.

754
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,170
It's important you don't get hurt,
so keep your earbud in.

755
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:48,550
I'll be watching.

756
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:50,260
Okay.

757
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:53,890
No sign of him.

758
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,810
Kang is still walking.
Let me know if you spot him.

759
00:52:58,890 --> 00:52:59,730
I will.

760
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:08,360
I think I found him.

761
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,320
Excuse me. Please turn right.

762
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:11,240
Sure.

763
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,660
Please slow down. Drive slowly.

764
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:19,960
He is entering a building now.

765
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,210
I'll get out here.

766
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,710
Okay. Be careful.

767
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,250
-Thank you, sir.
-You're welcome.

768
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,530
I lost him.

769
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,490
What do you see around you?

770
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,700
The upper floors are filled
with children's learning centers.

771
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,290
It's too early
for any kids to have arrived.

772
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,750
I don't think he went up.

773
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,210
I'll check downstairs.

774
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,370
I'll get straight to the point.

775
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,380
I distribute very specific video content
on the dark web.

776
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:53,170
If you provide me with videos of children,
I will distribute them on the dark web.

777
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:56,180
You'll earn ten million won
per ten-minute video.

778
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:02,390
Byung-soon will help you record
and edit the videos.

779
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:06,060
And we'll find the children
for this content.

780
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:07,980
You have…

781
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:10,940
nothing to lose.

782
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,150
Sounds good.

783
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:19,450
Someone's here.

784
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,330
Who is he?

785
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:26,370
He must have followed me
by tracking my ankle tag.

786
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,500
He can't see you from outside,
so don't move.

787
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:30,840
Jung-do. Are you okay?

788
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,170
Yes, I'm fine. I'm still looking.

789
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,320
Five times five is 25.

790
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:54,570
I'm all right.

791
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:01,370
I think that prick saw our license plate.
You can take care of him, right?

792
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,580
I'll take care of him quietly.

793
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,630
What's going on?

794
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:12,210
I can't find him.
The place is huge. What should I do?

795
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,470
Jung-do. I'll call Kang Ki-jung.

796
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,430
I'll put it on speaker. Listen carefully.

797
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:18,430

Mr. Kang Ki-jung?

800
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,750
I'm from the probation office.

801
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:46,660
Yes, hello.

802
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,040
It took you a while to answer the phone.

803
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,420
I do apologize.

804
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,710
I'm not familiar with cell phones,
so I didn't realize you called.

805
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:59,010
I see.

806
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:02,760
Could you tell me where you are now?

807
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:11,310
I stepped out to have some gimbap.

808
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,780
I see. Gimbap?

809
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,280
I'll go there now. Buy me some time.

810
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,110
You see,

811
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:25,490
Mr. Kang, I wanted to ask
about the ankle tag we provided.

812
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,250
If it feels uncomfortable,

813
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:29,330
we can adjust the fit for you.

814
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:31,500
Did you find it uncomfortable?

815
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,540
No, it's fine.

816
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:42,090
We can also offer support and resources
to assist with your job search.

817
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,010
What type of job are you looking for?

818
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,050
No, I'm good.

819
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:53,650
He's in the gimbap shop.

820
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:56,730
I understand.

821
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,530
I hope you enjoy your meal.

822
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:02,240
Please make sure
to answer your phone promptly from now on.

823
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:03,740
Sorry about that.

824
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:05,490
All right. Thank you.

825
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,410
Take care.

826
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:10,120
I checked on my way back.

827
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,370
There are many gimbap shops
near Kang's house.

828
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,460
-I could hear his mind racing.
-Yeah.

829
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,050
It's making me uneasy.

830
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:20,550
We can't tail him like this every time.

831
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:23,430
I know, but I'll give it my best.
I'll go again.

832
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:28,970

833
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,390
-Hey, Min-jo!
-Hello.

-Look who's here!
-Welcome back.

835
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,270
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

836
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,730
I'll be back to work tomorrow.

837
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,360

00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,070
What is it?

841
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:49,580
It's for you. I thought you might need it.

842
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,750
Really? Can I open it?

843
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:53,330

If you're in here,
they'll think your ankle tag is at home.

857
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:14,870
Shouldn't we seal the door and windows
to keep the sound in?

858
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:16,620
Don't worry about that.

01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,260
You little shit.

890
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,970
I told you I'd kill you,
fucking son of a bitch.

891
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:24,140
What are you looking at?

892
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,440
-We should get out of here. Run!
-Come here!

893
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:36,240
Wow, I'm so scared.

894
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:39,950
Fucking bastard!

895
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:47,630
Hey, get him!

896
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:49,210
Fucking hell! Son of a bitch!

897
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,960
Fuck!

898
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:55,550
That son of a bitch!

899
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:18,200
Hey! You fucking asshole!

900
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:22,330
-Fuck!
-Min-jo!

901
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:24,370
-Just get out of here, sir!
-Min-jo!

902
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,960
I said I'd kill you, fucking moron.

903
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,770
Fucking idiot! You son of a bitch!

904
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:51,060
Fuck, you little shit!

905
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:03,910
Are you dead? Hey.

906
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:07,080
You fucker. I'm not done with you yet,
you son of a--

907
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:10,670
Sir, are you all right?

908
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:12,590
I'm okay.

909
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:16,800
You idiot! Get him.

910
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:17,920
You motherfucker!

911
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,590
Fucking bastard!

912
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:25,350
You son of a bitch!

913
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:26,770
You dumb fuck.

914
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,400
You bastard!

915
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,240
-You son of a bitch!
-Get him!

916
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:41,030
-You fucker!
-Corner him!

917
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:42,700
Fucking bastard!

918
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,160
Try that again!

919
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,010
-Damn it!
-Fuck!

920
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:25,830
Hey, you son of a bitch!

921
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:30,540
Hurry up and go after him!

922
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:53,520
Die.

923
01:06:57,690 --> 01:06:58,610
You prick.

924
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:14,580
Motherfucker!

925
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:39,690
You shithead!

926
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:44,490
Is that all you got, fucker?

927
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,010
BIG BRO SUN-MIN

928
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:21,110
The person you are calling
is not available. Please leave--

929
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:17,410
Here comes Actor K.

930
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:13,840
Excuse me! Did something happen?

931
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:16,890
Call the police now!

932
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:17,810
Okay!

933
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:08,130
Fuck!

934
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,220
Die!

935
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,670
It's okay.

936
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:36,380
You're okay now.

937
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,280
Let's go! Let's get out of here!

938
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,620
Let go, you moron!

939
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,370
Shit, we're fucked.

940
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:08,750
There! It's over there.

941
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:21,630
Kang Ki-jung, freeze. Move, and I'll fire.

942
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,630
I said freeze!

943
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:33,020
I'll shoot if you move!

944
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:49,240
Patrol 15. An unidentified man
and an officer are hurt.

945
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:52,410
Kang Ki-jung is on the run.
Send backup immediately.

946
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,170
Sir, are you all right?

947
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,250
Which division are you in?

948
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,250
Martial arts officer.

949
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:10,140
Hello, Mr. Lee.

950
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:12,020
I'm Han Dong-hoon. I called you.

951
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,810
I see. Hello.

952
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:15,900
What happened?

953
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:18,190
He was stabbed at the scene.

954
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:21,240
Stabbed? What do you mean?

955
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,030
We're really sorry.

956
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:29,740
Jung-do. Hey, Jung…

957
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,250
Jung-do.

958
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:44,720
You said it was a minor injury.

959
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,260
You call a stabbing injury "minor"?

960
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:48,260
My apologies.

961
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,140
I didn't want you to be too worried.

962
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:52,770
That's why I said it.

963
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:56,060
Why did my son go to a place
where someone was swinging a knife?

964
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:57,350
We apologize.

965
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:00,480
Dad.

966
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:05,570
Jung-do.

967
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:07,280
Are you okay?

968
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:14,080
Has Kang Ki-jung been captured?

969
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:21,090
He cut his ankle tag off and fled,
so the police issued an APB.

970
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:24,720
The police are trying to find him,
so we'll get him soon.

971
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,680
What about the girl?

972
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,590
She's safe.

973
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,890
What about Mr. Kim?

974
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:46,900
He broke his neck
and is currently in surgery.

975
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:52,830
Won't that cause full-body paralysis?

976
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:56,500
Thankfully, his nerves weren't affected,
so he's going to be okay.

977
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:02,090
It'll take him a while to recover though.

978
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,470
Jung-do.

979
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:15,060
Mr. Cho…

980
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:18,270
was declared brain-dead.

981
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,560
The police are investigating now.

982
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:25,690
He suffered

983
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:28,780
a cardiac arrest on-site.

984
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:41,750
He had given consent

985
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:45,500
for organ donation after death,

986
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:49,800
and his family
wishes to honor his decision.

987
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:27,090
That concludes
the Brave Citizen Award Ceremony.

988
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:28,920
Thank you all for joining us today.

989
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:31,680
THE 2023 BRAVE CITIZEN AWARD CEREMONY

990
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:35,720
Excuse me.

991
01:18:37,470 --> 01:18:40,350
I'm Min-ju's aunt.

992
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:42,190
Oh, she's…

993
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:44,150
Yes, that's right.

994
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:47,110
Nice to meet you.

995
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:49,570
I apologize for not visiting you sooner.

996
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:51,280
Please don't worry about it.

997
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:56,160
I came to thank you for saving Min-ju.

998
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:01,750
Thank you.

999
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:04,000
And one more thing.

1000
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,550
Min-ju asked me to give this to you.

1001
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,270
HELLO, UNCLE
I'M MIN-JU, THE GIRL YOU SAVED

1002
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:23,770
BEFORE YOU SHOWED UP, I WAS REALLY SCARED

1003
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:29,070
I THOUGHT I'D NEVER SEE MY PARENTS AGAIN

1004
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:31,030
BUT THANKS TO YOU, I COULD SEE THEM AGAIN

1005
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:32,780
YOU EVEN GOT HURT SAVING ME
THANK YOU

1006
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:35,200
Is Min-ju all right?

1007
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,870
She's still too scared to leave the house.

1008
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:44,620
She says she keeps dreaming about it.

1009
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,920
But when I tell her about you, Mr. Lee,

1010
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:53,970
she perks up and tries to stay strong.

1011
01:19:56,590 --> 01:20:00,310
Thank you again for saving Min-ju.

1012
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,020
Many believe the punishment
for serial sex offender Kang Ki-jung…

1013
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:08,190
KANG KI-JUNG ON THE LOOSE

1014
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:09,440
…was too lenient.

1015
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,690
What's your take, Professor?

1016
01:20:11,780 --> 01:20:14,440
It is true
that our penalties for sex crimes

1017
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:16,860
are much lighter
than those in other countries.

1018
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:17,820
Right.

1019
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:19,740
A few years ago, there were attempts…

1020
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:20,660
Hey, man.

1021
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:23,330
-I'm back.
-Have some pizza.

1022
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:24,540
No, I'm not hungry.

1023
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:27,460
…concerned it might lead
to excessive punishment.

1024
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:32,130
We can all agree that sexual assault,
especially sex crimes against children,

1025
01:20:32,210 --> 01:20:36,380
should never be tolerated or forgiven,
regardless of the circumstances.

1026
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:37,550
Bro.

1027
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:39,590
You know the girl who was taken by Kang?

1028
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:42,060
I met her aunt today.

1029
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,810
I heard she was too scared
to leave the house.

1030
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,190
She did nothing wrong.

1031
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:52,520
Kang Ki-jung raped children
while evading the police

1032
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:53,730
for over four years.

1033
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:57,650
He won't get caught easily.

1034
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:00,240
I know how you feel.

1035
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:03,540
But you're already injured.

1036
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:06,330
You can't get hurt again.

1037
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:09,830
Leave it to the police.

1038
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:17,340
Hey, guys.

1039
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:21,010
Shouldn't we try to do what we can?

1040
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:23,810
I thought the same thing
when I heard that.

1041
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:25,350
Yeah.

1042
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:27,310
Even the police can't track him down.

1043
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,520
Can we really help?

1044
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,940
Yes, that's why we should help.

1045
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,520
A lot of criminals
are caught by civilians.

1046
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,400
While tailing Kang, I saw a car,

1047
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:40,910
but I couldn't see
through the tinted windows.

1048
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:42,820
It's been bothering me.

1049
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:44,910
Car make? Plate number?

1050
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:49,210
A black Range Rover, 100-TA-5525.

1051
01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:50,500
"100-TA-5525."

1052
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:52,290
All right, I'll ask my bro.

1053
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:56,880
I'll be out of here next week,
so get me some equipment too.

1054
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:58,340

It'll be useful.

01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:12,290
Can you open it?

1070
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:13,960
I saw it on YouTube.

1071
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:15,880
Good.

1072
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,720
-Hey, what happened?
-Shit.

1073
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:24,050
I'll try again.

1074
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:28,760
What? What is this?

1075
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,430
Hey, let's get out of here.

1076
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,100
What's going on? For fuck's sake.

1077
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:04,920
BRO

1078
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:05,880
Hey, I got it.

1079
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:10,140
Yeah, I got it.

1080
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:17,440
MY LITTLE BRO

1081
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:24,740
I see a shit ton of files.

1082
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:33,240
20130924_F_LONG HAIR

1083
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,040
What the fuck is this?

1084
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:39,630
On this bastard's computer,
there are videos of kids that…

1085
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:42,130
Guys.

1086
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,630
He has over a terabyte
of child sexual abuse files.

1087
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,050
Give me the Taser.

1088
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:51,850
-Now!
-Okay.

1089
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:55,310
Hey, Jung-do.

1090
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:00,900
Did you get Kang Ki-jung
to film the videos?

1091
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:03,650
Where is he now?

1092
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:06,440
Go on. Tase me.

1093
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:08,110
You don't think I can?

1094
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,030
Do it.

1095
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:12,370
-Fucking bastard.
-Jung-do! Don't!

1096
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:13,990
-Let go.
-No.

1097
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,040
-Let go of me!
-Stop.

1098
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,330
Calm down, Jung-do.

1099
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:17,830
Calm down.

1100
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:19,500
Let go of me. Let go!

1101
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:20,750
No, calm down.

1102
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:29,300
Shut up and relax.

1103
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:36,520
I can't believe
you actually used it on him.

1104
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,810
I see blood from his eye.
What if he loses his sight?

1105
01:25:39,390 --> 01:25:41,520
Hey, I told you not to do it.

1106
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:44,940
Hold on.

1107
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:51,700
Look at your eye.

1108
01:25:54,950 --> 01:25:57,500
If you don't go to the hospital,
you may lose your sight.

1109
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,040
If you tell us where Kang is,
I'll call you an ambulance.

1110
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:11,380
Nod if you wanna talk.

1111
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:20,440
Let's sit him up.

1112
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:31,860
Tell us now.

1113
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:36,830
I have a debit card linked
to a puppet account.

1114
01:26:36,910 --> 01:26:38,620
Kang's using that card now.

1115
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:41,210
On my phone,

1116
01:26:41,290 --> 01:26:44,830
you'll see text messages
that tell you where he used the card.

1117
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:46,790
About an hour ago…

1118
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,050
I received a text.

1119
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,300
You'll find him there.

1120
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:53,430
CHINESE PAVILION

1121
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:57,560
I've told you everything,
so please hurry up with the ambulance!

1122
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:03,560
Has Kang sent you any videos
in the past four weeks?

1123
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:11,740
He has!

1124
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,200
He has?

1125
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:20,160
-Hey! Lee Jung-do!
-No, don't do it.

1126
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:22,120
-No, don't!
-Let go.

1127
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:23,160
-Don't do it.
-Stop.

1128
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:24,580
-Don't.
-Hey!

1129
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,630
This is 112. How can I help you?

1130
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:33,550
There's a man making child pornography.
Please come now.

1131
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:34,760
Where are you now?

1132
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:38,510
Kang used Kim's card
at the places marked with red circles

1133
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,810
in the past two weeks.

1134
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:42,890
Notice all these motels?

1135
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:45,440
I think it's highly likely
that he's in this area now.

1136
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,190
All right.
Moisture, did you bring your drone?

1137
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:49,860
Yeah, it's in my car.

1138
01:27:51,150 --> 01:27:53,650
All right, friends. Don't get hurt.

1139
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:56,450
And

1140
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:58,280
sorry for yelling.

1141
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:01,790
That's cool. It's all good.

1142
01:28:02,370 --> 01:28:03,830
Honestly, I was quite shocked.

1143
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:06,580
Winner winner…

1144
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:07,960
Chicken dinner!

1145
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:10,710
God, it's cold.

1146
01:28:15,010 --> 01:28:16,800
-Where are you going?
-What?

1147
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:20,810
No. Don't do anything dangerous.

1148
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:23,730
-Dad.
-Hey!

1149
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:26,020
You were stabbed.

1150
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:29,400
Any deeper, and you could have died!

1151
01:28:35,650 --> 01:28:37,990
-Guys. Go in for a minute.
-Okay.

1152
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:39,240
Take your time.

1153
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:46,540
Three months ago…

1154
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:50,880
I didn't even know what an ankle tag was.

1155
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:55,380
But I know everything now.

1156
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:57,130
In fact, I know too much.

1157
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:02,260
I cannot forget what I've learned.

1158
01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:03,930
It's the police's job.

1159
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:06,480
You don't need to get involved.

1160
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:09,810
You know,

1161
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:13,270
that young girl I saved that day…

1162
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,610
is still too scared of people
to leave home.

1163
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,160
She's ten.

1164
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:25,580
Only ten.

1165
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:32,460
But it hurt the young girl so much
that she shut herself off.

1166
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:36,170
You know what I found out today?

1167
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:41,840
That the evil bastard hurt another child.

1168
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,140
The police? Yeah, I know.

1169
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:50,730
I'm sure they're all working hard.

1170
01:29:51,310 --> 01:29:52,980
I want to do my best too.

1171
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,360
Without regrets.

1172
01:30:01,950 --> 01:30:04,700
I also want to do my best
so I won't have regrets later.

1173
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:12,250
So please let me just go.

1174
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:16,050
If I go now, I can catch that bastard.

1175
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:21,220
As I speak, a ten-year-old girl
could be trembling with fear,

1176
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:24,550
waiting for me to rescue her, Dad.

1177
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:28,770
I wouldn't care if I didn't know.

1178
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,520
But now I know. How can I do nothing?

1179
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:43,030
And I won't get hurt again,
so don't you worry.

1180
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:49,410
I know I can do it this time, Dad.

1181
01:30:52,210 --> 01:30:53,210
So wish me luck.

1182
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:59,380
I'll see you later.

1183
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:03,090
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1184
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:10,390
Be careful.

1185
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:12,600
I will!

1186
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:02,650
Ready.

1187
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:06,860
VOICE CALL

1188
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:10,870
Group calling now.

1189
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:14,620
Tell me immediately if anything happens,
and do not step in.

1190
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:15,710
Got it?

1191
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:17,120
Let's go.

1192
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:29,470
-Earthworm, start here and go straight.
-Okay.

1193
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:34,770
Hello?

1194
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:37,020
That way. I'll go this way.

1195
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:38,270
-Okay, take care.
-Sure.

1196
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:44,110
-Hello.
-Hello.

1197
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:47,280
Has this man been staying here?

1198
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,030
No, I haven't seen him.

1199
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,780
Have you seen this man?

1200
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:52,490
I've never seen him.

1201
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:54,410
Have you seen this man?

1202
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:55,830
No, I haven't.

1203
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:57,370
Please take a closer look.

1204
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,540
I really don't know.

1205
01:32:59,040 --> 01:32:59,880
Thank you.

1206
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:01,040
He's not staying here.

1207
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,960
Sorry to bother you. Thank you.

1208
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:07,220
Guys. I'm in front of Daewon Motel now.

1209
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,760
It's at the end of the alley
where we started.

1210
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:13,470
I see Chinese food containers.
There are a bunch of men's shoes inside.

1211
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:15,140
-Come check it out.
-Okay.

1212
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,520
Over here.

1213
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:23,690
-Hey, look.
-Where?

1214
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:36,450
Hey, did you forget
I saved your life in prison?

1215
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,540
Not this shit again.

1216
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,920
It's about time you let it go.

1217
01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:43,000
Ki-jung.

1218
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:44,880
Let's open the window.

1219
01:33:49,550 --> 01:33:52,090
I'll handle it from here.
Go wait in the car.

1220
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:53,640
Be careful.

1221
01:33:54,350 --> 01:33:55,720
-Call us anytime.
-See you.

1222
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:56,680
See you soon.

1223
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:05,730
Okay.

1224
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:18,950
Get out here, Kang Ki-jung,
you son of a bitch!

1225
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:23,460
What's going on?

1226
01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:26,380
It's dangerous. Please go inside. Sorry.

1227
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:27,710
Okay.

1228
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:34,760
Who are you, motherfucker?

1229
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,850
I'll crack your skull open,
you fucking prick.

1230
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:43,270
Look at that son of a bitch.

1231
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:58,290
-You fucking bastard.
-Fucking prick!

1232
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:02,000
This is gochujang! It's burning my eyes!

1233
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:02,920
Fuck.

1234
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:07,040
Do you have a death wish?

1235
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:18,350
My hand!

1236
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:22,520
Hey, asshole. Come here!

1237
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:34,160
Hey, you fucking piece of shit!

1238
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:41,330
What?

1239
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:44,210
What the hell?

1240
01:35:54,970 --> 01:35:55,800
Moisture!

1241
01:35:55,890 --> 01:35:56,970
I'll follow him.

1242
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,190
You son of a bitch!

1243
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:17,660
Stop him! Don't let him go inside.

1244
01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:28,000
Son of a…

1245
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:37,590
It burns!

1246
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,980
You bastard!

1247
01:36:54,740 --> 01:36:56,820
Fuck you, asshole.

1248
01:36:58,410 --> 01:36:59,570
Fuck off, you son of a--

1249
01:37:04,330 --> 01:37:05,750
Moisture, which way?

1250
01:37:05,830 --> 01:37:06,830
Go right.

1251
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:12,420
Now left.

1252
01:37:14,170 --> 01:37:15,300
Now turn right.

1253
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:24,220
-He's looking at the drone.
-Maybe he knew all along.

1254
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:26,390
Damn it.

1255
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:33,940
You startled me.

1256
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:51,350
You're dead.

1257
01:39:08,990 --> 01:39:10,040
Come at me.

1258
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:13,540
Come on out, you bastard.

1259
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:06,390
Hey, do something.

1260
01:40:22,860 --> 01:40:23,900
-Nice!
-Oh yeah!

1261
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:16,600
You have the right to remain silent.

1262
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,060
Anything you say can

1263
01:42:20,230 --> 01:42:22,560
and will be used against you
in a court of law.

1264
01:42:24,310 --> 01:42:25,900
SILENT, AGAINST YOU, ATTORNEY

1265
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:28,570
And you have the right to an attorney.

1266
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:46,550
"I present this award to you…

You saved lives.

1273
01:43:10,110 --> 01:43:11,360
Thank you very much.

1274
01:43:12,610 --> 01:43:13,610
Thank you.

1275
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:18,120
The president will now take pictures
with the award recipients.

1276
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:37,680
One moment, please.

1277
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,430
Min-ju.

Thank you.

1280
01:43:46,770 --> 01:43:47,610
Are you all right?

1281
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:49,940
Yes, I'm okay now.

1282
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:52,240
I'm glad to hear that.

1283
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,280
