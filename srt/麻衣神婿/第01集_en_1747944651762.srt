1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I heard that the young master of Yuan family and the young girl of Yuan family

2
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
never found me.

3
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Why are you talking like this at night?

4
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We are here to find Shanhai Town.

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Rumor has it that Shanhai Town is a place where the martial arts class can practice the art of sword fighting.

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I am sorry.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I hope that I can get rid of myself because of my greed.

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Brother!

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Miss, how old are you?

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm 31 years old.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, you are so young.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Young master,

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
people there are all looking at their faces.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why are you here?

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You are looking at your back.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Miss, you don't know that our ancestors said that

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
after 30 years, a woman will not be as obvious as a young lady.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Her temperament and personality will be more internal.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You can't see anything on her face.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you want to see her face, you have to look at her back.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Come on, pull it down.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Pull it down.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The so-called back-to-back martial art,

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
back-to-back sign,

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
martial arts are the power of the heart,

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
the skin of the skin is the silk,

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
the lung is the cup, the body is the jade,

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and the heart is the cup.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It is a female belly between the body and the body.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's like a belly of a woman.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It seems to be for love.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You want to marry a rich old man.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Miss, your back-to-back martial art is not accurate.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You are a sleepy-head.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You are the destiny of all four families.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Young master,

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
you have good eyes.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't know what I have done.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,840
I don't know what I did wrong.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,880
I got married and died.

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,880
You have to help me

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,360
with my life.

43
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,160
It's easy to say.

44
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,200
Turn around.

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,360
Glutinous rice paste!

46
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,560
Glutinous rice paste!

47
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,720
Glutinous rice paste!

48
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,120
Everything in this world exists.

49
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,080
There are ways to control each other.

50
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
It's not difficult to break the barrier.

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,920
You're too hard-hearted.

52
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,240
When you go back,

53
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,440
you have to burn the stove

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,600
for three days.

55
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,600
You have to burn the three meals yourself.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,600
That way,

57
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,520
you can control your anger.

58
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,720
And

59
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,280
buy a goldfish for release

60
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,440
on the market on the first of the fifth.

61
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,480
Goldfish is a dragon species

62
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,000
that can solve your problem.

63
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,560
You're so lucky.

64
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll find a job.

65
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,480
Little Master,

66
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,240
I heard that

67
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,000
you're all

68
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,000
the children of Chunyang.

69
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,240
I didn't bring much money.

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,600
I'll come back

71
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,960
when you're closed.

72
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,280
It's a good chance.

73
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,400
I'll be more lucky.

74
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,160
Sister.

75
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,720
I want your money.

76
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
You're killing me.

77
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,240
Don't talk about money.

78
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
Leave now.

79
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,400
People are greedy.

80
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,520
They can do whatever they want.

81
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,320
Miss,

82
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,000
do you like your teeth or your back?

83
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,920
The woman

84
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
has a delicate

85
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,680
kohl-oil on her nails.

86
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,600
The color of the kohl-oil

87
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,120
is very bright when it's applied.

88
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,880
It's discolored

89
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,240
every hour.

90
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,360
According to the color of her nails,

91
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,320
it's only

92
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,480
an hour.

93
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,200
Now the sunset

94
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,120
is the time for the men to go home for dinner.

95
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,720
But she just got up

96
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,880
and got dressed.

97
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,480
At this age,

98
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,080
she's likely to be a widow.

99
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,160
The so-called official back portrait

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,560
is just a word

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,960
that you use to make up for your lack of knowledge.

102
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,120
Who are you?

103
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,360
What's the matter?

104
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,760
Chen Chu.

105
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,040
He was born in August of the year of the rooster.

106
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,040
He's not old enough to be a part of the Ningge Gang.

107
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,760
So his parents passed away.

108
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,040
He was a street kid.

109
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,800
He learned some tricks.

110
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,920
What do you want?

111
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,840
I'm here

112
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,880
to let you

113
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,040
count your own life.

114
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,040
What?

115
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,560
Are you crazy?

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,440
Why should I count my own life?

117
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,880
Our grandmaster said

118
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,280
doctors don't treat themselves.

119
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,560
I wonder if this money

120
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,120
is enough to make your grandmaster forgive you.

121
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
The End

122
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,080
Miss,

123
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,040
this is not about money.

124
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,000
To be honest,

125
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,120
it's business

126
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,760
that matters to us.

127
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,960
We are all guests.

128
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
You are my godfather.

129
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,640
So, grandmaster,

130
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,120
you can't just let me eat.

131
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,480
Today,

132
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,720
I'll help you

133
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,960
break the record

134
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,240
and help you

135
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,320
break the record.

136
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,800
Drinking

137
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Drinking

138
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,280
Drinking

139
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,080
Looking at how you were actions,

140
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm afraid your life is at risk.

141
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,760
This is the godfather's reticence.

142
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,320
Stop talking.

143
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,000
Keep disgusting yourself.

144
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
I'm done. What else do you want?

145
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
This is the deposit.

146
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,120
You can buy it and do something for me.

147
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
What do you want?

148
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
What do you want?

149
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Go back with me and be my husband.

150
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
What?

151
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Murong and Jin are fighting more and more.

152
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,120
But every time it's the Jin family who take advantage.

153
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
We are losing.

154
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
Who says it's not?

155
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,120
I think the Murong family is the sun and the moon.

156
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,120
The Sun will be swallowed by the Jin family sooner or later.

157
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,120
We have to prepare in advance.

158
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,120
We can't follow Murong's trail.

159
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,120
We can't follow his trail.

160
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
The business of the Murong family is not as good as the Jin family.

161
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,120
The main reason is not on Murong.

162
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,120
But on his daughter Murong Yan.

163
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,120
You are a daughter.

164
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,120
And your fate is like a baby.

165
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,120
You are in the family business.

166
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,120
You have the family's reputation.

167
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
So your shop will be damaged.

168
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
What's the solution?

169
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
It's simple.

170
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,120
Just find a person with a strong fate.

171
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,120
But where can we find a person with a strong fate?

172
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,120
We have searched the capital.

173
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
There is his address.

174
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
You can check it.

175
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Buns.

176
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Twenty years.

177
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Everything you did to the Yan family.

178
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
I will make you pay back.

179
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
I will make you pay back.

180
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
I will make you pay back.

181
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
I will make you pay back.

182
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
I will make you pay back.

183
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
I will make you pay back.

184
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
I will make you pay back.

185
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
I will make you pay back.

186
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,120
I will make you pay back.

187
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
I will make you pay back.

188
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
I will make you pay back.

189
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
