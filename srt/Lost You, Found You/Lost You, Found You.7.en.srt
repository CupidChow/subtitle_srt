3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,340
(Poppy Inn)

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,560
Miss, are you eating or staying?

5
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,400
Staying.

6
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,350
Alone, Miss?

7
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,070
How much?

8
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,350
One hundred taels.

9
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,640
So expensive.

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,560
Expensive?

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,430
That's easy.

12
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,070
We're destined to meet.

13
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,400
Come to my room at 11 pm

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,950
with the key,

15
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,950
and I'll waive the room fee.

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,510
How dare you say that?

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,710
Think about it.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This place is desolate.

19
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,840
Nearby,

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,710
this is the only inn.

21
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,000
Here's the key to my room.

22
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,190
Let go! Let go!

23
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,430
Sir, how old are you?

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,950
Twenty-eight.

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,400
Had enough of life?

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
No, no, no!

27
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,590
Then keep your hands to yourself.

28
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,840
This place is desolate,

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,200
perfect for burying someone.

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,040
Spare me.

31
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,350
I won't dare again!

32
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,510
Just do your job.

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,040
Yes.

34
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,430
Don't worry.

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,950
Dealing with a few lechers

36
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,060
is no problem for me.

37
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,480
With me here, I'll handle it.

38
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,150
Sir.

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,960
How many rooms do you want?

40
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,360
Seeing the deep bond between you two,

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,630
I know you must be siblings.

42
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,910
Of course, you'll take

43
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,940
(Poppy)
two rooms.

44
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,430
Alright.

45
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,150
Please come inside.

46
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,560
I've got the inn's map.

47
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,280
It's most likely in this storage room.

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,400
Tonight,

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,080
we'll check the storage room.

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,150
The inn is full of people and eyes.

51
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,710
The secret letter wouldn't be hidden
in a guest room.

52
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,310
A long-unused storage room

53
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,360
is indeed the most likely.

54
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,560
Let's find the letter quickly

55
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,470
and avoid complications.

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,680
Okay.

57
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,030
(I won't let you go easily.)

58
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,750
Nothing.

59
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,310
I didn't find it either.

60
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,150
Let's check the west wing.

61
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,990
Okay.

62
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,430
Why is this door unlocked?

63
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,910
What should we do?

64
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,120
How about we break out?

65
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,710
No. That'll make a scene.

66
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,430
Then

67
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,680
should we

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,390
stay here for the night?

69
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,670
Okay.

70
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,350
Sit down.

71
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,510
(What should I say?)

72
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,830
- Yuan.
- So...

73
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,800
(Is it just me or is it hot?)

74
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,120
(It's really hot.)

75
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,350
- So...
- Or...

76
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,230
You go.

77
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,480
Should I

78
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,680
check the door?

79
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,270
(I've helped them.)

80
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,750
(Why aren't they taking off the clothes?)

81
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,590
What's that?

82
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,720
You're not a child anymore

83
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,920
and still interested in this?

84
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,720
You once liked it the most.

85
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
(Yuan,)

86
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,920
(the lion dance at the market
is about to start.)

87
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,780
(They've invited the famous Lion King
from the city.)

88
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,760
(Let's go!)

89
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,830
(I have to study for the Liushan Agency exam.)

90
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,870
(Father won't let me go.)

91
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:18,920
(You go have fun.)

92
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,070
(Then I won't go either.)

93
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,240
(I'll pretend to be a lion for you.)

94
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,430
(Here comes the Lion King!)

95
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,360
(At best, you're a puppy.)

96
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,590
Don't run.

97
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,270
Stay still.

98
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,510
Sit. Sit.

99
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,910
Good.

100
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,070
(Good puppy.)

101
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,750
(You must listen)

102
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,920
(and not act on your own, okay?)

103
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,800
(Lion! I'm a lion, okay?)

104
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,920
(Little lion,)

105
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,680
(I hope you can always be happy)

106
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,630
(and joyful.)

107
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,720
(Protecting you)

108
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,070
(is the happiest thing in the world.)

109
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,470
It's been five years.

110
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,630
You finally came to trade.

111
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,580
