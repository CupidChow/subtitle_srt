=Episode 19=

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,550
Time's up. Execute him.

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,230
Wait.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,000
- Execute him.
- Wait.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,800
I'm the true foster child of Yue Tianxing.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,640
Yuan.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,450
What nonsense are you spouting?

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,100
(Contract for a Foster Son)

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,320
Back then, to be adopted by Yue Tianxing,

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,880
I disguised myself as a boy

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,070
and became his adopted child.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,140
(Huiyan Move)

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,880
Then I stabbed a knife

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,470
into Yue Tianxing's heart.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,520
Yue Tianxing was killed by me alone,

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,470
and no one else.

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,680
So,

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,350
it wasn't Gu Linyuan who killed Mr. Yue,

20
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,430
- but you?
- Yes.

21
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,480
- No.
- No.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,650
I acted alone.

23
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,560
It has nothing to do with him.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,480
It was both of us.

25
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,200
We killed Yue Tianxing together.

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,280
Is that true?

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,790
Now I've known the way

28
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,950
to decipher the letter.

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,920
Only I can do this.

30
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,400
- What's going on?
- Protect the chief!

31
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,040
Qian Kun Sect is attacking the prison!

32
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,680
Immediately shoot Yun Feifei.

33
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,760
Wait, Xiang Liting is still inside.

34
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,600
This way.

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,630
- He's useful.
- Be careful.

36
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,750
Bring him out to me.

37
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,590
Yes.

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,850
Where are they?

39
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,870
Where's the smoke coming from?

40
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,470
Protect the chief!

41
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,310
Be cautious of the Qian Kun Sect!

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,560
Chu Xin, hurry!

43
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,030
Hurry and go!

44
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,840
Chu Xin, Chu Xin.

45
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,590
Help!

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
Save me.

47
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,120
Yuan, are you okay?

48
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,120
Fei.

49
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,520
I'll settle the score with you later.

50
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,680
I remember everything now.

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,800
Aren't you happy?

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
I wish you hadn't remembered anything.

53
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,870
You made the decision on your own again.

54
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,400
Five years ago, you tricked me into leaving.

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,360
Now you're turning yourself in
without telling me.

56
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,310
Do you always want to leave me behind?

57
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,920
No.

58
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,560
I just don't want you to get hurt again.

59
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,680
I don't want you to suffer anymore.

60
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,280
I don't want you to be constantly wandering.

61
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,560
Whether you become an official

62
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,080
or a constable,

63
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,030
I just want to do everything I can

64
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,840
to take care of you.

65
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,560
But

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,750
if I can't be with you,

67
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,960
then every day

68
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,400
would be very, very hard for me.

69
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,470
Alright.

70
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,520
I promise you.

71
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,840
Even if I only have one day to live,

72
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,470
I want to be with you.

73
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,280
From today on,

74
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,240
I will be your wife,

75
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,310
and we will be together forever.

76
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,520
Is that okay?

77
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,950
We haven't even had the wedding ceremony,

78
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,510
and you already want to be my wife?

79
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,720
Five years ago, you promised
to marry me right here.

80
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,000
You knelt and told me that.

81
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,310
Tomorrow is my eighteenth birthday.

82
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,870
I plan to confess everything to Father.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,510
Even if he disowns me,

84
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,720
I'll still marry you.

85
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,760
But

86
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,870
I don't have a betrothal gift.

87
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,070
Will you still marry me?

88
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,600
If you dare to marry, I dare to wed.

89
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,320
I promise you.

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,510
When I'm successful,

91
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,510
I'll give you a wedding in the limelight.

92
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,760

111
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,720
I didn't make it either of those.
