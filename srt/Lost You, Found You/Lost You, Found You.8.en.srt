1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,060
=Lost You, Found You=

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,030
Good.

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,120
You two have been together all along.

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,550
It's you.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,440
Why are you here?

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,870
Gu Linxuan is Yue Tianxing's foster son.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,960
He came here five years ago.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,350
Today, he's here again.

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,710
It's definitely for the letter

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,640
that can overthrow the Qian Kun Sect.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,150
I'm just here to catch an affair.

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,710
If you're after the letter,

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,070
then let's compete.

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,030
Whoever gets it, keeps it.

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,560
Compete?

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,430
Have you forgotten?

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,600
Without my protection,

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,710
you wouldn't have gotten this far.

20
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,920
You're breaking the rules.

21
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,600
You can only meet privately with us,

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,350
not in public.

23
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,750
Now, only he knows the clues.

24
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,390
We must use them to find the letter.

25
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,230
Don't mess this up.

26
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,350
Move.

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,840
Just keep an eye on them.

28
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,400
There will be time for revenge later.

29
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,710
Who's speaking?

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
Let's go.

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,680
Stop hiding and come out to trade.

32
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,350
Let's go.

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,480
Where's the necklace?

34
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,310
It must be combined to count as the token.

35
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,520
You're five years late.

36
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,150
Pay the storage fee,

37
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,550
and the item is yours.

38
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,550
How much?

39
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,710
One tael per year.

40
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,400
Fair enough.

41
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,750
Gold.

42
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,560
Only one person can enter with me.

43
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,190
You two choose one.

44
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
I'll go.

45
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,120
Be careful outside.

46
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,400
If anything happens,

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,630
meet at the Zhulou Music

48
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,120
on the full moon night.

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,200
Please.

50
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,750
Fei.

51
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,520
Where are they?

52
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,800
We need to force them out.

53
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,080
Let's be clear.

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,150
Whoever finds the letter first, gets it.

55
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,590
(Is there a fire? Why so much smoke?)

56
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,280
(Fei, please be safe.)

57
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,150
Where's Gu Linxuan?

58
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,430
How would I know?

59
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,470
You slept with Gu Linxuan.

60
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,910
Did you think I wouldn't know?

61
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,910
What nonsense are you spouting?

62
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,870
You've been flirting with Gu Linxuan,

63
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,120
and he seems to like you a bit.

64
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,310
Do you think that means anything?

65
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,430
Let me tell you.

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,280
I don't care at all.

67
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,870
He'll always be a dog to my family.

68
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,680
Do you know how he became our enforcer?

69
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,280
He was just a prisoner,

70
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,080
beaten and tortured.

71
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,000
Now he's in a high position.

72
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,750
It's not just because I like him.

73
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,000
He's our drug test subject.

74
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,480
It's the Perish Pill.

75
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,920
Use it a bit more,

76
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,310
and all muscles contract,

77
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,310
enough

78
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,750
to break all bones.

79
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,560
Use it a bit less,

80
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,680
and the body becomes so weak

81
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,270
that people will die of exhaustion.

82
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,120
Missing a dose by 15 minutes

83
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,920
causes unbearable pain.

84
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,510
Eat it.

85
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,390
Every test subject died from the torture.

86
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,000
Only he survived.

87
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,390
We made him test it

88
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,870
again and again,

89
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,000
year after year.

90
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,680
So now,

91
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,720
he's the world's most knowledgeable

92
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,040
about the Perish Pill,

93
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,070
indispensable

94
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,390
to the Qian Kun Sect.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Impressive, isn't it?

96
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,630
It seems

97
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,240
you really like him.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,160
Do you want

99
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,040
to rush to his side,

100
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
comfort him, and heal him?

101
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,680
Why are you laughing?

102
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,240
I'm laughing at the drama about to unfold.

103
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,070
If all love and affection

104
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,800
turn to dust,

105
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,190
let's see how this tragic couple

106
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,510
can stay together through life and death.

107
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,880
Gu Linxuan.

108
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,240
You're just in time.

109
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,960
Yuan!

110
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,270
Yuan! Yuan!

111
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,000
Yuan!

112
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,360
Yuan, what's wrong?

113
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,480
I have the letter.

114
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,740
(Enchantment Smoke)

115
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,760
Let's go.

116
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,390
The Enchantment Incense.

117
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,390
Du Xiaoyu.

118
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,600
(The Enchantment Incense can accelerate
the effects of the Perish Pill.)

119
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,040
(But the real pain is yet to come.)

120
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,000
Yuan.

121
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,830
If you remember nothing,

122
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,310
how can you love each other?

123
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,270
The more you love, the more you'll suffer.

124
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,520
Feifei.

125
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,150
You're awake.

126
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,080
(Who is he?)

127
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,320
(Where is this?)

128
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,750
(Why am I here?)

129
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,000
Yue Tianxing's notes.

130
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,360
