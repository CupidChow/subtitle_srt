3
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,960
You've always carried this with you.

4
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,030
It's so precious,

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,240
and you're giving it to me?

6
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,190
Does this count

7
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,320
as a token of our love?

8
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,800
Yes.

9
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,070
I really have to go.

10
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,310
Chu Xin is waiting for me.

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,040
Then hurry back.

12
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,790
I'll be waiting for you.

13
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,230
Heaven above,

14
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,480
please protect Gu Linyuan

15
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,400
from the pain of the Perish Pill.

16
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,840
I, Yun Feifei, humbly beg and kowtow.

17
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,710
Good and evil are mutually exclusive.

18
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,150
As a constable, I've fallen for a villain.

19
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,800
If the heavens wish to punish,

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,150
let all disasters

21
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,710
befall me alone.

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,430
Sir, please sell this to me.

23
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,240
It's about to rain.

24
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
Come back tomorrow.

25
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,800
But I don't know if I can come back tomorrow.

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,640
Please sell it to me.

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,640
Alright then.

28
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,800
