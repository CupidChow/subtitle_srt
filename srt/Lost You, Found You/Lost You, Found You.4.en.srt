=Lost You, Found You=

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,960
Sorry, I failed.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,920
Please give me a chance to make amends.

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,030
Think about how

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,440
to explain to Lady Xiaoyu.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,600
Well...

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,750
I could say

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,920
Ms. Yun practiced dark arts and feigned death.

10
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,790
When I was handling the body,

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,840
she suddenly woke up,

12
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,430
injured me, and escaped.

13
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,470
Keep a close watch on Yun Feifei.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,840
For the next three days,

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
cooperate with whatever she wants to do.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,390
Don't let her ruin my plans.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,720
Yes.

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,560
You didn't catch me last time.

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,680
This swing is a thank-you gift.

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,790
So, if I have any worries,

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,280
I can come here to find you.

22
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,120
We've searched all the hiding places
of Qian Kun Sect,

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,920
but we still can't find any trace
of Zhang Kezhen.

24
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,190
Mr. Xiang.

25
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,480
You called me Xiang the other day.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,150
Why today Mr. Xiang?

27
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,920
Why did you go to the bridal shop?

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,120
That was just an excuse

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,150
to get close to Gu Linyuan.

30
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,760
I'm not a good match for you.

31
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,200
I hope you can

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,280
forgive my overstepping.

33
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,070
I've found out

34
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,760
Zhang Kezhen is an escaped death row prisoner

35
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,200
who holds crucial evidence against Gu Linyuan.

36
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,710
I suspect

37
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,510
this might prove

38
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,790
he is the foster child
of the old Grand Constable.

39
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,350
What else have you found?

40
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,040
Zhang Kezhen is hidden by Du Xiaoyu

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,350
in a secret chamber of Qian Kun Sect.

42
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,280
He will be brought out for public execution

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,910
at next month's wedding.

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
We just need to act

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,800
during the wedding banquet.

46
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,280
There's not much time left.

47
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,310
There's still some time.

48
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,710
Feifei, you don't need to be so anxious.

49
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,710
Relax.

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,590
- Here.
- Sir, what are you doing?

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,310
The auspicious hour is approaching.

52
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,800
Time to go.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,870
(That shadow looked like him.)

54
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,590
Sir, Gu Linyuan and Du Xiaoyu
are getting married today.

55
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,240
What?

56
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,590
The wedding date was moved up?

57
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,190
Feifei, don't act rashly.

58
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
Return to Liushan Agency to prepare.

59
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,780
(Qian Kun Sect)

60
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,660
(Happiness)

61
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,870
Weren't you supposed to come later?

62
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,520
Did you come looking for me today?

63
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,840
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

64
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,240
Do you know where this is?

65
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,080
Getting married early.

66
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,680
You lied to me again.

67
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,080
You never intended to marry her.

68
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,500
I won't let you marry her.

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,390
Why do you have the scar
left by Tianxing Spear?

70
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,720
Yue Tianxing couldn't have hurt you.

71
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,510
Why do you have the same scar as me?

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,840
Leave now.

73
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,760
I won't leave.

74
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,710
Go!

75
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,710
I...

76
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,150
(Two shadows.)

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
Linyuan, is someone with you in the room?

78
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,120
Do you see?

79
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,680
As long as there is light,

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,510
we can't even be together in the shadows.

81
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,070
You're scared now?

82
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,190
I thought I saw

83
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,480
someone else in the room.

84
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,110
You were mistaken.

85
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,510
Still left an ugly scar.

86
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,000
- Back then...
- Xiaoyu.

87
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,160
There's no need to talk about the past.

88
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,310
Why can't I mention it?

89
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,480
You killed your foster father back then.

90
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,120
If I hadn't brought you to Qian Kun Sect,

91
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,360
you would have been executed by Liushan Agency.

92
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,360
From now on,

93
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,360
you'll live and die

94
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,390
for me.

95
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,720
You'll forever be

96
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,480
my loyal dog under my skirt.

97
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,000
Xiaoyu.

98
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,430
It's almost time for the ceremony.

99
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,600
Change into the wedding clothes first.

100
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,560
Do you think I'm joking with you?

101
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,680
Do you know how dangerous this is?

102
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,870
You're not Yue Tianxing's foster child.

103
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,680
Mind your own business.

104
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,920
Linyuan, it's getting late.

105
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,310
You should change clothes too.

106
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,470
Okay.

107
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,430
I'm his real foster child.

108
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,390
Shut up. If this gets out,

109
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,560
we'll both be dead.

110
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,360
Linyuan, where's my veil?

111
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,600
Come in and change clothes.

112
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:01,910
Alright.

113
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,510
I want to save you and leave together.

114
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,360
If we can't have light,

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,950
we'll stay together in the dark.

116
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,110
Hurry up and go.

117
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,470
Linyuan?

118
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,190
She's only temporarily unconscious.

119
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,310
She'll wake up soon.

120
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,510
It's too dangerous here. You need to leave.

121
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,390
Zhang Kezhen is an escaped death row prisoner.

122
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,270
Tell me.

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,310
Is he related to what happened five years ago?

124
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,050
Five years ago, he saw us

125
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,800
kill Yue Tianxing together.

126
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,120
- Help!
- Such a pretty face.

127
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,750
Two months ago, he found me

128
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,240
and said he had evidence

129
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,270
to expose our true identities.
