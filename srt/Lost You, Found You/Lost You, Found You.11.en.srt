Don't worry.

5
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,880
They won't find this place

00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,280
You've been poisoned by the Carefree Needle.

I'm telling you.

18
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,310
I don't want to hear his name anymore.

I saw some women's clothes

40
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,590
and jewelry in your room.

41
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,710
Do you often bully women

00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,910

and detoxify me from the Carefree Needle?

47
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,370
Is it because of that letter?

We were once deeply in love.

49
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,480
Xiang warned me

50
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,800
that you've used

51
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,830
such lies to get close to me before.

55
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,430

56
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,920
