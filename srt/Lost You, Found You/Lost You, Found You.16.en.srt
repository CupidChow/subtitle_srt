00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,060
(Yue Tianxing's Notes)

4
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,240
(My head hurts again.)

5
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,920
(I must decipher the letter asap.)

6
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,070
(Hope you have a good dream tonight.)

7
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,760
Let go of me!

8
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,600
Fei!

9
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,710
Help!

10
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,790
- Run!
- Villain, you can't go in.

11
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,960
No!

12
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,430
Don't do this!

13
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,760
Fei!

14
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,790
I'm here.

15
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,190
Are you and Feifei truly a couple?

16
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,430
In the memories she lost, yes.

17
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,750
Then she just remembered.

18
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,590
Aren't you happy?

19
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,560
She's been like this lately.

20
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,150
When she wakes up,

21
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,310
she won't remember anything.

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,800
What if you told her everything

23
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
about the past?

24
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,800
Past memories will only cause her more pain.

25
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,000
You're not allowed to mention it again.

26
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,360
If you truly care about her,

27
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,150
help me investigate someone.

28
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,120
Who?

29
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,960
Xiang Liting.

30
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,750
Have you thought it through?

31
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,520
Is this your real purpose for capturing me?

32
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,240
Well, I thought about it all night

33
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,520
and decided to help you.

34
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,630
I'm not submitting to your tyranny.

35
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,360
Since Feifei was injured,

36
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,120
I've been working for Mr. Xiang

37
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,000
and have discovered some strange things.

38
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,430
If something's really wrong about him,

39
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,190
I will definitely report it to the chief.

40
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,590
You're quite righteous.

41
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,270
Of course.

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,800
But I have to give you some advice.

43
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,600
Continuing with Feifei like this

44
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,630
won't last long.

45
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,680
You might as well surrender yourself.

46
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,830
Wait for ten or eight years.

47
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,790
Mr. Enforcer,

48
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,350
forget what I said.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,950
I'm no longer an enforcer of the Qian Kun Sect.

50
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,800
So, should I call you

51
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,440
Linyuan?

52
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,390
You didn't eat the breakfast I made.

53
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,600
Come and eat,

54
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,240
or I won't make it for you anymore.

55
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,160
We're leaving soon.

56
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,270
I'll get some food

57
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,110
for your journey.

58
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,830
