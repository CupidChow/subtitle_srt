3
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,710
(Your friend)

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,120
(has been poisoned by the Perish Pills.)

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,870
(Seems he's using his inner strength
to stay alive.)

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,830
(Once the poison acts up
and can't be relieved,)

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,230
(he will lose his sanity)

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,430
(and become a crazed killer.)

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,160
Gu Linyuan.

10
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,480
(You left.)

11
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,560
(Why did you leave?)

12
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,000
(Don't you want the gift anymore?)

13
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,400
Gu Linyuan.

14
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,870
Gu Linyuan, take the Perish Pill.

15
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,150
Take it and you'll be okay.

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,070
Du Sanyao.

17
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,000
Gu Linyuan.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,150
Don't be afraid. It's me.

19
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,190
- Get out.
- It's me.

20
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,520
- Get out.
- Don't be afraid. It's me.

21
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,470
Get out. Get out.

22
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,360
A little bit, just a little bit.

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,430
I won't take the Perish Pill.

24
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,710
I won't take the Perish Pill.

25
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,840
Gu Linyuan.

26
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,240
Don't use your inner strength recklessly.

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,120
You'll only accelerate the poison.

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,080
Gu Linyuan.

29
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,400
Gu Linyuan.

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,520
Du Sanyao.

31
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,360
Gu Linyuan.

32
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,030
It's you.

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,630
How could it be you?

34
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,910
I don't want you to see me like this.

35
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,800
I won't leave.

36
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,080
You removed the Carefree Needles for me.

37
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,910
I want to stay here with you.

38
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,680
There's still a Carefree Needle.

39
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,590
I want to help you remove it.

40
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,680
Don't speak.

41
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,430
I bought medicine.

42
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,430
I'll make the medicine for you.

43
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,310
Don't leave.

44
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,560
She must've remembered.
