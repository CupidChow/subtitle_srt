=Episode 10=

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,920
What

4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,550
did you do to her?

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,800
Want to know?

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,830
Ask Du Xiaoyu about the Carefree Needle.

7
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,340
(Invitation)

8
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,120
Give me the antidote for the Carefree Needle.

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,430
What if I say no?

10
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,920
How can you break ties with me

11
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,840
over a cheap woman?

12
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,480
I won't let you insult her.

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,790
I'll say it again.

14
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,070
Give me the antidote for the Carefree Needle.

15
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,040
You're injured.

16
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,400
You can't control the Perish Pill.

17
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,560
Kneel and admit your mistake.

18
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,150
You can still be our enforcer.

19
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,070
Otherwise,

20
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,560
wait for your guts to rot

21
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,510
and die mad.

22
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,510
I forgot to tell you a happy news.

23
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,280
In ten days,

24
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,310
Xiang Liting will marry Yun Feifei.

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,310
You didn't know, did you?

26
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,120
Mr. Xiang is our good friend.

27
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,080
He will help us hold our position

28
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,030
and take good care of Yun Feifei.

29
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,240
See it yourself.

30
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,660
(The union of two families,
everlasting good fortune)

31
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,310
The poison of the Carefree Needle is incurable.

32
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,910
Her memory damage is irreversible.

33
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,870
Even if you remove all the needles

34
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,710
from her body,

35
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,430
she may not remember you.

36
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,780
(Liushan Agency)

37
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,120
(Ten days later)
Be quick with your hands!

38
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,470
- Thank you.
- Over there

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,870
Come on. Over here.

40
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,710
Good, good, good.

41
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,150
Thank you.

42
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,990
Put the small boxes here.

43
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,560
Enjoy your food and drink.

44
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,120
Sorry, please wait.

45
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,000
Why are you here?

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,910
Gu Linyuan isn't with you?

47
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,680
I'm here to deliver a gift to Mr. Xiang.

48
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,280
Today is my wedding.

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,630
You'd better not cause trouble.

50
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,310
But if it weren't for me,

51
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,480
would you have been able to marry her?

52
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,360
I'm warning you.

53
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,840
Don't think of hiding the letter.

54
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Or the Qian Kun Sect

55
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,800
will send you a bigger gift.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,240
You'd better worry about your enforcer.

57
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,200
Mr. Zhang.

58
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,470
(Liushan Agency)

59
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,310
Mr. Zhang.

60
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,740
(Happiness)

61
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,150
(The letter contains strange numbers)

62
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,240
(about Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches.)

63
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,080
(Only she)

64
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,910
(can understand the meaning behind it.)

65
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,280
(If I can marry her today,)

66
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,510
(I'll gain both love and wealth.)

67
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,350
Feifei,

68
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,160
today is our big day.

69
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,600
Why do you look unhappy?

70
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,600
I don't know why.

71
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,830
Getting married like this

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,000
makes me feel too rushed.

73
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,040
I haven't remembered anything yet.

74
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,270
Don't think too much.

75
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,720
After our wedding,

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,950
you'll decipher the letter.

77
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,270
Then we'll travel across the world.

78
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,670
Okay?

79
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,560
It's time. Cheer up.

80
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,800
(Liushan Agency)
The good time has come.

81
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,310
Here comes the bride and groom.

82
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,150
Good.

83
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,800
Congratulations, congratulations!

84
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,640
Congratulations!

85
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,830
Good, very good.

86
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,710
Good.

87
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,040
Congratulations, congratulations!

88
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,870
Congratulations, congratulations!

89

(Martyrs List of Honor,
Grand Constable Yue Tianxing)

90
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,160
Gu Linyuan, why are you here?

91
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,720
Mr. Gu, what is this?

92
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,950
Delivering a gift.

93
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,950
What kind of gift

94
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,240
do you have to deliver?

95
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,750
Did I say

96
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,560
the gift is for you?

97
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,630
You villain!

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,840
Let her go!

99
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,270
This is my gift to you.

100
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,750
Let go of me!

101
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,830
Gu Linyuan, are you betraying Qian Kun Sect?

102
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,600
No one can stop me.

103
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,390
If you take one step out the door today,

104
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,000
you'll be an enemy of Qian Kun Sect.

105
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,920
Don't expect to get another Perish Pill.

106
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,040
Qian Kun Sect is deeply evil

107
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,750
and has harmed my beloved.

108
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,830
I will repay it a hundredfold

109
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,120
and wipe you all out.
