00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,060
=Lost You, Found You=

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,280
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,190
I only found out later.

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,480
Two years ago, I got powerful.

6
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,470
Zhang Kezhen tried to extort money.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,350
He found some evidence,

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,600
including evidence against you.

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,270
Listen to me.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,520
Your identity must not be revealed.

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,550
Leave now.

12
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,990
What are you doing?

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,520
The bride will have Zhang Kezhen
at the wedding.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,920
Since that's the case,

15
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,110
why can't I be the bride?

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,840
Absolutely not.

17
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,320
It's too dangerous.

18
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,550
Xiaoyu.

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,360
Xiaoyu.

20
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,120
Is there any makeup left to do?

21
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,510
I'll come in and help you.

22
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,200
The ceremony is about to start.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,870
Why are you still dawdling?

24
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,740
(Du Sanyao, Leader of Qian Kun Sect)

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,350
She's all dressed up, Mr. Du.

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,350
Hurry. Don't miss the auspicious time.

27
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,280
Only I can be your bride.

28
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,540
(Happiness)

29
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,840
Place the saddle

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,000
for blessings of safety.

31
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,230
Combine the fans.

32
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,070
Great.

33
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,040
For harmony.

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,760
Open the fans

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
for prosperity and descendants.

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,640
Good.

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,240
Good. Bring the gift.

38
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,470
What gift? It's odd.

39
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,190
Why did it move? It's a person.

40
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,080
It's a person.

41
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,310
I heard this person offended Gu Linyuan.

42
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,310
They're going to execute him today

43
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,870
to show their power.

44
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,620
(Zhang Kezhen, a condemned prisoner)

45
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,400
We'll deal with him after the ceremony.

46
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,750
Bow to Heaven and Earth.

47
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,800
At the Sansheng Temple, the couple made a wish

48
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,310
and thus got married.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,430
Bow to the parent.

50
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,310
Get dressed as the bride

51
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,870
for a harmonious marriage.

52
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,190
Bow to each other.

53
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,590
Don't bow!

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,240
The bride is fake.

55
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,310
Who is she?

56
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,310
What's going on?

57
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,680
It's you.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,150
Are you tired of living,

59
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,430
daring to ruin my wedding?

60
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,960
Liushan Agency is handling the case.

61
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,710
Feifei.

62
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,280
Feifei, go!

63
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,120
- You can't leave.
- Zhang Kezhen, come with me.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,120
No one moves.

65
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,720
You've been hungry for a day.

66
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,870
Still not talking?

67
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,030
Where is the evidence you used
to blackmail Gu Linyuan?

68
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,430
Even if you're mute, you can write.

69
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,910
San...

70
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,510
Sheng...

71
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,830
Sansheng Temple.

72
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,240
Let's go.

73
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,680
Lady Xiaoyu, we've traced their tracks.

74
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,240
Didn't they say Yun Feifei was here too?

75
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,200
Where is she?

76
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,590
Get out of the way.

77
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,630
Ignore him. Catch Yun Feifei first.

78
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,830
She ruined my wedding.

79
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,680
I want her cut to pieces.

80
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
How dare you touch me!

81
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,510
My foot!

82
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,870
Lady Xiaoyu sprained her ankle.

83
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,080
Fan Peng,

84
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
take her back first.

85
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,510
I'll handle this.

86
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,030
- Yes.
- Yes.

87
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,670
Here.

88
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,830
Catch Yun Feifei for me.

89
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
The evidence is at Sansheng Temple.

90
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,160
After I deal with everything,

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,120
I'll come back for you.

92
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,780
