3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,320
(Qian Kun Sect)

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,550
The letter concerns our safety,

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,390
but you got nothing.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,000
According to our rules,

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,640
you deserve the harshest punishment.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,350
I'm willing to accept it.

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,430
(Grand Constable Yue Tianxing's Spirit Tablet)

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,710
This is our previous Grand Constable,

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,240
Yue Tianxing.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,070
He was our hero.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,180
You should respect him the most.

14
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,690
(Grand Constable Yue Tianxing's Spirit Tablet)

15
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:47,920
Mr. Yue died fighting Qian Kun Sect,

16
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,600
but we have been unable

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,390
to find the culprit.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,920
I've always felt

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,000
Mr. Yue's portrait looks very familiar.

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,310
The culprit is truly hateful.

21
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,150
Xiang, you're injured.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,590
It's good that you forgot.

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,950
You were in danger at the Corn Poppy Inn.

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,680
It still scares me now.

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,430
Luckily, I saved you.

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,870
This injury

27
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,950
is really nothing.

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,840
You were hurt because of me?

29
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,510
You must remember this place.

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,430
Whenever you were upset,

31
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,200
you liked to swing here.

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,920
Did I

33
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,360
see someone here?

34
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,400
Why do I feel like crying

35
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,840
when I come here?

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,800
That's because

37
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,150
I made this swing for you.

38
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,030
You were so touched and loved it so much.

39
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,840
Oh, that's why.

40
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,470
Not only that,

41
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,590
you once promised

42
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,800
to marry me here.

43
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,750
This is a wedding invitation
from Liushan Agency.

44
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,630
In ten days,

45
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,630
Xiang Liting will marry Yun Feifei.

46
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,220
(Invitation)

47
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,360
Do you know why

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,590
I didn't plead for you this time?

49
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,590
I don't care who is in your heart.

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,030
But I've chosen you,

51
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,030
so you can't run.

52
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,840
Your love may be elsewhere,

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,590
but you'll never leave me.

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
The punishment is over.

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
Take good care of him.

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,640
Yes.

57
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,080
Mr. Gu, how are you?

58
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,000
Prepare the horses.

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,430
But your health...

60
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,200
Yes.

61
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,360
Mr. Gu,

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,870
you've waited all night.

63
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,430
It's almost dawn.

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,400
You go back.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't disturb me here.

66
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,990
Yes.

67
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,030
Feifei.

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,560
Esteemed guests,

69
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,000
there are private rooms upstairs.

70
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,640
This way, please.

71
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,560
Boss, Qian Kun Sect is truly vicious.

72
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,750
Luckily, you're better now.

73
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,560
That scoundrel Gu Linyuan.

74
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,040
I better not see him again.

75
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,830
Such a good actress.

76
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,830
Didn't you come to see me?

77
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,950
Feifei, I ordered all your favorite dishes.

78
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,870
Feifei, do you remember this place?

79
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,190
This is where we lured Gu Linyuan.

80
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,270
(Qian Kun Sect)

81
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,600
Gu Linyuan

82
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,750
is arrogant and cruel, committing many crimes.

83
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,360
Everyone avoids him.

84
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,600
As the only constable

85
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,430
who dared to confront him,

86
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,360
Feifei, you risked your life

87
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,000
using the Perish Pills to lure him here.

88
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,240
That rat wore a mask.

89
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,360
Does he look hideous?

90
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,560
Can you remember what he looked like?

91
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,830
My head hurts.

92
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,070
I need some fresh air.

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,840
Yuan.

94
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,950
Yuan.

95
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,560
I recognize you.

96
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,310
The big villain of Qian Kun Sect,

97
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,800
Gu Linyuan.

98
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,230
Tell me.

99
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Who am I?

100
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,160
The Great Enforcer of Qian Kun Sect.

101
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,360
You're also

102
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,630
my mortal enemy.

103
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,870
What's wrong?

104
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,750
Why cry crocodile tears?

105
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,160
Aren't my wounds also thanks to you?

106
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Let me tell you.

107
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,560
If you dare provoke me today,

108
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,800
don't blame me for killing you

109
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,040
for the people.

110
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,870
Who told you all this?

111
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,750
Of course, Xiang.

112
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,240
Feifei, Feifei.

113
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,080
Feifei.

114
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,040
Gu Linyuan.

115
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,910
It's okay.

116
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,870
I'm here. It's okay.

117
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,950
Sir, you take Feifei away.

118
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
We'll handle him.

119
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,950
Today was supposed
to celebrate Feifei's recovery,

120
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,750
but you keep pestering.

121
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,360
I don't want to fight in front of Feifei.

122
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,950
Chu Xin, take Feifei back.

123
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,440
Feifei.

124
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,000
See?

125
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,680
No matter what your past was,

126
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,080
she has completely forgotten you now.

127
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,840
In her heart,

128
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,270
you're a villain who deserves a thousand cuts.

129
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,200
Stay away from Feifei.

130
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,910
What

131
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,550
