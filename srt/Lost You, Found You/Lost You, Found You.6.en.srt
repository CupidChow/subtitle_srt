4
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,980
(Contract for a Foster Son)

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,320
(This is the contract
when Yue Tianxing adopted me.)

6
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,340
(Fei)

7
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,150
(This is his handwriting.)

8
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,600
She didn't arrest me but taught me to read.

9
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,840
I'm Fei, a rogue.

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,000
But I didn't steal from you.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,760
You're Yuan, the foster son of Grand Constable.

12
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,920
Then take me to Liushan Agency.

13
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,510
You want to change your fate. I'll help you.

14
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,590
This is Huiyan Move.

15
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,680
Fei.

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,920
This is how my name is written.

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,070
She was a girl.

18
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,310
Father only wanted to adopt boys.

19
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,430
I pretended to be a boy and deceived him.

20
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,760
I want to join the Liushan Agency
with you in the future.

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,790
You're a thief.

22
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,040
I'm a liar.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,120
We're the same kind of people.

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,400
I have a good memory.

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,950
Actually, I want to become an official.

26
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,710
You'll stay in the courts.
I'll roam the martial world.

27
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,310
We'll do good for Heyang City together.

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,870
Tomorrow is my 18th birthday.

29
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,710
I will confess to Father that I'm a girl.

30
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,560
Will she say yes if I propose to her?

31
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,000
Even if he disowns me, I'll still marry you.

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,150
Yue Tianxing, you've ruined everything.

33
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:40,990
Yuan.

34
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,640
How can you be a girl?

35
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,640
Such a pretty face.

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,790
Help!

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,480
We didn't kill a nobody.

38
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,840
We can never meet again.

39
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,870
Change your name and start over.

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,430
What should I call myself?

41
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,710
Anything.

42
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,910
I won't.

43
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,710
Go.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,080
- No.
- Leave.

45
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,120
Leave.

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,520
Change your name.

47
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,870
Start over.

48
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,800
No.

49
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,240
Take the imperial exam. Become an official.

50
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,080
No.

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
Go.

52
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,120
You'll have a bright future.

53
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,960
Go.

54
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,400
Just don't call yourself Yuan.

55
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,430
Anything else will be fine.

56
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,840
Yue Tianxing's weapon is unique.

57
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,360
If I have this scar,

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,120
they won't be suspicious.

59
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,430
Are you Yue Tianxing's foster son?

60
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,080
Yes.

61
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,750
What's your name?

62
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,190
Yuan.

63
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,630
They hit me again.

64
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,840
I'm not doing well,
but you being okay is enough.

65
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,360
You're Yue Tianxing's foster son.

66
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,910
You must know the secret.

67
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,150
Tell me.

68
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,030
Where's the secret letter?

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,080
What secret letter?

70
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,270
I don't know.

71
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
Fine.

72
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,910
Qian Kun Sect has never seen

73
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,960
a prisoner who doesn't talk.

74
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,270
Hit him.

75
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,200
Yes.

76
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,400
I really wanted to see you today.

77
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,280
Hit him.

78
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,430
But I still hope

79
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,960
you won't come back.

80
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,430
So stubborn.

81
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,720
Are you really Yue Tianxing's foster son?

82
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,880
Yes.

83
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,160
Last night, I dreamed I sent you a letter.

84
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,310
It couldn't be delivered.
No response or sight of you.

85
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,750
In the dream, I was so sad.

86
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,680
But when I woke up, I felt relieved.

87
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,920
It's hard to meet you in heaven or earth.

88
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,920
We'll never see each other again in this life.

89
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,600
So we've really parted.

90
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,600
I finally dreamed of you.

91
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,950
Long time no see.

92

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,000
(You became Gu Linyuan for me.)

94
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,070
(It's all my fault.)

95
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,700
(Fei and Yuan: May everything go smoothly.)

96
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,270

He colluded with the Qian Kun Sect,

111
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,680
took the Perish Pills,

112
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,600

your identity must not be revealed.

It's said

117
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,270
Yue Tianxing wrote the secret to overthrow

118
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,680
the Qian Kun Sect in a letter.

119
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,950
They believe only his foster child can find it.

120

and you fall into the Qian Kun Sect's hands,

122
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,270
you'll suffer twice

123
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,390
as much as I did.

124
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,310
Didn't you say you wanted me to sail away?

125
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Let's leave together.

126
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,680
No one will find us.

00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,470
What's wrong?

128
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,870
I can't leave the Qian Kun Sect.

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,240

otherwise,

but you do.

142
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,240
I don't want this. Don't give it back.

146

Yue Tianxing.

147
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,360
He told me to keep it safe.

148
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,220
("100,000 Stories")

149
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,500
("Corn Poppy")

150
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,670
I remembered.

151
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,720
I saw this pattern

152
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,630
in a book he read.

153
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,790
Next to it was written:

154
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,840
"Corn Poppy, an antidote to Perish Pill."

155
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,000
So,

156
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,390
the Perish Pill's poison can be cured.

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,870
It must be.

158
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,630
If there's an antidote,

159
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,390
overthrowing the Qian Kun Sect will be easy.

160
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,150
Fei, you're saved!

161
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,200
But

162
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,390
what does "corn poppy" mean?

163
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,240
It's an inn outside the city.

164
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,600
It's said that five years ago,

165
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,120
Yue Tianxing arranged a deal

166
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,240
with the Qian Kun Sect Leader there

167
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,270
but stood them up later.

168
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,000
The letter must be hidden there.

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,080
Then let's go now.

170
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,320
No.

171
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,910
It's too dangerous.

172
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,480
We need to prepare well.

173
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,200
Are you planning

174
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,440
to get married first?

175
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,200
Du Xiaoyu sprained her ankle,

176
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,790
so I've postponed the wedding.

177
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,560
But

178
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,600
I still need to cover things up with Du Sanyao.

179
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,040
What about you?

180
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Don't you need to explain to your Xiang?

181
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,150

182
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,670
