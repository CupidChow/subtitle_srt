=Lost You, Found You=

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,060
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,870
Feifei.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,320
Do you remember when Gu Linyuan and I left?

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,920
We were investigating Xiang Liting.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,160
At his house,

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,640
we found evidence of his and Yue Tianxing's

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,920
collusion with the Qian Kun Sect.

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,670
Gu Linyuan also admitted his identity

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,440
as the foster son of the old Grand Constable

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,830
and the crime of patricide.

12
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,350
That's why they were imprisoned together.

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,030
Gu Linyuan entrusted me

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,750
to bring this credit to you

15
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,280
so that you could become the Grand Constable.

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Linyuan,

17
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,640
why did you set up Xiang Liting

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,960
to catch you?

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,880
What really happened back then?

20
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,710
Yue Tianxing and I committed serious crimes.

21
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,110
He died,

22
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,520
and I joined the Qian Kun Sect.

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,320
Later, I had power.

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,920
I wanted to get back with Feifei.

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,670
If you wanted to get back with her,

26
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,920
and you had evidence against Xiang Liting,

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,000
why did you surrender?

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,880
Of course.

29
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,680
I still support you in surrendering.

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,200
You're right.

31
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,480
Being on the run with Feifei

32
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,640
wouldn't last long.

33
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,760
She's forgotten the past.

34
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,840
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

35
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,790
I've decided

36
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,510
to confess my crimes

37
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,480
so she can focus on being a constable

38
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,760
and have a bright future.

39
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,590
Impossible.

40
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,590
Gu Linyuan couldn't have committed such crimes.

41
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,400
I don't care about being a Grand Constable.

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,840
- I want to find him.
- Feifei.

43
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,840
Calm down.

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,000
The chief is here right now,

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,480
ready to reward you.

46
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,070
If you're worried about Gu Linyuan,

47
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,760
it's better to become the Grand Constable

48
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,760
and uncover the truth.

49
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,680
If his crimes aren't punishable by death,

50
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,200
there may still be hope.

51
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,310
(Liushan Agency)
Constable Yun Feifei,

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,150
skilled in both martial and literary arts,

53
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,280
unafraid of strong enemies,

54
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,910
fought against the Qian Kun Sect,

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,870
captured countless criminals,

56
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,630
and cleared the agency of corrupt elements.

57
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,710
She's a pillar of the agency

58
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,400
and the support of Heyang.

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
Now, she's our Grand Constable

60
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,000
to faithfully serve

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,870
and protect the peace of the martial world.

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,150
Criminal Gu Linyuan

63
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,590
helped the villains,

64
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,360
harmed countless compatriots,

65
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,870
committed patricide for glory,

66
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,470
and acted against all morals.

67
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,360
He's guilty of heinous crimes

68
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,800
and will be executed

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,470
immediately.

70
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,590
Yun Feifei possesses an extraordinary memory

71
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,080
and aced her entrance exam to join us.

72
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,430
Today, we witness a woman
who rivals men in prowess.

73
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,590
She's a true heroine.

74
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,030
The master of the agency is unwell.

75
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,750
(Di Yun, Chief of the Martial World)
The Liushan Agency will be in your hands.

76
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,590
Sure.

77
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,430
Thank you for your favor.

78
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,710
However, I no longer have

79
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,750
the ability to remember everything.

80
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,590
I've even forgotten the most important things.

81
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,870
You indeed risked your life for us.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,950
Though Carefree Needle is potent,

83
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,830
in the future, if the opportunity arises,

84
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,040
it may not be incurable.

85
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,700
(Liushan Agency)

86
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:39,300
(Liushan Agency)

87
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,660
(I always find here inexplicably familiar.)

88
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,840
(I must have been here before.)

89
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,710
Is it fun?

90
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,960
I'll push you.

91
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,240
It's so fun!

92
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,790
Come on.

93
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,270
Push me higher.

94
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,560
Alright.

95
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,590
Yuan.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Since I stole your stuff, catch me then.

97
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,470
Why aren't you catching me?

98
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,870
I won't catch you.

99
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,510
I want you to play with me.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,120
I'm Fei, a rogue.

101
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,310
But I didn't steal from you.

102
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,600
You're Yuan, the foster son of Grand Constable.

103
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,310
Take me to see the official.

104
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,020
(Fate, Fei)

105
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,390
Fei.

106
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,520
Done.

107
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,070
This is how my name is written.

108
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,040
It's so hard.

109
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,950
It's not hard.

110
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,240
(You can write more articles
and practice more.)

111
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,630
(Over time, you'll be able to write well.)

112
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,270
(If I could write articles,)

113
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,680
(I wouldn't have to be a rogue.)

114
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,070
(I wouldn't have to join the Qian Kun Sect)

115
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,920
(and work for the villains.)

116
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,310
I want to join the Liushan Agency with you.

117
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,510
I have a good memory.

118
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,750
I want to become an official.

119
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,870
You'll stay in the courts.

120
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,070
I'll roam the martial world.

121
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,600
We'll do good for Heyang City together.

122
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,440
Alright.

123
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,800
Yuan.

124
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,560
I am Yuan.

125
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,390
He's Fei.

126
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
He's Fei.

127
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,750
Feifei,

128
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,630
they are going to execute Gu Linyuan.

129
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,000
What?

130
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,070
(You liar!)

131
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,190
(How could you be so foolish?)

132
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,680
(You are the little liar.)

133
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,720
(But I am also a thief.)

134
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,310
(We are meant to be together.)

135
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,480
(The lion dance at the market
is about to start.)

136
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,560
(They've invited the famous Lion King
from the city.)

137
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,480
(Let's go!)

138
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,680
(I have to study for the Liushan Agency exam.)

139
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,720
(Father won't let me go.)

140
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,950
(You go have fun.)

141
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,800
(Then I won't go either.
I'll pretend to be a lion for you.)

142
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,680
(Here comes the Lion King!)

143
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,950
(Protecting you)

144
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,600
(is the happiest thing in the world.)

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,920
(I joined Liushan Agency for you.)

146
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,070
(Two years ago,)

147
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,240
(I heard you were taken.)

148
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,070
(I rushed back.)

149
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,000
Come in and change clothes.

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,840
Alright.

151
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,950
Don't marry her, please.

152
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,830
Hurry up and go.

153
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,800
Let's run away together.

154
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,630
(If there can't be light,)

155
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,190
(we'll stay together in the dark.)

156
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,870
(Don't be afraid.)

157
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,000
(Do you know)

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,750
(how he became our enforcer?)

159
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,160
(He was just a prisoner,)

160
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,270
(beaten and tortured.)

161
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,480
(Now he's in a high position.)

162
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,920
(It's not just because I like him.)

163
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,600
(He's our drug test subject.)

164
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,870
(It's the Perish Pill.)

165
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,000
(Use it a bit more,)

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,270
(and all muscles contract,)

167
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,480
(enough)

168
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,830
(to break all bones.)

169
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,510
(Use it a bit less,)

170
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,720
(and the body becomes so weak)

171
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,270
(that people will die of exhaustion.)

172
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,480
(I want to join the Liushan Agency with you.)

173
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,800
(You'll stay in the courts.)

174
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,750
(I'll roam the martial world.)

175
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,640
- (Even if Father disowns me,)
- (Do good for Heyang City together.)

176
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,340
- (Take the exam. Become an official.)
- (I'll still marry you.)

177
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,650
Jia Zi.
[*From the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches]

178
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,720
Label the books.

179
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,270
It will be easier to find them later.

180
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,160
Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches,

181
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,930
combined with the page
and line numbers in the book.

182
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,660
(Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches)

183
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,910
(I remember now.)

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,480
(This is how to decipher the letter.)

185
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,960
(Fei,)

186
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,320
