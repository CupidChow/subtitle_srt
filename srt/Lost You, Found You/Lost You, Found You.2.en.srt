00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,620
(Longfeng Bridal Shop)

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,070
Which wedding dress do you think looks best?

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,760
Any one will do.

6
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,780
This dress is nice.

7
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,830
I'll take it.

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,390
How dare you take my dress?

9
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,710
I'll kill you.

10
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,190
Xiaoyu,

11
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
go try on your dress.

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,200
- Leave this to me.
- Give it to me.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,040
Alright.

14
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,040
What are you doing here?

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,350
Trying on wedding dresses.

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,200
Is that a problem?

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,950
Linyuan, come in.

18
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,070
Coming.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,320
What do you want?

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,870
- Linyuan.
- I'm next door.

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,320
Okay.

22
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
What are you doing?

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,040
My groom has a similar build to you.

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,350
Try on the dress for me.

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,680
Are you crazy?

26
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,430
Afraid she will hear us?

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,040
- What are you doing?
- This is a fitting room.

28
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,070
What's wrong with me trying on a dress?

29
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:56,990
Shameless.

30
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,520
You like this, don't you?

31
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,870
Before the wedding,

32
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,520
I'm happy to play this game

33
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,000
of old love rekindled.

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,960
Linyuan.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,810
What's all that noise?

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,150
Did you fall?

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,240
Linyuan?

38
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,990
I didn't.

39
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,560
You're not like this

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,400
with Du Xiaoyu.

41
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,710
Are you really going to marry her?

42
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,190
Marrying Lady Xiaoyu gives me power and status.

43
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,150
Why not?

44
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,280
Then why are you still wearing
the item I gave you?

45
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,750
You're marrying her

46
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,750
to kill someone,

47
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,590
right?

48
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,430
Leave Heyang City quickly,

49
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,150
or

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,360
I don't know what I'll do.

51
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,470
Xiaoyu,

52
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,240
are you done?

53
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,430
This wedding dress is beautiful.

54
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,630
Stop sulking.

55
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,560
You'll have your target

56
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,150
on the wedding day.

57
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,750
Today was supposed to be happy,

58
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,560
but I met a wretch.

59
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,470
Xiaoyu, it's late.

60
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,470
Let's go back.

61
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,630
Why are you wearing a dress like my groom's?

62
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,710
Take it off.

63
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,390
What if I refuse?

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,830
Then you'll die.

65
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,820
(Liushan Agency)

66
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,120
You're Yun Feifei?

67
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,590
Yes.

68
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,160
I heard Qian Kun Sect plans

69
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,430
to execute someone on their wedding day.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,840
Well.

71
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,000
I need to investigate it.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
Fine.

73
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,310
You won't live to see the results.

74
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,150
Guards.

75
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,390
Surround this shop.

76
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,430
She must die today.

77
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,950
Gu Linyuan, what are you doing?

78
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,830
She's just a small constable.

79
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,600
You don't need to do it yourself.

80
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,760
Hyah!

81
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,960
Hyah!

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,840
Hyah!

83
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,120
We're even now. You'll be my enemy next time.

84
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,190
(Trying to trick me into leaving again.)

85
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,360
I won't go. I won't go.

86
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,240
We can never meet again.

87
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,230
I won't.

88
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,190
Go. Go.

89
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,160
I won't.

90
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,000
Go!

91
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,390
Change your name.

92
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,720
Start over.

93
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,800
I won't.

94
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,190
Take the imperial exam.

95
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,300
Become a female official.

96
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,930
You'll have a bright future.

97
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,630
I won't. I won't.

98
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,470
Go!

99
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,390
Ms. Yun,

100
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,240
I'm ordered to send you to sail away.

101
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,000
It'll be years before you can return.

102
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,950
Qian Kun Sect will never catch you again.

103
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,800
Tell me.

104
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,310
Who is Qian Kun Sect planning

105
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,800
to execute at the wedding?

our head constable Yun Feifei is missing.

109

The Grand Constable wants to question you.

110

(Chu Xin, Liushan Agency)
Bringing so many people,

111
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
are you openly defying us?

112
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,920
Why? You summoned me.

113
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,120
Don't you dare let me in?
