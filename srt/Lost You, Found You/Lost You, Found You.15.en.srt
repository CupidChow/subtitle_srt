3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,800
These are

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,190
all dishes I used to love.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,280
I don't know if the taste has changed.

6
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,120
I'll serve you some rice.

7
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,550
Yuan.

8
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,550
Yuan.

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,790
What's wrong, Fei?

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,080
Feifei.

11
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,790
What's wrong?

12
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,190
It's nothing.

13
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,590
You must be hungry.

14
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,000
You didn't eat much last night either.

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,320
You eat too.

16
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,200
(She didn't remember.)

17
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,640
It seems

18
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,510
you're not too fond of these dishes.

19
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,400
It's my first time cooking.

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
Do me a favor.

21
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,560
You eat too.

22
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,390
(I'm sorry.)

23
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,030
The poison of the Carefree Needle is incurable.

24
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,290
Her memory damage is irreversible.

25
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,870
Even if you remove all the needles

26
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,800
from her body,

27
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,470
she may not remember you.

28
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,430
I've never respected gods or feared ghosts,

29
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,400
but this time,

30
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,430
I hope the Buddha blesses me

31
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,960
to achieve my wish.

32
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,590
If my beloved Yuan cannot remember the past,

33
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,120
it might not be such a bad thing.

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If that's the case,

35
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,190
I'm willing to use
the remaining days of my life

36
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
to ensure she has a life without worries.

37
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,600
Sir, do you ask for fate?

38
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,390
I want to ensure one person's safety.

Feifei.

58
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,190
He ambushed me on the way here,

59
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,190
so I captured him

60
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,630
to do the chores with you.

61
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,240
Feifei, don't be afraid.

62
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,510
I'll protect you.

So,

66
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,600
the villain really didn't do anything to you?

68
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,310

in details.

70
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,390
At that time,

71
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,040
you were our only head constable

72
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
brave enough

73
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,270
to confront the Qian Kun Sect directly.

74
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
To uncover Gu Linyuan's true identity,

75
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,680
you took a risk

76
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,680
and set a trap at the Zhulou Music.

77
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,030
A trap?

78
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,360
Is that so?

79
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,510
Feifei, let me tell you.

80
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,630
You were very impressive.

81
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,040
They surrounded us with dozens of people,

82
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,240
but when you unsheathed your sword,

83
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,720
they were scared out of their wits.

84
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,070
Really?

85
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,190
I was very brave back then too.

86
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,870
Seeing my stern expression,

87
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,310
they gave up without even fighting.

88
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,040
When you took out the fire stick,

89
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,600
he didn't expect you

90
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,800
to go all out with him.

91
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,270
He instantly gave up.

92
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,720
What's wrong?

93
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,040
Are you having a headache?

94
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,430
