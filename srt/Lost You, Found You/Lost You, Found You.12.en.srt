00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,760
You're deciphering the letter?

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,600
No.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,670
I'm just doodling.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,510
You're still not fully recovered.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,160
You can't rush to decipher the letter now.

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,230
And

9
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,710
you are no longer allowed to drink tea.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,480
Why?

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,750
Because when you drink tea,

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,310
you get stomachaches.

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,960
Lying to me again.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,070
Drink it, and it won't hurt.

15
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,680
I just...

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,520
Finish it.

Could it be

he really knows my past?

32
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,240
You're building a swing.

33
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
It's for me to play on.

34
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,710
Before, it seems like...

35
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,840
Do you remember something?

36
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,360
Nothing.

37
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
Say it.

38
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,200
Before,

39
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,240
Xiang at Liushan Agency

40
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,310
seems to have built me a swing too.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,840
What did you say?

42
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,680
You told me to say it, so I did.

43
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,550
Besides,

44
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,280
I didn't see it clearly.

45
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,150
It was just a fragment from my dream.

46
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,800
Are you afraid of me?

47
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,510
He didn't build you the swing.

48
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,800
I did.

49
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,310
Do you remember what day it is today?

50
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,360
It's your birthday.

51
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,560
Whatever you want to do today,

52
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,920
I'll do it with you.

53
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,800
How do you want to celebrate your birthday?

54
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,160
I made a whole table of dishes,

55
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,800
but you didn't even take a look.

56
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,360
You've been sitting here the whole time.

57
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,270
I guess

58
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,120
you're waiting for the stars, right?

59
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,750
How do you know

60
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,680
I want to see the stars?

61
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,390
I guessed right.

62
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,600
I don't know why.

63
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,040
I just feel

64
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,950
if I don't see the stars on my birthday,

65
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll feel regret.

66
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,080
Alright.

67
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll watch the stars with you tonight.

68
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,080
Yuan,

69
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,830
this is the first birthday I've spent with you.

70
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,680
Tonight, Father is out on duty.

71
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,800
I don't have to go home.

72
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,560
So,

73
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,720
what shall we do?

74
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,800
We can watch the stars together.

75
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,510
The night sky is beautiful like a painting.

76
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,160
Let's lie down and watch the stars together.

77
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,360
Isn't that romantic?

78
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,470
Lie down?

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,120
Sitting and watching is fine too.

80
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,560
When is your birthday?

81
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,750
When is your birthday?

82
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,630
I'm an orphan without parents.

83
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,360
I don't know when I was born,

84
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,870
nor where

85
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,310
I will die.

86
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,870
So, shall we treat today

87
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,950
as your birthday too?

88
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,080
Alright.

89
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,400
It seems

90
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,360
