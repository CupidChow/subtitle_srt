=Episode 20=

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,000
Fellow colleagues,

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,870
(Liushan Agency)
we only need to enter the archives

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,840
and we can decipher the letter.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,920
Obtaining the antidote formula,

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,800
we can save Heyang City

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,440
from the curse of the Perish Pill.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,190
Feifei, you just escaped the execution ground

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,830
and are now wanted throughout the city.

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,190
If we let you in

12
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,600
and something goes wrong...

13
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,030
I'll take responsibility.

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,720
Let them in.

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,070
Here it is.

16
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,600
Jia, 25, one, 23, three.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,710
Book on the Jia shelf. Page 25.

18
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,070
Line one, the 23rd character.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,040
And three?

20
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,430
It's the dosage.

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,870
Yi Chou, nine, two, four, three.

22
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,590
Nine, two, four, three.

23
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,310
Month.

24
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,150
Uncle.

25
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,070
No.

26
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,630
It's "Lian".

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,040
"Yun".

28
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,560
"Yun Lian".

29
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,640
Yun Lian is an herb.

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,510
The formula is real.

31
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,350
The dosage is three qian.

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,640
Ding Chen, one, sixteen.

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,590
Eight, three, seven.

34
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,430
One.

35
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,920
It's okay. Keep searching.

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,790
I'll protect you.

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,520
Twenty-nine.

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,520
Four.

39
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,040
No.

40
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,710
Gu Linyuan.

41
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,630
(Jia Zi)
Surrender now and you'll be spared.

42
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,470
Gu Linyuan, stop right now.

43
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,940
(Meng Haoran's Analects)

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,280
What a small world.

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,800
Gu Linyuan, get out of my way,

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,090
or I'll kill you too.

47
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,150
Du Xiaoyu,

48
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,120
don't you already know my name is Fei?

49
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,680
With me here today,

50
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,750
you won't take another step.

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,120
No one is getting away today.

52
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,430
Kill him!

53
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,240
Position. No.

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,080
Bone.

55
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,860
(Broken Bone)

56
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,240
Calm down.

57
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,430
Fall.

58
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,820
Ten. Page sixteen.

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,080
This is poisonous smoke.

60
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,160
(Why can't I see?)

61
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,070
Fei?

62
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,590
Fei?

63
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,270
Fei?

64
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,800
Is that you?

65
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,350
Fei.

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,840
Yuan.

67
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,110
Fei.

68
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,430
Yuan.

69
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,310
You're badly hurt.

70
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,440
I'm fine.

71
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,070
Your eyes?

72
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,120
It's just the smoke. I'm fine.

73
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,160
Fei, Fei.

74
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,830
We're running out of time.

75
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,120
Your health can't hold on much longer.

76
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,560
Fei,

77
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,430
this is the last book,

78
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,270
but it has no page numbers.

79
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,430
Read it to me now.

80
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,870
It advises couples

81
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,830
not to hate each other.

82
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,510
No, Fei. That's not right.

83
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,600
It's not right. Keep reading.

84
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,480
Don't be too affectionate.

85
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,560
Hide the world in a grain of rice.

86
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,830
Buddhism is vast.

87
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,920
Store the universe in a pot.

88
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,720
Taoism is profound.

89
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,320
I know it.

90
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,120
Profound. It's "Xuan".

91
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,240
The last ingredient is Xuan Shen.

92
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,360
It's Xuan Shen.

93
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,720
Fei, I'm worried

94
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,270
that because of the Carefree Needle,

95
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,310
I'll get

96
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,750
confused.

97
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,000
Please help me.

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,270
Don't worry.

99
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,870
Don't worry.

100
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,480
I believe in you.

101
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,510
I believe in you.

102
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,680
Jia Zi, twenty-one.

103
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,240
Twenty-three.

104
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,310
"Lian". It's "Lian".

105
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,630
Yi Chou, nine, two, four, three.

106
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,910
"Yun".

107
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,030
Ding Chen, one, 16, eight.

108
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,120
Thirty-nine.

109
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,720
"Zhi". It's "Zhi".

110
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,720
Ding Jia.

111
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,440
Five, 25.

112
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,200
Seven, four.

113
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,590
"Zi".

114
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:55,510
One, seven, five.

115
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,480
"Xuan Shen". The last ingredient is Xuan Shen.

116
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,710
Fei?

117
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,320
Fei?

118
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,360
Fei?

119
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,510
Is there anyone?

120
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,840
Fei?

121
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,080
Fei, wake up.

122
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,120
We solved it.

123
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,120
Fei!

124
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,020
(Qian Kun Sect)

125
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,300
(A month later)

126
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,030
(Seal)

127
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,870
Let's go.

128
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,910
The Qian Kun Sect has long
violated the martial code,

129
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,750
using the Perish Pill

130
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,000
to control their members

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,080
and killing innocents.

132
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,670
They deserve severe punishment.

133
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,000
The Qian Kun Sect has now been destroyed,

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,360
and the antidote for the Perish Pill
has been formulated.

135
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,550
Chu Xin, distribute the antidote

136
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,790
and save others

137
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,480
affected by the pill.

138
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,320
Yes.

139
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,390
Also,

140
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,630
the original Grand Constable, Yue Tianxing,

141
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,960
was morally corrupt

142
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,840
and deserved death.

143
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,840
Chief, I hope you can show mercy.

144
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,480
Gu Linyuan and Yun Feifei

145
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,790
do not deserve to die.

146
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,630
Indeed.

147
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,910
The antidote for the Perish Pill

148
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,990
was made by them,

149
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,840
saving countless people

150
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,510
in Heyang City.

151
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,510
They have indeed done a great deed.

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
These two are a perfect match.

153
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,150
It's a pity it took them so many years.

154
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,360
Now they can finally fulfill their wishes.

155
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,440
Feifei,

156
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,240
the chief wants to reward you.

157
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,840
Why do you want me to be the Grand Constable?

158
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,040
I don't want to.

159
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,020
(Liushan Agency)

160
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,840
You are the hope of the Liushan Agency.

161
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,360
But I'm still young.

162
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,390
I need to follow you.

163
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,200
The chief also strongly supports you

164
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,910
as the new Grand Constable.

165
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,840
Besides,

166
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,150
not appointing me

167
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,550
is the greatest reward.

168
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,320
That way, we can go

169
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,840
wherever we want.

170
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,510
So, where are you going?

171
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,320
The world is vast.

172
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,150
I just want him to stay with me,

173
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,320
wherever we go.

174
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,320
(The stars in the sky.)

175
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,840
(None are you.)

176
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,080
(Yet all are you.)
