3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,070
I'm indeed a bit disappointed

4
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,320
that we didn't see the stars,

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,870
but he seems even more upset.

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:29,920
It's raining so heavily.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,320
He's been out for a long time.

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,200
What could he be doing?

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,320
What am I worried about him for?

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,880
Even if he seems nice,

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,470
he's still a villain from the Qian Kun Sect.

12
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,230
You...

13
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,350
What's wrong?

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,840
Come with me.

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,560
Why aren't the lights on tonight?

16
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,560
Where are you taking me?

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,680
I'm taking you to see the stars.

18
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,960
How is it?

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,760
Do you like it?

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,480

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,760
You're amazing.

22
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,150
This...

23
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,470
Since the weather isn't cooperating,

24
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,000
we'll look at the stars like this.

25
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,630
They look like stars

26
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,710
and fireflies.

27
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,080
Silver candles in the autumn light.

28
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,430
Light silk fans flap at the fireflies.

29
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Your birthday gift.

30
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,030
Thank you.

31
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,030
So can we lie down

32
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
and watch the stars together?

33
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,280
What?

34
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
