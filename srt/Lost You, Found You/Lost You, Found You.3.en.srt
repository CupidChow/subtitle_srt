How dare you!

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,760
Why do you hate Mr. Yue so much?

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,440
He died suspiciously

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,190
while tracking the Perish Pill recipe.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,870
The prime suspect is his foster child,

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,710
who has vanished.

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,920
That son's name is Yuan.

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,520
It's quite similar to yours.

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,110
(Xiang Liting, Liushan Agency's Grand Constable)
Charge me with crimes.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,070
Do you think I'm afraid of it?

13
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,910
Even if I did kill him,

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,600
what could you do?

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,870
- You...
- Stop!

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,840
Feifei.

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,310
Feifei, you're hurt.

18
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,590
Did he do it to you?

19
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,430
How do you handle things?

20
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,920
This constable

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,310
is standing here unharmed, isn't she?

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,200
I am standing here,

23
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,400
but you did hurt me.

24
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,840
You wanted to kill me.

25
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,200
Are you afraid we'll uncover

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,040
your sect's crimes?

27
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,590
Ridiculous.

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,950
What crimes would we have?

29
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,000
Of course, we won't fear you.

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,350
Mr. Gu,

31
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,000
sorry for our mistake.

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,880
It's a misunderstanding.

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,400
Drink this tea

34
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,230
and settle it here.

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,400
Feifei,

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,280
I know you don't like tea leaves,

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,590
so I prepared one without them.

38
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,870
Who knows if you've poisoned it?

39
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,590
I've drunk her tea

40
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,280
and accepted

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,750
your apology.

42
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,590
I shall take my leave.

43
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,680
Stop!

I know you want to destroy Qian Kun Sect,

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,870
but there's no rush.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,280
I'll go rest.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,840
Feifei,

50
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,710
it's windy outside.

being a constable

108
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,070

111
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,790
Let go!

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,240

113
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,830
Turns out you like me.

114
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,750
Why don't you quit your job

115
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,480
and join Qian Kun Sect?

116
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,320
Let her go.

117
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,600
Mr. Gu, weren't you leaving?

118
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,160
