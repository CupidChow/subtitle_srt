(Qian Kun Sect)

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,230
News! Mr. Fan.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,870
A new batch of Perish Pills
has arrived at Zhulou Music.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,280
The seller is a new face.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,390
The situation's been tense lately.

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,830
Does Mr. Gu still plan to go?

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,870
This is just a trap

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,120
by the Liushan Agency to expose him.

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,000
Mr. Gu has ordered us

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,920
to play along

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,390
and kill whoever

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,560
may come.

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,430
Yes.

16
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,020
(Gu Linyuan, Qian Kun Sect's Enforcer)

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,560
The intermediary didn't mention

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,790
a beautiful lady would come today.

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,320
Nor did they tell me

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,150
that Qian Kun Sect's new enforcer

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,070
is so young and handsome.

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
(The Sect uses Perish Pills to control minds.)

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,590
(It's a great threat to the martial world.)

24
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,680
(Today, I brought my men,)

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,120
(disguised as poison dealers to set a trap,)

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,680
(Qian Kun Sect)
(going through so much trouble)

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,840
(to lure this enforcer out.)

28
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,870
(Liushan Agency)

29
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,510
(I hope he isn't that person.)

30
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,680
Such fine goods.

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,870
Where are they from?

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,400
This is highly toxic.

33
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,760
Do you always

34
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,280
(Yun Feifei, Liushan Agency's Head Constable)
inspect every transaction like this?

35
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,200
In Heyang City,

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,950
no one knows Perish Pills better than me.

37
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,680
If I don't verify them,

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,760
who would dare buy or sell them?

39
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,120
But you

40
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,680
seem quite curious about me.

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,200
Qian Kun Sect is the largest sect
in Heyang City.

42
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,310
Mr. Gu,

43
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,760
in just two years,

44
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,790
you went from an unknown nobody

45
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,790
to the second-in-command.

46
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,480
Isn't that intriguing?

47
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,900
(Perish Pill)

48
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,470
Fine.

49
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,910
I'm curious about something too.

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,630
Half a month ago,

51
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,560
Liushan Agency intercepted our goods.

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,910
Do you know of this?

53
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,150
I've heard about it.

54
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,840
Heard about it?

55
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,910
You're the head constable of Liushan Agency.

56
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,870
Wasn't it your doing?

57
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,960
Kill them!

58
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,630
I despise Liushan Agency the most.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,910
Tonight is your end.

60
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,430
(Huiyan Move)

61
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,960
Perish Pills have no antidote.

62
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,710
The victims can only keep taking them.

63
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,560
They're extremely harmful.

64
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,710
Rest assured.

65
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,080
Though I'm a rascal,

66
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,910
I wouldn't touch these pills.

67
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,560
You want to change your fate. I'll help you.

68
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,710
This is Huiyan Move.

69
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,630
From now on, you'll stay in the courts,

70
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,710
and I'll roam the martial world.

71
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,590
Together, we'll do good for Heyang City.

72
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,710

You suffered so much

77
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,150
to leave Qian Kun Sect.

78
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,520
Why have you

79
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,120
become their enforcer

80
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,560
because of power?

81
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,800
Five years ago, you swore to me

82
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,630
we'd never meet again.

83
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,390
Why are you here now,

as a constable?

85
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,680
I joined Liushan Agency for you.

86
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,040
Two years ago, I heard you were taken.

87
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,920
I rushed back

Are you really going to sell yourself?
