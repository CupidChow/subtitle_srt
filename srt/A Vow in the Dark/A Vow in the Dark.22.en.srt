7
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,070
My life is mine alone,

8
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,710
not fate's to command.

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,840
Jie Chuan.

10
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,070
I'm fine.

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,200
We've passed the illusion;

12
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,430
a clue will show.

13
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,420
(The Dragon Ancestor is back)

14
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:33,940
(The Dragon Ancestor is back
with the Artifact)

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,560
The Dragon Ancestor is back
with the Artifact.

16
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,020
(Serpent Immortal Temple)

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,580
Legend says

18
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,500
only the one who is
the Dragon Ancestor reborn

19
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,940
can restore the Artifact.

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,920
But how do you know

21
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,150
he's in the Serpent Immortal Temple?

22
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,320
Within the illusion

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,870
I was still conscious,

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,710
came to this place,

25
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,320
and spoke with the Dragon Ancestor.

26
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,000
Dragon Ancestor? You met him?

27
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,360
They say the Dragon Ancestor
foresees all.

28
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,360
As expected,

29
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,400
he calculated every step.

30
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,560
Do you think the conflict

31
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,470
ends so easily?

32
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,840
Ji Li is fated to slay you;

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
its edge is honed.

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,400
If you cannot settle her,

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,840
how will you settle two worlds?

36
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,870
Jie Chuan,

37
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,280
if you don't kill Ji Li,

38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,310
you'll suffer the consequences.

39
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,080
He foresees all?

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,440
That doesn't matter to me.

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,840
Yet now, when I'm with you,

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,840
I cherish

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,840
every single instant.

44
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,750
Wait.

45
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,710
Ever since the last chaos
in Hunling City,

46
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,120
Feng Tian

47
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,070
(Serpent Immortal Temple)
has sealed this area.

48
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,960
Now,

49
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,800
forcing it open

50
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,150
would need Demonic Ether.

51
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,150
The best way is to use a mortal way

52
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,990
to open it.

53
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,680
A mortal way?

54
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,200
Mortal strength?

55
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,150
Don't panic;

56
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,310
I have a plan.

57
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,600
The tea-house hired a new storyteller.

58
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,150
- Really?
- They say he's quite good.

59
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,360
To get into the temple,

60
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,100
let's just get a locksmith
to copy the key.

61
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,960
That's your brilliant idea?

62
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,680
Here's a locksmith.

63
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,590
Sir?

64
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,000
Sir?

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,240
- Why is it you?
- Master?

66
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,080
(Best Lock)

67
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,920
Have a seat.

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,120
Master, please sit.

69
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,920
Master,

70
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,280
I miss you

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,840
deeply now.

72
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,870
I miss you so much

73
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,910
that my tears fall like rain, Master!

74
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,840
Cut the drivel.

75
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,680
You are a locksmith.

76
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,870
This is true.

77
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,360
The best lock.

78
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,480
I hope I won't reincarnate

79
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,630
like Master.

80
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,630
How shameful.

81
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,640
Relax.

82
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,140
Even if you reincarnate,

83
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,320
I'll accompany you;

84
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,680
I won't let this happen.

85
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,600
Here.

86
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,120
Make a copy of this key.

87
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,200
Can you do it?

88
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,120
This...

89
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,970
You can't?

90
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,870
Impossible.

91
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,040
50 for a key.

92
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,240
Plus the fees

93
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,800
for labor, delay,

94
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,750
materials,

95
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,390
lung-clearing syrup,

96
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,430
and medical services...

97
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,870
I'll give you a discount, Master.

98
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,000
300 taels

99
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,750
in total.

100
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,830
300 taels?

101
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,750
Master,

102
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,510
you still need
to pay your disciple, right?

103
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,640
Master,

104
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,680
if you're really broke,

105
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,950
how about

106
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,190
teaching me the spell

107
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,600
of turning stone to gold tonight?

108
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,070
Master, please teach me.

109
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,190
Go away.

110
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,110
Relax.

111
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,350
The millennium jade marrow.

112
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,780
It's not conjured by spells.

113
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,600
Can you copy it or not?

114
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,740
Can you copy it or not?

115
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,560
Of course.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,920
Leave it to me.

117
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,160
We'll go in right now?

118
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,230
Don't be afraid.

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,840
I'm here.

120
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,680
How long were we gone?

121
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,070
Why has the city become like this?

122
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,940
With so much upheaval,

123
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,640
Hunling City

124
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,830
couldn't escape disaster.

125
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,240
Besides,

126
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,950
this is
the Serpent Immortal's sanctuary;

127
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,390
desolation was inevitable.

128
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,510
It's close by.

129
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,360
The Dragon Ancestor is a founding deity.

130
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,680
Even reborn,

131
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,570
why would he be in a place like this?

132
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,070
Something's there!

133
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,720
Look.

134
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,680
There's another one.

135
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,720
Stop scaring me!

136
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,040
You're an immortal,

137
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,630
yet you fear these things?

138
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,500
My cultivation is lacking, okay?

139
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,870
Find the Dragon Ancestor yourself;

140
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,710
I'm leaving.

141
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,830
This place has been abandoned for years;

142
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,190
it doesn't look inhabited.

143
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,480
Perhaps I guessed wrong.

144
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,150
But...

145
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,800
Are you looking for me?

146
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,750
Inside the well!

147
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,910
Who's there? Stop your ghost tricks!

148
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,920
As long as the money's right,

149
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,430
you can have
all the ghost tricks you want.

150
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,310
You can believe me.

151
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,360
Don't come closer!

152
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,270
Hong Baoyu?

153
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,520
You are...

154
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,190
the Dragon Ancestor?

155
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,920
You're...

156
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,630
returning it to me?

157
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,950
We had a deal.

158
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,000
The chest of gold is non-refundable.

159
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,720
Aren't you a locksmith?

160
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,910
What are you doing here?

161
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,030
I am

162
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,600
Hong Baoyu,

163
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,550
a jack of all trades.

164
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,150
As you can see,

165
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,080
I'm currently entrusted by the people;

166
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,390
now, I am

167
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,960
a demon-quelling

168
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,080
cultivator.

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,870
A con artist.

170
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,720
In this endless

171
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,960
and vast world,

172
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,720
I can ascend to the heavens

173
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,240
and descend to the abysses.

174
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,870
I know everything in the world.

175
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,480
My orders are effective.

176
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,230
Master,

177
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,240
if what you need is a locksmith,

178
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,960
I can be that too.

179
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,960
That works?

180
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,870
Any more keys to copy?

181
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,360
I'll give you a discount.

182
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,080
Exorcist, locksmith,

183
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,240
chef, bodyguard,

184
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,510
doctor, juggler,

185
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,350
and coroner.

186
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,720
Old trades.

187
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,120
Tailoring and coffin-making.

188
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,440
I've got

189
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,510
every trade covered.

190
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,270
He is

191
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,120
the Dragon Ancestor?

192
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,510
The Dragon Ancestor?

193
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,480
What does he do?

194
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,240
I can be that too.

195
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,150
How much are you paying?

196
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,000
A con artist.

197
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,390
Wait.

198
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,200
What if he really is?

199
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,670
My master is our God of War.

200
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Just in case.

201
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,630
As long as the money's enough,

202
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,630
and you keep me comfortable,

203
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,270
I can do

204
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,000
anything.

205
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,910
Is he an idiot?

206
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,120
It was glowing a moment ago;

207
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,600
now it's dark again.

208
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,600
The Dragon Ancestor should make it work.

209
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,670
Then why?

210
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,030
The Dragon Ancestor

211
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,120
was highly respected.

212
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,670
He turned his merits

213
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,150
into the Sun Artifact

214
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,130
to shine upon the world.

215
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,360
The only reason

216
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,960
the Artifact won't light

217
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,440
is that he

218
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,960
lacks virtue.

219
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,550
A mercenary

220
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,870
and cruel man

221
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,390
has no virtue at all.

222
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,280
Right.

223
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,000
Then let's melt him with love.

224
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,990
Love?

225
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,720
We'll seek the kindness inside him.

226
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,320
Virtue needs nurturing.

227
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,320
Where are you going?

228
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,000
To find him some love.

229
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,200
Find love?

230
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,910
No need.

231
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,030
Tell me who to become,

232
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,550
and I'll become them.

233
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,910
Hong Baoyu's parents?

234
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,970
You're helping Hong Zhua
look for his parents?

235
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,600
I'm trying to melt him with love.

236
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,960
Maybe he suffered some childhood trauma;

237
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,750
if we untie that knot,

238
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,720
we might fix the Sun Artifact.

239
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,080
Go on.

240
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,910
He was born with jade,

241
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,320
so everyone thought him auspicious.

242
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,360
But soon after,

243
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,390
the city met disaster:

244
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,550
Sunlight dimmed,

245
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,480
his family's fields lay waste,

246
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,440
and his parents

247
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,840
could barely stay alive.

248
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
With no choice,

249
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,910
they abandoned him while fleeing.

250
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,360
All these years,

251
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,630
in such a ruined world,

252
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,750
surviving as a lone orphan

253
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,440
is rough.

254
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,560
(So, Hong Zhua is here.)

255
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,280
(The shard was born with him.)

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,150
(If I go meet him now,)

257
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,240
(I'll fight Jie Chuan for sure.)

258
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,320
(I should disguise myself
as Hong Zhua's father)

259
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,360
(and wake him up)

260
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,960
(to take back the shard.)

261
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,230
Thank you.

262
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,120
- My pleasure.
- Thanks.

263
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,680
Goodbye.

264
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,870
(Now,)

265
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,840
(the soul inside Ji Li is complete;)

266
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,390
(Jin Li's body has appeared.)

267
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,630
(A perfect chance to exorcise.)

268
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,080
(Jie Chuan,)

269
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,590
(love truly clouds)

270
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,320
(the mind.)

271
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,440
(Since you're lost in love,)

272
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,480
(wait for the trap to close)

273
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,000
(and kill you.)

274
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,030
- Hurry up!
- Why?

275
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,240
I've got a surprise for you.

276
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,020
What surprise?

277
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,670
- I've prepared it for ages.
- Why here?

278
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,030
Hurry. Less chatter.

279
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,550
I checked your background;

280
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,870
a kind neighbor
brought your father here.

281
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,150
What do I need a father for?

282
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,110
My father?

283
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,150
What do I need a father for?

284
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,910
Don't you want to meet him

285
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,670
and ask why he abandoned you?

286
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,550
I don't.

287
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,790
I sprang from a crack in the rocks;

288
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,270
I've got no father.

289
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,510
This man

290
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,390
is the richest landlord,

291
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,080
known by everyone.

292
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,670
How famous?

293
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,000
People call him

294
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Hong Bancheng.

295
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,200
Hong Bancheng...

296
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,320
Father,

297
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,270
I'm here!

298
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,390
My jade?

299
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,360
I gave it away.

300
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,200
Gave it away? To whom?

301
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,080
To someone

302
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
I like.

303
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,600
She's Ms. Jin.

304
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,510
It's glowing!

305
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,150
Dragon Ancestor,

306
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,000
looks like we did the right thing.

307
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,080
The fated one with virtue.

308
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,670
So, what is

309
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,910
our next step?

310
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,200
Let Ji Li

311
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,030
melt the fated one,

312
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,550
and the Artifact will be restored.

313
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,440
Ji Li,

314
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,120
I never believed

315
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,320
in any fate.

316
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,030
I only want us

317
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,200
to never part in this life.

318
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,360
(Why does my chest ache so?)

319
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,150
(How annoying.)

320
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,100
(Hong Residence)

321
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,910
The spell turning stones to gold?

322
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,550
Ms. Jin taught you that?

323
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,000
Aren't you living elsewhere?

324
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,280
What are you sneaking in for so late?

325
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,630
Before I inherit your fortune,

326
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,790
I won't recognize you as my father.

327
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,600
I heard today

328
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,080
that you gave that jade
to someone you love.

329
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,030
As your father, I'm delighted.

330
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,120
I'm getting old;

331
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,910
I'd like grandchildren around me soon.

332
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,720
When will you bring her to meet me?

333
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,360
I can't.

334
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,150
She's not mine to summon.

335
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,790
Why should she come see you?

336
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,700
You're my son.

337
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,830
If you want something, fight for it,

338
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,830
or will you just hand it over?

339
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,110
In two days,

340
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,110
I'm holding a banquet
to acknowledge you as my heir.

341
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,920
She is the go-between for us.

342
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,640
Use the occasion

343
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,160
to invite her here.

344
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,030
I'll help you.

345
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,680
(On the day of the banquet,)

346
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,950
(things will go back to normal.)

347
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,920
(All this folly will finally end.)

348
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,920
(Ji Li,)

349
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,000
(you're the best knife.)

350
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
