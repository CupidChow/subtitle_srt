Ji Li.

8
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,700
Ji Li,

9
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,880
I know you resent me,

10
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,840
but since you once saved me,

11
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,790
I'll protect you
for the rest of my life.

12
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,950
Since I've given you
the Demon Pendant,

13
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,790
I will never take it back.

14
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,880
Your Soul-Search

15
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,300
left wounds still unhealed;

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,970
this pendant will let you

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,710
save the people of Hunling City.

18
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,240
Thank you, Immortal!

19
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,940
Thank you, Immortal!

20
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,150
Many thanks, Immortal!

21
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,280
Thank you, Immortal!

22
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,560
No need for this.

23
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,030
I am only a minor immortal;

24
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,470
I do not deserve such reverence.

25
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,520
Whoever saves us,

26
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,590
we will build

27
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,750
a temple for them!

28
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,680
That's right!

29
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,400
- He's right
- Yes!

30
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,800
The so-called Lady Serpent Immortal

31
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,960
was nothing more than an eel spirit.

32
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,520
An eel?

33
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,630
Using the drug to drive away Miasma

34
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,430
is no lasting cure.

35
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,080
You must rely on your own,

36
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,520
never grow lazy,

37
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,710
and place no hope
on immortals or demons.

38
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,080
That is the true way.

39
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,400
That's not exactly right.

40
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,750
Do you think we are in this misery

41
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,000
because we are lazy?

42
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,710
The two realms are in constant war,

43
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,910
and so we always suffer disaster.

44
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,940
If we were not driven to desperation,

45
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,560
who would sell their labor
to an eel spirit?

46
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,680
- Right!
- Yes!

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,190
The great war

48
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,000
even rains calamity on innocent mortals.

49
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,890
Tomorrow,

50
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,730
will you truly return
to the Immortal Realm?

51
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,630
Don't forget:

52
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,000
You promised me you'd grow

53
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,630
spirit plants for the Demon Realm.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,160
Spirit plants alone

55
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,750
cannot end your Miasma.

56
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,760
I believe

57
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,800
I can persuade Immortal Feng Tian

58
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,360
to share the Sun Artifact with you.

59
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,000
Then both clans

60
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,920
might at last know lasting peace.

61
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,590
Alright.

62
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
If you wish,

63
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,680
I will try my best

64
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,160
to bring

65
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,440
this peace.

66
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,310
I shall always wear

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,430
the Demon Pendant.

68
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,440
Take care

69
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,470
on the way.

70
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,390
I'll wait for you in the Demon Realm.

71
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,160
Luo Cha.

72
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,910
Your Grace.

73
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,480
With the great war looming,

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,390
please eliminate

75
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,480
Hong Zhua and Ji Li now

76
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,630
to cut off future peril.

77
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,440
Your Grace,

78
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,160
do not repeat the same mistake.

79
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,950
In the battle three centuries ago,

80
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,510
millions of demons lost their lives.

81
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,000
Now,

82
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,680
they're using the same methods

83
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,920
and even the same face.

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,120
Will you err again?

85
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,000
Still, I must keep my word.

86
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,720
I can tell him how to cultivate
the spirit plants.

87
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,400
Your Grace,

88
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,120
when you protected

89
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,830
Jin Li's shattered soul,

90
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,160
surely you meant to save her.

91
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,790
Today,

92
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,430
Ji Li is merely closer to you.

93
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,830
If Jin Li herself

94
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,750
stood before you now,

95
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,750
could you still restrain yourself?

96
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,390
Even if you could,

97
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,560
could you erase

98
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,040
the past intentions to save her?

99
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,240
Kill me if you must,

100
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
but I must speak up:

101
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,710
Jie Chuan,

102
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,120
you traded all your memories

103
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,800
to shelter Jin Li's remnant soul

104
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,070
and sealed it in a fish-bone

105
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,750
inside Ji Li's body

106
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,600
because you wanted to dig out that bone

107
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,950
and summon her back.

108
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,790
Now,

109
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,870
war is upon us.

110
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,070
This is the best time

111
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,120
to kill her!

112
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,360
Ji Li.

113
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,080
Jie Chuan,

114
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,190
who do you care for,

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,310
Ji Li

116
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,430
or Jin Li?

117
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,830
(I'm sorry.)

118
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,360
(We're in different clans, after all.)

119
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,750
As I said,

120
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,190
I don't divide lives

121
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,160
into ranks.

122
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,980
(May the two realms know eternal peace.)

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,840
(May)

124
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,600
(the two realms)

125
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,030
(know eternal peace.)

126
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,200
Leave me alone.

127
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,470
Ji Li,

128
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,510
will you let me explain?

129
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,030
Explain what?

130
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,200
Our souls are linked

131
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,790
only because Jin Li's soul dwells in me.

132
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,630
Well...

133
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,240
What is left to explain

134
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,390
that you'd chase me here?

135
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,720
That you tricked me

136
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,040
into pulling out your ice spike?

137
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,440
Or that you tricked me

138
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,150
into stealing a false Array?

139
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,960
Those things

140
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,960
are over, aren't they?

141
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Is that so?

142
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,320
You also used me
to nurture Jin Li's soul

143
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,670
so you could revive her someday.

144
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,680
Ji Li,

145
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,280
I never meant

146
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,120
to hurt you.

147
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,920
Is that so?

148
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,840
You left behind a shred of her soul

149
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,750
so she might live again.

150
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,320
I was never allowed to choose my life.

151
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,320
I'm only a minor immortal
of feeble power,

152
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,000
but I have a name.

153
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
My name is Ji Li.

154
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,870
The Demon-subduing Immortal
is far brighter than I,

155
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,000
but why should I be deceived by you?

156
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,590
Why should I be used as a soul vessel?

157
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,960
Why should I be dragged into your epic,

158
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,600
heart-rending love story?

159
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,910
Ji Li,

160
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
I cut every tie long ago;

161
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,200
I never saw you as her.

162
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,850
Truths and lies are mixed together.

163
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,120
Luo Cha can't tell them apart.

164
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,000
Neither can I tell

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,670
who you love when you look at me.

166
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,910
What about you?

167
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,670
Ask yourself:

168
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Are you certain?

169
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,670
If I were only Ji Li,

170
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
would you have paused
for me even for an instant?

171
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,480
I saw your past with her.

172
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,750
Every moment

173
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,150
was true.

174
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,840
You still have feelings for her.

175
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,080
Then why did you take my hand?

176
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,670
Why shield me?

177
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,360
Why pretend

178
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,600
that your love was so deep?

179
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,270
Ji Li,

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,840
that's not true.

181
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,320
You can renew your love with her;

182
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,120
I don't deserve that.

183
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,480
No need to worry about me.

184
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,510
You want the fish bone?

185
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,240
You can have it back today.

186
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,080
I was a fool,

187
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,630
thinking our linked souls
meant something.

188
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,480
It was nothing but a joke.

189
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,510
No!

190
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,910
We shall be even

191
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
starting today.

192
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,510
Jie Chuan,

193
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,460
withdraw your Demonic Ether at once!

194
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
I've severed the soul bond
between you.

195
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,120
Your Demonic Ether

196
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,240
can only harm her.

197
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Ji Li, die!

198
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,440
- Ji Li!
- Ji Li!

199
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,630
Don't be afraid.

200
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,990
I'm here.

201
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,600
Master...

202
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,440
Jie Chuan,

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,670
Ji Li belongs to the Immortal Realm.

204
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,390
Her fate

205
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,360
is none of your concern.

206
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,870
If you seek to cut her bone out,

207
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,630
immortal soldiers will never agree.

208
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,630
Master,

209
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,960
I want to go home.

210
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,630
(Ji Li,)

211
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,150
(I can't deny my past with Jin Li,)

212
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,440
(but you must know:)

213
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,630
(you've never been her replacement.)

214
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,200
(What I feel for you now)

215
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,550
(has nothing to do with the past)

216
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,120
(or your face that resembles hers.)

217
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,680
Your Grace,

218
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,320
I've brought Ji Li back

219
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,160
to accept your punishment.

220
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,250
Your Grace,

221
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,360
Ji Li conspired with Jie Chuan

222
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,850
and threw Hunling City into chaos.

223
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,810
Please punish her.

224
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,040
Ji Li,

225
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,030
anything to say in your defense?

226
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,280
Your Grace,

227
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,630
the demons raid us time and again

228
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,000
only because the Miasma chokes them

229
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,080
and they lack sunlight.

230
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,110
I believe

231
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,440
if we can share the Sun Artifact,

232
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,630
the two clans can live in peace

233
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,810
and the mortals will know quiet at last.

234
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,990
Ji Li,

235
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,080
guard your tongue!

236
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,120
The Sun Artifact is our treasure.

237
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,720
Only by its light

238
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,510
are we free of Miasma.

239
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,150
Why should we share it with demons?

240
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,750
Ji Li,

241
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,120
you harbor treason in your heart.

242
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,670
Your Grace...

243
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,120
Your Grace, no!

244
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,840
Master...

245
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,270
Master!

246
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,680
Master...

247
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,800
Ji Li,

248
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,970
when you freed Jie Chuan
without permission,

249
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,150
your master bore the penalty for you.

250
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,390
Do you want to kill him now?

251
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,230
Ji Li,

252
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,470
remember:

253
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,080
You swore

254
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,960
to be strangers

255
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,360
with Jie Chuan

256
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,080
from now on.

257
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,030
I admit my guilt.

258
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,120
Here,

259
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,320
I swear

260
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,720
that I'll never have

261
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,750
dealings with Jie Chuan

262
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,790
or step into the Demon Realm.

263
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,080
Should I break this oath,

264
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,120
let heaven strike me dead,

265
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,910
my soul scatter to nothing.

266
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,840
Imprison the criminal Ji Li

267
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,630
in the Forbidden Land.

268
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:31,220
♪Thin wisps of smoke weave
through the river♪

269
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:38,180
♪Melodies and wine fade,
drunk beneath the sunset♪

270
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,900

sway the falling leaves♪

271
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:51,220

in this life♪

00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,580
♪You come to me in every way♪

273
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,700
♪Filling my dreams
with tangled love and hate♪

274
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:12,660
♪All my best years were for you♪

275
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:19,460
♪At the far edge of the world
where lanterns fade♪

276
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:26,980
♪Through the mortal dust,
time flows with its trials♪

277
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:34,100
♪Joys and sorrows ease grief♪

278
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,980
♪At dusk, petals fall
as winter snow carries the starlight♪

♪Across endless lifetimes,
the ballad endures♪
