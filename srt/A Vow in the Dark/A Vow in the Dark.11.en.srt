=Episode 11=

7
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,840
Years ago, the former sovereign
invaded the Immortal Realm

8
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,640
and lay with an immortal,

9
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,230
begetting a mongrel like you.

10
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,150
We hunted you for years;

11
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,590
today,

12
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,480
you finally fall into our hands.

13
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,430
Get lost!

14
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,040
Jie Chuan, Demon Sovereign.

15
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,070
Let's go!

16
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,230
Jie Chuan,

17
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,350
Demon Sovereign?

18
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,360
Do you know who I am?

19
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,470
Why use your dragon scale to save me?

20
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,870
You're the old man's
illegitimate daughter

21
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,430
and shouldn't be killed by immortals.

22
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,520
You're a demon,

23
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,590
so you'll be

24
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,310
under my protection.

25
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,120
You slew 100 immortals in one night,

26
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,080
worthy indeed to be my sister.

27
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,550
Come.

28
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,240
Return with me to the Demon Palace;

29
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,310
no one will harm you again.

30
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,750
Once I enter

31
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,120
the Demon Realm,

32
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,030
I'll live only for its sake.

33
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,680
From this day,

34
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,400
I swear

35
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,410
to trample the Immortal Realm
beneath my feet

36
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,750
and forge

37
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,800
an everlasting

38
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,630
demon empire.

39
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,240
You once vowed no one could hurt me;

40
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,000
yet you stroke me

41
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,240
for a little immortal.

42
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,920
Ms. Luo,

43
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,120
the Sovereign commands you

44
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,780
to oversee all affairs
during this period.

45
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,000
Where is he?

46
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,630
He went

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,870
to the Immortal Realm.

48
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,040
You haven't found Jin Li's spirit body?

49
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,710
No,

50
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,830
but we now have a lead.

51
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,720
Your Grace, be at ease.

52
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,040
Ji Li nurtures the soul;

53
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,430
Jin Li shall be the blade.

54
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,360
If Jie Chuan grows fond of either,

55
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
we can kill him.

56
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,600
If Ji Li proves uncontrollable,

57
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,790
Hong Zhua,

58
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,830
show no mercy,

59
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,230
and kill her

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,720
to end the threat.

61
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,270
Your Grace,

62
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,950
the soul within Ji Li is still unformed.

63
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,920
Even if we locate Jin Li's spirit body,

64
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,120
the soul cannot yet return.

65
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,400
Why not search

66
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,120
in secret

67
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,490
and wait for the right time

68
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,430
to draw the soul?

69
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,480
I never thought

70
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,830
you would care so much

71
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,480
for a mere soul vessel.

72
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,920
Ji Li is not as loyal

73
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,920
as Jin Li to the Immortal Realm.

74
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,360
Once the soul is extracted,

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
kill her.

76
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,110
Your Grace,

77
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,920
must it truly be so?

78
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,360
The Demon-subduing Immortal
will soon return.

79
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,310
You should be

80
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
the happiest of all.

81
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,270
I think only of the greater plan.

82
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,680
I think you've stayed too long
among demons

83
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,870
and forgotten our order.

84
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,870
Who are you to question

85
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,430
the rules of our realm?

86
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,270
Hong Zhua,

87
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,510
your wounds are grave.

88
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,630
From this day,

89
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,630
go and heal alone.

90
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,810
Ji Li will be dealt with

91
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,120
according to the procedures.

92
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,710
I...

93
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,750
Yes, Your Grace.

94
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,480
(Jin Li,)

95
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,190
(to kill Jie Chuan)

96
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,630
(and save the Six Realms,)

97
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,390
(innocent Ji Li will have to die.)

98
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,240
(Was the choice we made back then)

99
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,920
(right or wrong?)

100
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,760
Master.

101
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,880
Huan Zhen,

102
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,400
you're here.

103
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,870
In the coming days,

104
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,630
I must enter seclusion to heal.

105
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,540
Put this painting away

106
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,480
for now.

107
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:15,800
Master,

108
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,980
after all these years,

109
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,930
can you still not forget
the Demon-subduing Immortal?

110
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
It's all because of you,

111
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,520
Ji Li.

112
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,680
(It's so dark.)

113
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,000
That is the Candle Dragon

114
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,830
said to birth auroras?

115
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,360
You are the Candle Dragon
who just lit my path?

116
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,870
What's wrong with you?

117
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,910
You're hurt.

118
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,030
Were you also punished

119
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,200
and locked in this Forbidden Land?

120
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,590
I saved

121
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,720
a great demon,

122
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,030
but he used me,

123
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,320
deceived me,

124
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,870
and implicated my master.

125
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,030
Though he used me,

126
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,120
he never truly

127
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,840
harmed me.

128
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,630
He was

129
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,870
good to me

130
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,080
only because I resembled
someone he once loved.

131
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,200
I was nothing more

132
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,200
than a stand-in.

133
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,510
Being able to speak it aloud like this

134
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,550
has made me feel better.

135
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,510
My power is small,

136
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,510
yet I'm skilled at healing.

Your Grace,

162
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,200
Jie Chuan has broken in,

163
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,510
trying to steal the Sun Artifact.

164
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,790
How could Jie Chuan be here?

165
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,910
It is absolutely true.

166
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,480
The Sun Artifact's barrier
has been breached;

167
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,110
it could be destroyed at any moment.

168
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,470
Last night,

169
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,080
Jie Chuan was indeed here.

170
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,910
His dragon scale is the proof.

171
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,000
Where is

172
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,960
Jie Chuan now?

173
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,390
The Forbidden Land.

174
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,360
It's you.

175
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,440
Ji Li,

176
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,280
let me explain.

177
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,550
You must've mistaken me.

178
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,510
I am Ji Li,

179
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,960
not Jin Li.

180
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,670
That is long past.

181
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It isn't what you think.

182
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,510
You are deceiving me again.

183
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,890
This is the Immortal Realm;

184
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,480
please go back.

185
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,840
If a fight starts,
you'll be outnumbered.

186
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,320
Ji Li,

187
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,270
I knew nothing

188
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,360
of the plan to draw the soul.

189
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,840
Only after the Soul-Search

190
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,080
did my memories return;

191
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,120
only then did I learn

192
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,390
that you look alike.

193
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,510
Your Grace,

194
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,160
Ji Li has colluded with an outsider.

195
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,960
Feng Tian.

196
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,320
Ji Li,

197
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,870
what do you have to say?

198
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,080
Ji Li,

199
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,630
you conspired with a demon

200
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,440
to steal the Sun Artifact.

201
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,910
Do you confess your guilt?

202
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,110
Feng Tian,

203
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,510
are you talking about me?

204
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,630
Jie Chuan,

205
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,030
you know the answer.

206
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,150
You slipped in uninvited;

207
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,630
the Sovereign hasn't punished you,

208
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,510
yet you tried to steal the Sun Artifact.

209
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,870
Now,

210
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,750
are you going to shield an immortal?

211
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,980
You've pinned the crime on me.

212
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,470
How am I supposed to defend myself?

213
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,480
You...

214
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,720
You are insufferably arrogant!

215
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,000
That's true.

216
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,510
What can you do about it?

217
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,790
Must I report to you

218
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,030
about my whereabouts,

219
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,840
Feng Tian?

220
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,270
I'm going to shield

221
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,630
this immortal.

222
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:55,990
Today,

223
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,870
however grave her mistake is.

224
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,270
I won't step aside.

225
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,110
Don't you dare

226
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,000
lay a hand on her.

227
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,840
Your Grace,

228
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,710
I offer myself as your prisoner

229
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,600
to cooperate with the investigation.

230
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,960
Don't you dare!

231
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,030
They are framing you.

232
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,670
Can't you see?

233
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,320
Come back with me.

234
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,160
No.

235
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,870
Why should I go with you?

236
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,000
I've sworn before the Three Realms:

237
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,390
I will never set foot

238
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,360
in the Demon Realm again,

239
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,600
nor will I have any dealings

240
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
with you, Jie Chuan.

241
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,000
(Good, Jie Chuan.)

242
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,480
(Once your feelings grow,)

243
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,150
(the fish-bone mark
within Ji Li will ripen.)

244
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,630
(We cannot kill you yet,)

245
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,910
(but your arrogance won't last long.)

246
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,150
(As for what you truly feel)

247
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,750
(for Ji Li,)

248
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,150
(one test will tell.)

249
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,670
So,

250
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,360
the attack is proven beyond doubt.

251
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,790
Are you willing to accept death?

252
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,440
I am willing.

253
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,280
Death?

254
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,600
I don't think

255
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,960
you're capable of that.

256
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,880
Since you insist on holding a trial,

257
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,790
I'd like to step in:

258
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,630
Last night,

259
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,400
she was with me.

260
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,920
I'm her witness.

261
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,000
You'd best uncover the truth

262
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,920
and restore her innocence,

263
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,480
or the Immortal Realm

264
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,270
will know no peace again.

265
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,040
♪Thin wisps of smoke weave
through the river♪

266
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
♪Melodies and wine fade,
drunk beneath the sunset♪

267
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,720
♪Lonely light and sword shadow
sway the falling leaves♪

268
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,040
♪Laughing at my recklessness
in this life♪

269
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,400
♪You come to me in every way♪

270
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,520
♪Filling my dreams
with tangled love and hate♪

271
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,480
♪All my best years were for you♪

272
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:16,280
♪At the far edge of the world
where lanterns fade♪

273
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,800
♪Through the mortal dust,
time flows with its trials♪

274
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:30,920
♪Joys and sorrows ease grief♪

275
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,800
♪At dusk, petals fall
as winter snow carries the starlight♪

276
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:43,400
♪Across endless lifetimes,
the ballad endures♪
