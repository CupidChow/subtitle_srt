7
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,840
- It's the Dragon Ancestor!
- The Dragon Ancestor!

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,160
The Dragon Ancestor has appeared!

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,120
Yes.

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,070
The Dragon Ancestor.

11
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,150
The Dragon Ancestor is here.

12
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,640
He's come to save us!

13
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,390
He's come to mend the Artifact!

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,480
That's sunlight.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,920
- Real sunlight!
- Wonderful!

16
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,310
Sunlight at last!

17
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,150
Sunlight!

18
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,120
Sunlight is bathing both realms.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,680
We'll never have to fight over it again.

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,070
Hurray!

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,150
Long live the Dragon Ancestor!

22
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,560
Thank you, Dragon Ancestor!

23
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,070
Hurray!

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,840
Does it hurt?

25
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,030
From this day on,

26
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,470
immortals and demons

27
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,800
shall know no more war.

28
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,990
You and I

29
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,000
will wander the Three Realms,

30
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,880
never leaving each other's side.

31
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,030
What do you think?

32
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,590
But the fish bone inside me

33
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,840
will keep draining your Demonic Ether.

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,340
As long as I can stay with you,

35
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,470
nothing else matters.

36
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,710
From now on,

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,200
we'll be the most ordinary couple

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,560
in Hunling City.

39
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,310
I can gladly lose

40
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,750
the Demonic Ether.

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
This pouch.

42
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,550
(May)

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,280
(the two realms)

44
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,590
(know eternal peace.)

45
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,710
You didn't toss it up?

46
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
How could I

47
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,680
hand your wish to Feng Tian?

48
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll make it come true

49
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,150
for you.

50
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,470
Ji Li,

51
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,280
we're on the same side now.

52
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,030
Will you

53
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,310
marry me?

54
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,290
Now, order is restored,

55
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,150
and everything is back to normal.

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,400
Hong Zhua,

57
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,800
where is Jin Li's body?

58
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,750
It must not fall

59
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,310
into demon hands.

60
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,030
Your Grace,

61
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,430
the Three Realms are at peace,

62
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
so Jin Li's body need not appear.

63
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,560
The great war

64
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,950
brought years of disaster
to Hunling City;

65
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,750
our merit was long spent.

66
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,720
Jie Chuan ended the strife

67
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,120
and repaired the Artifact.

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,310
Even without Demonic Ether,

69
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,720
even blind,

70
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,000
he still holds the hearts of all.

71
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,270
Nonsense!

72
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,720
You once promoted me,

73
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,920
but our ways now diverge.

74
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,040
I now have my own path.

75
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,750
Jin Li's body

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,490
shall guard the Three Realms forever.

77
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,870
I request to be struck

78
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,600
from the immortal rolls.

79
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,510
I kept watch through myriad nights.

80
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,070
Does that count for less
than Jie Chuan's single rescue?

81
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,300
(Hong Residence)

82
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,830
I'm no longer the Demon Sovereign.

83
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,040
Do you think

84
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,970
anyone will come to our wedding feast?

85
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,310
With your terrible popularity?

86
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,720
Of course not.

87
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,360
I'm different.

88
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,650
Everyone immortal

89
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,900
(Invitation)
will surely come

90
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,190
and eat everything you prepare.

91
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,310
Ji Li! Ji Li!

92
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,360
Ying Ge!

93
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,240
Ying Ge's here!

94
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,480
Ying Ge, are you here for our wedding?

95
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,800
Feng Tian is about

96
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,270
to destroy the world and rebuild it.

97
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,600
Isn't he already ruler of both realms?

98
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,870
Why bother?

99
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,830
Ruler?

100
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,160
But no one acknowledges him.

101
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,750
After Jie Chuan repaired the Artifact,

102
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,630
he became the one
the Three Realms accept.

103
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,720
Deprived of popular support,

104
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,870
Feng Tian fled to Wasteland

105
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,920
and found Devourer's spell

106
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,390
that feeds on emotions and desires.

107
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,310
He plans to turn all who defy him

108
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,270
into puppets.

109
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,830
His power has soared.

110
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,390
He's now indestructible.

111
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,510
He swears

112
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,480
to wipe out Jie Chuan.

113
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,920
The Three Realms
will face chaos once more.

114
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Your Grace,

115
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,040
you still act against everyone
in the end.

116
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,360
For whose sake did we devise

117
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,920
the demon-slaying plan?

118
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,190
You became a spy,

119
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,160
fell in love with Jie Chuan,

120
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,720
yet in the end obeyed
Feng Tian's command,

121
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,120
betrayed Jie Chuan,

122
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,000
and died by his hand.

123
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,750
But none of us foresaw

124
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,720
that Jie Chuan would trade
all his memories

125
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,800
for a single fish bone,

126
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,480
sealing it inside Ji Li.

127
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,400
Ji Li,

128
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,630
innocent and lively,

129
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,720
never knew

130
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,160
she was already a piece on the board.

131
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,720
400 years have passed;

132
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,240
they now love each other dearly,

133
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,000
yet Feng Tian has become

134
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,390
the one who'd destroy the world.

135
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,800
If you were in their place,

136
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,270
what choice would you make?

137
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,720
I still remember our first meeting.

138
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,480
You were punished for stealing my wine

139
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,360
and then turned my life

140
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,870
upside down for 100 years.

141
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,000
The most domineering immortal
in my life.

142
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,040
But if I make

143
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,430
this choice for you today,

144
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,310
I'm afraid I won't find peace

145
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,070
even after death.

146
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,510
Jin Li,

147
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,790
I once promised we'd share good wine.

148
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,390
I broke that promise.

149
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,390
Don't hold it against me.

150
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,300
The world was thrown into chaos
by this fish bone scheme.

151
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,790
It's time

152
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,030
for the two of us to end it.

153
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,910
Master.

154
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,270
Please set the array for me.

155
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,460
If the Fish-Bone Array
can kill Jie Chuan,

156
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,970
it can kill Feng Tian as well.

157
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,590
Ji Li,

158
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
the Fish-Bone Array
is a self-destructive.

159
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,510
Once Feng Tian dies,

160
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,960
you will dissolve and perish, too.

161
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,000
Have you thought this through?

162
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,030
Jie Chuan has done enough for me.

163
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,000
Feng Tian wants to unmake the world.

164
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,550
Right now, the only one who can stand

165
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,750
before Jie Chuan is me.

166
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,360
I've decided.

167
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,630
Please set the array.

168
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,280
Master.

169
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,240
You're my disciple.

170
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,600
How could I let you face it alone?

171
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,270
I have poured

172
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,150
all the power of Jin Li and me

173
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,360
into the fish bone.

174
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,550
The ice spike can slay Feng Tian

175
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,440
and still leave you alive.

176
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,910
Master!

177
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,960
May you and Jie Chuan

178
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,840
grow old together in peace

179
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,750
after this battle.

180
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,350
No!

181
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,390
Master!

182
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,240
Master!

183
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,200
Master...

184
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,030
Master...

185
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,750
Master...

186
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,080
Feng Tian!

187
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,960
It's me.

188
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,960
Jie Chuan,

189
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
you're worthless now.

190
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,960
Why do they still worship you as ruler?

191
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,750
I won't accept it!

192
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,910
So,

193
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,870
you'd destroy the world?

194
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,960
Hypocrite!

195
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,750
If you don't shelter your people,

196
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,480
they will turn against you.

197
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,840
Even without me,

198
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,000
they'd find another worthy man

199
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,150
to follow.

200
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,990
Nonsense!

201
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,550
Once I kill you,

202
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,910
I become the only ruler!

203
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,030
What a surprise.

204
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,550
The mighty Demon Sovereign

205
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,870
has been so weak.

206
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,350
Jie Chuan,

207
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,200
you're useless now.

208
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,320
Feng Tian,

209
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,870
you stand alone.

210
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,080
Master and Jin Li gave their souls

211
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,480
to set things right.

212
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,710
Now,

213
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,200
after such a long-term scheme,

214
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,550
the blade meant to slay demons

215
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,150
falls on you.

216
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,630
Ji Li.

217
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,750
Jie Chuan,

218
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,150
we met and fell in love.

219
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,000
Even if I die today,

220
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,510
I won't regret it.

221
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,120
Just don't leave me behind.

222
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,960
Whatever you do, I agree.

223
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,870
You revived Jin Li.

224
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,550
Why aren't you dead?

225
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,270
I was once a weak immortal

226
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,390
and thought the war was far away.

227
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,630
Then I fell in love with Jie Chuan

228
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,470
and learned

229
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,150
the distant war was right before me.

230
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,840
Now,

231
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,720
I step forward for all living things,

232
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,440
ready to give my life

233
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,630
for righteousness,

234
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,840
to guard the future I believe in,

235
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,120
to guard Jie Chuan,

236
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,480
to guard every soul I cherish.

237
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,910
Why would I lose?

238
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,600
Why?
