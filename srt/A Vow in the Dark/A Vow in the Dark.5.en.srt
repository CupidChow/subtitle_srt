=Episode 5=

7
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,560
You're quite the God of War.

8
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,400
It would be a waste not to turn you

9
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,350
into my puppet.

10
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,930
Ji Li is Jie Chuan.

11
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,150
Ji Li is Jie Chuan.

12
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,350
Ji Li is Jie Chuan.

13
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,870
Ji Li is Jie Chuan.

14
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,480
Ji Li is Jie Chuan.

15
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,190
Ji Li has already been slain by Jie Chuan.

16
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,400
Don't tell me you're really going to

17
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,560
take revenge.

18
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,000
Jie Chuan,

19
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,190
pay for taking my disciple Ji Li's life.

20
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,240
Master.

21
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,750
Jie Chuan,

22
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,400
you took Ji Li's life

23
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,400
and even used her body to grow flowers.

24
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,590
With Ji Li gone,

25
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,030
your spirit must be shattered.

26
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,240
Today,

27
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,470
I will end you.

28
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,080
So her soul may find peace.

29
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,960
Master.

30
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,360
What are you talking about?

31
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,430
Master, what are you trying to do?

32
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,920
Master.

33
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,500
Master.

34
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,240
Master, it's me, Ji Li, wake up!

35
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,240
Master.

36
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,280
Master...

37
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,590
Ji Li.

38
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,360
Master.

39
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,360
Jie Chuan.

40
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,470
Jie Chuan,

41
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,640
let her go.

42
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,310
You used such a vile scheme,

43
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,430
trying to drive a wedge
between me and Ji Li.

44
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,560
To end you,

45
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,600
I don't need a scheme.

46
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,740
(Hunling City)

47
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,100
(Hot Spring Pavilion)

48
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,750
Who… who are these people?

49
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,350
No idea.

50
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,120
What's going on?

51
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,630
What's the situation?

52
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,680
This place is…

53
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,870
It should be my Demonic Ether

54
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,720
clashing with that fellow's power

55
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
that shattered the barrier.

56
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,800
That's how we came here.

57
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,120
We came here by irregular means.

58
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,950
Art is restricted here.

59
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,680
My power flickers on and off.

60
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,830
For the time being,

61
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,560
we're not able to go back.

62
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,600
So for now, you...

63
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,870
Does that mean

64
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,270
you've called a truce?

65
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,070
Stay here and wait for a bit.

66
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,800
I'll take a look around.

67
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,040
Why should we follow his orders?

68
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,120
We're going too.

69
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,200
Ji Li.

70
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,720
Just stay put and don't worry.

71
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,000
Is everything ready yet?

72
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,270
Lady Serpent Immortal is waiting.

73
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,560
Serpent Immortal.

74
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,270
You two, come over here.

75
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,920
A mere mortal.

76
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,830
How dare you summon me like a servant.

77
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,430
We're in the Mortal Realm.

78
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,520
Art is restricted.

79
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,160
We must act with caution.

80
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,950
Didn't you hear me speaking to you?

81
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,680
Lady Serpent chooses Ji Ling for tribute.

82
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,190
Are you ready?

83
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,870
What on earth are you wearing?

84
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,270
You look so flamboyant.

85
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,800
And are those two horns on your head?

86
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,270
This one is perfect.

87
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,800
What a rare beauty in the Hunling City!

88
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,360
How did I never notice before?

89
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,920
Lady Serpent Immortal

90
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,120
favors ones like you.

91
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,480
A delicate scholar with a gentle frame.

92
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,720
Miss, please mind yourself.

93
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,310
Guards.

94
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,360
Present him to Lady Serpent Immortal.

95
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,360
Willing or not, you must comply.

96
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,270
Take him away.

97
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,510
Master.

98
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,390
Master.

99
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,960
Master.

100
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,040
Ji Li.

101
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,870
Are you just going to watch

102
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,030
my master being taken away?

103
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,120
Do not act recklessly.

104
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,000
Our powers are restricted in Hunling City.

105
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,360
Ji Li.

106
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,840
My master...

107
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,630
Hong Zhua won't die just yet.

108
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,320
Besides,

109
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,000
they're just mortals.

110
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,510
If they all managed to kill him,

111
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,960
he wouldn't be worthy of being my rival.

112
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,960
Your spiritual power is weak

113
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,910
and your wound hasn't healed yet.

114
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,790
Let's find a place to settle down.

115
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,720
But this is Hunling City.

116
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,390
It costs money to settle down.

117
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,510
What should we do?

118
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,870
I am the lord of the Demon Realm.

119
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,320
For a thousand years,

120
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,510
I have reigned supreme,

121
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,390
revered by the common folk.

122
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,560
Besides,

123
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
I have countless temples.

124
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,150
We'd find a place to stay.

125
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,750
Let's go.

126
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,460
Hurry, over here.

127
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,510
There's lodging here.

128
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:52,220
(Hong Zhua Temple)

129
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,870
We've searched over a dozen temples.

130
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,390
All of them belong to my master.

131
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,630
Hunling City has stood for millennium,

132
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,630
witnessing changes.

133
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,840
No wonder people don't recognize you.

134
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,920
Silence.

135
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,150
Your Grace,

136
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,550
don't bother with the ignorant folk.

137
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,720
At least they left us food.

138
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,550
I'd never eat Hong Zhua's offerings.

139
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,870
The wound...

140
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,260
(Hong Zhua Temple)

141
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,510
You're badly injured

142
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,670
and you've absorbed my Demonic Ether.

143
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Two different powers clashing together

144
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,600
will force your true form to reveal.

145
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,960
Take some med for now to suppress it.

146
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,720
Once I return to the Demon Realm,

147
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,320
I'll find another way for you.

148
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,870
Don't overthink it.

149
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,150
I saved you

150
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,870
because the Demon Realm
needs spirit plants.

151
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,720
You keep saying you want to kill me,

152
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,240
yet you always end up saving me.

153
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,910
Your Grace,

154
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,080
you're approachable

155
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,240
and strikingly handsome,

156
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,060
nothing like
what the Immortal Clan describes,

157
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,910
cold, unfeeling,

158
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,910
bloodthirsty by nature.

159
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,160
Go on.

160
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,390
What other rumors

161
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,720
they have been spread?

162
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,270
I only…

163
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,840
heard it in passing.

164
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,320
Word is, Your Grace,

165
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,550
you were outplayed
by the Demon‑subduing Immortal.

166
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,320
Back during the great war,

167
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,870
he defeated you
with a single move

168
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,770
and you couldn't recover for centuries.

169
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,120
Rumor—this must be pure rumor.

170
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,000
I believe…

171
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,360
you're surely the greatest under heaven.

172
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,280
Foolish fish.

173
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,750
It is that

174
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,720
I've simply indulged you too much.

175
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,630
You mustn't let pride turn to anger.

176
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,200
That's not how a gentleman behaves.

177
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,720
Gentleman...

178
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,910
In your eyes,

179
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,000
haven't I always

180
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,910
been a great villain,

181
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,480
a swindler, have I?

182
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,270
I only called you that in secret.

183
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,510
Oh, you did in secret?

184
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,630
What is this?

185
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,080
These are fireworks.

186
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,110
Fireworks?

187
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,610
The Temple Fair in Hunling City.

188
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,630
Temple Fair.

189
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,510
Tonight, I'm in high spirits.

190
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,080
I order you

191
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,670
to join me for a stroll.

192
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,670
(Tough words, soft heart.)

193
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,200
(Perfect chance to ask about
Master's whereabouts.)

194
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,000
Wait for me, Your Grace.

195
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,780
(Tea House)

196
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,370
Sir,

197
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,320
have you seen a tall man

198
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
with peach blossom eyes

199
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,750
and fair skin?

200
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,080
No, I haven't.

201
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,080
Thanks.

202
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,870
I order you to join the Temple Fair,

203
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,360
not to hunt for Hong Zhua.

204
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,630
The Temple Fair

205
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,750
costs money.

206
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,630
How will we enjoy it?

207
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,510
Have the offerings at Hong Zhua Temple
grown dull to you?

208
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,510
Come on.

209
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,790
So close.

210
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,630
Sir.

211
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,510
What is it?

212
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,910
I heard in Hunling City,

213
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,670
if you hit ten out of ten

214
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,840
in the pitch-pot game,

215
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,600
you'll win one string of coins.

216
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,440
Is that right?

217
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,080
Ten out of ten, you say?

218
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
If you land all ten today,

219
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,270
besides the string of coins...

220
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,320
See those items over there?

221
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,910
Pick one as you wish.

222
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,240
Hasn't your power yet to fully recover?

223
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,910
Mortal trinkets.

224
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,870
I have no need to use power for this.

225
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,480
Well done.

226
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,030
- Perfect.
- Nice.

227
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,430
- Another hit.
- Indeed.

228
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,820
He must be quite the master.

229
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,600
- Impressive.
- Remarkably impressive.

230
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,320
Please halt, sir.

231
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,440
You already hit eight.

232
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,720
Do you truly believe you'll hit all ten?

233
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,550
Just grab a small prize and be done.

234
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,390
Petty mortal pest.

235
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,110
Sir,

236
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,220
step aside a bit.

237
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,080
What is a pest?

238
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,290
♪Thin wisps of smoke weave
through the river♪

239
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:03,240
♪Melodies and wine fade,
drunk beneath the sunset♪

240
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:09,980
♪Lonely light and sword shadow
sway the falling leaves♪

241
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:16,280
♪Laughing at my recklessness
in this life♪

242
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:23,650
♪You come to mein every way♪

243
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,760
♪Filling my dreams
with tangled love and hate♪

244
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,720
♪All my best years were for you♪

245
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:44,530
♪At the far edge of the world
where lanterns fade♪

246
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:52,070
♪Through the mortal dust,
time flows with its trials♪

247
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:59,180
♪Joys and sorrows ease grief♪

248
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:05,050
♪At dusk, petals fall
as winter snow carries the starlight♪

249
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:11,670
♪Across endless lifetimes,
the ballad endures♪
