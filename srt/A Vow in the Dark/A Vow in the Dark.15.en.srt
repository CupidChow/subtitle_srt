Ji Li!

12
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,510
I only have you in my heart,

13
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,680
only you.

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,400
You were in my illusion,

15
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,510
connected with my soul,

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,640
and shared my emotions.

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,760

18
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,150
you will not perish.

With my reverse scale,

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,520
you will be alright.

Ji Li, Ji Li!

22
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,430
I saw her star dim

23
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,870
in Flowing Star;

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,120
I came to save her.

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,940
Without immortal bones, she cannot live.

26
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,960
Yet

27
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,960
there is one chance left.

28
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,400
Bones can be re-forged,

29
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,940
and broken shards re-grown.

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,750

blooms the Rejoining Flower,

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,400
but it opens only

of an ancient divine beast.

Yet you must pass
through the Grave Gorge.

36
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,470
In recent years,

37
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,430
no one has entered and lived.

38
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,280
The Grave Gorge...

39
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
What is so hard about that?

79
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,590
From now on,

80
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,550
I'll follow you every lead.

81
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,960
Ji Li,

82
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,960
are you unwilling to wake up?

83
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,870
Sorry, I should never have left you.

84
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,080
Ji Li,

85
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,270
Jie Chuan

86
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,630
loves you.

Ji Li...

89
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,230
Ji Li!

90
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,270
You're awake.

91
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,960
Where is Ji Li?

92
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,080
How is she?

93
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,790
She woke long ago.

94
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,710
Then where is she?

95
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
Oh, no.

96
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,120
It's my loose tongue;

97
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,440
I mentioned the Grave Gorge.

98
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,200
She must have gone there.

99
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,480
Grave Gorge...

100
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,440
Ji Li!

101
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,480
You're hurt.

102
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,510
Just a scratch;

103
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,510
don't worry about me.

104
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,080
I brought you water from Flowing Star.

105
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,630
Drink a little.

106
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,480
Right now, the immortals

107
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,440
hates the demons to the bone.

108
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,030
Plus, Jie Chuan broke his promise.

109
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,290
If they know about your two,

110
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,910
exile will be the least
of your troubles.

111
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,550
That was only a misunderstanding.

112
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,200
I must return and explain to Master;

113
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,200
perhaps

114
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,600
I can lessen the immortals' bias
against Jie Chuan.

115
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,240
You're in trouble yourself;

116
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,150
why fret over him?

117
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,750
You should just go to the Demon Realm

118
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,300
and spare yourself this lovesick pain.

119
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,390
The great war began because of me;

120
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,960
I have to return.

121
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,360
Yet I can't stop worrying about him.

122
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,030
He suffered these wounds

123
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,270
for my sake.

124
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,590
(Ji Li)

125
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,030
(wants to return?)

126
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,550
(No. She must not leave.)

127
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,470
What's wrong?

128
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,080
Your wounds...

129
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,280
Wait.

130
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,050
Your power hasn't recovered.

131
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,390
Let me check his injuries first;

132
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,460
then we'll think of a plan.

133
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,440
Sure.

134
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
How can this be?

135
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,370
Cultivation backlash
for a Demon Sovereign?

136
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,960
What do we do?

137
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,080
I'll try again.

138
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,360
Ji Li, things are tricky now.

139
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,750
Why don't you stay here?

140
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,870
I'll fetch

141
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,240
Hong Zhua to treat him.

142
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,440
Hold on.

143
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,840
You won't see him for a while.

144
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,680
I'll go.

145
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,790
Jie Chuan, hold on.

146
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,030
Am I that fragile?

147
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,390
I'll circulate for a while.

148
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,750
I feel lively; I'm fine.

149
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,360
You two are just happy

150

to endure each other.

151
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,870
All right, I won't disturb you.

152
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,630
As for what you asked,

153
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,240
I'll pass the word to Hong Zhua.

154
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,240
As for his illness,

155
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,440
as long as you stay,

156
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,580
