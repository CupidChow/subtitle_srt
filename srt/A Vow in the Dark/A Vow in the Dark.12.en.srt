Ji Li.

00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,600
=Episode 12=
You conspired with Jie Chuan

8
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,070
to smash the Sun Artifact's barrier.

9
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,350
Was it to steal the Artifact?

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,280
Do you confess?

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,360
Your Grace,

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,430
I did see Jie Chuan yesterday,

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,400
but I absolutely did not damage
the Artifact.

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,960
What about you,

15
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,150
Jie Chuan?

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,840
Why would I destroy some trinket?

17
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,560
How dare you

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,280
frame me?

19
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,560
If not you,

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,120
why was a dragon scale found
beside the barrier?

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,920
Where were you two

22
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,790
last night?

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,920
Tell us now.

24
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,710
Last night, we never left

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,880
the Forbidden Land.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,040
How can you prove it?

27
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,190
He can prove it.

28
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,910
Ji Li is

29
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,150
a weak immortal.

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,480
How could she survive a night there?

31
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,510
I didn't want to alarm anyone,

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,070
so I used a scale

33
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,510
to shield her heart.

34
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,120
She slept through the night in my arms,

35
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,280
and thus she woke up unharmed.

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,150
What nonsense are you spouting?

37
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,120
You turned into a Candle Dragon,

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,680
so I fell asleep by accident.

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,910
Don't slander me.

40
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,360
You two

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,360
are so shameless.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,310
As for the scale beside the Artifact,

43
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,840
it must be a schemer

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,520
who was watching us

45
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,960
and stole it when we weren't looking.

46
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,920
Ridiculous!

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,750
Immortals

48
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,240
would never stoop

49
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,800
to the sordid deeds you describe;

50
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,430
it's all an empty excuse.

51
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,560
Why would you protect

52
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,840
an immortal with a dragon scale?

53
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,360
Jie Chuan,

54
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,310
you have no proof at all.

55
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,310
The case is closed:

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,910
Ji Li confesses;

57
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,730
she shall await sentence.

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,640
Your Grace,

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,680
I was also deceived by Jie Chuan;

60
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,000
I never damaged the Artifact.

61
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,310
The real culprit

62
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,560
is still at large,

63
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,290
which would cause an endless danger.

64
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,310
For the Immortal Realm,

65
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,190
I beg three days

66
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,590
to find evidence

67
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
and give the realm the truth.

68
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,360
Very well.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Three days.

70
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,920
Ji Li,

71
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,150
solve the case;

72
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,800
redeem your fault.

73
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,470
Jie Chuan, within three days,

74
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,080
you may stay here,

75
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,280
but make no reckless moves.

76
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,150
Should you stir at all,

77
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,960
Ji Li will be struck

78
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,070
from the immortal rolls forever.

79
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,030
Feng Tian!

80
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,910
Yes, Your Grace.

81
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,310
(So, Jie Chuan truly loves her.)

82
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,610
(The plan to destroy the demons)

83
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,840
(is almost within reach;)

84
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,750
(the Three Realms will soon be
at peace again.)

85
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,590
Ji Li,

86
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,430
you fell in love
with the Demon Sovereign?

87
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,310
What love?

88
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,590
Stop your nonsense.

89
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,430
I'm being framed,
and you don't even comfort me;

90
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,710
you just gossip.

91
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,630
I'm asking because I care!

92
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,710
Finding the culprit can wait;

93
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,710
what matters is

94
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,430
that your beloved is Jie Chuan!

95
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,960
Still,

96
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,000
Jie Chuan is over 1,00 years old;

97
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,720
you're barely 300.

98
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,610
Don't let him fool you.

99
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,720
I'm telling you:

100
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,800
Be careful.

101
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,310
Don't get too close to demons;

102
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,510
they're bloodthirsty,

103
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,430
fierce,

104
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,920
and ruthless.

105
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,600
Think it through!

106
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Oh, enough already!

107
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,070
I need your help.

108
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,390
I have a plan to clear my name,

109
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,630
but I need to borrow some water
from Flowing Star.

110
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,470
No problem.

111
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,800
Come back with me now for it?

112
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,120
Better not.

113
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,390
I'm still a criminal.

114
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,410
Besides,

115
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,950
Jie Chuan is still around.

116
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,480
If you dare bully Ji Li,

117
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,310
even the Demon Sovereign
won't get off lightly.

118
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,190
Hurry up. I'm waiting.

119
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,630
Okay, okay!

120
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,830
You should keep your distance

121
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,870
to avoid rumors.

122
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,950
What if they aren't rumors?

123
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,600
All the immortals know

124
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,470
- that last night...
- It's all your fault!

125
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,800
It takes two to clap.

126
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,190
Ji Li,

127
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,000
I brought the water you asked for.

128
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,480
Have you found anything?

129
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
A special mark.

130
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,720
What kind of mark?

131
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,360
What were they just saying?

132
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,510
Top secret.

133
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,430
I can't tell you.

134
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,550
Just make sure Flowing Star

135
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,070
is sealed tight for the next few days.

136
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,920
Why?

137
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,590
Look.

138
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,000
Someone dropped the dragon scale
beside the Artifact

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,830
to frame Jie Chuan and me.

140
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,120
What they don't know is

141
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,390
that the scale has
Jie Chuan's glow powder;

142
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,950
only water from Flowing Star
can wash it off.

143
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,750
If the river isn't guarded,

144
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,870
the culprit could rinse the powder away

145
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,560
while pretending to be fooling around.

146
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,800
Flowing Star can wash off
the glow powder?

147
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,560
That's huge!

148
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,510
This is important.

149
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,680
You must keep it secret.

150
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,560
You mustn't

151
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,120
tell anyone.

152
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,630
Ji Li, trust me.

153
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,270
I won't let you down.

154
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,470
I'll surely guard the secret.

155
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,310
(Ying Ge loves to gossip.)

156
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,700
(Whatever she knows,)

157
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,220
(all Three Realms hear within a day.)

158
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,050
(I'll just wait by the trap.)

159
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,510
The net is spread.

160
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,070
My name will be cleared soon.

161
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,600
By glow powder?

162
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,190
I'm afraid you'll catch nothing.

163
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,030
Why?

164
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,680
I am the immortals' prime enemy;

165
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,430
my dragon scales

166
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,920
have been studied for ages.

167
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,680
If there really were glow powder,

168
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,260
it would've been spotted long ago.

169
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,480
Your plan

170
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,520
won't work.

171
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,750
Why didn't you say so?

172
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,000
You wanted to mock me?

173
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,240
If you want the truth,

174
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,760
I'll help.

175
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,200
You have a way?

176
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,400
What's wrong?

177
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,750
If you want the culprit,

178
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,390
behave yourself.

179
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,260
That night in the Forbidden Land,

180
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,600
I sensed a third person's power.

181
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,560
I've started the Tracking Spell.

182
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,600
If their power

183
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,070
reacts with the Demonic Ether,

184
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,830
we'll have them.

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,290
Every immortal has a spirit root;

186
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,070
once tainted by my scale

187
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,630
and caught in the spell,

188
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,220
their aura will twist.

189
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,200
Jie Chuan,

190
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,470
this is the Immortal Realm;

191
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,440
don't get close to me.

192
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,440
There.

193
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,390
In the south west,

194
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,030
whose palace is it?

195
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,200
Huan Zhen?

196
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,350
Huan Zhen,

197
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,030
why is it you?

198
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,110
Huan Zhen,

199
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,030
we have the same master.

200
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,630
Why frame me?

201
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,510
Frame?

202
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,350
Yes.

203
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,240
I smashed the Sun Artifact,

204
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,550
but did I frame you?

205
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,840
Wasn't it you who proposed

206
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,510
sharing the Artifact with demons?

207
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,750
Is that not collusion?

208
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,150
(She begged the Artifact for demons?)

209
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,870
Your Grace,

210
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,390
immortals and demons

211
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,320
have battled without end,

212
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,870
leaving corpses

213
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and wailing.

214
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Innocent people in Hunling City
have also suffered from it.

215
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,030
We're seemingly enemies,

216
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,320
but in truth,

217
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,390
we fight only to survive.

218
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,390
All beings have spirits

219
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,240
and the right to live.

220
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,470
Immortals claim

221
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,910
to guard every life under heaven;

222
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,510
are the demons

223
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,270
not also lives under heaven?

224
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,870
What the demons seek

225
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,080
is only a patch of sunlight.

226
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,790
If we share the Artifact,

227
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,990
I believe

228
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,390
the two realms can live in harmony,

229
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,360
and a peaceful era will come.

230
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,120
Well said.

231
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,910
The feud between the two realms

232
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,320
does not need

233
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,750
to be settled by force.

234
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,390
Feng Tian,

235
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,840
we are both sovereigns.

236
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,750
Our first duty

237
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,320
is to shield our people

238
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,910
in peace.

239
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,600
If you share the Artifact

240
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,200
and let us cultivate spirit plants

241
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,600
to drive away the Miasma,

242
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,710
I swear

243
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,320
we shall never have war

244
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,200
but live in harmony

245
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,630
with immortals.

246
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,200
What a pity

247
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,480
that I don't have the Artifact.

248
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,870
If I had,

249
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,000
we'd gladly share it with the immortals.

250
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,550
(Jie Chuan is so eloquent.)

251
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,750
(But I'll never trust a demon.)

252
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,280
(Still,)

253
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,390
(Jin Li's soul is not yet formed,)

254
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,000
(and Jie Chuan is hard to kill;)

255
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,960
(for now, I must play along)

256
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,600
(and keep him steady.)

257
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,280
Jie Chuan,

258
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,870
you must keep your word.

259
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,840
When have I ever

260
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,440
cheated you?

261
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,590
Good.

262
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,240
Huan Zhen will be confined for now

263
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,510
for later punishment.

264
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Three days later,

265
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,240
the two realms

266
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,510
shall parley for peace

267
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,390
in the hall.

268
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,240
Jie Chuan, wonderful!

269
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,720
We'll have peace.

270
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,670
It's settled!

271
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,600
We won't have to fight anymore.

272
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,350
What's wrong?

273
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,920
Nothing.

274
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,240
My wounds have not fully healed.

275
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Are you okay?

276
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:35,840
I'm fine.

277
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,030
My memories just returned,

278
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,840
so I must return to rest.

279
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,750
Once the peace is sealed,

280
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,280
there will be

281
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,840
no more camps dividing us.

282
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,550
Was your offer of peace

283
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,840
spoken from the heart?

284
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,230
Of course.

285
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,930
I'll neither cheat
nor hide anything from you.

286
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,440
What else?

287
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,670
What else?

288
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,280
Well...

289
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,550
No more calling me stupid,

290
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,960
no more locking me,

291
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,270
and no more striking my master!

292
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,590
Master?

293
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,040
Still thinking of Hong Zhua?

294
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,840
Quite a list.

295
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,670
Going to back out?

296
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,320
You should keep your word.

297
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,230
What?

298
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,470
Fine.

299
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,870
I'll keep my word.

300
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,280
(Ji Li,)

301
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,240
(whatever trap Feng Tian sets,)

302
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,870
(I will protect you.)

303
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,680
Jie Chuan,

304
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,600
have you truly decided on peace?

305
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,630
Can the immortals' words

306
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,510
be trusted?

307
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,040
I believe them.

308
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,580
You just believe in Ji Li.

309
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,480
Have you forgotten?

310
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,870
The immortals used to hunt me.

311
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,120
They wouldn't spare even a half-blood,

312
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,390
much less demons they deem filth.

313
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,680
This peace

314
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,270
is a bait of Feng Tian

315
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,440
and Ji Li.

316
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,670
My affairs

317
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
are not yours to meddle in.

318
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,840
This concerns the entire clan.

319
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,150
How can I let private feelings rule you?

320
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,230
Your Grace,

321
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,080
have you fallen in love with her?

322
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,040
Enough.

323
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,440
Out.

324
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,960
Wait.

325
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,270
Take this.

326
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,400
The army will be standing by.

327
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,120
I promised Ji Li,

328
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,440
so I wouldn't march on the immortals,

329
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,770
yet guarding against treachery
is necessary.

330
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,230
If Feng Tian

331
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,750
strikes during the talks,

332
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,480
we must be ready.

333
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,280
Yes.

334
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,080
Who has angered you today?

335
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,480
Feng Tian

336
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,240
offered peace,

337
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,480
and my brother agreed!

338
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,240
Feng Tian's beauty-trap works well:

339
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,000
An immortal beast has Jie Chuan

340
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,120
dazed and drifting.

341
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,790
If peace is sealed,

342
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,600
your dream of unity will be over.

343
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,870
How ridiculous the oath

344
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,360
you and Jie Chuan once swore!

345
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,960
Stop sowing discord.

346
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,280
Don't be hasty.

347
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,150
I have a plan.

348
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,600
My soul-devouring aura can stir
the threads of love.

349
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,480
If Jie Chuan truly loves the immortal,

350
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,120
he'll be unconscious for three days.

351
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,630
Three days are enough

352
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,320
for you to do whatever you wish.

353
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,510
Yet our clan
still lacks the strength for a war.

354
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,910
Then let me aid you.

355
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,870
Once the war starts,

356
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,080
my aura will swallow

357
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,510
immortal power.

358
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,230
Don't worry.

359
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,240
It harms only immortals,

360
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,150
not demons.

361
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,870
This...

362
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,870
Why?

363
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,000
This matter is grave.

364
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,110
Why not wait

365
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,830
until the Sovereign wakes up?

366
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,510
The immortals
must've cast a spell on him,

367
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,350
so the Sovereign is still asleep.

368
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,890
The chance waits for no one.

369
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,680
We've had the petition.

370
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Stop dithering.

371
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,980
By the Sovereign's order:

372
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,310
the day of peace-talks

373
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,480
is the day we strike the immortals!

374
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,720
Kill! Kill!

375
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,580
Kill! Kill!

376
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,200
Kill! Kill! Kill!

377
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:51,090
♪Thin wisps of smoke weave

378
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:58,050

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:46,850
♪Through the mortal dust,
time flows with its trials♪

386
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:53,970
♪Joys and sorrows ease grief♪

387
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,850
♪At dusk, petals fall
as winter snow carries the starlight♪

388
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:06,450
♪Across endless lifetimes,
the ballad endures♪
