7
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,870
Ms. Jin.

8
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,310
Ms. Jin?

9
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,880
Why are you here?

10
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,400
Ms. Jin,

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,350
my father's throwing a banquet for us.

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,790
I want to give him a gift.

13
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,480
Could you

14
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,510
help me pick one?

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,600
I...

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,590
(No matter what fate says,)

17
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,680
(the Artifact must be mended.)

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,790
(I might as well let Master)

19
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,790
(feel love soon.)

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,840
All right.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,840
I'll come with you.

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,790
Let's go.

23
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,270
Shopkeeper!

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,680
Coming, coming.

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,230
Wrap this hairpin for me.

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,070
Sir,

27
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,070
I'm terribly sorry.

28
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,200
Just now, a patron

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,590
bought the entire shop.

30
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,560
This pin

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,040
can't be sold to you.

32
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,270
Who was it?

33
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,760
Me.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,880
You're too late

35
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,480
for this hairpin;

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,520
it's mine.

37
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,390
Weren't you choosing a gift
for your father?

38
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,200
This one

39
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,310
will do nicely.

40
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,910
I'm giving it to you.

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,200
You're welcome.

42
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,920
Later,

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,960
I'll bring a girl here.

44
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,910
You should

45
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,960
play robbers and scare her;

46
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,680
I'll swoop in and save her.

47
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,630
Understood?

48
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,560
Yes, yes.

49
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,780
Rescuing a damsel in distress.

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,680
Take this.

51
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,120
Wait.

52
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,470
Nice try.

53
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,150
Pulling this on me?

54
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,430
Everyone,

55
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,590
throw him down!

56
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,840
I just paid you in gold!

57
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,960
You saw it.

58
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,160
Hey, there must be a mistake.

59
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,080
Let me explain.

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,000
Wait!

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,280
Help! Help!

62
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,800
It glows even now?

63
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,710
No wonder Hong Baoyu
talked about surprise.

64
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,750
What a surprise indeed.

65
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,000
I didn't want you to go to him.

66
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,190
I was on my way to find you.

67
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,870
I just didn't want you

68
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,120
alone with him, okay?

69
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,680
Such a miser giving you gifts.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,960
He's up to something.

71
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm trying to restore the Artifact.

72
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,720
True feelings

73
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,270
can fix the Artifact,

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,400
but it never said

75
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,800
the feeling had to be love.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,360
There's also family and friendship.

77
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,070
Since every feeling is fine,

78
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,560
I can do it, too.

79
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,870
Stop meddling.

80
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,820
I'm only trying to mend

81
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,410
his bond with his father.

82
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,800
He invited me

83
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,160
to his banquet tonight.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,070
His bond with his father?

85
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I'll go for you.

86
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,600
It's just about feeling, right?

87
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,680
I'm brimming with warmth.

88
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,240
I'll give it to him.

89
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,680
What are you doing?

90
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,160
Hong Baoyu! Hong Baoyu!

91
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,270
Stay put.

92
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,070
You're here. Don't speak yet.

93
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,510
There are things I can't say

94
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,920
to your face,

95
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,190
so let me say them like this,

96
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,470
okay?

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,830
Before I met you,

98
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,830
I put money above everything;

99
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,480
I believed

100
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,480
money was the root of life.

101
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,630
But since knowing you,

102
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,430
I've learned

103
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,270
that some things

104
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,120
can't be measured with money.

105
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,360
Every moment between us

106
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,830
is a treasure that no money could buy.

107
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,950
Today,

108
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,430
I want to tell you:

109
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,630
I like...

110
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,040
You?

111
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,560
So, you care about me so much.

112
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,160
I was worried

113
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,870
about how to let you feel my friendship,

114
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,070
but now I know

115
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,950
I worried for nothing.

116
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,110
How about

117
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,320
we become sworn brothers?

118
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,910
You?

119
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,960
What?

120
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,030
Let us

121
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,240
swear to heaven

122
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,520
and become brothers.

123
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,910
Let us...

124
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,800
Raise your fingers.

125
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,480
Heaven, listen:

126
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,510
Hong Baoyu and I

127
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,600
form a brotherhood today.

128
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,320
We'll never abandon each other.

129
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,460
Should we break this oath,

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,050
let heaven strike us dead.

131
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,600
Say it.

132
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,190
Say it.

133
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,130
Should we break this oath,
let heaven strike us dead.

134
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,640
(Heaven,)

135
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,160
(pretend you didn't hear that,)

136
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,870
(or you'll regret it.)

137
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,920
Wait, you...

138
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,480
Who wants to be your sworn brother?

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,840
Since it's ready,

140
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,200
come and drink.

141
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,630
Who wants to drink with you?

142
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,960
Ji Li.

143
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,350
Feng Tian.

144
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,000
Come at me.

145
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,030
Let her go!

146
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,430
She is my blade to kill you.

147
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,710
Without her,

148
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,270
how else can I kill you

149
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,070
and reclaim my place
as ruler of both realms?

150
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,240
1,000 years ago,

151
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,560
I sent Jin Li to infiltrate
the Demon Realm

152
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,070
for this very day.

153
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,000
300 years ago,

154
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,430
I planted a fish bone in her

155
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,240
to trick you into nurturing it
with Demonic Ether.

156
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,390
Now,

157
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,680
the hour is ripe:

158
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,480
Once Ji Li and Jin Li become one,

159
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,870
Jie Chuan,

160
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,600
you will not escape death.

161
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,550
Let me go!

162
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,990
Ji Li.

163
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,470
Ji Li,

164
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,440
you finished what Jin Li

165
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,630
left unfinished.

166
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,080
When Jie Chuan dies,

167
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,360
you'll have the first merit.

168
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,200
Feng Tian,

169
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,440
keep dreaming.

170
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,360
Jie Chuan,

171
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,840
your Demonic Ether

172
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,000
has crushed me for years.

173
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,600
Now, the Artifact is shattered.

174
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,360
Your Demonic Ether

175
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,440
has become a weapon
that could ruin the world.

176
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,870
As expected,

177
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,630
the chaotic Demon Realm

178
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,720
should be ruined forever.

179
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,110
Ji Li!

180
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,750
I've waited for a thousand years

181
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,720
for this moment.

182
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,960
Jie Chuan,

183
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,320
will you save her

184
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,440
or the whole world?

185
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,080
Your death is already written;

186
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,440
only I

187
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,030
can rule both realms.

188
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,240
Ji Li, I just didn't want you to worry.

189
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,390
I never

190
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,320
believed in fate!

191
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,750
Stop!

192
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,390
- Master!
- Hong Zhua,

193
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,630
do you also covet

194
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,960
the throne of both realms?

195
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
Your Grace,

196
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,000
I once believed

197
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,670
immortals were orthodox,

198
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,600
and demons were heresy.

199
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,030
I longed for clear order

200
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,200
and everything

201
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,750
to work in turn.

202
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,600
But these days in Hunling City,

203
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,630
I've seen too much.

204
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,320
The immortal-demon strife

205
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,060
threw the Three Realms into chaos,

206
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,360
leaving the mortals in endless misery.

207
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,630
Is this fate?

208
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,320
If such strife

209
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,960
is indeed our fate,

210
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,750
then I will follow

211
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,670
my heart

212
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,000
and smash that fate.

213
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,370
Impossible...

214
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,630
Only the Dragon Ancestor

215
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,720
can mend the Artifact.

216
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,080
If you hand the shard to him,

217
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,480
how long do you think you'll live?

218
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,200
Precisely because of that,

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,840
salvation

220
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,390
or ruin

221
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,030
depends on Jie Chuan.

222
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,360
The Dragon Ancestor reborn

223
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,870
is Jie Chuan, Demon Sovereign.

224
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,720
Dragon Ancestor,

225
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,150
I've regained my memory.

226
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,550
Please tell me

227
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,150
the way to restore the Artifact.

228
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,200
Whatever the cost,

229
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,720
I will bear it

230
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,790
without complaint.

231
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,750
The Artifact was forged

232
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,720
with my left eye 10,000 years ago.

233
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,080
Now, it was broken

234
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,360
because of your dispute.

235
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,670
To repair it,

236
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,790
the reborn must willingly give up
both eyes.

237
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,200
Hong Zhua,

238
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,910
all phenomena

239
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,960
are but fleeting illusions.

240
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,960
You think you are me in the world,

241
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,960
yet you are not;

242
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,390
you think you cannot save the world,

243
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,670
yet perhaps you can.

244
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,920
The choice

245
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,240
is yours alone.

246
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,480
How can it be Jie Chuan?

247
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,080
Your Grace,

248
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,840
only I know

249
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,270
where Jin Li's body dwells.

250
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,870
If you insist on destroying
the Three Realms,

251
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,710
then I

252
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,150
must defy your order.

253
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,150
Everything I've done

254
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,600
was to unite the realms

255
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,030
and bring eternal peace.

256
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,630
Now, fate has chosen another?

257
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,630
Impossible.

258
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,110
Jie Chuan,

259
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,150
you claim you seek peace
between immortals and demons.

260
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,320
This is the perfect moment.

261
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,080
Offer your eyes and save the world.

262
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,910
Once you lose your sight,

263
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,870
let's see how many days you survive.

264
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,790
Why should I risk the wrath of heaven

265
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,790
to kill a benefactor

266
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,240
who'll soon be blind?

267
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,240
So what

268
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,270
if I lose

269
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,480
a pair of eyes?

270
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,200
No.

271
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,350
Wait.

272
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,600
There has to be another way.

273
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,480
You once said

274
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,960
Hunling City

275
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,270
is vivid and alive,

276
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,170
and it's your favorite place.

277
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,630
How could you bear

278
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,270
to watch it get ruined?

279
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,320
I will stay with you

280
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,510
as a mortal.

281
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,320
You think of the Three Realms;

282
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,720
I am selfish.

283
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,670
I will stay with you

284
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,080
for the rest of my life.

285
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,680
Your Grace,

286
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,840
I will restore

287
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,630
the Sun Artifact;

288
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,750
I beg you

289
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,270
to honor your word

290
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,190
and return to your place.

291
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,590
Ji Li.

292
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,550
Ji Li, are you there?

293
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,390
Where are you?

Ji Li?

295
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,550
Ji Li, where are you?

296
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,270
Come and find me.

297
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,390
Come and find me.

298
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,560
Ji Li.

299
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,040
