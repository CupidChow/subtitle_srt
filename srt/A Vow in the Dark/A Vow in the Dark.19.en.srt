The Devourer is gnawing your mind.

13
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,280
Wake up!

14
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,190
Jie Chuan,

15
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,040
protecting her
while you're going frenzy.

16
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,710
How touching.

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,400
But you have only a shred of will now;

18
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,680
soon you'll be my nourishment.

19
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,070
Jie Chuan...

20
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,200
Interesting.

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,070
You still love her even now.

22
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,710

Jie Chuan, wake up.

I was wrong. Sorry.

Jie Chuan,

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,360
I really

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,280

Yesterday,

42
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,870
you begged me to live,

43
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,240
saying...

44
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,840
Jie Chuan, wake up.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,710
I was wrong. Sorry.

46
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,240
Jie Chuan,

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,280
I really

48
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,590
love you.

49
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,950
I spoke in haste.

50
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,120
I didn't mean to offend you.

51
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,400
Besides,

52
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,680
you're the almighty Demon Sovereign

53
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,120
who'd wipe out

54
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,680
immortals.

55
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,070
I saved you

56
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,630
only for peace,

57
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,720
not worry.

58
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,630
Don't fret.

59
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,030
Ji Li,

60
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,480
if I ask for your hand,

61
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,160
would you agree?

62
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,120
If the two realms

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,680
need a bridge,

64
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,070
I'll be it.

65
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,560
But if it's for love alone,

66
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,270
I refuse.

67
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,400
After all,

68
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,100
immortals and demons are different.

69
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,110
Very well.

70
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,190
For the two clans alone.

71
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,070
After the wedding,

72
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,630
I'll set you free.

73
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,640
(Ji Li,)

74
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,870
(what's the difference)

75
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,920
(between immortals and demons?)

76
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
(Once the traitor's found,)

77
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,390
(I'll give you a peaceful world.)

78
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,750
(You won't be harmed again.)

79
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,600
The realms are settled.

80
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,640
What should we do

81
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,070
about the immortals?

82
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,680
Demons will move to the Immortal Realm.

83
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
You're the sovereign of both.

84
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,760
Why not

85
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,310
slaughter them all

86
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,870
to avoid future troubles?

87
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,830
From Jie Chuan

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
to Ji Li:

89
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,190
Let us bind our lives

90
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,120
and get married.

91
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,240
With only you by my side,

92
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,800
the knot will be tied,

93
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,560
and we'll grow old together.

94
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,050
Both the immortals and the demons

95
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,630
will live in peace.

96
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,720
Jie Chuan and Ji Li

97
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,310
shall have eternal love.

98
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,390
Thus agreed.

99
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,030
I object!

100
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,590
Jie Chuan,

101
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,750
have you forgotten?

102
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,600
We swore

103
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,830
to exterminate every immortal.

104
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,310
Immortals are

105
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,390
all hypocrites.

106
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,510
Why marry one now?

107
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,110
Now,

108
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,040
you're their sovereign.

109
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,870
Any method serves.

110
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,510
Why marry her?

111
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,440
Luo Cha,

112
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,630
if we keep sinning

113
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,480
without conscience,

114
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,360
how are we better than them?

115
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,670
Two days ago,

116
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,950
I found the frenzy rage

117
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,160
is born

118
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,270
of a fiend

119
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,950
that feeds on threads of love,

120
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,370
regardless of the race.

121
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,510
It almost possessed me,

122
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,870
but Ji Li saved me.

123
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,720
Why were you attacked?

124
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,720
Only you went to Wasteland

125
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,120
the day before the festival.

126
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,110
Luo Cha,

127
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,920
one tug

128
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,160
unravels all.

129
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,920
Perhaps you didn't mean it,

130
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,270
but can you still control

131
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,190
the current situation?

132
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,800
All I did was

133
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,950
for demons.

134
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,480
I believe your heart

135
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,950
is with our people.

136
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,670
There is

137
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,240
one last chance:

138
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,600
At the wedding,

139
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,870
strike the fiend down.

140
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,710
Yes.

141
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
I'll obey.

142
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,720
(Jie Chuan, don't hate me.)

143
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,360
(Luo Cha,)

144
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,550
(everyone makes mistakes.)

145
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,480
(If you come back,)

146
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,840
(you'll still be my family.)

147
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,390
Devourer,

148
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,080
how dare you possess my brother

149
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,840
and feed on demons?

150
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,670
You are no demon.

151
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,480
What are you?

152
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,750
Someone

153
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,240
must've instructed you today.

154
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,790
What?

155
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,730
You're finally clever.

156
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,200
However,

157
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,030
it's too late.

158
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,200
Haven't you noticed?

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,960
From the moment we met,

160
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,360
I planted the frenzy seed.

161
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,000
Demons are so ridiculous.

162
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,480
Your cause failed

163
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,270
because of one woman.

164
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,390
Luckily, I had you,

165
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,630
so I could reignite hatred

166
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,270
between the realms

167
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,630
when they were seeking peace.

168
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,480
Your goal

169
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,670
is to ignite the great war?

170
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,550
In 3,000 years of battles,

171
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,870
the hate of countless corpses forged me:

172
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,550
I'm neither immortal

173
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,110
nor demon.

174
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,510
Luo Cha,

175
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,320
you cannot kill me;

176
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,320
Jie Chuan cannot kill me.

177
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,200
Jie Chuan,

178
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,870
I'm coming for you.

179
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,750
Master,

180
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,480
do you know why the halls
are empty today?

181
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,720
The Immortal Realm is deserted;

182
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,400
all have gone to the Demon Realm

183
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
for Jie Chuan and Ji Li's wedding.

184
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,840
I forgot.

185
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,670
Wounded by Jie Chuan,

186
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,790
you can no longer hear.

187
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,280
Master,

188
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,720
if I strip your immortal bones,

189
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,870
you'll be mortal;

190
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,030
we can live as a mortal couple

191
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,750
and stay together forever.

192
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,080
Don't worry.

193
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll protect you.

194
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,720
In your dreams.

195
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,150
Master!

196
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,510
Master,

197
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,200
I love you so.

198
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,960
Why will you never see me?

199
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,120
Huan Zhen,

200
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,230
let go.

201
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,590
Master,

202
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,750
I beg you.

203
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,630
Look at me.

204
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,320
Please look at me.

205
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Just once, Master!

206
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,040
Master!

207
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,350
Huan Zhen,

208
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,440
our lives

209
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,320
were never our own.

210
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,270
Why insist

211
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,720
on sabotaging our plan

212
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,270
and betraying us?

213
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,550
Betray you?

214
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,790
I betrayed

215
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,120
the clan

216
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,150
only for you.

217
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,390
You are mine;

218
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,030
I won't give anyone else

219
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,000
the chance to steal you.

220
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,600
Huan Zhen,

221
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,200
have you forgotten

222
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,670
everything I taught you?

223
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,240
What is honesty and truth?

224
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,120
Tell me.

225
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,960
I gave you immortal arts

226
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,960
and shaped you into human form,

227
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,030
not so you could betray the immortals.

228
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,750
You disappoint me.

229
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,720
Stay here

230
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,030
and reflect.

231
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,480
Master,

232
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,720
I'll return everything

233
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,030
you ever gave me.

234
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,390
Huan Zhen!

235
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,750
Luo Cha

236
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,390
has been gone for a day.

237
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,600
You know she's the traitor.

238
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,390
Why let her leave?

239
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,870
She is my sister;

240
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,600
I trust her.

241
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,390
I fear

242
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,440
she cannot kill the Devourer

243
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,390
and will only alert him.

244
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,920
Don't worry.

245
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,360
The Devourer feeds on threads of love.

246
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,120
Today, at our wedding,

247
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,750
with me gravely wounded,

248
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,870
he will not miss such a chance.

249
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,630
He will come.

250
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,790
Your Grace,

251
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,630
bad news.

252
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,440
Hong Zhua has escaped.

253
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,480
Shall we summon guards to pursue?

254
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,350
No need.

255
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,200
Perhaps

256
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,360
we should postpone the wedding.

257
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,010
Nothing is more important
than our wedding.

258
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,150
Carry out the orders.

259
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,200
Who will command

260
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,470
the guards?

261
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,390
You're in charge.

262
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,040
In the past,

263
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,270
she hated her mismatched eyes most

264
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,030
and used power

265
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,360
to hide them.

266
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,630
She is

267
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,030
no longer Luo Cha.

268
