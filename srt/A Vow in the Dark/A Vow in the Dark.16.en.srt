00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,350
What a stench.

8
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,350
Smelly bamboo shoot noodles again?

9
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,480
Only after Ying Ge left did I remember:

10
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,680
This stuff cures everything,

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,620
a remedy for every ill,

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,320
perfect for strengthening your body.

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,920
I have internal injuries;

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,760
I fear this thing

15
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,200
will only make them worse.

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
Then you must eat it.

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,680
It's guaranteed to heal you,

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,880
tailor-made for your condition.

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,000
If I eat,

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
you won't leave?

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,000
Then let's see whether you've caught

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,840
the strange disease

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,640
of spitting blood
the moment I walk away.

24
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,950
Ailments in this world
come in every form;

25
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,950
since you claim it works,

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,230
I might as well

27
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,070
give it

28
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,400
a try.

29
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,630
Finish it.

30
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,080
Master!

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,710
Master, why are you here?

32
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,910
Did Ying Ge

33
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,080
explain the great war

34
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,190
to you?

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
Ji Li,

36
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,080
Jie Chuan is lying.

37
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,280
On the surface it was war,

38
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,410
but he seized the chance

39
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,120
to crack the immortals' barrier

40
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,910
and poison your kind.

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,360
Now,

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,590
many immortals

43
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,120
are slipping into losses

44
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,470
of souls and threads of love.

45
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,120
Even Wasteland show signs.

46
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,000
How vicious.

47
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,520
That's surely his true purpose.

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,280
Master, is this a misunderstanding?

49
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,910
Could this be a mistake?

50
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,520
Jie Chuan would never lie to me.

51
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,240
Immortal lives hang by a thread.

52
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,080
The only thing
that can suppress the poison

53
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,360
is Jie Chuan's Demonic Ether.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,190
You are an immortal.

55
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,000
Will you save them

56
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,680
or not?

57
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,800
Of course, I will.

58
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,680
Jie Chuan

59
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,960
will lend us

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,800
his Demonic Ether,

61
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,520
right?

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,520
You still trust him?

63
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,150
I have nothing more to say.

64
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,000
Take this Spirit Sensor.

65
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,870
It will draw only

66
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,800
the Demonic Ether from him,

67
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,910
never harming his life.

68
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
The choice

69
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,470
is yours.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,590
See? I ate every last bit.

71
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,910
What's wrong?

72
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,610
Why do you linger outside?

73
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,920
My master came.

74
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,240
He says the soul-devouring aura
still lingers;

75
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,630
they need your Demonic Ether
to hold it back.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,940
The soul-devouring aura

77
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,140
was born from Elder Guo;

78
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,390
using my Demonic Ether

79
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,160
is only a temporary fix.

80
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,600
I want to take you back
to the Demon Realm

81
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,950
and investigate the root of this.

82
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,920
But that will take too long;

83
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,560
more immortals will die.

84
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,720
Yet given the current situation,

85
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,270
they'll never trust me;

86
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,390
they'll only use it

87
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,750
as fresh leverage.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,840
You just don't wish

89
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,310
to save them, right?

90
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,520
It's not that.

91
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,400
I just don't think

92
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,110
things would be so simple.

93
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,470
Trust me.

94
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,750
Come back with me tomorrow;

95
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,240
we'll find a way

96
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,830
to drive the aura away for good.

97
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,630
I must return first;

98
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,480
I'll come for you tomorrow.

99
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,390
(As the Soul-devouring Demon expected,)

100
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,070
(Jie Chuan still wants
to save the immortals.)

101
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,630
(How ridiculous.)

102
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,400
(Ji Li,)

103
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,120
(I can't let you keep bewitching him.)

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,870
(Your Grace,)

105
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,000
(if you can't sever this bond,)

106
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,070
(I'll sever it for you.)

107
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,360
The soul-devouring aura?

108
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,920
But Elder Guo is dead.

109
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,750
Can it rise again?

110
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,480
This is the cave
of the last soul search.

111
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,720
Jin Li's spirit body

112
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,040
is really in Wasteland.

113
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,510
Is the plan

114
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,350
still on track?

115
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,790
Yes.

116
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,390
The soul-devouring aura

117
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,480
has seeped through the cracked barrier

118
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,630
into the Immortal Realm.

119
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,720
Soon,

120
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
every immortal

121
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,800
(That voice sounds like...)

122
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,630
will be a walking corpse.

123
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,760
Then

124
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,870
we'll seize the Immortal Realm

125
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,560
with ease.

126
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,750
With Jin Li's help,

127
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,730
you'll surely become the sovereign

128
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,800
of both realms.

129
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,160
(Luo Cha...)

130
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,390
(Could the mastermind be...?)

131
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,040
(Master was telling the truth?)

132
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,880
Jin Li,

133
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,350
wait for me.

134
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,600
Whether it's Elder Guo

135
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,630
or Ji Li,

136
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,630
I will pay any price

137
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,360
to save you.

138
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,030
Stop acting.

139
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,790
Ji Li has already gone.

140
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,280
(Ji Li,)

141
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,510
(I came back)

142
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,150
(to prepare a surprise for you.)

143
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,840
(But I don't know)

144
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
(whether you'll like it.)

145
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,750
Your Grace,

146
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,320
such a grand Blossom-Dyeing Festival.

147
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,510
What are we celebrating?

148
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,910
I am to be wed.

149
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,630
Ji Li,

150
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,000
why so downcast?

151
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,440
Last night,

152
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,320
I dreamed
of the Demon-subduing Immortal.

153
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,630
She rebuked me

154
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,360
for leaving the Immortal Realm in peril.

155
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,790
A fragment of her soul lingers in you,

156
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,440
so nightmares bloom.

157
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,790
The Demon-subduing Immortal

158
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,030
fell centuries ago.

159
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,160
Let it go.

160
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,030
That fall

161
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,120
was hundreds of years ago.

162
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,480
Have you ever thought of seeking her?

163
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,200
Ji Li,

164
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,790
the one beside me now

165
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,920
is you.

166
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,870
Her whereabouts

167
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,120
are no concern of mine.

168
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,320
Then

169
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,910
what if

170
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,010
the Demon-subduing Immortal

171
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,320
came begging you

172
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,910
to save the immortals

173
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,180
with your Demonic Ether?

174
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,990
Ji Li,

175
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,550
it's not that I refuse;

176
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,130
I simply won't be played
by Feng Tian's provocation.

177
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
The great war has just come to an end.

178
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,000
Why would he stake

179
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,750
his people's hope on demons?

180
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,560
It reeks

181
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,240
of a scheme.

182
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,960
I have battled him

183
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,630
a thousand years;

184
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,480
I know him.

185
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,280
Fine.

186
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,510
Alright.

187
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,200
I understand.

188
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,670
One last thing.

189
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,720
Where were you

190
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,560
just now?

191
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,350
I...

192
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,060
I've been in the Demon Realm.

193
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:20,940
Affairs piled up,

194
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,100
so they took

195
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,250
some time.

196
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,850
You must've grown impatient.

197
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,440
(You're still lying.)

198
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,360
(Jie Chuan,)

199
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,600
(how can I ask you)

200
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,200
(why you lie to me?)

201
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,870
Haven't you always wanted
to bring me back?

202
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,750
Let's go.

203
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,840
Really?

204
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,840
You're willing to come with me?

205
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,960
As an immortal criminal,

206
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,280
I can never go back.

207
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,590
Ji Li.

208
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,080
How defiant!

209
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,480
A mere lesser immortal

210
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,550
dares defy immortal fate!

211
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,540
If I ask her to kill Jie Chuan now,

212
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,870
she'll have to obey,

213
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,320
let alone use the Spirit Sensor!

214
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,600
Please calm your wrath.

215
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,000
It's a millennium plan
to destroy demons.

216
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,820
How could you lose control of Ji Li?

217
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,350
Hong Zhua,

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,340
how could you make such a mistake?

219
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,870
Your Grace,

220
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,080
if Ji Li felt nothing for Jie Chuan,

221
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,320
Jie Chuan would hardly love her
so deeply.

222
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,840
Now,

223
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,790
the fish-bone mark within her
is complete;

224
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,600
tomorrow, whatever the cost,

225
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,440
I will bring her back

226
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,200
and finish the great plan.

227
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,440
Good.

228
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
After she's back,

229
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,910
keep a close eye.

230
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,120
As long as we're ready
for Jin Li's return,

231
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,230
I don't care

232
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,390
where she is.

233
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
I saw Jin Li's spirit body

234
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,000
in a cave west of Wasteland;

235
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,590
Jie Chuan

236
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,790
was there as well.

237
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,720
Her spirit body is in Wasteland?

238
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,630
The place
in the Serpent Spirit's memory?

239
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,560
Now,

240
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,030
Jie Chuan has

241
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,600
the soul-devouring aura

242
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,790
and Jin Li's spirit body,

243
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,440
yet he feigns innocence.

244
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,960
Ji Li,

245
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,390
I don't know how he fooled you,

246
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,320
but by now

247
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,270
you must see

248
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,840
Jie Chuan is the mastermind.

249
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,220
He intends to take the Immortal Realm

250
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,000
once and for all.

251
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,390
Once he returns to the Demon Realm,

252
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,630
he will rally fresh legions

253
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,150
and march straight on us.

254
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,840
If...

255
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,870
If he wanted me dead,

256
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,080
why did he save me?

257
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,870
Feng Tian has fought him

258
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,390
for over a thousand years

259
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,780
without gaining the upper hand.

260
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,270
His kindness toward you

261
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,870
might only be a stratagem.

262
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,750
You must not let his affection

263
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,670
doom all immortals.

264
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,350
I understand.

265
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,200
I will

266
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,280
think again.

267
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,550
You don't have much time.

268
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,390
Tomorrow,

269
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,550
Jie Chuan returns to the Demon Realm;

270
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,320
tonight

271
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,750
is your final moment to decide.

272
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,670
Ji Li already misunderstands.

273
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,370
Whether Jie Chuan and she

274
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,130
ever meet again in this life

275
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,630
depends on tomorrow's festival.

276
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,960
Then tomorrow

277
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,080
shall give them an unforgettable memory.

278
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,030
Are you certain your aura will work?

279
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,030
I cannot afford

280
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,170
to leave any evidence behind.

281
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,150
Rest easy.

282
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,030
My method of uprooting love

283
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,080
is silent without a trace.

284
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,270
Once used,

285
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,840
it'll sever all affection

286
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,910
and bring more power.

287
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,480
The effect is outstanding.

288
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,960
♪Thin wisps of smoke weave
through the river♪

289
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,920
♪Melodies and wine fade,
drunk beneath the sunset♪

290
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,640
♪Lonely light and sword shadow
sway the falling leaves♪

291
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,960
♪Laughing at my recklessness
in this life♪

292
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,320
♪You come to me in every way♪

293
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,440
♪Filling my dreams
with tangled love and hate♪

294
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,400
♪All my best years were for you♪

295
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,200
♪At the far edge of the world
where lanterns fade♪

296
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,720
♪Through the mortal dust,
time flows with its trials♪

297
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,840
♪Joys and sorrows ease grief♪

298
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,720
♪At dusk, petals fall
as winter snow carries the starlight♪

299
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:10,320
♪Across endless lifetimes,
the ballad endures♪
