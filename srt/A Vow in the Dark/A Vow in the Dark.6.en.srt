00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,390
Such a shame.

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,640
So close.

9
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,000
Turns out he's a fraud.

10
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,710
No wonder it wouldn't go in.

11
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,150
Looks like this iron butterfly likes you.

12
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,150
Can't be pried off.

13
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,120
Everyone, watch closely.

14
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,430
He is cheating.

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,480
Wait, wait.

16
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,770
Forget it.

17
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,750
The whoe thing is a scam.

18
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,240
Just wait and see.

19
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,230
You won, it's yours.

20
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,790
This is what I earned.

21
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,400
Waiter.

22
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,710
Two bowls of Plain Noodles.

23
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,870
Hold on.

24
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,760
Skip the Plain Noodles.

25
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,840
Make it two bowls of

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,070
smelly bamboo shoot noodles.

27
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,280
- Got it.
- Smelly...

28
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,000
bamboo shoot noodles?

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,310
Mm.

30
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,120
What we usually have
are elixirs and delicacies.

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,310
But now we're in Hunling City.

32
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,520
We should try something bold.

33
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,750
You've been here before?

34
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,800
Mm.

35
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,430
Immortals and demons are constantly
at war.

36
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,500
My spiritual power is weak.

37
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,280
So I often sneak out in secret.

38
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,080
Honored guests,

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,750
smelly bamboo shoot noodles is ready.

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,080
Thank you.

41
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,920
Please enjoy it.

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
Such foul-smelling stuff.

43
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,150
You're not eating it?

44
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,360
Then I will.

45
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,120
You Immortal Clan folk

46
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,400
rarely have tastes like yours.s

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,560
Little rascal, still eating noodles.

48
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,590
You ruined my plan.

49
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,340
You…

50
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,680
I spared you just now.

51
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,030
Yet you didn't value it.

52
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,840
Then I'll make you suffer a bit.

53
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,470
Come on, then.

54
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,680
This is my own Heaven Formation.

55
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,560
Today, I'll let you witness it.

56
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,080
You're done now, huh?

57
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,800
Sorry, Your Grace. I'm counting on you.

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,640
Not your business.

59
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,390
(His power hasn't recovered.)

60
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,710
(But he should be fine, right?)

61
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,310
Run?

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,840
Hand over the money.

63
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,710
I…

64
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,920
Go…

65
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,630
- Monster!
- Monster!

66
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,310
Monster!

67
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,240
It's a monster!

68
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,800
No…

69
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,640
I'm not…

70
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,630
I'm not a monster.

71
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,860
I'm not a monster.

72
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,400
Strike her down! Strike her down!

73
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,470
I'm not a monster.

74
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm not a monster.

75
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:09,990
Monster!

76
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,750
Strike her down!

77
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,840
Get lost!

78
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,960
Hit her!

79
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,800
- Strike her down!
- Burn her!

80
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,600
You troublesome succubus, a true jinx.

81
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,530
Some spiritual plants in my manor
aren't planted yet.

82
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,800
I won't let you suffer any harm again.

83
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,520
Run, quickly!

84
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,880
Stop right there.

85
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,110
Where are you going?

86
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,350
Your Grace,

87
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,480
I'm taking a stroll.

88
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,270
You left me alone back there.

89
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,070
Yet you ran off in a flash.

90
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,390
Are you afraid

91
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,240
I'd settle scores?

92
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,160
No, it's not that.

93
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,750
It's just the people in Hunling City

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,070
could never be your match, Your Grace.

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,310
I was only worried that

96
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,510
I'd slow you down in a fight.

97
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,130
With the scales,

98
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,390
you can't go anywhere unnoticed.

99
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,480
You're eternal and indestructible.

100
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,800
Power beyond measure.

101
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,860
I'm just an Immortal Beast,

102
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,720
wounded and weary.

103
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,000
Unlike you, I can't recover instantly.

104
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,480
I don't want others to see me like this.

105
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,070
Even an Immortal Beast has pride.

106
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,270
I don't think

107
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,270
you look bad.

108
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,160
I just feel

109
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,120
it's a bit conspicuous.

110
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,510
Since I was the one who took you out,

111
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,040
I would never

112
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,120
hold it against you.

113
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,680
If those scales on you

114
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,760
trouble you,

115
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,600
I have a way to resolve it.

116
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,710
Really?

117
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,770
Yes.

118
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,710
I mean it.

I don't need your healing.

131
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,870
Your Grace,

132
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,750
you won't let me use Taijing Power.

133
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,510
Afraid you'd fall under my control?

134
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,950
You're overthinking it.

135
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,830
Is that so?

136
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,830
Your hand is injured.

137
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,070
Are you sure you don't need my aid?

138
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,550
I require no assistance from you.

139
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,720
Since you already know about it,

140
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,480
you'd better stay put as I say.

141
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,550
Did you hear me?

142
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,630
(So now,)

143
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,200
(have I completely restrained Jie Chuan?)

144
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,080
(Then I can push him
into saving Master.)

145
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,360
Ji Li.

146
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,790
If you dare activate it,

147
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,790
I will turn you back into a mere fish.

148
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,460
(Serpent Immortal Temple, Hunling City)

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,960
My power still hasn't recovered.

150
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,390
Sir,

151
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,150
you haven't had anything today.

152
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,750
Have you thought it through?

153
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,000
As long as you serve Lady Serpent well,

154
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,960
you could even gain immortality,

155
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,150
let alone glory and wealth.

156
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,280
Absurd.

157
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,510
Living in shameless excess,

158
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,080
yet seeking immortality?

159
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,550
This hand of yours...

160
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,080
Fair and delicate.

161
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,480
Lady Serpent will surely be pleased.

162
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,910
This pretty face.

163
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,720
Remember this,

164
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,200
use that newly made splendid robe.

165
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,350
Yes.

166
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,670
Such a slender waist.

167
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,270
Don't forget the jade belt.

168
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,110
Yes.

169
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,120
This graceful waistline.

170
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,630
Enough!

171
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,790
You're overstepping now.

172
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,270
Not yielding, are you?

173
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,350
Guards!

174
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,000
I have plenty of ways to deal with you.

175
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,870
Your Grace,

176
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,750
please.

177
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,200
You're being overly attentive.

178
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,480
Speak.

179
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,320
What is it?

180
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,670
Well, I'm here to thank you

181
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,150
for saving my life.

182
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,990
Please.

183
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,990
And?

184
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,120
Your Grace,

185
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,960
you lent me a hand,

186
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,120
healing me with your Demonic Ether.

187
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,240
It was simply like

188
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,670
bringing the dead back to life.

189
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,870
A flawless cure.

190
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,440
The touch of a master healer.

191
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,280
Please, here you go.

192
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,600
Your Grace,

193
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,720
you know,

194
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,510
our spiritual power is connected.

195
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,720
So you can't just walk away.

196
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,910
Why not help me save my master

197
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,790
while you're here?

198
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,960
No.

199
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,390
He'll survive anyway.

200
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,360
I just want to see

201
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,670
how he makes a fool of himself.

202
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,380
(Explicit Paintings)

203
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,720
Helping the wicked.

204
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,150
Aren't you afraid of divine retribution?

205
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,160
Oh dear.

206
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,720
You're so uncooperative.

207
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,000
You'll have to endure some hardship.

208
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,420
Chun'er.

209
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,960
As expected, nothing there.

210
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,270
Filthy and impure.

211
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,840
Let me tell you,

212
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,360
it's fine to be stubborn for now.

213
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,240
But when serving Lady Serpent,
you must be sweet.

214
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,030
Or you'll lose your life.

215
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,420
Don't say I didn't warn you.

216
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,360
I even have to apply the mark myself.

217
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,840
Qiu'er.

218
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,840
Dress him up properly.

219
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Not bad.

220
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,550
Lady Serpent will surely be pleased.

221
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,870
Evil demons,

222
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,510
how dare you try to seize me, an immortal.

223
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,440
Today I shall uphold justice
on Heaven's behalf.

224
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,920
Ms. Luo.

225
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,360
Demon Sovereign,

226
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,390
that rascal Hong Zhua,

227
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,390
and Ji Li

228
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,000
fell into Hunling City together.

229
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,840
What?

230
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,510
His Grace fought fiercely with Hong Zhua.

231
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,320
And the three fell into Hunling City.

232
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,900
Their powers must be constrained.

233
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,440
In that case,

234
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,030
let's take this chance

235
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,240
to end both Hong Zhua and Ji Li.

236
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,630
This one looks rather decent. Take him.

237
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,630
This one...

238
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,990
Take him too.

239
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,390
Your Grace,

240
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,240
- let's
- Move.

241
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,130
pretend to be a couple.

242
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,720
- Hurry.
- Couple?

243
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,750
You're a single man.

244
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,080
You must protect yourself well.

245
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,960
My master has already been taken.

246
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,480
If I don't shield you,

247
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,720
what if you're captured too?

248
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,720
(I'm still counting on you to save him.)

249
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,200
(You mustn't be captured.)

250
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,870
This one's not bad, take him along.

251
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,150
- Lord Commander!
- Honey.

252
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,390
Lord Commander, this is my man.

253
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,150
We're married, please let him go.

254
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,840
He's a tribute for Lady Serpent Immortal.

255
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,480
Being chosen is a blessing for you.

256
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,600
Drag her away.

257
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,240
No, don't!

258
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,540
- Lord Commander.
- Beware Lady Serpent's wrath.

259
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,680
Why do you want to enter?

260
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,720
I heard the festival
of Lady Serpent is coming.

261
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,670
We're going to try out
for the maid selection.

262
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,390
You.

263
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,360
Yes, you. Come over.

264
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,720
Lord Commander.

265
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,550
This... this is my elder sister.

266
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,030
She has trouble with her mind.

267
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,200
She's plain looking
and might startle you.

268
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,320
Step aside.

269
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,030
This little beauty looks quite fine.

270
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,670
Go, go, move along.

271
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,590
Next.

272
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,790
Take this one away as well.

273
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,160
Your Grace, Your Grace.

274
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,440
Please, don't be upset.

275
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,400
It was only a matter of expedience.

276
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,550
If you dare toy with me again,

277
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,680
you'll be done for.

278
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,480
Lady Serpent descends to the Mortal Realm.

279
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,680
Everyone, make way.

280
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,610
Tonight at the Midnight Hour,

281
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,510
Lady Serpent Immortal graces
the mortal world with her blessing.

282
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,510
Ji Ling shall be chosen anew.

283
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,200
Please rise.

284
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,050
Why should I kneel?

285
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,160
You two dare offend Lady Serpent Immortal.

286
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,720
Lower your heads and kneel, now.

287
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,550
Serpent Immortal?

288
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,110
Lady Serpent Immortal

289
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,750
descends to the Mortal Realm.

290
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,880
Everyone, make way.

291
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,440
Lady Serpent Immortal

292
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,070
bestows grace upon the world

293
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,030
at the Zi Hour.

294
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,550
Ji Ling shall be chosen anew.

295
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,070
(Ji Li and Lady Serpent Immortal)

296
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,720
