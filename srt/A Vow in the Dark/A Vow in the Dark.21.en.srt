Jie Chuan

8
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,600
really handed the Sun Artifact

9
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,670
back to the immortals?

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,720
Your Grace,

11
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,940
he's only posted a few demon generals

12
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,200
to guard it,

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,360
claiming it's shared

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,520
by immortals and demons,

15
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,040
and both sides seem content.

16
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,760
How generous,

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,760
trying to buy loyalty

18
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,480
and keep the dual throne.

19
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't let that stand.

20
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,920
If the Artifact disappears,

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,760
chaos will split the realms.

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,280
By then,

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,350
as fated doom of Jie Chuan,

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,480
Ji Li will kill him,

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,310
and everything will return to right.

26
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,920
So, this is the immortals' scheme.

27
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,710
What do you want

28
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,560
to use Ji Li for?

29
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,350
Jie Chuan,

30
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,070
you're trapped;

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,400
death is certain.

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,330
Knowing this changes nothing.

33
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,070
You've known

34
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,710
Ji Li is the knife,

35
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,350
yet your love is rooted deep.

36
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,480
Could you ever kill her?

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,960
As expected,

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,400
whoever has feelings

39
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,190
will only fail.

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,960
Neither the Artifact nor the throne

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,200
is fit for you.

42
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,030
Master.

43
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,590
Ji Li.

44
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,120
Master,

45
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,910
you and Feng Tian came

46
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,800
to steal the Artifact?

47
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,200
Ji Li.

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,240
Master,

49
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,120
can't our people live in peace?

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,360
Feng Tian

51
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,750
is no longer

52
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,240
the sovereign.

53
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,400
Why obey?

54
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,400
Do it.

55
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,400
Don't you dare.

56
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,400
How useless.

57
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,310
Master!

58
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,240
Master...

59
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,800
Jie Chuan, if you want the dual throne,

60
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,280
take it!

61
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,680
The Artifact is already broken;

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,840
its fragments reincarnated

63
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,870
with Hong Zhua.

64
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,800
No one shall get

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,430
what I cannot possess.

66
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,870
As expected,

67
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,240
with the Artifact destroyed,

68
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,170
Hunling City was caught in the backlash.

69
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,960
We still have

70
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,280
the afterglow of the Artifact;

71
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,240
once we find it,

72
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
everything will be fine.

73
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,430
Feng Tian cast the Artifact

74
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,750
and Master into the reincarnation cycle.

75
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,710
They could be

76
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,550
anywhere now.

77
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,800
It's okay.

78
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,360
The Sun Artifact

79
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,530
cannot hide its light.

80
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,080
Let's follow the glow.

81
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,710
But

82
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,280
without the Artifact,

83
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,950
Hunling City, besieged by mixed Miasma,

84
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,920
is failing;

85
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,000
it can't withstand strong spells.

86
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,720
If the city collapses,

87
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,440
all Three Realms will perish.

88
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,680
We can only use the gentle spells.

89
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,400
Sure.

90
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,580
(Hong Residence)

91
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,440
Jie Chuan,

92
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,830
there's light inside.

93
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,510
The Artifact must be in that house.

94
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,480
(Hong Residence)

95
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,720
Hong Baoyu is so greedy.

96
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,920
If he weren't handsome,

97
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,310
I'd have thrashed him long ago.

98
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,160
Yeah.

99
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,360
He was born with jade.

100
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,070
What a waste.

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,630
Born with jade...

102
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,680
(The Artifact should be on him.)

103
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,750
(Why is there nothing?)

104
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,160
(Could it be here?)

105
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,560
Young lady,

106
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,830
why burst into my chamber

107
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,720
at night?

108
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,470
Master...

109
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,310
(Hong Baoyu)

110
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,480
If you want this,

111
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,160
keep it quiet.

112
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,000
Want to touch me?

113
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,080
Here's my price:

114
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,800
one hundred gold.

115
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,830
Master, no, help!

116
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,870
Rogue, how dare you!

117
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,640
Gentleman,

118
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,870
we can bargain,

119
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,510
but I'm the dream guy
of countless ladies

120
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,600
in Hunling City.

121
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,540
How could you punch me?

122
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,480
How rough.

123
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,870
She adores my peerless looks

124
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,920
and demands service;

125
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,830
one hundred gold

126
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,800
is fair.

127
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,600
Why be mad about this?

128
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,640
Jie...

129
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,190
Mr. Jie, this isn't right.

130
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,430
Master...

131
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,390
I'm not your master.

132
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,950
Why do you look like this?

133
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,310
This is normal.

134
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,480
Hong Zhua reincarnated,

135
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,600
so his temperament changed,

136
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,720
but his nature didn't.

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,900
As an immortal,

138
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,320
he thought only of the greater good;

139
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,670
as a mortal,

140
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,860
he thinks only of money.

141
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,360
My master is not like that!

142
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,480
Master...

143
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,440
Alright.

144
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,710
Mr. Hong,

145
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,390
you must have noticed:

146
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,390
sky darkens by the day;

147
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,920
plants wither.

148
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,720
The shard you carry

149
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,190
can save all living beings.

150
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,920
All living beings?

151
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,080
Miss,

152
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,560
you're so kind.

153
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,780
So, you agree?

154
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,470
- 2,000 taels.
- What?

155
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,310
I was born with this jade;

156
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,950
it's been my companion

157
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,750
my whole life

158
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,630
and never left me.

159
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,240
It's my primordial essence.

160
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,870
This price

161
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,390
tests the sincerity

162
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,000
on behalf of all living beings.

163
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,200
Mr. Hong,

164
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,000
the world

165
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,360
truly needs it.

166
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,430
In that case,

167
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,870
for the world's sake,

168
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,320
at least 1,000 taels.

169
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,750
50% discount.

170
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,670
Get out.

171
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,480
You don't have money,

172
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,250
yet you lecture me
about all living beings?

173
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,120
This is crazy.

174
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,360
A waste of time.

175
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,240
Utterly speechless.

176
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,270
Master, how did you become like this?

177
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,720
How could he do this?

178
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,030
I told you we should tie him up,

179
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,360
but you refused.

180
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,510
Now what?

181
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,340
The Artifact is broken;

182
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,200
the light over Hunling City

183
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,390
is only afterglow.

184
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,840
We must obtain

185
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,390
the shard at once,

186
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,150
or the sun will fade,

187
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,230
and the city

188
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,120
will rot in Miasma

189
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,720
like the Demon Realm.

190
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,320
Since Hong Baoyu scorns virtue

191
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,320
and worships money,

192
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,000
let's just give him money.

193
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:27,990
Now,

194
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
only one trick will work:

195
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,600
turning stone to gold.

196
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,200
(No spells are allowed.)

197
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,480
(Have you forgotten?)

198
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,150
(Don't worry.)

199
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,630
(This is the gentlest spell.)

200
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,240
(It's so mild.)

201
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,030
(It won't harm the city.)

202
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,360
(However,)

203
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,550
(it lasts only
half an incense stick of time.)

204
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,440
(Grab the shard and run.)

205
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,690
(Sure.)

206
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,690
(You can't do it again.)

207
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,750
Mr. Hong,

208
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,440
is this enough?

209
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,840
Yes.

210
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,200
Hey.

211
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,550
You promised us.

212
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,350
No.

213
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,510
Something's wrong.

214
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,720
Yesterday, you were broke;

215
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,910
today, you're lugging gold.

216
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,440
Suspicious.

217
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,320
(He noticed?)

218
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,480
(Impossible.)

219
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,790
(He's a mortal.)

220
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,500
(How could he see through a spell?)

221
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,590
I get it!

222
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,080
You two...

223
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,510
You two

224
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,550
found a brilliant way

225
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,810
and got rich overnight.

226
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,710
Share the secret.

227
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,790
Tell me!

228
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,350
No.

229
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,570
Hand over the Artifact.

230
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,000
If you don't tell me,

231
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,270
I can't oblige.

232
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,230
Wait.

233
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,910
The shard is the priority.

234
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,390
Endure it.

235
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,390
Mr. Hong,

236
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,630
we're pressed for time.

237
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,750
Give us the shard today;

238
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,000
we'll explain next time.

239
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,240
You look down on me, right?

240
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,870
I know

241
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,600
that in your eyes,

242
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,360
- (Time's up.)
- I'm not qualified

243
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,910
to join your business,

244
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,720
but I was born

245
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,790
to hardship.

246
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,910
I can endure hardships;

247
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,550
also,

248
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,150
I'm very clever.

249
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,710
Oh, no.

250
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,080
What?

251
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,630
Don't move.

252
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,800
100 taels.

253
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,320
I have a bottom line.

254
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,040
500 taels.

255
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,440
Is that enough?

256
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,120
Sir, there are things

257
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,030
I can't do

258
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,320
for money.

259
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,910
1,000 taels.

260
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,030
How can you test me like this?

261
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,510
Any...

262
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,510
Any more?

263
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,750
What are you doing?

264
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,630
Listen.

265
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,240
Listen to what?

266
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,280
Master,

267
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,950
please accept me as your disciple.

268
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,270
Master,

269
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,910
I was narrow-sighted.

270
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Nothing earns faster

271
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,030
than turning stone to gold!

272
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,240
Take it.

273
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,200
Rise.

274
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,000
Once the reincarnation is over,

275
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,150
Master will be normal again, right?

276
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,670
If the Artifact can't be repaired,

277
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,790
he can't reincarnate,

278
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,270
and you'll be free of longing.

279
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,240
Are you jealous?

280
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,150
I rule both realms.

281
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,120
The world comes first.

282
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,710
Are you angry?

283
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,360
I was wrong.

284
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,960
I can't fix the Artifact alone.

285
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,150
The shard flickers on and off.

286
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,870
We must first

287
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,240
activate the Artifact

288
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,750
to repair it.

289
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,990
Help me.

290
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,870
I'm helpful, right?

291
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,390
(To repair the Artifact,)

292
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,260
(we must enter
the Dragon Ancestor's Illusion.)

293
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,980
(Dragon Ancestor's Illusion)

294
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,680
Jie Chuan.

295
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,550
Who are you?

296
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,670
I am the Dragon Ancestor.

297
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,150
You came for the Sun Artifact.

298
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,390
Ten thousand years ago, I gave my eyes

299
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,710
to drive out the demonic barrier

300
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,960
and forged that Artifact.

301
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,510
Now, it's been ruined by your conflict.

302
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,000
This is fate.

303
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,990
Today,

304
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm the sovereign of both;

305
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,200
immortals and demons live in peace.

306
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,840
Since I've reached

307
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,200
this illusion,

308
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,600
a way to mend the Artifact

309
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,200
must exist.

310
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,390
Please enlighten me.

311
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,000
Do you think the conflict

312
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,600
ends so easily?

313
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,200
Ji Li is fated to slay you;

314
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,840
its edge is honed.

315
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,630
If you cannot settle her,

316
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,960
how will you settle two worlds?

317
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,440
Jie Chuan,

318
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,790
if you don't kill Ji Li,

319
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,870
you'll suffer the consequences.

320
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,920
Ji Li.

321
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,120
Are you hurt?

322
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,080
I've never bowed to fate.

323
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,000
If she is fated to kill me,

324
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,510
I will break that fate.

325
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,360
How dare you defy fate?

326
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,600
In that case,

327
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,790
let me help you.

328
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,590
My life is mine alone,

329
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,110
not fate's to command.
