Hong Zhua.

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,470
Long time no see.

9
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,430
Master!

10
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,590
Hong Zhua's disciple.

11
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,480
How remarkable.

12
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,870
I still have use for you.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,950
Jie Chuan.

14
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,790
Let her go.

15
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,560
Hong Zhua.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
Centuries have passed.

17
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,870
The God of War

18
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,040
is so average.

19
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,480
Your mediocre disciple

20
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,040
is leaving with me.

21
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,430
How do you know this surge

22
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,590
belongs to the Sovereign?

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,790
The great war happened 300 years ago.

24
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,630
Jie Chuan has vanished without a trace.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,080
I think a new Sovereign

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,000
should've been chosen long ago.

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,590
Indeed, we must have a Sovereign.

28
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,190
Your ambitions

29
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,280
can no longer stay hidden.

30
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,150
You're scheming to seize the throne.

31
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,190
You're merely a hybrid.

32
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,030
We took you in

33
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,120
only for Jie Chuan's sake.

34
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,030
Watch your tone

35
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,360
when you speak to me.

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,800
I followed the last Sovereign
to win the domain.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,240
Jie Chuan was but a babe back then.

38
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,440
The Sovereign's seat
has been vacant for too long.

39
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,840
We must choose one.

40
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,680
With me here,
don't you dare act rashly.

41
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,280
Welcome back, Your Grace.

42
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,280
Welcome back, Your Grace.

43
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,080
(He truly is the Demon Sovereign.)

44
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,630
(How could he lie to me?)

45
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,080
(How detestable!)

46
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,400
traitor!

47
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,840
You're still alive.

48
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,710
You should die!

49
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,080
Jie Chuan.

50
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,710
How do you know her?

51
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,750
300 years ago,

52
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,870
she betrayed you,

53
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,360
so you were wounded and sealed.

54
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,520
Stop your nonsense.

55
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,910
I don't even know who you are.

56
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,800
Besides,

57
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,910
I'm just a 300-year-old fish.

58
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,910
I know nothing about the matters

59
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,190
from 300 years ago.

60
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,910
I don't remember

61
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,000
what happened 300 years ago.

62
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,420
But your power is feeble.

63
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,140
How could you pull out the ice spike?

64
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,900
Before I entered the Void Land,

65
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,820
what exactly happened?

66
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,540
She's nothing but a traitor.

67
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,740
Kill her now.

68
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,020
Kill her now.

69
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,220
Kill her now.

70
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,620
Kill her now.

71
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,700
Goldfish.

72
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,580
Teleportation.

73
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,000
To the Immortal Realm.

74
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,820
Fengling Port.

75
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,540
I finally made it out.

76
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,660
What happened to the Hybrid Tree?

77
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,580
You're full

78
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,740
of cunning schemes.

79
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,660
You shall die!

80
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,260
(300 years ago,)

81
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,900
(after the great war,)

82
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,780
(memories of the past)

83
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,620
(were sealed within the Void Land.)

84
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,940
(Now, the seal is broken.)

85
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,180
(The Hybrid Tree will fade.)

86
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,180
(With the past gone,)

87
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,300
(new stories emerge.)

88
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,180
Illusion.

89
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,460
If you meant to save me,

90
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,500
why didn't you do it sooner?

91
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,060
Jie Chuan.

92
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,180
Jie Chuan,

93
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,580
why did you save her?

94
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,940
Do you still

95
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,700
have feelings for her?

96
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,860
Silence.

97
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,420
I've severed

98
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,900
all ties of affection.

99
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,820
It's for the great cause.

100
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,340
For the great cause,

101
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,300
she can't die yet.

102
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,220
Hurry.

103
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,780
Hurry up.

104
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,740
Behave in the Demon Realm.

105
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,860
Get up there.

106
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,620
As expected,
all the demons are rough,

107
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,940
especially your leader

108
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,460
named Jie Chuan.

109
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,100
The roughest of you all.

110
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,380
This is maddening.

111
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,100
He's a liar! A demon!

112
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,460
Master, it's so dark.

113
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,460
Demon... no.

114
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,540
Demon Sovereign.

115
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,940
It's for me?

116
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,940
You know it's dark here?

117
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,820
You're a good demon.

118
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,740
Yes, you're a good demon.

119
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,580
What's going on?

120
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,900
Master seems

121
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,820
to have taught me how to smelt iron.

122
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,660
Let me give it a try.

123
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,420
That fish...

124
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,900
It's unbelievably tough.

125
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,500
Thanks.

126
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,620
Demon!

127
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,980
Demon Sovereign.

128
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,020
If I say

129
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,900
it fell off on its own,

130
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,780
will you believe me?

131
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,820
(The trigger)

132
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,380
(is her Taiqing Power?)

133
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,540
Demon Sovereign,

134
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,660
you're injured,

135
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,180
yet you still come to watch over me.

136
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,580
You don't have to.

137
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,580
You really don't have to.

138
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,460
Demon, what are you doing?

139
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,460
(I need to figure out
what's really going on.)

140
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,180
Use your Taiqing Power to attack me.

141
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,100
Attack me.

142
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,220
What?

143
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,780
Why would you even ask that?

144
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,340
Alright, here I go.

145
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,140
(Just as I suspected.)

146
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,860
From now on,

147
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,000
you are not allowed to use
your Taiqing Power.

148
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,820
Stay here.

149
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,220
Otherwise,

150
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,620
I'll turn you

151
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,220
into a pot of fish soup.

152
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,740
This place is filthy and dark.

153
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,460
What can I do without Taiqing Power?

154
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,660
Unless...

155
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,580
So many delicious food.

156
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,900
I've never seen them
in the Immortal Realm.

157
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,100
How ignorant.

158
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,180
My brother is nothing like Feng Tian

159
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,740
in the Immortal Clan.

160
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,980
He's full of himself.

161
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,060
Even fruit is ranked.

162
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,220
Here,

163
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,360
everyone is treated equally.

164
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,900
It's just like one big family.

165
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,820
Your realm is run

166
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,420
entirely by you and your brother.

167
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,940
Of course, it feels like a family.

168
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,140
As expected of siblings,

169
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
both of you look so cold,

170
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,540
like carved from the same mold.

171
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,100
What did you just say?

172
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,180
Isn't this a Demon Fruit?

173
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,940
I've heard my master talk about it.

174
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,580
It's said to be a rare treasure.

175
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,700
Eat one,

176
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,220
and your cultivation can leap
by a level.

177
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,100
Not bad for being held captive.

178
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,620
Captive?

179
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,020
How optimist.

180
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,060
A fish unwanted by both realms

181
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,820
are still pleased here.

182
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,900
Right now,

183
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,900
you're the traitor
to the Immortal Realm.

184
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,780
A traitor to the Immortal Realm?

185
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,180
Come back here.

186
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,140
Explain it.

187
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,580
I'm a traitor to the Immortal Realm.

188
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,340
I'm not!

189
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,820
Thinking carefully,

190
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,780
I think this demon

191
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,580
looks rather handsome.

192
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,580
Why is it

193
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,900
that every time I use Taiqing Power,

194
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,420
he seems to suddenly

195
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,300
appear right beside me

196
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,260
and then...

197
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,540
It's as if he's drawn to me.

198
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,500
No.

199
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,900
No, no.

200
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,600
This is not the time
to think about that.

201
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,820
Luo Cha was right.

202
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,900
If I stay here any longer,

203
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,740
things will get messy.

204
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,820
Right now,

205
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,380
I must clear my name.

206
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,820
Something's wrong

207
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,940
with that fish.

208
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,580
When she stirs the Taiqing Power,

209
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,580
I get drawn to her.

210
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,220
A cunning trick.

211
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,220
I can't be bound by a mere fish.

212
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,080
♪Thin wisps of smoke weave
through the river♪

213
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:07,030
♪Melodies and wine fade,
drunk beneath the sunset♪

214
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,770
♪Lonely light and sword shadow
sway the falling leaves♪

215
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:20,070
♪Laughing at my recklessness
in this life♪

216
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,440
♪You come to me in every way♪

217
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:34,550
♪Filling my dreams
with tangled love and hate♪

218
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:41,510
♪All my best years were for you♪

219
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:48,320
♪At the far edge of the world
where lanterns fade♪

220
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:55,860
♪Through the mortal dust,
time flows with its trials♪

221
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,970
♪Joys and sorrows ease grief♪

222
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,840
♪At dusk, petals fall
as winter snow carries the starlight♪

223
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:15,460
♪Across endless lifetimes,
the ballad endures♪
