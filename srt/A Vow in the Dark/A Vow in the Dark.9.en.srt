=Episode 9=

7
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,920
Today,

8
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,670
I shall serve Lady Serpent Immortal.

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,000
Who is in my bedchamber?

10
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,680
My Lady,

11
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,810
you didn't eat
smelly bamboo shoot noodles today?

12
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,520
Chase her!

13
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,350
She's an eel spirit.

14
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,870
Master.

15
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,150
Ji Li,

16
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,680
you risked your life

17
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,400
to save Jie Chuan?

18
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,750
I did it for the people of Hunling City.

19
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,740
Besides,

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
even Jie Chuan

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,840
couldn't handle

22
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,080
that eel spirit.

23
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,150
If we leave her be,

24
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,430
she'll surely harm the mortals.

25
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,360
But your power is weak;

26
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,530
how could you risk yourself?

27
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,630
At least Ji Li has loyalty,

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,430
which is far better than you,

29
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,670
a so-called God of War
wrapped in empty glory

30
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,170
who knows nothing of mortal suffering.

31
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,590
Master,

32
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,910
didn't you also come
because of the eel spirit?

33
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,280
We tracked her all the way here.

34
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,030
Right now,

35
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,520
finding her is what matters most.

36
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,060
She can't have gone far.

37
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,150
This painting is rather unusual.

38
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,910
Who ruined my face?

39
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,120
I schemed for 100 years

40
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,630
and gathered countless Ji Ling,

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,310
just so today I could become

42
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,280
the prettiest man in the world,

43
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,120
yet you destroyed it with a few strokes.

44
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,840
I cannot tolerate such humiliation!

45
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,520
Enough talk; come out at once,

46
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,000
or I'll paint your whole body black.

47
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,880
I won't!

48
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,360
With this ugly face,

49
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,590
how can I ever show myself?

50
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,680
Ugly?

51
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,310
You copied my appearance

52
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,720
and dare call it ugly?

53
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,310
Your appearance?

54
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,390
I modeled myself on a powerful immortal.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,070
(Immortal?)

56
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,480
(Could it be Jin Li?)

57
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,520
Stop!

58
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,680
Is this some conspiracy of yours?

59
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,760
Snake spirit,

60
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,600
how did you take on this form?

61
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,880
I'll protect you;

62
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,600
speak without fear.

63
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,680
I was once a minor demon
in Hunling City.

64
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,000
My power was insignificant.

65
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,680
One day, I stumbled into a cave

66
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,040
and met the spiritual body
of an immortal.

67
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,160
She was shrouded
in a soul-devouring aura.

68
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,510
The moment I drew close,

69
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,560
the aura wrapped around me

70
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,510
and boosted my cultivation,

71
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,430
allowing me to assume human shape.

72
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,630
(She didn't copy Ji Li.)

73
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,390
(Who is the one
who looks exactly like Ji Li?)

74
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,560
Heretical arts

75
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
are never the true path.

76
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,510
A monster like this

77
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,800
cannot be allowed to live.

78
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,910
Stop!

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,430
Until I figure it out,

80
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,160
you will not harm her.

81
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,540
Snake spirit,

82
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,510
who exactly was that immortal?

83
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,800
Show yourself,

84
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,340
or I'll obliterate your body and soul.

85
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,870
You'll never learn this secret.

86
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,590
Ji Li,

87
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,270
your power is too weak;

88
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,560
you mustn't use Soul-Search.

89
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,270
Ji Li!

90
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,030
Goldfish,

91
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,000
Soul-Search!

92
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,040
She looks exactly like me.

93
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,870
You painted me

94
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,190
before I even arrived.

95
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Your face

96
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,510
is already etched forever

97
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,190
in my heart.

98
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,560
Ji Li.

99
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,560
Eel spirit,

100
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,630
I spare your life today.

101
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,160
Listen:

102
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,510
From this day on,

103
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,310
you can no longer

104
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,720
bring harm to the world.

105
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,560
- Ji Li!
- Ji Li!

106
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,760
Are you alright?

107
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,800
You knew forced Soul-Search

108
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,120
would bring terrible backlash;

109
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,920
why insist on it?

Master,

129
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,620
during the Soul-Search,

130
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,660
I saw the Demon-subduing Immortal.

131
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,100
What else did you see?

132
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,380
I saw

133
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,340
she was not

134
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,060
what the immortal rumors describe.

135
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,580
She and Jie Chuan

136
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,820
were in love.

137
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,420
Master,

138
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,540
did you know

139
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,740
I look exactly like her?

140
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,860
Is that why you

141
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,060
wanted me to leave Jie Chuan

142
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,380
and return to the Immortal Realm?

143
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,260
Ji Li,

144
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,700
you are only a koi fish

145
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,740
I brought back from Fengling Sea.

146
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,660
You are not the fallen immortal.

147
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,540
You didn't know

148
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,540
about the past

149
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,580
because I didn't want to bring it up.

150
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,820
In my eyes,

151
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,980
you are simply Ji Li.

152
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,940
But in Jie Chuan's eyes,

153
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,420
I fear

154
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,020
he is looking at you

155
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,820
and seeing someone else.

156
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,860
Ji Li,

157
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,140
he's not an immortal like us.

158
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,780
I understand.

159
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,900
I understand, Master.

160
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,460
I stayed for the people of Hunling City.

161
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,420
Once this is over,

162
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,580
Jie Chuan and I will have no past left.

163
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,820
I'll return with you.

164
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,420
I'll give this Demon Pendant

165
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,580
back to him.

166
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,660
(If I)

167
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,460
(didn't look exactly)

168
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,820
(like the Demon-subduing Immortal,)

169
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,180
(would you still)

170
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,580
(fall into Hunling City to heal me,)

171
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,900
(seek my master,)

172
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,700
(and fuss)

173
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,420
(over an insignificant immortal
like me?)

174
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,740
I'm sorry.

175
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,340
Sorry?

176
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,380
Even if it costs you body and soul,

177
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,140
you still intend to kill me?

178
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,900
My love for you is sincere.

179
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,980
But killing you

180
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,620
is my fate.

181
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,060
I have to betray you.

182
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,340
May we never meet again.

183
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,420
(Jin Li,)

184
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,420
(we both once vowed to guard the peace.)

185
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,940
(Only then did our love grow.)

186
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,100
(Yet)

187
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,580
(our difference trapped you.)

188
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,100
(I loved you without regret,)

189
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,340
(so I managed to keep
a trace of your soul,)

190
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,500
(causing Ji Li's calamity by mistake.)

191
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,320
(I will repay this karmic debt)

192
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,060
(with all my remaining days.)

193
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,700
Mother.

194
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,860
Lady Serpent Immortal...

195
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,500
It hurts so much.

196
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,260
Mother.

197
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,060
Wake up, please!

198
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,780
I beg you, My Lady!

199
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,820
Lady Serpent Immortal,

200
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,740
without the drug, what can we do?

201
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,620
My Lady, give me the drug.

202
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,340
Give me the drug.

203
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,900
Give me the drug.

204
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,740
My Lady,

205
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,100
give me the drug.

206
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,060
Honey...

207
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,900
Wake up, please!

208
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,340
Lady Serpent Immortal...

209
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,620
Wake up, please!
