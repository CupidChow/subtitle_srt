8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,150
In the war,

9
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,920
the immortals were crushed.

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,150
And you

11
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,600
are the one to blame.

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,840
Today,

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,030
in this hall,

14
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,370
you're convicted
of the following crimes:

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,280
Treason

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,070
and collusion with the demons,

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,350
bringing death and ruin here.

18
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,310
I plead

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,760
guilty.

20
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,560
Your Grace,

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,680
Ji Li has committed

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,790
monstrous crimes.

23
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,910
She shall suffer

24
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,230
a heart-piercing blow,

25
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,120
with her body slain, soul scattered,

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,710
cast into the wheel of rebirth.

27
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,640
Your Grace, Ji Li has made amends.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,150
She cured immortals

29
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,350
and drove out demons.

30
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,310
Please spare his life.

31
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,510
Your Grace,

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,120
I'm responsible for Ji Li's fault

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,120
as her master.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,040
Your Grace,

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,430
please spare his life.

36
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,200
I'm willing

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,590
to bear the punishment on her behalf.

38
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,590
Guarding the immortal realm

39
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,840
was always your duty;

40
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,070
this time,

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,200
you too have erred.

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,350
Master! Master!

43
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,190
Your Grace,

44
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,430
the great war began only because of me;

45
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,780
let every punishment fall upon me.

46
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,680
It was my fault, not my master's.

47
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,800
- Spare my master!
- Ji Li!

48
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,640
Ji Li...

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,200
Master,

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,000
I let you down.

51
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,470
I'll accept my punishment.

52
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,470
Enough.

53
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,080
Ji Li will be hanged

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,680
before the Heavenly Gate.

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,960
After seven days,

56
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,630
she'll be cast into the Wasteland

57
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,800
to ponder her crimes.

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,920
Huan Zhen

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,870
broke the Artifact;

60
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,630
she'll suffer alike.

61
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,710
Yes, Your Grace.

62
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,800
I wanted peace,

63
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,740
yet you attacked them.

64
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,560
How dare you!

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,250
Where are Luo Cha and Elder Guo?

66
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,310
Your Grace,

67
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,460
after the great battle,

68
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,680
those two

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,910
vanished without a trace.

70
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,310
Find them.

71
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,910
Search the Three Realms;

72
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
bring them back alive,

73
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,900
or bring back their corpses.

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,960
Yes!

75
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,590
Wait.

76
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,910
What penalty

77
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,150
does Ji Li face?

78
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,600
She'll lose her immortal bones,

79
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,280
be hung outside the Heavenly Gate,

80
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,710
and be cast into the Wasteland.

81
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,710
For now, you will act

82
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,280
as regent of the Demon Realm.

83
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,910
Whatever happens,

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
do not stir.

85
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,800
If another mistake occurs,

86
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,430
the realm will vanish.

87
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,750
Your Grace, are you...

88
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,750
I am going

89
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,750
to the Wasteland.

90
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,420
(Wasteland)

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,960
If not for you,

92
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,560
I'd never be here.

93
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,830
My power is sealed;

94
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,070
there's no food or shelter here.

95
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,360
A lofty immortal like me

96
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,520
shouldn't suffer such misery.

97
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,280
Are you listening?

98
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,630
If you and Master weren't so close,

99
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,120
I'd never have framed you
out of jealousy.

100
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,560
What's wrong with you?

101
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,710
Cover that wound now.

102
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,720
Wasteland Bears roam here;

103
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,630
they love blood.

104
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,070
I made a mistake

105
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,950
and was banished here

106
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,240
all because of you.

107
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,430
I don't want to die here.

108
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,630
If someone must die,

109
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,470
it'll be you.

110
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,000
Come out!

111
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,470
Show yourself, or I strike.

112
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,680
Why try to hurt yourself?

113
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,070
If I hadn't, would you ever appear?

114
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,560
Why have you followed me all this way?

115
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,920
Why won't you hear me out?

116
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,440
What will it take

117
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,680
for you to trust me again?

118
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,970
There is nothing left to say.

119
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,720
I said everything

120
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,070
during the great war.

121
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,390
We are finished

122
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,600
unless you die.

123
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,540
My life is yours to take

124
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,950
whenever you wish.

125
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,170
Have you lost your mind?

126
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,640
Without you,

127
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,630
I no longer know how to live.

128
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,430
I've made myself clear:

129
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,000
We're different.

130
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,720
There is no path for us.

131
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,920

can my trust still make?

155

Give me your trust,

and I will prove it to you.

157
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,560
Besides,

158
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,320
I never ordered

159
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,440
the attack.

160
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,120
A traitor lurked beside me.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,120
On the eve of war,

162
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,840
someone cast a spell

163
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,870
that threw me into sleep.

164
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,280
However,

165
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,960
I cast the Tracking Spell

166
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,440
on the one who did it.

167
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,160
Now,

168
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,710
they've fled into the Wasteland.

169
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,130
If you don't believe me,

170
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,700
you'll let the true culprit escape.

171
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,440
If I speak

172
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,670
even half a lie,

173
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,750
I will never appear

174
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,390
before you again.

175
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
The last time.

176
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
This is the final chance.

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,840
Tracking Spell.

178
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,600
It seems your brother suspects you.

179
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,360
If your plan had worked,

180
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,320
he'd never doubt me.

181
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,550
Ms. Luo, are you here to blame me?

182
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,870
Rest easy.

183
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,270
Since I promised to help you
finish this cause,

184
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,840
I will clean up the mess for you.

185
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Elder Guo

186
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,270
has led you into the Wasteland, right?

187
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,630
If you fear Jie Chuan's blame,

188
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,320
I can find you

189
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,720
a scapegoat.

190
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,840
Jie Chuan ordered

191
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,440
the assault on the immortal realm.

192
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,630
Why hunt Luo Cha and me?

193
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,480
Elder Guo.

194
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,840
Your Grace.

195
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,790
In this great war,

196
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,750
you don't seem to understand

197
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,120
my deep intentions.

198
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,360
In the past battles,
I led the army myself;

199
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,080
why did I let you command this one?

200
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,000
In the great war,

201
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,150
the outcome is never sure.

202
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,360
I chose to let you lead

203
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,710
because if we won,

204
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,390
our great cause would be done,

205
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,870
and you and I

206
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,270
would shine in history,

207
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,080
honored by every clan;

208
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,240
if we lose,

209
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,870
you were the commander,

210
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,870
the guilt would rest on you.

211
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,150
I'd simply shove

212
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,510
the crime of provoking war

213
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,960
onto your shoulders,

214
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,600
and then ask for peace

215
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,790
with the immortals.

216
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,240
Either way, I'd be safe.

217
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,080
So,

218
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,670
from beginning to end,

219
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,270
I was just your scapegoat.

220
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,670
Exactly.

221
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,550
Elder Guo,

222
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,630
your life

223
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,480
is mine now.

224
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,910
You brat!

225
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,080
I never knew you were so treacherous!

226
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,790
Jie Chuan,

227
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,000
you are unfit to rule the Demon Realm!

228
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,510
Well?

229
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,710
Did it work?

230
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,320
My illusion

231
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,240
can bind his threads of love.

232
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,030
Now, he's under my control.

233
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,510
Elder Guo,

234
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:10,080
why have you come to the Wasteland?

235
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,790
Jie Chuan, I'll kill you!

236
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,240
Jie Chuan, I'll kill you!

237
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,510
Good.

238
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:19,910
Very good.

239
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,990
It's right here.

240
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,320
Careful!

241
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,550
Jie Chuan,

242
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,550
how dare you chase me here?

243
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,670
Elder Guo, it's you.

244
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,270
Give me an answer for the great war.

245
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,630
So, it really was you.

246
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,160
Elder Guo,

247
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,320
I don't think

248
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,790
you're the real traitor.

249
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,000
If you surrender now,

250
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,360
I can spare your life

251
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,800
because of your past merits.

252
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,240
Jie Chuan,

253
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,150
that's your flaw:

254
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,670
hesitant, soft-hearted,

255
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,870
and hypocritical.

256
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,670
In the Wasteland, your power is drained.

257
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,720
With a wounded burden,

258
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,270
what can you do to me?

259
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,960
Elder Guo,

260
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,390
where did this demonic aura come from?

261
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,360
Something I obtained years ago.

262
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,750
Jie Chuan,

263
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,200
I am the true Demon Sovereign!

264
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,750
Die!

265
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,030
I will use Soul-Search right now

266
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,120
to see who hides behind you.

267
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,600
Watch out!
He's going to detonate his soul!

268
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,800
Ji Li!

269
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,390
Ji Li...

270
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,680
Ji Li...

271
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,560
Jie Chuan,

272
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,720
it's so great that I found out

273
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,790
you didn't do it.

274
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,120
Ji Li.

275
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,480
I'm dying.

276
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,960
Jie Chuan,

277
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,160
even my scales have changed color.

278
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,000
Ji Li, don't be afraid.

279
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,360
I'll fetch the treasure
from the Demon Palace.

280
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,590
You'll be alright.

281
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,350
My immortal bones are shattered
inch by inch;

282
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,440
I can't survive long in the Wasteland.

283
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,750
Before I die, knowing

284
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,960
it wasn't you...

285
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,310
Ji Li.

286
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,750
I'm so happy.

287
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,760
You won't die.

288
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,680
Trust me.

289
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,440
I believe you.

290
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,400
Ji Li.

291
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,110
I've always believed you.

292
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,310
I just realized it too late.
