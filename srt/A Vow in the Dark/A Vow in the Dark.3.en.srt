00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,350
(This is outrageous.)

8
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,120
(Foolish fish.)

9
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,480
(Her spiritual power)

10
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,480
(has a healing effect.)

00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,200
(How rare.)

12
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,840
Why is this pillow so cold and hard?

13
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,120
Pervert!

14
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,870
Don't shout.

15
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,200
You...

16
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
What trick are you up to now?

17
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,000
Trick? I should be asking you that.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,060
In the middle of the night,

19
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,970
it's my bed in my room!

20
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,430
Your bed?

21
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,470
The Demon Realm belongs to me.

22
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
Let me make this clear.

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,630
Stop your little schemes.

24
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,680
Otherwise,

25
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,310
killing a fish

26
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,400
would be child's play.

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,470
You... I...

28
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,430
Jie Chuan.

29
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,670
Address me as Your Grace.

30
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,360
Your Grace.

31
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,830
The Immortal Realm
has learned you broke the seal.

32
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,310
They are rallying their troops

33
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,080
and may strike at any moment.

34
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,590
To ensure safety,

35
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,800
I have reforged our defenses

36
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,800
and drawn a new Array.

37
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,520
The immortals

38
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,500
are nothing to be feared.

39
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,240
But the intentions of Jin Li

40
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,190
sent by them remain unclear.

41
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,240
I'll play along.

42
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,360
Perfect timing.

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,150
The Demon Defense Array

44
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,480
is a matter of great importance.

45
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,120
No one is allowed to leak it.

46
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
Understood.

47
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,560
(The Demon Defense Array?)

48
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,080
(Once I get that,)

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,120
(I can clear my name as a traitor,)

50
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,000
(so I won't be punished heavily.)

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,630
Sweep this spot.

52
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,870
Yes.

53
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,510
You, sweep over here.

54
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,370
Yes.

55
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,220
Come with me.

56
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,160
Go tidy up the bookshelf.

57
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,000
Alright.

58
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,800
Make sure every corner is spotless.

59
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,000
(The Demon Defense Array.)

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,510
(Where could it be?)

61
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,510
Where did you come from?

62
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,360
This candle is made
from millennium wax.

63
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,390
But you...

64
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,830
I didn't mean to.

65
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,680
Which hall are you from?

66
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,360
I've never seen you before.

67
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,510
I'm new here.

68
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,390
New?

69
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,070
We haven't recruited in centuries.

70
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Speak the truth.

71
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,830
- Let's go to Ms. Luo.
- I am new here!

72
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,360
- (Such a lousy thief.)
- Sorry!

73
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,200
(Why did Hong Zhua)

74
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,160
(take you as his disciple?)

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,480
What happened?

76
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,800
Your Grace, she...

77
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,600
You may go.

78
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,500
Yes.

79
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,510
You stay

80
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,070
to serve me.

81
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,200
Me?

82
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,230
Yes.

83
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,110
Put more strength into it.

84
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,270
A bit higher.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,950
Add some force.

86
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,190
Yes, Your Grace

87
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,800
(Where exactly is the Array?)

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,190
(Foolish fish.)

89
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,160
You, go over there.

90
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,030
Oh.

91
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,830
Your Grace.

92
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,480
Are you here to make amends?

93
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,240
Since you're willing
to serve here as a maid,

94
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,070
you'd better behave.

95
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,950
Don't be too curious

96
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,190
about this bookshelf.

97
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,070
If anything goes missing,

98
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,350
I will not

99
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,480
spare you.

100
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,480
This bookshelf?

101
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,030
Anything unusual here?

102
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,390
Is it hidden here?

103
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,630
Your Grace.

104
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,550
The miasma is worsening.

105
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,950
I've moved the injured demons
outside the hall.

106
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,150
Let's go

107
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,990
and take a look.

108
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,510
Your Grace,

109
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,750
we've used the pure water made
from forbidden flowers.

110
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,600
But it may not hold for long.

111
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,800
Thank you.

112
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,600
Jie Chuan,

113
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,720
your wounds aren't healed.

114
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,750
You must not use Demonic Ether.

115
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,400
- Step aside.
- What's wrong?

116
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,230
Stay close to me.

117
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,270
(I can't let anyone know)

118
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,550
(an Immortal Beast can hold me at bay.)

119
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,630
(As the ruler of the realm,)

120
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,000
(he'd actually drain his power)

121
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,240
(for the common demons.)

122
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,470
Well,

123
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,440
I don't think

124
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,840
you can get rid

125
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,340
of the long-existing miasma this way.

126
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,100
Why not plant some immortal herbs?

127
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,580
It'll help you in the long run.

128
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,540
The matters here

129
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,940
are none of your concern.

130
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,740
How fickle.

131
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,260
I can save them, too.

132
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,140
As I said,

133
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,580
I don't divide lives

134
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,540
into ranks.

135
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,820
My spiritual power is depleted.

136
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,340
But I can save them.

137
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,220
If you trust me,

138
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,100
take me up there.

139
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,100
(He may look cold,)

140
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,060
(but he's actually kind.)

141
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,660
(But if I give the Array to Master,)

142
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,900
(he'll probably be locked
in the Void Land again.)

143
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,500
Thanks, Your Grace, Miss.

144
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,460
Stealing this Array was almost too easy.

145
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,220
What if it's a trap?

146
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,540
Master has been here before.

147
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,580
He can tell if it's genuine.

148
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,220
I'll teleport it to Master.

149
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,340
Let's go check over there.

150
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,260
(Forbidden Land of the Demon Realm)

151
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,520
I didn't know the Demon Realm
had such beautiful places.

152
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,940
Goldfish, teleport it to Master.

153
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,260
Hurry, eat it.

154
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,100
Eat up, you chubby fish.

155
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,140
Those who trespass
into the Forbidden Land

156
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,500
should die.

157
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,780
I didn't know
this was the Forbidden Land.

158
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,820
As the Demon Sovereign,

159
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,220
you're being so petty.

160
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,660
There aren't any traps
or magical tools.

161
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,820
Only one oasis remains.

162
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,620
A thick mist shrouds all around.

163
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,540
Only in the center
does sunlight break through.

164
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,740
As the Demon Sovereign,

165
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,860
you shouldn't claim this land
for yourself.

166
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,300
As you know,

167
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,380
we have but this sliver of sunlight.

168
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,300
I'm not the one who set it

169
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,660
as the Forbidden Land.

170
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,700
All demons chose

171
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,140
to guard it of their own accord.

172
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,620
You immortals,

173
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,540
no matter your rank,

174
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,060
have the dew and light
to cultivate with.

175
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,460
But demons have only

176
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,740
this single patch of sunlight.

177
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,860
You once asked

178
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,620
why we lack your flowers

179
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,820
to draw in the miasma.

180
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,140
Now, do you have your answer?

181
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,780
This isn't a reason for you

182
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,660
to wage war against us.

183
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,780
Do you really think I started it?

184
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,300
When survival becomes a distant dream,

185
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,340
resistance

186
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,660
is no longer a choice.

187
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,540
Perhaps

188
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,980
the two clans

189
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,860
could talk things through.

190
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,260
Talk?

191
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,100
With those immortals

192
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,700
full of themselves?

193
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,340
Or with your master,

194
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,380
who destroyed my city?

195
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,660
Or maybe

196
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,060
with you,

197
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
a weak fraudster?

198
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,660
Do immortals ever care

199
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,780
about the fate of demons?

200
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,300
Don't think I'm blind
to what you're up to.
