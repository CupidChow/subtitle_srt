7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,280
The Sovereign is back!

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,760
Your Grace!

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,150
Your Grace is back!

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,520
Your Grace!

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,460
Your Grace!

12
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,880
Your Grace!

13
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:00,920
This way.

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,240
Your Grace! Your Grace!

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,120
Why is an immortal at his side?

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,480
Will she be our Queen?

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,590
Not everyone can become our Queen.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,040
Ridiculous!

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,000
Your Grace,

20
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,150
the Blossom-Dyeing Festival begins!

21
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,480
With blossoms dyed,
the demon clan will rise!

22
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,870
With blossoms dyed,
the demon clan will rise!

23
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,200
What does the festival mean?

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,680
Where do you get

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,480
all these flowers?

26
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,070
Whenever a great celebration occurs,

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,640
we demons channel power

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,350
to dye withered grass with colors.

29
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,890
This is the Blossom-Dyeing Festival.

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,230
But dyeing blossoms drains energy,

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,680
so it's rarely done.

32
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,430
What has happened

33
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,000
to make you go to such lengths?

34
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,230
It's a great affair

35
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,640
for the demon clan and me.

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,560
I'm a little tired;

37
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,200
I'll rest first.

38
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,080
With blossoms dyed,
the demon clan will rise!

39
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,290
With blossoms dyed,
the demon clan will rise!

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,400
With blossoms dyed,
the demon clan will rise!

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,240
With blossoms dyed...

42
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,030
The Sovereign arranged

43
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,710
the Demon Fruit specially for you.

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,750
Why are you holding

45
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,480
a Blossom-Dyeing Festival today?

46
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,280
It was never this grand before.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,980
Today, the Sovereign

48
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,150
has planned for a long time;

49
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,560
it's for the demon clan's cause.

50
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,560
And that cause is

51
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,710
to invade the Immortal Realm?

52
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,030
You knew the answer.

53
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,430
The Sovereign is giving himself

54
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,870
to you for that very goal.

55
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,000
The immortals are sick

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,080
and helpless.

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,190
Of course, we celebrate

58
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,000
because we're about to triumph.

59
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,630
Have you never considered

60
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,100
peace between the two realms?

61
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,990
Peace?

62
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,030
The immortals are sick and weak.

63
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,080
The Sovereign returned
to prepare for war.

64
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,750
In the last war,

65
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,800
when we saw your kind,

66
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,150
we longed to tear your flesh alive.

67
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,720
The talk of peace is absurd.

68
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,430
You're an immortal, too.

69
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,750
How can there be peace?

70
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,750
Give her the things.

71
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,590
Let's go.

72
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,430
(An ordinary demon soldier
can see the truth.)

73
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,000
(Why must I keep deceiving myself?)

74
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,630
(Do I have to hear it)

75
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,430
(from his lips before I wake up?)

76
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,790
You're here.

77
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,590
Jie Chuan,

78
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,870
let's drink.

79
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
What's happening?

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,040
That day in the Wasteland cave,

81
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
I heard your plan clearly.

82
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,510
The immortals are in danger

83
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,680
because of you.

84
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,360
Yet you act as if nothing happened

85
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,600
beside me.

86
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,640
Jie Chuan,

87
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,310
I don't know you at all.

88
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,510
You frighten me.

89
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,880
Ji Li,

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,040
you doubt me

91
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,360
because of a few immortal rumors?

92
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,040
What have I done

93
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,750
to deserve such cruelty?

94
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,270
It's not a doubt.

95
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,000
I saw with my eyes

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,920
and heard with my ears.

97
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,670
What?

98
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,390
I only need your Demonic Ether
to save them.

99
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,680
Once the immortals are healed,

100
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,040
everything between us

101
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,390
will be settled.

102
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,830
We'll be even.

103
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,760
Whether it's the Demon Realm

104
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,190
or Wasteland,

105
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,800
I'll treat the days and nights we shared

106
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,120
as nothing but a beautiful dream.

107
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,230
Your Grace!

108
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
Ji Li!

109
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,560
Am I truly such a man

110
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,600
in your heart?

111
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,070
You think a mere Spirit Sensor

112
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,120
can subdue me?

113
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,670
Your Grace,

114
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,120
kill her at once!

115
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,240
This is all an immortal plot.

116
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,240
They've poisoned our realm;

117
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,040
every plant in the Forbidden Land

118
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,560
is dead or dying.

119
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,430
I thought we only wanted
his Demonic Ether.

120
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,120
Why are their plants withering?

121
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
The demons stormed the Immortal Realm.

122
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,190
How can we not avenge this?

123
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,710
Today,

124
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,480
we destroy Jie Chuan

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,070
and the entire demon clan!

126
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,000
Ji Li,

127
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,480
I've reported your merit today

128
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,070
to Feng Tian.

129
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,600
You may leave Wasteland.

130
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,830
She achieved so much.

131
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,120
That's clearly not enough!

132
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,230
Ji Li,

133
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,190
your souls are bound;

134
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,190
only you can wound him.

135
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,750
Do it.

136
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,070
Master,

137
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,200
I...

138
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,390
Take the sword.

139
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,230
I...

140
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,870
Jie Chuan!

141
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,120
He's become

142
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,790
a Demon Deity!

143
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,160
How?

144
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,000
Thanks for helping me

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,840
shatter love's chains.

146
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,120
To show my gratitude,

147
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,320
I shall raze the Immortal Realm

148
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,240
in three days.

149
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,600
Plotting against the Sovereign?

150
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,000
You've outfoxed yourselves.

151
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,870
You self-righteous hypocrites

152
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,040
should repent

153
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,270
in the dungeon later.

154
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,350
Master.

155
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,850
Still unwilling to leave?

156
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,080
Master!

157
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,030
Master!

158
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,870
Ji Li...

159
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,560
Ji Li...

160
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,030
Master,

161
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,440
you're still thinking

162
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,550
about her?

163
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,630
If not for her,

164
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,240
you'd never be like this.

165
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,710
Huan Zhen?

166
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,480
Where is Ji Li?

167
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,080
Jie Chuan...

168
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,240
He hates her to the bone.

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,360
He'll show no mercy.

170
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,080
Go back and report

171
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,440
that Jie Chuan has ascended,

172
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,000
and he'll march on us.

173
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,720
I will save Ji Li.

174
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,150
No!

175
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,840
Master, you're too weak.

176
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,790
You must rest.

177
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,800
Master,

178
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,870
the immortals used you;

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,790
Ji Li saw only Jie Chuan.

180
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,150
You're gravely hurt.

181
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,840
Why not find some hidden place

182
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,910
and leave these wars behind with me?

183
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,390
An immortal's duty

184
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,390
is the safety of the Immortal Realm.

185
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,360
If you cannot grasp that,

186
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,030
leave at once.

187
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,240
Jie Chuan, bad news!

188
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Hong Zhua has fled.

189
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,840
Our forces are mustered.

190
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,390
Before he can warn them,

191
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,080
we storm the Immortal Realm.

192
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,800
They say

193
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,030
their barrier cannot be breached

194
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,480
without the key.

195
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,360
The last assault failed

196
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,670
because we couldn't

197
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,510
break through.

198
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,680
Now,

199
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,870
to win in one strike,

200
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,960
we must find the way through,

201
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,280
or victory

202
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,800
is impossible.

203
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,150
Ji Li is Hong Zhua's disciple.

204
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,320
She should know

205
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,550
how to break that barrier.

206
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,470
Understood.

207
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,030
Hong Zhua is wounded.

208
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,000
He can't save you.

209
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,560
You'd better

210
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,390
tell us

211
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,750
the barrier's weakness at once,

212
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,360
or don't blame me

213
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,870
for being rough.

214
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,710
Stop.

215
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,440
I have my own way

216
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,550
to break through that barrier.

217
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,320
You will watch

218
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,240
demon legions shatter it.

219
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,150
Your Grace,

220
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,960
an immortal named Huan Zhen
seeks audience.

221
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
She claims she can reveal

222
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,870
the secret to breaking the barrier.

223
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,990
Huan Zhen?

224
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,550
The war is coming.

225
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,200
You

226
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,390
are all veteran demons.

227
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,910
This campaign

228
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
must succeed.

229
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,030
(Their wounds
from the last war still fester.)

230
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,270
(I must borrow Devourer's strength;)

231
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,630
(after victory,)

232
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,960
(they can heal.)

233
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,510
(Only when desire is torn out)

234
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,480
(can we trample the immortals.)

235
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,870
Everyone,

236
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,120
the key to the barrier is in our grasp.

237
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,440
The Sovereign

238
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,670
has finally decided to strike.

239
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,390
In the last great war,

240
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,000
you've earned great merit.

241
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,840
Now,

242
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,120
our clan

243
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,720
has started anew

244
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,230
to attack the immortals again!

245
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,720
We'll surely win

246
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,120
against the immortals!

247
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,390
We'll surely win

248
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,870
against the immortals!

249
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,630
You've been lying to me all along.

250
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,080
Why didn't you just kill me?

251
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,240
All those vows

252
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,200
and promises are lies!

253
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,510
Listen.

254
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,960
Your Grace,

255
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,800
we have won.
