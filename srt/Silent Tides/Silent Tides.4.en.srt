194
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,020
The government is responsible
for the safety of travel in Macau

195
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,570
and also the maintenance
of the business relationship

196
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,330
between Portugal and Japan.

197
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:01,810
Got it?

198
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:02,970
Inspector General Gonçalves,

199
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,810
listen to me.

200
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:04,770
There are many

201
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,330
high-ranked officials of my party

202
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,180
trapped in Hong Kong.

203
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:07,730
These people

204
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,180
are the targets the Japanese

205
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,540
are looking to capture.

206
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,260
If we don't dispatch the boats now,

207
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,690
they may lose their only chance

208
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,690
to escape.

209
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,690
This will cause immense loss

210
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,900
to China in warfare and in our future.

211
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,180
Sorry, Mr. Liang.

212
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,420
You should talk to the Japanese
about this instead.

213
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,970
Portugal is a neutral country.

214
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,940
They don't care
who will lose more in this war,

215
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,570
neither will they choose
between China and Japan.

216
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,300
Inspector General Gonçalves.

217
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,100
The cruelty of the Japanese army

218
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,230
has long been proved
by countless bloody facts.

219
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,690
Don't you know that?

220
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,020
Portugal is indeed a neutral country.

221
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,810
But even if it's out of humanism,

222
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,900
the neutral country
should help the refugees.

223
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,900
If you want to save the Chinese,

224
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,900
you Chinese should think of a way.

225
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,850
Order Steamship Sai On
to shut off immediately,

226
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,330
and it is not allowed to leave the port.

227
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,140
Yes, sir.

228
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,540
Xian,

229
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,900
what should we do now?

230
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,940
Are you cold?

231
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:47,780
Look!

232
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,810
What's that?

233
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,330
Hey!

234
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,810
Hey!

235
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,490
We're here to pick you up!

236
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,690
Hey!

237
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,210
We're here to pick you up!

238
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,690
How much is it?

239
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,780
Miss, how much is it?

240
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,180
How much?

241
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,970
It's free.

242
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,490
I'll send you to Macau for free.

243
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,570
It's really free.

244
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,210
Ms. Qiao.

245
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,570
Ms. Qiao, come quickly!

246
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,090
Yu!

247
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:30,970
Mr. He!

248
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,540
Mr. He!

249
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,300
Yu?

250
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,450
Yu!

251
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:40,970
Yu!

252
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,240
You know that kid?

253
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,940
She's a kid from a Boat Dweller family

254
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,380
I met in Macau.

255
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,600
Be careful.

256
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:07,940
Yu,

257
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,010
thank you so much.

258
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,810
Without you,

259
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,330
we wouldn't be able to leave today.

260
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,450
Don't mention it.

261
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,330
Didn't you help me last time?

262
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,540
Is your information correct?

263
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,810
The coastal guard's report
very clearly stated that

264
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,420
a large number of Chinese boats

265
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,650
are heading to Macau
through the Lingding Channel.

266
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:27,810
[Macau Governor, De Solaire]

267
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,060
They're already very near to Macau pier.

268
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,660
Hong Kong has just fallen.

269
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,180
Don't let the mess fall upon Macau.

270
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,780
Order the Navy to dispatch all ships

271
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,210
to deploy to the maritime boudary.

272
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,970
Are we intercepting those Chinese boats?

273
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,380
The ship is full of civilians.

274
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,300
How can we intercept them?

275
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,140
Sink them?

276
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,900
I'm talking about putting up the boundary.

277
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,170
Ms. Qiao.

278
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,690
Why are you alone?

279
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,060
Where's Mr. Qiao?

280
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,610
This is the Japanese Navy.

281
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,540
All ships that are leaving

282
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,660
without permission

283
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,380
are to return immediately.

284
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,940
Those not obeying
will be shot down.

285
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,570
Fire!

286
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,420
Get down!

287
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,660
Get down!

288
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:38,970
Dad!

289
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,450
Mom!

290
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,690
Mom!

291
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,570
-Yu's mom!
-Mother!

292
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,210
Xian!

293
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,330
Bring Mommy back.

294
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,540
Come in quickly!

295
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,610
It's dangerous!

296
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:48,900
Xian!

297
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,140
Don't go out anymore!

298
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:51,970
Xian!

299
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,110
-Come in!
-Xian!

300
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,850
Xian, come in.

301
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,900
It's dangerous!

302
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:58,540
Third Uncle!

303
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,830
Look over there!

304
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,810
This is the Macau sea.

305
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,790
Other than civilian ships,

306
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,610
-all armed ships are not allowed to enter.
-Portuguese warships.

307
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,180
Hurry!

308
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,300
Go that way.

309
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:08,900
Okay.

310
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,830
Haishan.

311
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,750
Hurry up, bring all the comrades with guns

312
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,790
to my ship.

313
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,660
Mommy!

314
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,730
Xian.

315
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,780
Water keeps coming in.

316
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,810
The water in the boat is too deep!

317
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,690
It's sinking! What should we do?

318
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,180
Brother!

319
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,570
Rizhang!

320
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,570
The cannonboat we sent out

321
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,690
was hit by an unknown speedboat.

322
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,810
The ship was flooded and became immobile.

323
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,300
The two other boats sent out subsequently

324
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,810
were stopped by Macau's navy

325
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,810
near Macau's maritime boundary.

326
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,090
General.

327
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,730
Are we forcibly entering the Macau sea?

328
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,390
Awaiting your instructions.

329
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,210
The fleeing British troops

330
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,570
possess too much military

331
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,330
and financial intelligence
about Hong Kong.

332
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,900
We must catch them.

333
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,570
However,

334
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,810
the headquarters has not yet finalized
its strategy for Macau.

335
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,570
It is not advisable to have direct
conflicts with Portugal at this time.

336
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,380
We have no choice but to order them
to turn back.

337
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,110
Understood.

338
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,810
Regarding the intelligence
on those targets,

339
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,690
immediately send a telegram

340
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,550
to Colonel Sawa and Consul Fukue,

341
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,490
instructing them to coordinate the capture
at once.

342
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,210
Yes, sir.

343
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,260
Yu!

344
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,450
Go! Get outside quickly!

345
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,180
Go! Go! Go!

346
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,690
Hurry!

347
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,490
Boats are coming!

348
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,020
Boats are coming!

349
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,730
Mommy!

350
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,060
Boats are coming!

351
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,810
Yu!

352
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,090
-Come! Yu, get on the boat quickly!
-Yu's mom!

353
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,970
Be careful.

354
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,730
Take it slow. The leg.

355
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,660
Careful with the leg.

356
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,490
It's injured.

357
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,330
Let's go, Zai!

358
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:58,970
Zai!

359
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,060
Dad.

360
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,140
-Come. Get on the boat.
-Hurry.

361
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,970
Where's Little Miss?

362
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,610
She's here!

363
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,010
Get on the boat, Qiwen.

364
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:07,380
Come on.

365
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,339
The boat is full!

366
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,800
The boat can't take more!

367
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,859
No room left!

368
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,920
The child hasn't gotten on board yet!

369
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:14,619
Only two left!

370
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,560
Get on our boat!

371
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,180
-Get on this boat!
-Let the kids board!

372
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,619
-Get on this boat!
-Move closer!

373
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,450
Qiwen.

374
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,910
I'll take Zai to that boat.

375
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,450
Come closer!

376
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,339
Your ship is sinking!

377
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,210
There's still space on this boat!

378
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,619
Come closer! Come closer!

379
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,140
Hurry!

380
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,210
Be careful.

381
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,660
Here.

382
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,010
Daddy,

383
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,400
who were the people that rescued us
just now?

384
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,300
They're Communists—

385
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,420
members of
the Zhongshan Anti-Japanese Guerrillas.

386
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:12,980
Thank you.

387
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:15,770
Here.

388
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,140
Where's Daddy?

389
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,820
Xian!

390
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:28,930
Dad!

391
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,050
Xian!

392
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:32,860
Xian!

393
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,820
-Mommy!
-Zai.

394
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,790
Here, Xian!

395
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,860
Mommy!

396
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:52,690
-Zai.
-Grandpa.

397
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,140
Dad.

398
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,860
Zai.

399
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,690
Are you alright?

400
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,450
Are you okay?

401
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,770
Be careful.

402
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,140
Be careful.

403
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,940
Comrade Ke,

404
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,050
we're counting on you
for what happens next.

405
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,900
We still have to search for
other missing comrades,

406
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,560
so we'll take our leave first.

407
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,420
Is there any hope that Commander Qu
and the others

408
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,930
are still alive?

409
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,660
Captain Long.

410
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:26,970
Take care.

411
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,140
Take care.

412
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,880
Consul Fukue,

413
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,490
Portugus is a neutral country.

414
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,820
The Hong Kong fugitive you mentioned

415
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,580
has not violated any laws of Macau.

416
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,970
What obligation
does the Macau government have

417
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,230
to assist in apprehending the fugitive?

418
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,550
-Here's the thing.
-We have...

419
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,530
shown Portugal the utmost respect.

420
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,820
However, if you

421
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,820
disregard our request
and allow refugees to enter,

422
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,450
we will have no choice

423
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,350
but to regard the Macau government

424
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,940
as deliberately
violating the principle of neutrality

425
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,820
and aiding fugitives in their escape.

426
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,820
In that event,

427
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,580
the 100,000 Imperial Army of Japan nearby

428
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,740
will have no choice but to intervene
and enforce order in Macau.

429
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,730
What kind of people are the fugitives?

430
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,420
Can you provide us with a complete list

431
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,340
and their criminal evidence?

432
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,050
The detailed fugitive list and information

433
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,580
are currently under verification
by Hong Kong authorities.

434
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,660
It will be provided once confirmed.

435
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,460
If you cannot even clearly state
who the fugitives are

436
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,380
or what crimes they have committed,

437
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,140
how can we possibly
cooperate with the arrest?

438
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,490
The identification
and capture of the fugitives

439
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,420
will be handled by the Sawa Agency.

440
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:39,550
There is no need
for the Macau government to intervene.

441
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,490
Your only responsibility

442
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,580
is to ensure that

443
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,130
not a single refugee enters
the border without authorization.

444
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,730
Even if we are to close the border gate,

445
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,640
you must give us a time limit.

446
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,210
Close it

447
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,970
for 24 hours initially.

448
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,250
I am Macau's Inspector General, Gonçalves.

449
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,000
I now announce
an emergency government decree.

450
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,500
Effective immediately,

451
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,740
Macau Customs will be temporarily closed.

452
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,600
[Pier 12: Macau - Hong Kong]

453
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,210
No one is permitted
to cross the border into Macau.

454
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,940
I'll announce it again.

455
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,200
Attention, everyone.

456
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:31,050
Effective immediately,
Macau Customs is temporarily closed.

457
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,070
No one is allowed
to cross the border into Macau.

458
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,660
Those bastards!

459
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,600
Gonçalves,

460
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,130
what is going on?

461
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,580
By what authority
are you closing the border gate?

462
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,730
The temporary closure of Macau Customs

463
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,620
is a demand of the Empire of Japan.

464
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,210
Mr. Lok Pak,

465
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,660
[Deputy Chief of the Japanese
Military Intelligence Agency in Macau]

466
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,240

[Yamaguchi Kumi]

468
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,340
are currently meeting with
Governor De Solaire.

469
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,800
Ask your governor
if you have any questions.

470
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,870
Attention all personnel.

471
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,100
By order of the Macau government,

472
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,420
the entry checkpoint
at the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal

473
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,200
will be temporarily closed for 24 hours.

474
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:20,050
It will reopen at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

475
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,240
What did you mean by that earlier?

476
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,960
Why not utilize the strength
of the Portuguese Macau government

477
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,920
instead of pursuing the fugitives
independently?

478
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,850
Can you trust such an important case

479
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,480
to the Portuguese Macau government?

480
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,440
If the fugitives escape,

481
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,060
who will take responsibility?

482
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,740
You?

483
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,580
However,

484
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,110
with the limited manpower
of the Sawa Agency,

485
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,070
how do you plan to capture them?

486
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,460
It is true that
the Sawa Agency's current manpower

487
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,920
is insufficient.

488
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,850
But it doesn't matter,

489
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,790
because the manpower

490
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,580
is already delivering itself to us.

491
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,380
Three days.

492
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,730
Just give me three days,

493
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,520
and I can gather all the manpower

494
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,800
you need.

495
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,290
Two days.

496
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,260
One day! One day will be enough!

497
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,170
Tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock,

498
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,550
I will bring all the personnel you require

499
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,590
right here

500
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,270
and report to you punctually!

501
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:36,820
Good.

502
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,110
As long as you deliver on your promise

503
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,420
and complete this search
and arrest mission,

504
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,340
you, Huang Gongjie, will henceforth be

505
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,770
the Captain of
the Sawa Agency's Special Operations Team.

506
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:47,970
When that time comes,

507
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,380
let alone the Tai Ho Brotherhood,

508
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,420
the entire Macau

509
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,770
will have to heed your commands.

510
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,580
Thank you for your cultivation, Chief.

511
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,580
Mommy, I'm so hungry.

512
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,920
Little Miss.

513
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,730
Be good.

514
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,250
Hold on for now.

515
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,100
Look, so many people here
haven't eaten anything either.

516
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,030
I promise

517
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,390
I'll make you something delicious
once the gate is open.

518
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,730
Zai, Little Miss.

519
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,320
Apple.

520
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,880
Where did you get the apple?

521
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,770
I bought it specifically for the children
when I went home.

522
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,730
After all the trouble on the way,

523
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,870
I completely forgot about it.

524
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:24,800
Mommy!

525
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,900

526
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,150
Yu.

527
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:29,900
Mommy!

528
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,620
Yu's mom! Yu's mom!

529
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,730
Mommy!

530
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,310
Mommy!

531
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,480
Wake up!

532
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,110

533
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,720
Yu's mom!

534
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,150
Excuse me. Move aside.

535
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:38,750
Excuse me.

537
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,390
Mommy!

538
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,200
Yu's mom!

539
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,680
-Can you hear us?
-Sorry. Excuse me.

540
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,310
Yu's mom!

541
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,390
Mommy! Mommy!

542
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,310
Thank you.

543
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,480
Yu, help me get your mum up.

544
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,590
How is Yu's mom?

545
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,590
Actually, the penetrating wound on her leg

546
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,720
isn't very serious,

547
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,630
but now the gate is closed
and she can't go to the hospital.

548
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,350
The wound could get infected at any time.

549
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,110
Plus, she's lost a lot of blood

550
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,590
and hasn't eaten
or drunk anything for so long.

551
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,130
Not to mention an injured person,

552
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,110
even a healthy person
couldn't endure this.

553
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,040
Injuries and blood loss
make people extremely weak.

554
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,570
The key is to eat something.

555
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,800
But where can we get food right now?

556
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,110
That's true.

557
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,930
Yu,

558
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,090
I have an apple here.

559
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,280
Hurry and give it to your mom to eat.

560
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,000
But what about you?

561
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,440
We've eaten.

562
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,490
Isn't that right, Little Miss?

563
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,510
Yes, we've eaten.

564
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,410
Give it to your mom to eat.

565
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Thank you.

566
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
Thank you, Mr. He.

567
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:48,720
Thank you.

568
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,310

569
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,290
you and your parents

570
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,830
are our saviors.

571
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,280
Don't worry.

572
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,680
We will take care of your mother's injury
until she recovers.

573
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,760
And Grandpa, Mommy,

574
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,240
me and Little Miss
will take good care of her.

575
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,170
Comrade Ke,

576
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,110
the food we brought is almost gone.

577
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,240
The younger ones might be able
to hold on a bit longer,

578
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,070
but the elderly...

579
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,360
What I'm worried about now isn't that.

580
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,350
These gentlemen are really too old,

581
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,440
and they have to stay in this huge crowd

582
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,630
for a whole day.

583
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,680
There may be a problem at any time.

584
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,390
I wonder if Comrade Buddha's Hand

585
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,790
has received the message

586
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,200
and knows about our current situation.

587
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,310
I was wondering why Mrs. Qiao was alone.

588
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,830
It turns out Mr. Qiao...

589
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,680
Don't worry.

590
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,150
Mr. Qiao only works at a bank.

591
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,070
He is neither British,

592
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,110
nor is he military, police,
or an official.

593
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,770
The Japanese probably
won't do anything to him.

594
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,510
I just don't understand.

595
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,650
What could be so important that

596
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,060
he would disregard his own safety

597
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,600
and keep delaying like this?

598
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,240
[Winter 1941]

599
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,160
[The Northern Hemisphere was struck by
a severe cold wave unseen in a century.]

600
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,220
[Even Macau, known for its warm climate,]

601
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,250
[recorded its lowest temperature
since records began.]

602
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,180
[Frost covered the entire region
by midnight,]

603
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,090
[and countless people suffered from
frostbite and cold-related illnesses.]

604
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:00,800
[White Dove Scripture]

605
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,830
The first group of targets
departed Hong Kong last night

606
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,560
and are expected
to arrive in Macau this morning.

607
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,790
Hello, I'm He Xian.

608
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,960
I'm Ke Zhengping.

609
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,770
Thank you for last night.

610
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,630
If it had not been for
your boat coming to our rescue,

611
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,790
my son and I would still be in the sea.

612
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,080
You're welcome.

613
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,550
This is the eighth one tonight, right?

614
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,200
The ninth.

615
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,630
By tomorrow morning,

616
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,690
who knows how many more there will be.

617
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,630
Daddy,

618
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,310
why are we being kept here?

619
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,590
Even if we're injured

620
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,840
or sick,

621
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,240
we can't enter Macau to see a doctor.

622
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,590
Is Macau not part of China?

623
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,630
Child,

624
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,440
of course Macau

625
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,150
belongs to us Chinese.

626
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,000
However, our government at that time
was weak and incompetent,

627
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,970
allowing bandits to seize Macau

628
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,910
from our grasp.

629
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,280
That's why

630
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,920
they dare to blatantly

631
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,280
shut us Chinese

632
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,830
out.

633
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,830
Not just Macau,

634
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,100
but six other territories as well—

635
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,200
all occupied by bandits.

636
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,630
I have a poet friend

637
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,720
named Wen Yiduo,

638
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,920
who wrote a series of poems

639
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,520
called

640
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,400
"Song of the Seven Sons".

641
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,680
It's to remind every Chinese person of

642
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,680
these seven children
separated from our motherland.

643
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,070
The first poem is about Macau.

644
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,440
Would you like to hear it?

645
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,000
Yes.

646
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,760
Do you know that

647
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,150
"Mom Kong"

648
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,870
is not my true name?

649
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,000
I have been away from your cradle

650
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,830
for far too long.

651
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,630
Mother.

652
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,200
But though they have taken my body
by force,

653
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,720
you still hold

654
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,590
my inner soul.

655
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,110
Mommy!

656
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,950
For 300 years,

657
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,180
I have never ceased dreaming of you,
my birth mother.

658
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,720
Please call me by my childhood name.

659
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,920
Call me

660
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,980
"Macau".

661
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,740
Mother.

662
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,860
I want to come back.

663
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,550
Mother.

664
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,110
Reporting, Chief!

665
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,240
Every one of my men here

666
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,500
is a seasoned veteran of the underworld!

667
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,520
Do you find them satisfactory?

668
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,870
Dispatch all ambulances to the pier.

669
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,540
Additionally,
have the medical team prepare

670
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,480
extra surgical masks
and armbands as backups.

671
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,520
I'm concerned
there may be too many patients,

672
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,280
and we will need
to recruit volunteers on-site to assist.

673
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,880
Alright, see you at the pier.

674
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,350
These are

675
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,430
the fugitive photos
just delivered from Hong Kong.

676
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,280
There are 10 copies in total.

677
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,310
You have 20 minutes

678
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,040
to distribute them to your men.

679
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,870
Divide them into groups of three,

680
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,240
issue one copy to each group,

681
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,000
and make sure they memorize
these individuals' appearances.

682
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,730
Understood.

683
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,480
Go.

684
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,850
The border gate will open in half an hour.

685
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,680
Even if we gather enough manpower,

686
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,540
it will be impossible to screen
tens of thousands of refugees in time.

687
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,680
Who said the gate would open at 9 o'clock?

688
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,280
Are you going to go back on your word

689
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,960
with Governor De Solaire?

690
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,680
You're right.

691
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,870
Then what do you plan to do?

692
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,280
I've prepared bait for them—

693
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,440
special passes.

694
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,150
Without employing some tactics,

695
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,990
how can we make the fugitives
reveal themselves?

696
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,990
Go and see De Solaire.

697
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,150
The above covers

698
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,720
the implementation
of the grain supply sources

699
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,520
and Hengfengyu's grain procurement plan.

700
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,240
That concludes my introduction.

701
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,190
Your Excellency the Governor,

702
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,040
our Chinese community has fulfilled
its commitment

703
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,320
and prepared a solution
to the food problem.

704
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,440
The government should be able
to set aside its concerns

705
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,570
and open the gate as scheduled, right?

706
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,920
Inspector General Gonçalves,

707
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,120
what's your opinion?

708
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,320
The plan is detailed and thorough.
I have nothing to say.

709
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,420
In that case,

710
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,810
now,

711
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,840
as the Governor of Macau,

712
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,960
I hereby announce...

713
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,440
Wait.

714
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,010
What?

715
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,980
It was agreed for 24 hours.

716
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,010
How can they break their promise?

717
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,710
Sawa Eisaku said

718
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,710
he only mentioned closing the gate
for 24 hours initially,

719
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,150
not that it would remain closed
for only 24 hours.

720
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,320
He has just received
the fugitive information

721
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,120
and needs more time
for screening and apprehending.

722
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,650
He will come to Government House
immediately

723
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,040
to coordinate
specific apprehension matters with us.

724
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,710
How can they do this?

725
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,840
This is outrageous.

726
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,720
[Kiang Wu]

727
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,150
Mr. He, Ms. Qiao,

728
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,440
many doctors have arrived.

729
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,750
My mommy will be saved!

730
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,550
It's already 9:05.

731
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,280
Why hasn't the gate opened yet?

732
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,550
Your Excellency the Governor,

733
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,230
we Chinese merchants
have clearly presented

734
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,960
a solution to the food problem.

735
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,880
If the government fails
to open the gate on schedule,

736
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,190
that would be a blatant breach of promise.

737
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:50,960
Exactly.

738
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,710
If the government concedes again,

739
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,000
how can we account
to all sectors of Macau,

740
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,960
to various countries,

741
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,620
and to the entire international community?

742
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,270
But if the Japanese
really take military action

743
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,210
and confrontation
ensues between both sides,

744
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:02,940
who can bear the consequences?

745
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,360
As this concerns the future and destiny
of Macau,

746
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,380
it should be decided by a vote

747
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,400
of all members of the Executive Council.

748
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,960
All members in favor of opening the gate
immediately,

749
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,920
please raise your hand now.

750
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,400
Six votes.

751
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,690
Wait.

752
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,440
Mr. Ma is just a member
of the General Chamber of Commerce,

753
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,880
not a formal member
of the Executive Council.

754
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,610
He doesn't have voting rights.

755
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,930
Five votes in favor.

756
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,870
Good.

757
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,150
All members
opposing the opening of the floodgates,

758
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,750
please raise your hands now.

759
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,540
One, two, three, four…

760
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,590
Also five votes.

761
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,660
Rodrigues, why didn't you vote?

762
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,880
Are you abstaining?

763
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,520
No.

764
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,600
I want to vote.

765
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,340
It's now five to five. Mr. Rodrigues,

766
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,700
your vote will decide the outcome.

767
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,270
Please vote.

768
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,750
I

769
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,370
am absolutely against opening the gates.

770
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,620
Mr. Rodrigues.

771
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,080
Why?

772
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,460
May I ask—

773
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
opening the gates is based on the premise

774
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,590
that you Chinese merchants promise to

775
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,630
solve the food shortage

776
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,360
caused by the influx of refugees.

777
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,230
Is that correct?

778
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,230
Yes.

779
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,040
Which is exactly why I voted against it.

780
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,710
Because I don't believe in promises
made by you Chinese.

781
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,510
As for why,

782
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,300
perhaps you should ask Mr. Ma Wanqi

783
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,400
in charge of the proposal.

784
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,320
Mr. Rodrigues,

785
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,550
you know very well there was a reason
behind that payment delay.

786
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,960
I promised you

787
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,660
no matter what,

788
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,550
I will pay you back in full.

789
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,480
But since facts have proven

790
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,070
that promises made by you Chinese
simply can't be trusted,

791
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,630
I must put first

792
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,800
the survival of the hundreds
of thousands of people in Macau.

793
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,440
I,

794
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,040
Rodrigues,

795
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,250
as a member
of the Macau Executive Council,

796
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,170
absolutely oppose opening the gates.

797
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,750
Attention, please.

798
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,210
Emergency announcement.

799
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,110
Attention, please.

800
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,400
Emergency announcement.

801
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,660
The Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal,

802
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,270
which was scheduled to
reopen at 9 a.m. today,

803
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,480
will remain closed

804
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,260
until further notice.

805
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,520
The exact reopening time
is yet to be determined.

806
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,400
-All passengers, please remain calm.
-Officer, please open the gate.

807
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,520
My mother's hurt.

808
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,710
If you don't open the gate now,
it'll be too late!

809
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,920
The Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal,

810
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,550
which was scheduled to
reopen at nine this morning,

811
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,840
will remain closed

812
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,400
until further notice.

813
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
Let us in!

814
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,750
Protest! Protest! Protest!

815
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,040
The situation inside the gate
is extremely dire.

816
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,360
From yesterday till now, dozens of bodies

817
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,550
have already been carried out,

818
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,650
and the number is still rising.

819
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,270
It's as if the dead

820
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,330
weren't your Portuguese people, right?

821
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:35,920
But

822
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,920
even if you don't care about
Chinese lives,

823
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,520
there are still
many foreign nationals inside.

824
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,440
And we

825
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,880
have already given solemn assurances
to the consuls of various countries

826
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,800
that the gate will reopen on time.

827
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,440
If this continues,

828
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,270
the government won't be able to withstand

829
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:54,870
the immense pressure from
the entire international community.

830
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,630
As for the pressure Governor is now under,

831
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,630
the Imperial Japanese Army understands it
very well.

832
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,230
So

833
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,710
I came here specially

834
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,360
to offer you a good way

835
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,960
to ease that pressure.

836
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,400
Protest! Protest!

837
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,230
To relieve the pressure inside the gate,

838
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,070
-the Macau government will issue
a batch of temporary special passes
-I have to go to see.

839
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,920
for certain designated travelers.

840
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,440
These passes will be
the only valid documents

841
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,320
for crossing the gate
before the official reopening.

842
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,480
Quantities are limited.

843
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,550
All foreign representatives,
after hearing this announcement,

844
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:35,750
please go to the
Port Authority Dispatch Center to apply.

845
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,880
Repeating:

846
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,710
To ease the situation inside,

847
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,230
the Macau government will issue
a batch of temporary special passes

848
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,440
for special tourists.

849
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:46,320
Per the Governor's agreement
with the Japanese side,

850
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,590
the issuance of these passes

851
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,170
will be carried out with your cooperation,

852
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,920
and all parties

853
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,520
must maintain proper order.

854
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,920
Only 30 passes?

855
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,040
Mr. Lok Pak,

856
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,840
look outside the gate.

857
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,800
How many foreigners
are among those refugees?

858
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,190
Ninety-nine percent are Chinese,

859
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,620
yet a handful of foreigners
took 70 passes.

860
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,270
What about the
tens of thousands of Chinese?

861
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,360
How is that fair?

862
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,710
The Governor only cares about

863
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,070
pressure from foreign nations,

864
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,040
not Chinese refugees.

865
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,720
If I hadn't fought for it,

866
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,400
these 30 passes

867
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:23,050
wouldn't even reach the Chinese community.

868
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,320
Figure out

869
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,400
how to distribute them.

870
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,710
But

871
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:30,770
I have one request—

872
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,440
save one pass

873
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,440
for Miss Qiao Yinwan.

874
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,300
Mr. Yamaguchi,

875
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
everyone's here.

876
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,110
Announce the mission.

877
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,520
Yes.

878
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,040
Listen carefully.

879
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,400
I'll be at the gate

880
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,530
watching those who pick up the passes.

881
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,880
You

882
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,230
go in groups of three

883
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,040
and check the refugees.

884
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,360
This is our Special Service Division's

885
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,520
first mission—

886
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
and it must make an impact.

887
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,270
Any fugitive

888
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,320
the Imperial Army wants—

889
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,880
not a single one is to slip through.

890
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,520
Understood?

891
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,360
-Yes!
-Yes!

892
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,770
Did you take the photos?

893
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:17,570
Yes.

894
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,040
Yes.

895
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,520
While you still can,

896
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,630
take a look.

897
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,740
Take a good look at them.

898
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,660
Memorize these faces.

899
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:27,710
What?

900
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,230
Only 30 passes?

901
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:31,960
Look at

902
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,680
the lists submitted by all the groups—

903
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,530
there are over a hundred names.

904
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,800
They're all either

905
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,550
scientists

906
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,320
or

907
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,110
-educators.
-President Gao,
let's not get into that now.

908
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,840
Give it to me.

909
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,320
Look at my list.

910
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,930
You must get these people through.

911
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:53,110
Every one of them is important.

912
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,520
Mr. Liang,

913
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,460
you don't have to say more.

914
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,360
I'll put this list

915
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,270
at the very top.

916
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,070
Thank you.

917
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,500
What are you doing?

918
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,960
I'm Ke Lin,

919
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,750
leader of the volunteer medical team
from Kiang Wu Hospital.

920
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,750
I'm going in to provide emergency aid

921
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,750
to the refugees inside.

922
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,400
Please let me pass.

923
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,630
Sorry. Under the order,

924
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,710
once you enter,

925
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:18,630
you can't come out.

926
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,320
I know.

927
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:20,820
Please.

928
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,520
Guys,

929
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,760
I'm Ke Lin,
Director of the Medical Department

930
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,190
at Macau's Kiang Wu Hospital.

931
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,400
From now on,

932
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,230
our medical team
will provide free treatment

933
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,400
-to help the refugees
-Ke Lin.

934
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,370
in the gate.

935
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,190
Severe and critical cases
will be treated first.

936
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,990
If you need medical assistance,

937
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,190
please line up over there.

938
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,550
Good!

939
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,880
Zhang, you handle the initial check.

940
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,190
Sort patients by severity—

941
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,270
