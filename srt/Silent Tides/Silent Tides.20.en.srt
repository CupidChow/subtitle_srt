00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,830
I understand
you'd like to draw clear boundaries

4
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,460
between the Portuguese and the Chinese.

5
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,210
But as a Chinese proverb goes,

6
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,289
"If the lips are gone,
the teeth will feel cold."

7
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,420
Whether Portuguese

8
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,509
or Chinese,

9
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,759
since we live on this same land,

10
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,289
looking out for each other
is our only choice.

11
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,930
Over the past year,

12
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,450
we the Chinese have done our part.

13
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,300
This time,

14
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,760
whether the Portuguese can do the same

15
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,430
depends on what you choose.

16
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,990

What a surprise.

21
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,470
A campaign for saving the country
by buying government bonds

22
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,470
has boosted Hengfengyu's business.

23
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,620

are rarely visited,

despite offering high rates of return.

27
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,650

Macau people are still patriotic.

00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,950

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,470
Zhengping,

40
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,680
You're placing orders for some friends

41
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,920
from the north, right?

42
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,690
Right.

43
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,880
I was wondering

44
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,040
why they asked for
so many winter supplies

45
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,760
and such massive quantities
of rubber shoes, saltpeter,

46
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,630
hardware, medicine,
and surgical instruments.

47
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,940
Since you're all sensible people,

48
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,990
I might as well be frank with you.

49
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,790
These are for the Chinese forces
behind enemy lines in North China.

50
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:36,640
You mean...

51
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,540
I mean...

52
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,910
the anti-Japanese forces
behind enemy lines in North China.

53
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,070
There's no way to describe the hardships

54
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,250
they are enduring right now.

55
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,690
The Japanese' Three Alls Policy
has taken a toll

56
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,550
on North China,
where every village is in mourning.

57
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,079
Smoke signals of war are seen everywhere.

58
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,260
To make it worse, the whole area
has been struck by natural disasters

59
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,660
for 2 consecutive years.

60
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,450
The troops are short of food and clothes.

61
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,660
The wounded
lack medicine and proper care.

62
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,950
For each bullet fired,

63
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,970
the shell must be collected,

64
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,410
filled with powder,
and reused for 7 or 8 times.

65
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,140
Even so,

66
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,510
no more than 5 bullets can be distributed

67
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,420
to each gun.

68
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,320
The situation has gone this bad?

69
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,260
The reality is even harsher
than what I said.

70
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,290
Let me tell you a figure.

71
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,580
A recent survey
in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region shows

72
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,400
that the average weight
of military personnel

73
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,930
is even below 46 kilograms.

74
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,250
Those front-line combat units are already

75
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,310
prioritized in allotting supplies.

76
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,500
The troops farther behind
are in even worse conditions.

77
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,260
Over 30% of military officers

78
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,659
have fallen ill simply due to malnutrition

79
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,460
and lack of warm clothing.

80
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,140
Zhengping, when do the supplies
need to be delivered?

81
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,820
As soon as possible.

82
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,200
The earlier they arrive,

83
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,550
the more quickly the distressed troops
in North China will receive help.

84
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,580
I'll work it out.

85
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,130

86
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,720

It's time you went to bed.

90
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,900
Sure. I'll just read it again before bed.

91
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,550
Okay.

92
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,170
Mr. He, why are the goods
you need this time

93
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,030
so different from those
you ordered for Chongqing?

94
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,659
These seem like what the north needs now.

95
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,090
I'm only placing orders.

96
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,550
The recipient and the place the goods

97
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,610
are delivered to don't matter to you.

98
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,040
But as you know,

99
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,860
the Portuguese government

100
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,010
has always been firmly anti-communist.

101
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,010
Don't you forget

102
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,260
that in Macau,

103
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,260
we have a common enemy—

104
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,720
the Japanese.

105
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,420
I've noticed
that no matter what issues come up,

106
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,120
you can always manage

107
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,070
to persuade me in the simplest way.

108
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,960
Fine then.

109
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,590
My only job
is to provide goods to Hengfengyu.

110
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,550
I won't ask about anything else.

111
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,430
Thank you.

112
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,510
When will this shipment
be fully assembled?

113
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,810
I have the majority of the goods on hand.

114
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,250
But it'll take half a month

115
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,610
to gather the rest.

116
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,300
Okay.

117
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,880
Then...

118
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,010
it's settled.

119
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,090
Sure. We have a deal now.

120
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,780
Hello, it's me.

121
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,960
What did you say?

122
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,620
W-Why is that?

123
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,480
What stupid pass?

124
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,330
Got it. I'll look into it right now.

125
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,300
Anything wrong?

126
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,450
A shipment of my company

127
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,980
was seized by the Japanese troops
at the Gongbei checkpoint

128
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,630
for the ridiculous reason
that we were unable

129
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,160
to present a pass
issued by Agency Chief Sawa.

130
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,460
Agency Chief Sawa?

131
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,130
Since when do merchants need a permit

132
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,460
from him
to get the goods through the port?

133
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,380
Mr. Lok Pak.

134
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,110
What is going on?

135
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,380
Why was a shipment of mine

136
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,610
detained at the Gongbei checkpoint?

137
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,140
I demand an explanation now.

138
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,130
Why do I need a pass
issued by Agency Chief Sawa?

139
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,510
Mr. Rodrigues, not only you are affected.

140
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,540
Since early this morning,

141
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,430
all Portuguese merchant ships and goods

142
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,460
entering Guangdong

143
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,930
and Hong Kong overland or by sea

144
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,460
have been seized by the Japanese

145
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,960
for the same reason—

146
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,490
no transit is allowed without a pass

147
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,550
issued by Agency Chief Sawa.

148
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,640
What right do they have to do so?

149
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,020
What right?

150
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,260
This is obviously
their retaliation on the government

151
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,950
for refusing to accept their terms.

152
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,350
Mr. Lok Pak,

153
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,140
what the Japanese want

154
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,110
is for the Chinese to be forbidden
to fight them in Macau.

155
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,460
What do the affairs of China
have to do with us Portuguese?

156
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,960
The government must not compromise

157
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,340
our interests for the Chinese.

158
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,340
Or how do we get on with our lives?

159
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,380
Exactly.

160
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,770
I understand your concerns.

161
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,950
I'll negotiate with the Japanese soon

162
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,380
to get the goods released
in the shortest time possible.

163
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,640
Rest assured.

164
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,770
I promise I'll give everyone an answer.

165
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,460
Make it quick.

166
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:43,190
Please don't misinterpret
this seizure of goods.

167
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,000
At the previous
Japanese-Portuguese joint meeting,

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,200
didn't you criticize the Imperial Army

169
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,770
for shifting all the blame
of the rampant smuggling

170
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,860
to the Macau government,
despite our joint authority

171
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,660
of cracking down on such crimes?

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,340
Given that,

173
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,310
the Command decided
to take on its responsibility

174
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,000
by issuing strict orders

175
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,500
and conducting
an anti-smuggling operation.

176
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,480
Then crack down on smuggling

177
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,470
as you should.

178
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,430
Why did you have to seize all the goods
of the Portuguese merchants in Macau?

179
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,190
Do you mean all of them are smugglers?

180
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,720
Conclusions

181
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,830
can't be made without inspections, right?

182
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,650
Mr. Lok Pak, don't worry.

183
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,050
The Command

184
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,340
has assigned this task to me.

185
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,480
When the goods are verified
as non-smuggled,

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,840
all of them and the ships

187
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,580
will be returned intact.

188
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,430
You have my word.

189
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,430
That's more like it.

190
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,270
Then...

191
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,150
how long will the inspections take?

192
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,500
Well...

193
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,790
At minimum,

194
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,830
10 to 15 days.

195
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,340
At maximum,

196
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,960
6 to 12 months.

197
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,650
Anyway,

198
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,310
once the anti-Japanese activities
in Macau subside,

199
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,580
and I have time,

200
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,770
I'll immediately conduct quick inspections

201
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,930
to protect the legitimate interests
of the Portuguese merchants in Macau.

202
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,240
Six to twelve months?

203
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,050
Most of the seized goods

204
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,580
are daily necessities

205
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,930
that will spoil within a month or two.

206
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,190
Who will buy them after the inspections?

207
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,310
Colonel Sawa,

208
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,060
don't you forget

209
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,480
that a formal trade agreement

210
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,430
has been signed
between Portugal and Japan.

211
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,190
What you're doing
is a blatant breach of contract.

212
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,840
I'm just performing my duties.

213
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,390
Bottom line is,

214
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,770
Macau is now in the charge of Portugal.

215
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,860
The Empire of Japan

216
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,980
has always hoped to maintain

217
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,460
friendly cooperation
with the Portuguese merchants in Macau.

218
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,340
As for whether the local government

219
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,000
and the Portuguese merchants

220
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,840
in Macau

221
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,820
would like to make things difficult

222
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,840
for themselves—

223
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,310
this is entirely up to you.

224
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,080
I've had a bit too much tea.

225
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,100
Excuse me

226
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,580
for a moment.

Okay. I got it.

232
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,810
Thank you, Chairman Gao.

233
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,860
What now?

234
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,360
The Portuguese Macau government
has decided

235
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,730
to hold a vote again

236
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,000
tomorrow at 10:00 on the terms

237
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,770
proposed by the Japanese.

238
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,000
According to
Chairman Gao's initial assessment,

239
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,670
the Portuguese merchants' strong protests

240
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,570
have swayed the attitude of half

241
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,500
of the Executive Council members.

242
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,320
Things are not looking good.

243
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,310
Though the situation is tense,

244
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,010
there are still solutions.

245
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,620
From my perspective as a doctor,

246
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,600
treating only the symptoms

247
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,320
without addressing the cause

248
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,250
is a taboo in practicing medicine.

249
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,100
Only by identifying

250
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,650
and treating the root cause

251
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,080
of the illness

252
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,030
can a patient be cured.

253
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,230
The same applies to Macau.

254
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,580
The Japanese have been dominating Macau

255
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,910
effortlessly by taking

256
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,460
advantage of Macau's fundamental weakness.

257
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,980
And that weakness

258
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,910
only lies in one thing—

259
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
transportation.

260
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,650
Exactly.

261
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,670
Macau is essentially an isolated island,

262
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,390
with all livelihoods
and its entire economy

263
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,550
completely dependent on foreign trade.

264
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,650
Now, the Japanese

265
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,840
have occupied all the nearby areas.

266
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,930
Once they implement a blockade,

267
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,100
Macau will be

268
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,270
driven in an extremity right away.

269
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,290
All imports and exports have been

270
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,950
in the Japanese' control the entire time.

271
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,960
The problem is just that they're now
on to the Portuguese merchants.

272
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,890
This is indeed a tricky situation

273
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,320
that can't be easily solved.

274
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,550
Mr. Liang.

275
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,890
There's a permanent solution

276
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,080
we can implement now,

277
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,810
since the conditions are ripe.

278
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,810
That is to build a secret

279
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,540
supply route by leveraging
the joint efforts of multiple parties.

280
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,070
The Portuguese Macau government has always

281
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,930
been going after Tai Ho Brotherhood
for smuggling.

282
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,740
That aside,

283
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,890
do you think we,

284
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,890
the Chinese Nationalist Party,

285
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,080
will cooperate with the Communist Party?

286
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,970
Mr. Liang,

287
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,710
we're all Chinese.

288
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,440
Why draw lines between us?

289
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,500
I'm not creating divisions.

290
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,100
It's just that the Communist Party
wants to be a leader itself

291
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,160
instead of submitting
to the Nationalist Government.

292
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,190
Now, the top brass

293
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,050
in Chongqing find them abhorrent.

294
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:13,930
How is it possible

295
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,340
for the Nationalist Party members in Macau
to work with the communists

296
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,200
at this moment?

297
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,000
Mr. Liang,

298
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,480
what are we discussing today?

299
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,290
It is how to unite the Portuguese

300
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,420
and the Chinese communities in Macau.

301
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,770
Solidarity is even possible to be achieved

302
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,030
between the Portuguese and the Chinese.

303
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,890
Why can't all Chinese

304
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,720
unite to fight against

305
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,310
the enemy?

306
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,810
Mr. Liang,

307
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,390
I don't know much about other things,

308
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,340
but I do know

309
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,150
that after Hong Kong fell,

310
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,730
as we came all the way
to Macau for sanctuary,

311
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,690
Commander Ou risked his life

312
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,690
to save everyone.

313
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,080
It was exactly Commander Ou

314
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,600
and the guerrilla units led by him

315
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,810
that helped relieve the famine in Macau
and protect

316
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,940
the banknote paper.

317
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,100
Mr. Liang,

318
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,990
we've been through
those actual happenings together.

319
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,160
They've never drawn lines

320
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,070
or asked for anything in return.

321
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,810
Recently, I've read two articles

322
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,550
sent by a friend from Hong Kong.

323
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,470
One is

324
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,280
"The Declaration on the Pacific War
by the Communist Party of China."

325
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,520
The other is

326
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,740
the CPC Central Committee's

327
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,940
"Directive on
the Pacific Anti-Japanese United Front."

328
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,390
Mr. Liang,

329
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,190
I'm not a communist,

330
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,120
and I won't try to convert you.

331
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,880
You do believe that, don't you?

332
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,660
I surely do.

333
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,150
I trust you.

334
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,650
These two articles

335
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,650
are about striving for unity

336
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,190
among all classes,

337
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,520
political parties,

338
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,030
ethnic groups,

339
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,070
and countries.

340
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,360
The Communist Party members are even told

341
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,720
to work with
the Chinese Nationalist Party.

342
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,000
They're not just talking the talk,

343
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,730
but actually walking the walk.

344
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,000
Macau can be

345
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
the biggest and the most direct

346
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,700
beneficiary of such cooperation.

347
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,300
Mr. Liang,

348
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,080
the Communist Party
doesn't see anyone differently.

349
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,480
Why must you judge others

350
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,480
based on their political stances?

351
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,620
Will the Communist Party

352
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,460
really be so selfless

353
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,140
as to transport supplies for us?

354
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,890
Mr. Liang,

355
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,640
hasn't that already been proven

356
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,410
by all those past incidents?

357
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,270
I believe

358
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,810
Commander Ou and his guerrilla units

359
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,470
won't hesitate to do anything

360
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,320
helpful for the Resistance.

361
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,869
I have to leave Kiang Wu?

362
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,760
Why?

363
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,560
Not only that,

364
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,589
you should also keep a distance

365
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,770
from some of your former friends,

366
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,000
especially...

367
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,060
He Xian.

368
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:31,390
Xian?

369
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:32,780
Yes.

370
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,480
Why?

371
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,090
Have you heard

372
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,490
something bad about him?

373
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,260
Tell me!

374
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,610
To be honest with you,

375
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,480
today, at the Sawa Agency,

376
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,080
I saw with my own eyes

377
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,980
that He Xian is now on the list

378
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,040
of anti-Japanese activists
that are being watched by Japanese agents.

379
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,970
Plus, he's labeled as a key figure.

380
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,050
Yinwan,

381
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,100
given what you did in Hong Kong,

382
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,830
the Japanese' suspicion of you

383
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,520
has not diminished at all.

384
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,630
Worse still,

385
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,430
the Government Bond Fundraising Committee
that Mr. Liang is working on

386
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,780
has become a thorn in the Japanese' side.

387
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,890
You know better than anyone

388
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,460
how ruthless the Japanese can be.

389
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,960
If you stay at Kiang Wu,

390
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,630
you could be implicated anytime.

391
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,700
Even your life

392
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,320
could be endangered.

393
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,370
Yinwan,

394
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,450
I'm saying this

395
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,580
purely out of concern for your safety.

396
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,690
Do take it seriously.

397
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,620
Leave Kiang Wu right away,

398
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,830
and cut off contact with He Xian.

399
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,710
Thank you, Dr. Lok Pak.

400
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,760
I'll do as you suggest

401
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,590
and quickly resign
from Kiang Wu Elementary School.

402
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,130
Really?

403
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,240
Really.

404
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,240
I was worried that you might object to it.

405
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,980
By the way...

406
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,220
does Bachongtian Club
still need musicians?

407
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,260
Are you going back

408
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,750
to working at Bachongtian Club?

409
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,500
After I resign from the school,

410
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,330
I'll need a new job.

411
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,650
Except for playing the violin,

412
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,910
I have no other skills.

413
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,260
So, I'm wondering

414
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,960
if...

415
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,700
Say no more.

416
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,630
As long as you're willing to come back,

417
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,130
you'll still be the concertmaster

418
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,660
of Bachongtian orchestra.

419
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,560
Thank you.

420
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,080
[Hai Ho's Hall]

421
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,840
Transporting goods for those

422
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,880
Portuguese?

423
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,720
Dream on!

424
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,280
Master Sanhe,

425
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,350
when Macau was in crises

426
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,700
during the grain transportation,

427
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,540
the HKD War,

428
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,950
and the secret delivery of banknote paper,

429
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,630
Tai Ho Brotherhood never ceased

430
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,040
to offer generous help.

431
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,230
Why are you saying no this time?

432
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,110
On those occasions,

433
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,310
we saved Macau with concerted efforts.

434
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,980
We were helping our own brothers

435
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,960
and the Chinese people in Macau.

436
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,110
But who are these foreigners?

437
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,540
Why should I help them?

438
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,110
I know

439
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,780
you and the Brotherhood have been somewhat
unfairly treated by the government

440
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,510
and the Portuguese merchants.

441
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,380
"Somewhat unfairly treated"?

442
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,370
For all these years,

443
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,560
they've defined us in Tai Ho Brotherhood

444
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,390
as

445
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,950
pirates and smugglers.

446
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,090
They seized so many of our ships

447
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,280
and put bounties on so many of our men.

448
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,680
In their squalid prison,

449
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,650
so many of my brothers suffered.

450
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,780
But none of those are happening now.

451
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,190
Fine.

452
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,590
Let's not talk about the past.

453
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,980
Focus on the present then.

454
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,430
After signing

455
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,930
that that seven-article agreement
with the Japanese,

456
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,660
they banned wooden sailboats.

457
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,200
As for all motorized vessels,

458
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,600
they can't set sail

459
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,980
before being registered

460
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,720
with the Port Authority.

461
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,640
You know that, don't you?

462
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,150
Yes, I do.

463
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:40,740
Over 80% of the vessels

464
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,460
owned by Tai Ho Brotherhood
are wooden sailboats.

465
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,460
That contract has had

466
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,980
our livelihood severely slashed.

467
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,240
The remaining vessels are motorized,

468
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,240
and I must use them
for legal shipping operations

469
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,720
to make money for my brothers
in a legitimate way, right?

470
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,450
I submitted an application
for registration

471
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,760
to the Port Authority.

472
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,090
Guess what happened?

473
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,220
Was it...

474
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,950
rejected?

475
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,210
It was worse than that.

476
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,620
Rodrigues, in his position

477
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,580
as head of Portuguese merchants

478
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,220
and Inspector General
of the Port Authority,

479
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,960
said the Japanese assigned too few places

480
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,700
for vessel registration to them,

481
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,930
which were barely enough
for the Portuguese merchants.

482
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,790
He also told us,

483
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,510
what he calls "smugglers,"

484
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,150
to just make a few trips
in secret at night,

485
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,580
and not to take up any official quotas.

486
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,450
Did he really say that?

487
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,870
He said exactly all that,

488
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,520
with sheer contempt.

489
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,590
This man Rodrigues...

490
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,630
Mr. He,

491
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,910
that happened

492
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,740
after we risked our lives

493
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,740
to bring to Macau

494
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,330
the life-saving grain.

495
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,410
Rodrigues

496
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,800
makes money from me.

497
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,520
And when he doesn't,

498
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,250
he puts on airs as a Portuguese.

499
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,590
He has backed

500
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,450
Tai Ho Brotherhood into a corner.

501
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,370
Now,

502
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,780
with his goods having been seized
by the Japanese,

503
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,720
he's asking if I can help him.

504
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,780
Well, sorry,

505
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,410
I can't.

506
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,350
I just can't.

507
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,470
Master Sanhe,

508
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,740
in that matter,

509
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,520
Rodrigues did act improperly.

510
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,880
But in such desperate times,

511
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,030
our common enemy is the Japanese.

512
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,090
Building a secret channel
for transporting supplies

513
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,540
will not only help
the Portuguese merchants out of trouble,

514
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,390
but also address

515
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,520
the national needs in resisting intruders.

516
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,240
Tai Ho Brotherhood has always put
loyalty and righteousness first.

517
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,300
Master Sanhe, you more magnanimous.

518
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,520
I believe

519
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,850
you will let go

520
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,280
of those petty grievances

521
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,610
for the sake of the country
and the people.

522
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,130
What if I'm reluctant to do so?

523
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,780
Then how about this?

524
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,110
I'll try to negotiate

525
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,350
with Rodrigues
to have more Ho Hai Club vessels

526
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,520
registered with the Port Authority.

527
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,160
How many quotas did you apply for?

528
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:52,740
Five.

529
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,520
But now five won't do.

530
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,650
I want to double it

531
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,200
to 10, and not one less.

532
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,040
Fine.

533
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,780
I'll try.

534
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,840
Are you satisfied?

535
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,130
No, that's not enough.

536
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,050
What else do you want?

537
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,260
I want Rodrigues

538
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,020
to serve me tea and apologize

539
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,190
in person.

540
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,600
Master Sanhe,

541
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,990
that won't be necessary, right?

542
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,060
Mr. He...

543
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,450
Rodrigues disrespected

544
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,040
Tai Ho Brotherhood first.

545
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,390
Shouldn't he serve me tea and apologize?

546
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,560
If he refuses,

547
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,130
Tai Ho Brotherhood...

548
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,960
won't help him anything

549
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,240
with the Portuguese merchants' goods.

550
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,420
Can you really persuade Tao Ho Brotherhood

551
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,190
and the guerrilla forces

552
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,570
of the Communist Party to help

553
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,970
us Portuguese merchants transport goods?

554
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,940
That depends on
whether you'll have support

555
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,800
from the Portuguese merchants
in tomorrow's vote.

556
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,300
If the freight problems

557
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,230
in Macau can be solved,

558
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,890
and the restrictions imposed

559
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,940
by the Japanese
can be lifted once and for all,

560
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,440
I guarantee

561
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,320
the Portuguese merchants

562
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,780
will all vote in our favor.

563
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,740
However,

564
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,290
Portuguese merchants take

565
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,220
less than half of the seats
in the Executive Council.

566
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,080
The government is the key player.

567
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,660
I'm afraid my influence

568
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,310
alone

569
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,770
is far from enough.

570
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,440
Don't worry about that.

571
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,100
I'll go to Bachongtian Club

572
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,480
to meet with Mr. Lok Pak

573
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,240
right after discussing with you.

574
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,780
Good.

575
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,660
If Macau's trade is jeopardized,

576
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,540
Lok Pak can't be the deputy director
of the Economic Bureau anymore.

577
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,070
You're right to talk to him.

578
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,220
Since Tai Ho Brotherhood

579
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,590
has agreed to do such a huge favor
for the Portuguese merchants in Macau,

580
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,450
don't you think

581
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,980
you owe them a gesture of gratitude?

582
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,570
But now five won't do.

583
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,740
I want to double it

584
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,240
to 10, and not one less.

585
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,940
What? Ten quotas for vessel registration?

586
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,340
That's an exorbitant demand.

587
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,910
It's a real bargain.

588
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,980
He's tackling the biggest obstacle

589
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,440
faced by all Portuguese merchants
in Macau.

590
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:02,560
I was indeed too harsh on Huang Sanhe

591
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,840
when he applied for registration
last time.

592
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,320
Listen,

593
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,880
my own company

594
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,520
will spare 3 quotas for them.

595
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,210
As for the rest, I'll have to ask

596
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,310
some other Portuguese merchants for help.

597
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,490
How does that sound?

598
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,860
Good, it's settled then.

599
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,350
The last request won't be

600
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,880
difficult for you to meet.

601
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,280
What request?

602
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,890
Now that you're forming an alliance

603
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,410
with Master Sanhe,
you should meet with him, right?

604
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,350
You'll seal the deal in person,

605
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,590
and promise not to back out.

606
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,590
I will bring

607
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,300
Master Sanhe along for a visit.

608

All you need

609
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,350
to do is serve him tea
and say something nice

610
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,950
so as to

611
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,190
bury the hatchet

612
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,110
with him.

613
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,720
Mr. He,

614
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,220
are you asking me
to apologize to Huang Sanhe

615
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,800
by serving him tea myself?

616
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,410
What?

617
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,220
Shouldn't you do that?

618
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,390
He's head of a smuggling gang,

619
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,530
-while I am...
-The son of the former Governor of Macau.

620
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,150
How's it possible for you to serve him tea

621
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,130
and apologize?

622
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,810
Do you think that way?

623
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,290
Fine then.

624
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,690
Forget about my visit today.

You and your fellow Portuguese merchants

626
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,190
should handle your own problems.

627
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:12,930
Just hold on.

628
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:13,920
Why the rush?

629
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,450

634
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,330
was in desperate straits,

635
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,940
devoted all they had

636
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,240
to stabilizing the situation

637
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,950
when the banking industry in Macau

638
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,210
was about to collapse,

639
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,330
and risked their lives to deliver

640
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,890
the special printing paper

641
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,350
for the new notes to Macau.

642
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,220
You've all benefited from their help.

643
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,330
Who are you to pompously look down

644
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,500
on them now?

645
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,980
Fine.

646
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,340
I'll serve him tea as an apology.

647
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,760
Will that do, Xian?

648
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,190
When he's here,

649
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,790
remember to speak politely.

650
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,810
If you feel shortchanged,

00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,930
and knew that the Macau station

753
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,260
she built with great efforts

754
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,060
has fallen to the current state,

755
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,520
would she be happy?

756
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,930
What on earth do you want from me?

757
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,980
I fulfilled my duty.

758
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,040
I risked my life!

759
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,620
But what happened?

760
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,560
I caused the death of my beloved woman.

761
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,200
Xian, take my advice.

762
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,220
Even if the sky falls,

763
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,420
don't ever think of holding it up alone.

764
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,820
When you end up like me,

765
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,030
it'll be too late

766
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,240
to regret.

767
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,540
All is too late.

768
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,090
Xian,

769
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,110
I know you're tired.

770
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,490
Then get some rest.

771
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,720
Nobody will blame you.

772
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,740
I'd like to take a rest.

773
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,950
I wish I could have some idle time.

774
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,520
But the Japanese just wouldn't let me.

775
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,220
You know what?

776
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,540
These terrible people
have stirred up trouble again.

777
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,080
Once more, they've pushed Macau

778
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,670
to the edge of survival.

779
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,920
Tomorrow is the critical day.

780
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,830
We must make it through.

781
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,060
But now,

Wanqi is sick.

783
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,170
Zixia is not around.

784
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,560
I can't handle all of this alone.

785
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:29,960
Chang,

786
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,240
I need a friend like you.

787
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,920
Pull yourself together

788
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,160
and share the burden,

789
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,590
will you?

790
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,870
Okay.

791
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,390
How can I help?

792
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,500
Rodrigues has a message

793
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,460
that must be delivered
to Master Sanhe tonight,

794
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,190
who is not at the headquarters
on Hengqin Island.

795
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,890
Only those trusted by Tai Ho Brotherhood

796
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,350
have access to that place.

797
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,410
Tonight,
I need to stay for important issues,

798
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,740
so I can't go there.

799
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:11,960
Only you

800
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,380
can complete this task for me.

801
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:17,730
I'll do it.

802
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,430
Yinwan,

803
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,130
are you sure
you don't want to change rooms?

804
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,110
This is too small a room

805
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,060
with noise, since it's close

806
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,760
to the elevator.

807
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,960
You'll be disturbed.

808
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,000
Not at all.

809
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,850
Being near the elevator
provides much convenience.

810
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,690
Dr. Lok Pak,

811
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,800
thank you.

812
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,040
You're very welcome.

813
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,520
I'm delighted to have you back
at Bachongtian Club.

814
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,460
If you need anything, just let me know.

815
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,410
Got it. Thanks.

816
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,220
In addition, recently,
the kerfuffle caused by the Japanese

817
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,060
has been giving me quite a headache.

818
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,790
The Executive Council
will hold a vote tomorrow.

819
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:53,980
But don't you worry.

820
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,180
I will definitely take the lead
in voting against the ban.

821
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,500
Dr. Lok Pak,

822
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,610
thank you on behalf of all Chinese people.

823
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,540
I'm glad to help.

824
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,659
Renyu,

825
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,110
you'll watch over me from heaven, right?

826
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,560

827
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,810

[Wing Tseng Tong Cake Shop]

00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,390
I, Mary Jones,

830
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,430
hereby appoint Mr. Yang Chang

831
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,290
as a covert intelligence operative
for this station.

832
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,580
Mr. Yang Chang,

833
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,230
welcome aboard.

Five of them were killed on the spot.

835
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,020
All the smuggled goods on their boats

836
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,350
were confiscated by us.

837
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,880

before the boats sank,

840
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,240
we could've caught those
who jumped overboard.

841
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,830
Chief,

842
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,100
the goods on those boats

843
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,410
are worth dozens of gold bars.

844
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,930
Did that merchant ship of Rodrigues'

845
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,140
participate in the interception?

846
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,890
Would he have dared to disobey
an order from the anti-smuggling unit?

847
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,140
Good.

848
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,560
Driving a wedge between the Chinese
and the Portuguese merchants

849
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,560
matters more than taking down
a smuggling vessel of Tai Ho Brotherhood.

850
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,230
These goods...

851
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,830
will be rewards for the Special Ops.

852
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,560
Thank you.

853
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,540
How tasty.

854
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:16,560
However,

855
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,330
a small price has to be paid.

856
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,490
Prepare 10 gold bars now

to give them to Lok Pak.

858
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,350
W-why are we sending gold bars to him?

859
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,030
The Portuguese Macau government
is going to hold a second vote.

860
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,960
Lok Pak is quite influential
among the officials.

861
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,810
It's best to apply

862
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,820
the carrot-and-stick approach
to such people.

863
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,500
Don't you know that?

864
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,640
Lok Pak is greedy for money.

865
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,100
This tactic of yours will work,

866
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,600
Chief.

867
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I'll do as you say.

868

Off you go.

869
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,000
Did Rodrigues really say yes?

870
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,410
He also agreed to serve Huang Sanhe tea

871
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,220
as an apology?

872
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,310
The future of all Portuguese merchants
is on the line.

873
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,770
He is surely able to sort out
his priorities.

874
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,540
Oh, Rodrigues has always

875
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,140
been a hoity-toity man.

876
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,000
It's not easy to make him yield.

877
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,600
With him initiating a truce,

878
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:20,810

879
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,210
won't complain anymore.

What's the government's plan?

881
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,740
The Portuguese government
is adamantly anti-communist.

882
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,350
To avoid being cracked down,

883
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,750
those secret channels
for transferring supplies

884
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,270
have to be built covertly.

885

Look,

Captain Huang,

939
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,940
I own Bachongtian Club.

940
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,450
I hired Miss Qiao as the chief musician.

941
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,060
The Special Operations Team is upstairs.

942
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,460
That's where you throw your weight around.

943
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,990
You're now causing a scene
at the wrong place.

944
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,520
You guys are...

945
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,370
determined to fight against
the Imperial Army and Special Ops, right?

946
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,300
Huang Gongjie, what are you doing?

947
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:41,640
Chief.

948
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,560
You bastard!

949
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,790
You have no discipline whatsoever.

950
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,750
Who do you think you are to act

951
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,980
so rudely at Mr. Lok Pak's establishment?

952
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,640
And you're even holding a gun.

953
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,140
Put it down now!

954
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:07,930
Mr. Lok Pak,

955
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:09,730
Mr. He,

956
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,460
Miss Qiao, my apologies.

957
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,910
I should've done a better job
disciplining my subordinates.

958
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,680
Sorry for interrupting your performance.

959
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,740
Please forgive us.

960
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,520
Apologize to Miss Qiao.

961
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,100
Miss Qiao, I'm sorry.

962
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:38,290
How lucky to witness Miss Qiao's return
to Bachongtian Club.

963
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,770
Our ears are in for a treat.

964
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,590
Everyone, join me...

965
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,770
in welcoming Miss Qiao
for a wonderful performance!
