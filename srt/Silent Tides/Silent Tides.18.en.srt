00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,030
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,630
Tell the General

4
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,300
I want an apple pie.

5
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,460
A large one.

6
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,180
Apple pie?

7
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,789
Go get him

8
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,380
an apple pie.

9
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,180
Yes, sir.

10
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,110
You've loved apple pie
since you were little.

11
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,370
So whenever we were eating out,

12
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,980
I always made sure

13
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,750
to get a large one.

14
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:21,510
You said

15
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,090
that having a good appetite is a blessing.

16
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,690
I even told my friends

17
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,910
that when you were this tall,

18
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,990
you could already

19
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,350
finish a huge apple pie in one go.

20
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,880
They didn't believe me.

21
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,130
How old

22
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,350
were you then?

23
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,230
I was seven.

24
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,410
Seven years old.

25
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,320
Right.

26
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,500
It was when you were seven.

27
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,470
That Christmas Eve,

28
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,670
many people came to our house.

29
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,600
Dad was entertaining guests,

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,630
and Mom was busy cooking.

31
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,780
So it was just the two of us,
playing hide-and-seek.

32
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,320
You always lost to me at hide-and-seek.

33
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,100
So that day, you said

34
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,829
you had to beat me once.

35
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,470
When I was seven,

36
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,230
my brother and I

37
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,920
were taken in
by the Benevolence Orphanage.

38
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,730
My parents passed away

39
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,930
before I could even remember anything.

40
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,230
Yes.

41
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,130
I said I wanted to beat you once.

42
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,150
Later, we really couldn't find you.

43
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,310
The whole family panicked

44
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,040
and looked for you everywhere.

45
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,980
Mom was so worried she cried.

46
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,040
Dad almost called the police.

47
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,850
I was young then

48
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,180
and didn't know better.

49
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,160
But I really didn't mean to
scare everyone.

50
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,710
It wasn't until midnight,

51
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,769
when I heard you singing
"Bright Moonlight,"

52
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,130
that I finally found you
in the backyard storage room.

53
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,720
Well, that was such a dark place.

54
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,010
How did you find the courage

55
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,220
to hide there?

56
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,840
Do you remember?

57
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,550
I remember.

58
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:45,760
General.

59
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,240
We didn't agree to the meeting

60
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,340
just to let them waste time reminiscing.

61
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,260
We can't just let them

62
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,790
ramble on like this, can we?

63
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,010
No rush. Let's keep listening.

64
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,810
It's been so long since I've seen you,

65
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,010
and the first thing I do is bring up

66
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,430
all those old memories.

67
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,240
Are you annoyed?

68
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,750
Not at all.

69
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,340
Renyu.

70
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,190
I remember everything

71
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,220
you said.

72
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,690
I won't be by your side anymore.

73
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,280
Take good care of yourself.

74
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,260
Okay?

75
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,810
Don't worry.

76
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,550
I'll be fine.

77
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,690
That's true.

78
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,310
You've always had

79
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,340
a mind of your own,
ever since you were little.

80
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,480
You'll definitely be fine.

81
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,100
Actually, it's me who should be worried.

82
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,580
I'm always hesitant in everything I do,

83
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,810
overthinking,

84
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,930
and not brave enough.

85
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,140
That's not true.

86
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,080
Let me finish.

87
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,380
Yinwan.

88
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:20,760
Mm.

89
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,940
Everything you did

90
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,630
was right,

91
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,080
all of it.

92
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,700
Your sense of responsibility,
your bravery—

93
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,560
I'm proud of you.

94
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,520
Of course, in my heart,

95
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,310
I also have a wish.

96
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,760
I hope

97
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,630
that I can be like you,

98
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,010
brave

99
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,070
and responsible.

100
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,750
So that you can be proud of me too.

101
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:00,960
Renyu.

102
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,150
Eat.

103
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,080
I want to see General Yazaki.

104
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,860
Let my sister go,

105
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,380
and I'll tell you

106
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,440
where the batch of banknote paper is.

107
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,830
She's my only sister.

108
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,820
For her, I can give up everything.

109
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,380
Mr. Qiao, you're indeed a smart man.

110
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,130
Deal.

111
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,880
Renyu.

112
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,480
Are you full, Yinwan?

113
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:00,880
Hmm.

114
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,960
I'm full.

115
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,560
Then I won't keep you any longer.

116
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,130
Go back now.

117
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,380
Be good.

118
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,700
Don't delay what needs to be done.

119
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,179
Renyu...

120
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,740
Mr. Qiao,

121
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,820
we've fulfilled your request

122
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,200
and let your sister leave.

123
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,150
Now,

124
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,550
it's your turn to tell us
where the batch of banknote paper is.

125
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,120
Qiao Renyu,

126
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,050
you should know this very well.

127
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,430
If you don't tell the truth,

128
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,390
your sister

129
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,610
will never be able to leave Hong Kong.

130
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,620
Xian.

131
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,860
Yinwan!

132
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,030
Be proud of me!

133
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,160
Brother!

134
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,040
Brother!

135
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,080
I'm proud of you.

136
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,370
All units, attention.

137
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,010
The target is moving.

138
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,290
Thank you.

139
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,220
Miss, feel free to look around.

140
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,260
Hmm.

141
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,220
She just bought a violin?

142
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,450
Yes. She said she's going to use it
to commemorate a relative.

143
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,290
She said nothing else besides that.

144
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,750
We've already taken
the violin shop owner in for questioning.

145
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,270
Keep watching her.

146
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,720
This is the information

147
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,920
we've found so far on the Qiao siblings.

148
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,710
We're still gathering the rest.

149
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,550
Leave nothing out.

150
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,290
Investigate everyone who's had dealings
with them in the past.

151
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:23,820
Yes, sir.

152
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,190
Play it again.

153
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:27,940
Yes, sir.

154
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,530
Brother!

155
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,270
Yinwan, don't be afraid. I'm here.

156
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,670
This woman has been

157
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,670
running all over the Island all day.

158
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,390
She leaves a white flower

159
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,000
and plays a violin piece at each stop.

160
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,120
We've quickly verified

161
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,500
that the places she's been to

162
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,840
are either where the siblings used to live

163
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,120
or where Qiao Renyu studied or worked.

164
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,430
This woman barely interacts with anyone.

165
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,500
Everyone who has spoken to her—

166
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,960
and even those who merely stopped
to listen to her play—have been

167
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,290
taken back to the Military Police Station
for questioning.

168
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,280
But no suspicious targets
have been found so far.

169
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,070
Continue monitoring her.

170
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,290
Do not miss a single clue.

171
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:11,990
Yes, sir.

172
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,140
Miss, what would you like to drink?

173
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,580
I'll have a macchiato.

174
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,580
Certainly. Please wait a moment.

175
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,290
Don't get close.

176
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,390
Yinwan is surrounded by secret agents.

177
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,500
But what if we miss

178
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,840
her playing?

179
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,200
We won't.
She knows the distance between us.

180
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,670
She'll make sure we hear her playing.

181
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,880
She's about to start playing.

182
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,890
The sound of a violin can travel far.

183
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:14,130
[One day ago]

184
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,430
But if you suddenly play
at a random location,

185
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,089
won't that be too conspicuous

186
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,099
and draw the enemy's attention?

187
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,910
Then I'll play more pieces

188
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,330
and visit more places

189
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,900
to confuse them.

190
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,350
Hong Kong is where my brother and I

191
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,500

After seeing my brother,

194
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,450
I'll be filled with nostalgia.

195
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,540
It's natural that I want to visit places
where we once lived,

197
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,700
and play music to express my longing.

00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,700
That makes sense, doesn't it?

199
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,430
This plan is good.

200
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,720
We just need to agree beforehand

on a specific piece

202
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,430

Why is all of this
about Qiao Renyu's work again?

207
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,170
The siblings talked mostly about
their childhood.

208
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,170

209

I'll go get my violin and play it for you.

No need.

238
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,780

We've already checked.

257
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,740
That place used to be an orphanage.

258
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,740
After Hong Kong fell,
it was occupied by the Japanese.

259
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,340
Now it's been converted into
their Naval Club.

260

263
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,560
I remember that day was Christmas.

264
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,260
It was my first time
seeing the priest and the nuns.

265
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,390
I was terrified,

266
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,740
so I hid inside a concealed wall.

267
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,630
It was built behind a statue
of the Virgin Mary,

268
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,870
and the switch was actually
one of her shoes.

269

I stumbled into it completely
by accident—

270
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,020
somehow, I just crawled in.

271
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,190
A concealed wall?

272
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,990
That's right.

273
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,370
This kind of concealed wall, meant to
prevent theft, is extremely well hidden.

274
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,260
Ordinary people would never find it.

275
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,780
That's why Mr. Qiao Renyu

276
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,190

the Japanese would be so shameless

285

Given the current fire,

378
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,020
it could very likely trigger
a much larger explosion.

an explosion!

General, we've confirmed it.

392
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,330
Since childhood, Qiao Renyu and his sister
were taken in

393
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,390
by the Benevolence Orphanage
of St. John's Church.

394
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,370
The claim about spending Christmas at home
with their parents

395
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,370
is a complete lie.

396
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,190
Post two men to stand guard
at the entrance.

397
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,110
Have the men in the back
make the fire bigger.

398
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,520
Don't let the Japanese come back.

399

-Let's go.
-Let's go.

What Qiao Renyu hinted at

407
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,480
must be some hidden location
in the orphanage.

408
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,890
Where is that orphanage?

409
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,870
On Garden Road, the St. John's...

You two, go downstairs.

417
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,480
The Virgin Mary statue upstairs
has no mechanism.

418
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,000

419

423
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,520
falls into Japanese hands,

424
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,590

of the Virgin Mary,

428

and the switch was actually
one of her shoes.

429

540
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,680

Even if we can't catch up,

551
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,800
we should still be able to intercept them.

552
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,910
I understand.

553
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:01,090

00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,500
guard the cargo himself.

565
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,160
Xian,

566
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,480
what do you want
these cans of gasoline for?

567
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,250
Don't worry about it.

568
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:24,930
Go steer the ship.

569
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:25,460
Alright.

570
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:26,650
Master Huang.

571
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,640
This batch of banknote paper is

572
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,350
more important than anything else.

573
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,060
Whether or not we can get it to Macau,

574
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,120
it must not fall into Japanese hands.

575
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,330
Master Huang,

576
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,520
take Xian to that ship.

577
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,390
I'll guard the cargo.

578
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,030
Wanqi,

579
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,250
Baixin is still waiting for you at home.

580
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:47,960
I know.

581
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,460
But your father,

582
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,960
wife, and son...

583
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,360
I'm in charge of this operation.

584
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,790
Everything follows my orders.

585
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,980
I'll guard the cargo.

586
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,540
Zixia, take them away.

587
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,210
Okay.

588
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,580
I'll go to the lead ship
and clear the way for you.

589
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,710
Be sure to stay safe.

590
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,420
Go.

591
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,530
Listen up, everyone!

592
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,250
Tonight,

593
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,370
I don't want a single ship

594
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,000
or person entering Macau from the sea!

595
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,750
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

596
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,610
Board the ship!

597
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,340
Mr. Huang,

598
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,830
it's pitch black out there,

599
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,930
and the Lingding Channel is so vast.

600
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,930
Where are we supposed to block them?

601
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,620
Japanese warships are chasing them.

602
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,980
They're sure to take the quickest route.

603
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,060
They don't dare risk wasting time
by taking detours.

604
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:54,520
We'll block them right at
this Hong Kong-Macau shipping lane.

605
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,810
It's definitely the right move.

606
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:56,540
Understood.

607
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,390
Wait.

608
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,420
Tonight the wind is from the east.

609
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,910
The sound of engines

610
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,650
will carry toward us.

611
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,630
At night,

612
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,460
your ears are more useful than your eyes.

613
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,520
Tell everyone to prick up their ears!

614
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,160
As soon as you spot the target,

615
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,500
fire a signal flare.

616
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,180
Yes.

617
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,140
That woman, Qiao Yinwan,

618
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:26,210
is no longer worth... keeping alive.

619
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,060
Arrest her.

620
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,140
Immediately!

621
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,660
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

622
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,940
[Brother Qiao Renyu's Tomb]

623
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,300
Look, up ahead are the waters of Macau.
