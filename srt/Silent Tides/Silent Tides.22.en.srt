Send this letter

00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:44,950
to Dr. Ke Lin's clinic.

5
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,640
Now?

6
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,170
Yes.

7
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,280
Go immediately.

8
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,479
Make sure you hand it to him personally.

9
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,490
Alright.

10
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,370
Sawa.

11
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,960
The midnight Mass at Saint Dominic's Church
is about to start.

12
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,430
If you want to waste time
with Liang Yanming, that's your choice.

13
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,579
As the Consul in Macau,

14
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,670
I have to go strengthen
Japanese-Portuguese relations.

15
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,070
Our informant reported 5 minutes ago

16
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,710
that Liang Yanming
is still at Kiang Wu Elementary School

17
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,440
and there has been no movement.

Chief!

30
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,250
Liang Yanming made a move.

31
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,440
He just left Kiang Wu Elementary School,

32
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,440
still wearing the
Government Bond Fundraising Committee armband?

33
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,240
Yes, our people saw it clearly.

34
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,820
By the way,

35
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,860
they said he was holding something red

36
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,670
with gold characters,

37
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,560
like an invitation
or an appointment letter.

38
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,610
A red appointment letter
with gold characters?

39
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,530
An invitation?

40
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,260

41
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,610
Why would Liang Yanming
go to Saint Dominic's Church?

42
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,210
The church
is holding Christmas Mass tonight.

43
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,820
De Solaire has invited

44
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,490
representatives from
all countries and sectors in Macau.

45
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,290
Liang Yanming is going there now

46
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,440
wearing the armband.

47
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,670
He is clearly planning to burn his bridges

48
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,670
and make a scene in front of everyone.

49
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,820
He...

50
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,910
really knows how to pick his spots.

Chief,

53
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,440
what should we do?

54
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,030
Since he insists on courting death,

55
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,440
I can only let him have it.

56
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,860
Yamaguchi,

57
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,110
take that gun.

58

Let's go to the church.

Yes.

60
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,760
What is responsibility?

61
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,320
Responsibility is standing tall

62
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,690
and facing things on your own.

63
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,440
Yes.

64
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,240
That's why
I had no choice but to let her go,

65
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,290
the farther the better.

66
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,909
Right. I'm telling you, Mary

67
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,409
shouldn't have been the one who died.

68
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:58,670
It should have been me.

69
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,200
I should have been the one who died.

this is Qiao Yinwan.

76
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,740

77
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,610
Miss Qiao?

78
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:42,800
Oh,

79
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,940
Xian isn't home. He went out.

80
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,720
What about his wife?

81
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,530
She went out too,

82
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,040
to find Xian.

83
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,070
Miss Qiao,

84
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,680
what do you need him for?

85
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,050
Well, Mr. He,

86
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,940
do you know where they went?

87
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,040
When Qiwen went out,

88
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,160
she told me

89
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,900
they'd be at that small bar
not far from home.

90
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,170
Miss Qiao,

91
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,560
if there really is anything you need,
just tell me.

92
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,060
I'll go find them for you.

93
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,860
Alright then. thank you, Mr. He.

94
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,110
No problem.

95
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,020
Ah.

96
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,240
What?

97
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,410
Qiwen,

98
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,920
why are you here?

99
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,320
I'm here to drink with you.

100
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,060
Come on, drink up.

101
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,490
I really didn't expect

102
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,909
to see the three of you like this.

103
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,200
You're usually so smart

104
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:53,110
and capable,

105
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,490
seeming to understand everything

106
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,820
and able to handle any difficulty.

107
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,790
Aren't you supposed to be so impressive?

108
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,910
Why is it that when it comes to women,
you all lose your heads,

109
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,260
panic, blame the world,

110
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,390
and drink yourselves into this state?

111
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,320
Wanqi.

112
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,550
Do you know why I came here today?

113
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,570
Because Baixin asked you

114
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,950
to help return the wedding dress.

115
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,670
Yes.

116
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,560
Baixin did come to ask me
to help return her wedding dress.

117
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,679
But it wasn't because she wanted
to break up with you,

118
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,909
or because you were sending her

119
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,980
abroad to study.

120
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,680
On the contrary,

121
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,580
she knew everything.

122
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,870
Really?

123
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,700
Do you really think
you could hide it from her?

124
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,530
She's such a smart girl,

125
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,480
and she cares about you so much.

126
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,880
How could she not notice?

127
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,930
She secretly copied down the names

128
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,660
of the medicines you are taking

129
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,310
and went to the hospital
to ask about them.

130
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,460
She knows you have tuberculosis.

131
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,290
She told me that

132
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,060
from now on,

133
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,600
she would always stay by your side,

134
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,110
cook every meal for you,

135
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,750
remind you
to take your medicines and see the doctor,

136
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,890
and go out with you to exercise

137
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,530
and breathe fresh air.

138
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,560
Yes.

139
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,860
You don't have to marry her,

140
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,940
but she won't give up any hope

141
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,190
of curing your illness.

142
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,880
I know you don't want to burden Baixin,

143
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,320
but she's not as fragile as you think,

144
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,180
and she doesn't need
a man's so-called protection.

145
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,150
On the contrary,

146
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,580
for this love,

147
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,800
she will protect you to the very end.

148
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,870
Do you understand?

149
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,030
As for you, Chang.

150
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,410
Don't think

151
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,700
that you helped Mary so much,

152
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,730
or that you were the one
who pushed her to this point.

153
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,250
That's not true.

154
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,030
Mary's courage surpassed yours
by more than a hundred times.

155
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,060
It was she

156
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,060
who built the service station on her own.

157
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,670
It was also she

158
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,410
who, even with nothing,

159
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,940
persisted in fighting
against the Japanese.

160
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,620
If Mary's spirit is watching from heaven,

161
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
knowing that her sacrifice has only

162
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,100
produced the useless mess
you three have become,

163
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,980
how worthless would she feel?

164
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,560
Right?

165
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,870
What she wanted was a real man,

166
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,320
a Yang Chang
who could run the service station

167
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,940
and avenge her.

168
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,410
As for you, Xian,

169
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,690
you're always afraid
you're dragging Yinwan down.

170
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,090
You think she's just a girl
who plays the violin.

171
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,210
But have you ever thought about this?

172
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,910
The Qiao Yinwan who watched

173
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,170
her brother die right before her eyes,

174
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,190
yet stayed completely calm
without giving the slightest hint,

175
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,910
and held off Japanese intelligence agents

176
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,290
across all of Hong Kong for an entire day—

177
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,560
is she really...

178
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,580
really less brave

179
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,240
or less responsible than you?

180
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,580
I am your wife.

181
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:30,110
Every time you risk your life out there,

182
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,960
have I ever tried to stop you?

183
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,160
It's not that I don't know

184
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,460
that every time you go out,

185
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,170
you might not come back.

186
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,880
One wrong step,

187
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,640
Father would lose his son,

188
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,320
and Zai and Little Miss
would lose their father.

189
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,960
I never complained once,

190
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,930
because I know

191
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,690
the responsibility you're carrying.

192
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,260
No matter how worried

193
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,430
or reluctant I feel,

194
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,770
I still have to

195
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,790
take good care of this family
while you're away.

196
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,430
Only in this way

197
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,650
can you fight without distractions.

198
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,660
Qiwen,

199
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,200
thank you.

200
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,080
Xian,

201
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,750
you know I understand you.

202
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,170
In short,

203
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,100
stop thinking of yourself
as someone else's savior.

204
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,880
We women

205
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,040
are actually braver and stronger than you.

206
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,700
Baixin,

207
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,580
Mary,

208
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,790
and Yinwan—

209
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
they all knew what they were doing.

210
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,910
If you really are men,

211
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,440
then show your true strength and courage.

212
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,130
Xian.

213
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,320
Quan?

214
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,650
Old Master asked me to pass you a message.

215
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,810
Mr. Liang

216
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,290
is in danger.

217
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,370
Dear brothers and sisters,

218
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,530
peace belongs to those with kind hearts.

219
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,750
In our hearts,

220
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,150
we plant the seeds of truth and justice

221
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,580
and ignite the light of love and goodwill.

222
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,270
This light grants us the blessing

223
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:12,270
of true brotherhood

224
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:16,750
to help those in need

225
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,820
and those suffering and abandoned.

226
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,420
[Jade and Jewelry]

227
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,840
It also gives us the strength

228
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,100
to resist tyranny and oppression,

229
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,820
so that together we can build a just…

230
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,000
What's happening?

231
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,589
Ch-Chief.

232
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,040
Something doesn't seem right.

233
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,700
Liang Yanming.

234
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,910
It must be Liang Yanming.

235
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,600
Fellow countrymen of Macau,

236
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Merry...

237
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,830
Christmas Eve.

238
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,740
I am Liang Yanming,

239
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,790
head of the

240
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,810
Wartime Government Bond Fundraising Committee.

241
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,370
Today is Christmas Eve,

242
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,610
and people from all walks of life
in Macau have gathered here.

243
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,330
I would like to take this opportunity

244
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,870
to say a few words.

245
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,890
The midnight Mass just now

246
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,060
was wonderful.

247
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,450
It preached love and peace,

248
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,090
kindness and justice,

249
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,580
telling all of Macau
that we are brothers and sisters

250
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,000
and should treat each other like family.

251
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,530
If that were truly the case,

252
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,590
Macau would be

253
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,570
a paradise on earth.

254
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,160
But what about the reality?

255
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,760
Just yesterday,

256
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,780
the Portuguese Macau government,
for their own selfish interests,

257
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,230
bowed to the Japanese

258
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,850
and brazenly banned

259
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,810
the promotion
and sale of China's government bonds.

260
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,530
This disregards China's interests

261
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,310
and tramples on the patriotic hearts
of my fellow citizens.

262
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,830
It uses so-called neutrality

263
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,860
as a fig leaf for aiding the enemy.

264
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,930
Such petty self-interest

265
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,040
and cowardly behavior.

266
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,200
It shows no sense of justice

267
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,980
and disregards the law.

268
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,280
Shameful!

269
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,740
Yamaguchi.

270
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,950
Let me put it this way.

271
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,220
If selling out the Chinese

272
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,500
could really buy the Portuguese
a bit of temporary safety,

273
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,410
then so be it.

274
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,460
But what is the reality?

275
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,220
Everyone knows

276
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,310
that when bandits
are met with submission and flattery,

277
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,570
they only become more ruthless

278
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,820
and more greedy.

279
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,820
Isn't that true?

280
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,280
Looking back on Macau over the past year,

281
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,410
in the face of crisis,

282
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,960
when did weakness ever buy us a way out?

283
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,680
Every time, it was only through

284
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,870
our unity and determined struggle

285
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,170
that we turned danger into safety.

286
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,500
There is an old Chinese saying:

287
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,460
"without the lips,
the teeth will be exposed to the cold."

288
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,220
Today,

289
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,570
if you abandon the Chinese people,

290
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,440
who make up 96 percent

291
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,770
of Macau's population,

292
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,670
tomorrow,
when the bandits turn their knives on you,

293
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,440
tell me,

294
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,700
who will come to your aid?

295
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,140
Who will save you from disaster?

296
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,570
I'm afraid by then,

297
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,370
you will be nothing
but lambs on the chopping block,

298
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,370
waiting to be slaughtered.

299
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,110
How tragic.

300
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,980
Such a shame.

301
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,280
Chief, I'm in position and ready to shoot.

302
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,370
Colonel Sawa, what are you doing?

303
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,670
What do you think I could be doing?

304
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,650
You...

305
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,270
So many eyes are watching.

306
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,930
Are you insane?

307
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,430
Let me say

308
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,380
a few more words
to my Chinese compatriots.

309
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,920
Given the current situation,

310
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,020
with the Japanese military threats outside

311
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,150
and the Portuguese Macau government
cowering in fear inside,

312
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,540
persevering in the effort
to save our country

313
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,870
is no easy task.

314
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,930
But if we do not persevere,

315
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,040
China will perish as a nation.

316
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,020
So, I hereby call upon

317
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,960
the 400 thousand Chinese compatriots
of Macau

318
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,200
to rally your spirits

319
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,000
and be ready to make sacrifices.

320
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,480
I call upon every Chinese person

321
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,740
to unite as one and to stand together
with a single purpose,

322
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,000
like countless drops of rain converging into a mighty flood.

323
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,610
Then we will be able to sweep away all obstacles,

324
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:36,500
forging an iron Great Wall
of resistance and national salvation,

325
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
unbreakable and indestructible!

326
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,480
In this way,

327
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,720
our China, our magnificent China,

328
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,310
will become something to be celebrated

329
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,310
and remembered with tears and song!

330
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,670
Not only the Portuguese Macau government,

331
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,940
but also people from all sectors, are present.

332
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,230
Killing now

333
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,230
would only backfire.

334
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,940
What's happening?

335
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,270
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

336
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,740
I think I saw Xian.

337
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,750
Master Sanhe,
I'll go check. Please wait in the car.

338
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,540
Xian!

339
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:16,520
Xian!

340
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,460
Dr. Ke?

341
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,580
Make way!

342
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,180
Make way!

343
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:20,940
Make way!

344
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,370
Make way!

345
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,000
Excuse me.

346
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,810
Make way!

347
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,610
Let me through!

348
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,830
I know

349
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,910
that in the corners below the stage,

350
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,240
hidden

351
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,500
in the darkness,

352
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,910
there are all kinds of monsters

353
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,570
gnashing their teeth at me.

354
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,630
It doesn't matter.

355
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,650
I

356
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,130
made up my mind long ago to die if I must.

357
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,850
I want to kill one

358
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:59,500
as a warning to the others.

359
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,540
Come!

360
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,200
Come on!

361
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:09,960
Make way!

362
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,280
-Excuse me!
-Excuse me!

363
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,510
Make way!

364
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,670
Shoot!

365
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,220
Mr. Liang!

366
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,960
Heaven and Earth possess righteous energy,

367
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,480
flowing in myriad forms.

368
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,980
Below, it becomes rivers and mountains;

369
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,520
above, it becomes the sun and the stars.

370
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,690
When found in man,
it's called the Noble Spirit,

371
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,020
[In memory of Liang Yanming.
He has not yet been avenged]

372
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,540
vast and mighty, filling the firmament.

373
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,780
When the government is honest and just,

374
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,760
it functions in harmony,
radiating brilliance throughout the court.

375
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,310
But in times of extremity, integrity is revealed—

376
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,260

there were the historical records;

in the state of Jin, there was
the brush of Dong Hu that upheld justice.

380

In the Qin dynasty, there was Zhang Liang's iron hammer;

381

in the Han dynasty,
there was Su Wu's envoy staff.

382
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:27,240

in General Yan's head;

00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,620
The price

559
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,430
was fairly reasonable.

560
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,500
Mr. Rodrigues,

561
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:13,000
helping you dispose of this backlog of goods

562
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,140
serves both as an explanation
for the misunderstanding

563
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,280
over the hijacking

564
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,980
and as concrete proof

565
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:19,230
of the underground multi-party supply transport network

566
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,690
that I mentioned earlier.

567
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,980
The facts are clear.

568
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,030
As long as we work together,

569
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,580
this line can operate successfully.

570
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,810
So this time,

571
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,890
Master Sanhe and I have come

572
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,390
in the hope that you will set aside past grievances

573
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,930
and persuade the Portuguese merchants in Macau

574
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,770
to join this transport network.

575
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,810
Mr. Rodrigues,

576
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,620
if you're still upset

577
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,820
about the hijacking,

578
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,710
I, Huang Sanhe,

579
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,870
representing the Tai Ho Brotherhood,

580
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,480
would like to pour you tea and apologize.

581
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,940
Mr. Rodrigues,

582
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,020
please.

583
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,190
No, no, no.

584
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,270
Master Sanhe, you're too kind.

585
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,190
This cup of tea

586
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,070
should be mine to offer you.

587
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:07,870
Here.

588
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,480
No, no, no.

589
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,910
I was in the wrong first.

590
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,370
No.

591
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,540
I should be the one to apologize first.

592
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,560
Please, let me.

593
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,360
Then let me play the peacemaker.

594
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,430
Drink this cup of tea,

595
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,000
the clouds will part,

596
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,890
and from this day on,

597
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:19,950
we are all friends.

598
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,050
Well, the warrant...

599
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,250
I'll have it withdrawn immediately.

600
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,060
To sum up,

601
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,050
the patriotic merchants led by Ma Wanqi and He Xian

602
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,750
have become the backbone of Macau's business community.

603
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,480
The Portuguese merchants have also been won over.

604
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,370
As for transportation,

605
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,580
Zhongshan Anti-Japanese Guerrillas

606
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,940
and the Tai Ho Brotherhood, an unofficial force,

607
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,960
are working together smoothly.

608
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,870
Anti-Japanese sentiment across all sectors in Macau is now running high.

609
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,530
Therefore,

610
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,230
an underground supply transport network

611
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,540
with Macau at its core is already on solid footing.

612
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,390
How is the Allied Forces' intelligence station doing?

613
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,980
Although it was suspended for a while,

614
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,170
it has now resumed

615
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,510
and is expanding.

616
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,390
I found them a new location,

617
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,730
right next to my clinic,

618
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,060
where they can run a grocery shop as cover.

619
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,490
That's a good arrangement.

620
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:09,670
Previously,

621
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,230
our Guangdong–Hong Kong resistance forces

622
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:15,770
already cooperated with the Allied Forces on intelligence.

623
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,390
Now with this intelligence station,

624
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,870
Allied intelligence can now be integrated

625
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,940
into our entire Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macau

626
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,350
underground intelligence network.

627
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,350
This also aligns with the central leadership's directive

628
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:27,350
to strengthen the global anti-fascist united front.

629
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,040
Comrade Hannian,

630
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,370
what's the next focus of our work in Macau?

631
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:32,710
Just one thing:

632
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,980
to consolidate and strengthen

633
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,480
the anti-fascist united front in Macau

634
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,190
and accelerate the development of Macau's underground supply network.

635
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,100
It must be able to support both the front lines

636
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,540
and the base areas behind enemy lines,

637
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,060
forming stable supply and distribution channels.

638
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,500
So through Macau,

639
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,980
we'll sell more specialty products

640
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,910
to obtain more strategic supplies.

641
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,890
Not just more,

642
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,250
but ten or a hundred times more than before.

643
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,940
This channel must become normalized

644
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,430
and remain operational at all times.

645
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,210
The significance of this for improving

646
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,460
the entire enemy‑rear battlefield

647
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,990
and the supply of our forces

648
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,350
cannot be overstated.

649
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,430
To ensure the smooth progress of this work,

650
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,500
the organization has decided to transfer

651
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,190
a capable comrade from Hong Kong

652
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,480
to be stationed in Macau long‑term

653
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,410
under the cover of a merchant.

654
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,910
He will have two tasks.

655
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:18,370
First,

656
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,140
to actively bring patriotic businessmen

657
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,000
such as Ma Wanqi and He Xian

658
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,170
closer to our Party

659
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,070
and turn them into our allies.

660
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,100
Second,

661
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:30,140
to ensure the safe operation of this supply line.

662
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,350
Do you know

663
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,400
who Hong Kong

664
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,080
is sending this time?

665
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:35,750
Who?

666
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:38,610
Comrade Ke Zhengping.

667
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,460
Both Hong Kong Liaison Headquarters and the East River Column

668
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,250
agree that

669
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,580
Comrade Zhengping

670
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,380
is the most suitable candidate.

671
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,600
From now on,

672
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,690
you two brothers can fight side by side.

673
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,100
Well,

674
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,120
what about my identity?

675
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:55,910
Here's the thing.

676
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,910
Comrade Ke Zhengping

677
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:58,930
was sent by

678
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,160
East River Column and Hong Kong Liaison Headquarters.

679
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,470
He's on a separate line from yours.

680
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:05,520
Understood.

681
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:07,250
So on the surface,

682
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,310
I can only be his older brother.

683
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,460
Don't rush.

684
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,980
I haven't finished.

685
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,900
Comrade Ke Zhengping was ordered

686
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,580
to accept the leadership

687
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,490
of "Buddha's Hand"

688
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,440
under special circumstances.

689
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,420
That means that

690
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:21,940
in ordinary times,

691
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,640
you will oversee and guide his daily work,

692
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,700
and in extremely urgent situations,

693
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,040
you may, in the identity of Buddha's Hand,

694
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,370
issue him direct orders

695
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,620
and even mobilize

696
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,190
the Party's underground organizations

697
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,890
and armed forces across the Guangdong‑Hong Kong‑Macau region.

698
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,250
The purpose is to ensure

699
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,350
the safety of this supply line.

700
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,520
The code phrase for special orders

701
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,060
consists of 11 words:

702
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,840
The Great Way prevails;

703
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,340
all under heaven belong to the people.

704
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,120
The Great Way prevails;

705
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,610
all under heaven belong to the people.

706
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,260
I remembered.

707
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,690
It's settled then. Next time come to my club for drinks.

708
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,080
We won't leave until we're drunk!

709
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,020
Don't worry.

710
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,620
I, Rodrigues, will drink with you till the end.

711
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,580
Mr. Rodrigues.

712
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,220
Rodrigues,

713
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,520
you have other guests?

714
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,920
so I'll take my leave now.

715
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,660
I won't see you out then.

716
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,510
Well.

717
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,830
Mr. Rodrigues.

718
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,440
Last time, the contract we agreed on

719
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,640
was unfortunately interrupted halfway through.

720
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,390
Today,

721
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,370
we're here

722
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,640
to see whether

723
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,410
we can finally sign it.

724
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,640
Sorry.

725
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,460
You're too late.

726
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,520
That shipment has already been sold.

727
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:37,210
From now on,

728
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,660
all my goods

729
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,980
are already spoken for.

730
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,750
There's no need for you to waste your time here.

731
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,370
See you.

732
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,460
Gentlemen, please.

733
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,230
Bastard!

734
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,720
We finally managed to drive a wedge between the Portuguese and the Chinese,

735
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,830
but you insisted

736
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,910
on going your own way.

737
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,190
Now look.

738
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,330
With the bullet

739
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,310
that struck Liang Yanming,

740
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:14,500
all our efforts have gone to waste!

741
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,430
How do you plan to fix this?

742
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,660
Increase the seizures against Portuguese merchants in Macau.

743
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,600
Keep applying greater pressure

744
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
to force the Portuguese to change their stand.

745
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,730
What?

746
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,660
What nonsense are you talking about?

747
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,310
Across the entire Pacific Theater,

748
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:34,690
the Empire is already at a complete disadvantage.

749
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,600
What we lack now is supplies!

750
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,880
Supplies!

751
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,760
To maintain Japanese–Portuguese trade relations,

752
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,890
Headquarters has ordered

753
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:48,540
that all goods confiscated from Portuguese merchants

754
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,540
be returned immediately without conditions!

755
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:54,190
Similar actions will not be permitted in the future!

756
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,050
Are you listening?

757
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,450
So that means...

758
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,600
those Portuguese don't have to pay any price at all

759
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,580
for tolerating the Chinese?
