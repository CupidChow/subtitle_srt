00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,790
There are still people behind!

189
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,290
Hurry!

190
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,680
Retreat quickly!

191
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,550
Hurry! Retreat!

192
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,290
The enemy's firepower is too fierce!

193
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,130
On my command,

194
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,060
everyone, retreat!

195
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,600
Take all important supplies!

196
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:15,940
Go!

197
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,000
Retreat! Let's go!

198
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,340
Take everything!

199
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,560
All transport operations suspended?

200
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,270
We have no choice.

201
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,730
Master Sanhe,

202
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:08,810
I understand.

203
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,130
For the past two years, your men
have been mostly transporting

204
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,340
supplies for the Resistance,

205
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,370
earning just a little hard-earned money

206
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,440
to barely get by.

207
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,010
Once transport operations stop,

208
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,540
your men will have a hard time
making a living.

209
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,550
If there are difficulties...

210
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,630
Money isn't what I'm concerned about.

211
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,840
No matter how tough
things get for our men,

212
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,370
they won't starve to death.

213
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,920
What I'm worried about is

214
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,290
this large shipment of tungsten ore
that just arrived.

215
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,600
We had agreed

216
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,770
to exchange it

217
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,860
for the shipment

218
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,390
of diesel fuel
that Rodrigues brought into

219
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:34,980
Macau.

220
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,870
Once transport operations stop,

221
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,180
with such important cargo stuck in hand

222
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,300
and the Japanese inspecting so strictly,

223
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,670
if time drags on,

224
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,200
I'm afraid information might leak

225
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,340
and cause trouble.

226
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,980
It's precisely because this cargo is
so important

227
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,680
that without the Guerrilla Unit's escort,

228
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,210
the risk is simply too high.

229
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,370
That's right.

230
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,170
Master Sanhe,

231
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,960
we'll have to ask you

232
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,530
to find a way to hide
this batch of goods for now.

233
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,180
Alright.

234
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,290
I'll return to Zhongshan overnight

235
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,580
and hide the tungsten ore
in the Xi River first,

236
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,180
so the Japanese won't find it.

237
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,840
The most important thing right now

238
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,770
isn't the cargo,

239
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,880
but...

240
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,430
how to help Captain Ou and his men

241
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,830
get through this crisis.

242
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:12,940
Indeed.

243
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,510
The encrypted telegram
from the Guerrilla Unit says

244
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,770
that dozens of wounded guerrillas
can't move with the team,

245
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,340
especially the critically injured.

246
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,980
They urgently need surgery now,

247
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,510
but Zhongshan doesn't have
the necessary conditions.

248
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,840
They are asking if we in Macau

249
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,170
can think of a solution.

250
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,870
Dr. Ke,

251
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,750
aren't the operating rooms
at Kiang Wu Hospital

252
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,060
ready for use?

253
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,180
The surgical equipment is all in place,

254
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,460
but the application to open
the operating rooms

255
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,860
is still being held up
by the Health Bureau.

256
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,590
Why is it being held up
by the Health Bureau?

257
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,960
The Portuguese Macau government has long
discriminated against Chinese doctors.

258
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,820
The Health Bureau has regulations

259
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,530
that in Macau,

260
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,870
only certified

261
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,060
Portuguese surgeons

262
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,870
are qualified to perform surgeries.

263
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,820
Chinese doctors can't perform surgeries
without authorization.

264
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,480
We need approval from the Health Bureau,

265
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,840
which then reports to
the Executive Council.

266
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,930
In short, there are piles of procedures,

267
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,930
and approval won't come for months.

268
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,270
Those damn foreigners.

269
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,350
The situation is urgent now.

270
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,940
We don't have time to wait for them

271
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,740
to go through their procedures.

272
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,840
I'll go back immediately and mobilize

273
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,510
all medical staff

274
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,220
to jointly petition the Governor

275
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,300
for urgent special authorization to allow
Kiang Wu Hospital to perform surgery.

276
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,170
Once the surgical authorization is
approved,

277
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,250
Master Sanhe, I hope you

278
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,780
can transport the wounded
to Macau promptly.

279
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,060
You can count on me.

280
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,950
Water Ghost?

281
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,050
Water Ghost!

282
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,200
Mr. Liang.

283
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,520
Mr. Liang.

284
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,569
Weren't you supposed to
be watching the door?

285
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,020
Why are you sneaking around alone
in the warehouse?

286
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,569
Hey!

287
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,410
Are you secretly smoking opium again?

288
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:14,869
No.

289
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,400
Absolutely not, Mr. Liang.

290
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,700
I can barely afford food these days.

291
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,500
How would I have money for opium?

292
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,089
I was just a bit sleepy,

293
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,000
so I came in here to take a nap.

294
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,869
It'd better be.

295
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,280
If the Leader finds out

296
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,810
you've been secretly smoking opium again,

297
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,290
he'll skin you alive.

298
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,440
Go watch the door now.

299
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,280
Okay, okay.

300
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,380
Hey, wait.

301
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,990
Come here.

302
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,970
Water Ghost,

303
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,170
recently,

304
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,560
we haven't had any transport jobs.

305
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,350
Nobody's making money,

306
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,220
and you've always been a big spender.

307
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,650
Here.

308
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,500
Take the money.

309
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,760
But don't you dare use it for opium.

310
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,330
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

311
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,060
Don't worry.

312
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,960
I quit a long time ago.

313
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,870
Hurry up and watch the door.

314
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,330
I'll check the inventory.

315
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,610
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

316
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,140
Alright.

317
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,520
[Yayue Tea House]

318
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,810
Boss,

319
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,590
at black market prices,

320
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,720
one box of this is worth half a gold bar.

321
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,150
Three boxes should be enough
for three months' worth of opium, right?

322
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,350
-Yes.
-Then hurry up.

323
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,260
Get going.

324
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,080
What's the rush?

325
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,250
Well.

326
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,000
It's penicillin.

327
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,240
American-made.

328
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,110
Military grade too.

329
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,940
Water Ghost.

330
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,810
You're quite something.

331
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,150
Tell me.

332
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,520
Where did you get

333
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,370
such good stuff?

334
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,560
Such a massive amount of tungsten ore

335
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,000
is hidden in Zhongshan?

336
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,300
But knowing that doesn't help us.

337
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,090
Only the top leaders

338
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,730
of the Tai Ho Brotherhood know
the location of the goods.

339
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,670
How are we supposed to
find it in such a large county?

340
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,020
We can't find the tungsten ore
in Zhongshan,

341
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,970
but the diesel fuel that Rodrigues
was going to use for the exchange

342
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,280
is still in Macau, isn't it?

343
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,070
But now all their supply lines
have been shut down,

344
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,800
so Rodrigues's diesel

345
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,570
won't be moved either.

346
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,960
That's why we need

347
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,440
you, Mr. Consul, to step in

348
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,980
and force them to move it.

349
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,090
Our Macau government has just received

350
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,390
an urgent diplomatic note

351
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,930
from Yasumitsu Fukae.

352
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,110
Due to the recent increase
in smuggling here,

353
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,280
the Japanese authorities

354
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,520
have stated that they will

355
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,070
launch

356
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,350
a joint anti-smuggling operation here
immediately.

357
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,960
What does that have to do with the diesel
I'm asking for?

358
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,810
Consul Reeve,

359
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,480
you should know

360
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,310
that Japan has

361
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,070
joint anti-smuggling authority
throughout Macau.

362
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,440
According to their requirements,

363
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,170
during the inspection period,

364
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,740
all commercial maritime transport
must be suspended here.

365
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,890
All businesses must

366
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,780
declare their entire inventory
within three days.

367
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,180
After that,

368
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,900
the Joint Anti-Smuggling Team will conduct

369
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,770
a thorough inspection throughout the city.

370
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,040
Any undeclared goods discovered

371
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,260
will be deemed contraband.

372
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,330
The Joint Anti-Smuggling Team
has the authority to seize the goods

373
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,520
and immediately arrest all personnel

374
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
involved on site.

375
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,240
Now that the Japanese
have surrounded Zhongshan,

376
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,570
we cannot transport

377
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,940
this diesel out at all
under such a tight blockade.

378
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,020
If we don't declare it

379
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,570
and it's discovered during inspection,

380
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,200
with the Macau government involved,

381
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,780
this will become a serious problem.

382
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,890
What I mean is,

383
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,020
we can only

384
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,440
completely abandon this batch of diesel.

385
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,970
We can arrange
other sources of diesel later.

386
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,540
Your Excellency the Governor,

387
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,930
are you joking?

388
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,350
Hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops
are attacking Hunan,

389
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,150
Guangxi, and northern Guangdong.

390
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,680
This diesel is meant to supply

391
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,150
British military service units

392
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,070
and American observation units
across those regions.

393
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,730
Our units are now in Shaoguan,

394
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,930
Guilin,

395
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,170
and Huizhou.

396
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,590
This diesel is intended for
their emergency evacuation.

397
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,040
If we abandon this batch of diesel,

398
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,670
and as a result, our Allied Forces'

399
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,440
service units and observation units

400
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,430
aren't able to evacuate in time,

401
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,090
who among you
can take responsibility for that?

402
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,370
But isn't there simply
no other option right now?

403
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,440
Who would have thought

404
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,390
that the Japanese would exploit
the shutdown of Macau's transport routes

405
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,650
to suddenly conduct an inspection on us?

406
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,670
Consul Reeve,

407
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,460
this time we must ask you

408
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,280
to understand
the Macau government's predicament.

409
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,330
Governor,

410
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,110
I cannot understand at all!

411
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,040
You may fear the Japanese at present,

412
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,610
but please don't forget

413
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,540
that on both the European
and Pacific fronts,

414
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,670
our British and American Allied Forces
are continuously achieving victories.

415
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,150
The outcome of this war
has already been determined.

416
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,000
And both Macau and Portugal

417
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,590
should be well aware of

418
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,890
how the situation in the Far East
will unfold in the near future.

419
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,430
When that time comes,

420
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,410
Britain and America
will never forgive those

421
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,670
who undermined us behind our backs.

422
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,250
In short,

423
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,200
the Governor has already promised
Consul Reeve

424
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,200
that this batch of diesel
must be shipped out immediately.

425
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,610
But during the inspection period,

426
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,650
aren't all merchant vessels
prohibited from leaving port?

427
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,670
We're planning

428
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,570
to use the Steamship Sai On.

429
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,690
You should know

430
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,240
that Macau's daily supply
has always depended on Guangdong.

431
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,520
During the inspection
and port closure period,

432
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,980
the government needs to
send ships to Zhongshan

433
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,110
to purchase essential supplies.

434
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,200
That is perfectly reasonable, isn't it?

435
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,800
And we've already confirmed

436
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,650
that as long as

437
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,350
a leading figure
from Macau's business community

438
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,850
acts as guarantor for the ship rental,

439
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,830
the Japanese Naval Defense Department

440
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,500
will allow the government to handle

441
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,090
special transit permits
for official vessels.

442
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,180
So you want to use

443
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,070
the Steamship Sai On,

444
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,410
under the pretext of purchasing supplies,

445
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,210
to smuggle that batch of diesel?

446
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,280
There's no other way.

447
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,070
I'll act as the ship rental guarantor.

448
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,220
The GEB will apply to the Japanese
for the transit permit.

449
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,980
Xian, all we need you to do

450
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,440
is activate the transport line
to Zhongshan

451
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,960
and notify Huang Sanhe
to receive the goods on time.

452
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,310
We can also bring back

453
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,090
the tungsten ore urgently needed
by the Allied Forces.

454
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,700
This plan kills two birds with one stone.

455
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,510
No.

456
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,010
This is far too risky.

457
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,130
The leader of the Portuguese merchants is
shipping the cargo,

458
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,780
and the GEB is
applying for the transit permit.

459
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,260
If anything goes wrong

460
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,720
and the Japanese find out,

461
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,260
it would mean the Portuguese merchants
and the government

462
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,990
are jointly transporting
strategic materials.

463
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,500
Mr. He, aren't you overthinking this?

464
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,150
Precisely because the government
cannot smuggle,

465
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,520
even if the Japanese
are extremely suspicious,

466
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,980
they wouldn't suspect
the Steamship Sai On.

467
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,980
The deadline for inventory declarations
is today.

468
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,930
This diesel must be transported out,

469
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,330
whether we like it or not.

470
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,260
Let's put aside
the diesel transportation matter for now.

471
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,650
I'd like to ask first:

472
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,020
the application for surgical authorization
at Kiang Wu Hospital

473
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,890
was submitted several days ago.

474
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,130
Why hasn't it been

475
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,440
approved yet?

476
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,680
What?

477
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,180
A simple surgical authorization,

478
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,830
and it still hasn't been approved?

479
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,170
It's because the Governor has been

480
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,960
overwhelmed by that batch of diesel

481
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,490
and simply hasn't had time.

482
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,810
Once the diesel matter is resolved,

483
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,780
all other matters

484
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,670
will be handled promptly.

485
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,520
I understand.

486
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,820
Since you insist on transporting it,

487
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,630
I have one condition.

488
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,330
Why would He Xian

489
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,700
volunteer to be the guarantor
for the Steamship Sai On?

490
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:03,760
His reasoning is that it's too risky

491
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,580
if only Portuguese merchants
and the government are involved.

492
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,000
If something goes wrong,
it would be catastrophic for Macau.

493
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,610
He's the chairman
of the Banking Association

494
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,090
and also a representative figure
of Macau's business community.

495
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,460
If he acts as the guarantor,
once something goes wrong,

496
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,630
the government can shift responsibility
to him personally.

497
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,780
In that case, I'll approve

498
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,150
his request for Kiang Wu Hospital's
surgical authorization.

499
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,240
No, Your Excellency,

500
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,590
you absolutely cannot approve
that surgical authorization now.

501
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,420
Why not?

502
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,650
Your Excellency,

503
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,430
why is He Xian

504
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,370
so eager to open Kiang Wu Hospital's
operating rooms?

505
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,240
It's just to treat
Ou Xin's wounded guerrillas.

506
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:41,110
Once you sign the special approval,

507
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,590
large numbers of
wounded Communist guerrillas

508
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,030
will be sent to Macau for surgery.

509
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,960
What if the Japanese find out about this?

510
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,390
Macau would still be accused of
violating neutrality

511
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,370
and secretly aiding
the resistance against Japan.

512
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,510
Then how do we explain this to He Xian?

513
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,720
There's only one way—stall.

514
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,980
The Health Bureau
already has clear regulations:

515
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,570
only Portuguese doctors are qualified to
perform surgeries.

516
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,650
We can simply say
that Kiang Wu Hospital isn't ready yet

517
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:09,030
and stall
until the diesel shipment is dispatched.

518
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,090
But how can we face He Xian if we do this?

519
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,520
Between an individual and the government,

520
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,390
Your Excellency,

521
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,350
the choice is very clear.

522
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,890
Hello?

523
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,540
Oh, Dr. Ke.

524
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,890
I was just about to go to the government
to process the ship charter guarantee.

525
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,620
How are things at the hospital?

526
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,680
What?

527
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,040
Rejected?

528
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:45,910
Yes.

529
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,540
We've already received the official reply
from the Health Bureau.

530
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,130
They said that Chinese doctors in Macau
are not qualified to perform surgeries

531
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,330
and rejected the hospital's application
for surgical authorization.

532
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,630
How could they do that?

533
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,810
Aren't they going back on their word?

534
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,940
Everyone at the hospital is
extremely upset now.

535
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,020
All the doctors want to resign in protest.

536
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,750
I can't hold them back on my own.

537
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,090
I've already notified Wanqi to come
as soon as possible as the representative

538
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,720
of the Kiang Wu Charitable Association
and try to calm everyone.

539
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,390
Alright.

540
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,190
I understand.

541
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,520
I'm going to the Government House now.

542
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,450
Wait for my news.

543
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,860
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

544
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,330
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

545

an atrocity at Shimen Jiubao, Zhongshan!

546
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,980
Forty-one villagers were buried alive!

00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,670

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,110
An atrocity at Shimen Jiubao!

555
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,870
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

556
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,330
Kid, I'd like a copy.

557
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,630
Ming.

558
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,780
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

559
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,580
Newspaper! Get your newspaper!

560
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,870
Guys, hurry up!

561
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,460
Mr. Liang.

562
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,720
Hey, Young Master Huang.

563
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,090
I've already marked the meeting points

564
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,150
on the map.

565
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,130
From now on,

566
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,670
all crew members are forbidden
to leave the ship without permission.

567
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,310
Our men helping to load cargo

568
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,110
also cannot act on their own,

569
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,460
to prevent any leaks.

570
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,570
Don't worry.

571
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,430
I'll only hand the map to the captain
after the ship passes

572
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,230
the Japanese checkpoint
on the Xi River tomorrow.

573
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,130
Good. I'll leave things
in your hands then.

574
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:34,660
Alright.

575
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,670
Everyone, hurry up!

576
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,280
Your obstruction and self-preservation

577
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,810
are why the wounded are stranded
at Black Hill

578
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,280
without medical treatment.

579
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,240
And that's why those innocent villagers,

580
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,890
who risked their lives
to protect the wounded,

581
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,290
were brutally murdered.

582
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,910
Forty-one people.

583
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,950
Forty-one Chinese lives!

584
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,660
Mr. He.

585
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,610
The Japanese have gone to such extremes.

586
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,540
That is truly something

587
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,190
we never imagined.

588
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,290
But the tragedy,

589
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,850
after all, was caused by the Japanese.

590
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,800
But then again,

591
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,090
Ou Xin and his band of guerrillas

592
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,720
will eventually be wiped out
by the Japanese.

593
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,380
For Macau's sake,
the government has no choice.

594
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,000
Since the Chinese will lose
to the Japanese anyway,

595
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,150
helping the Guerrilla Unit even

596
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,000
a little bit isn't worth it.

597
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,390
But transporting diesel
for the British and Americans,

598
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,240
no matter how risky, is worth it.

599
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,100
That's your logic,

600
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:36,940
isn't it?

601
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,460
Mr. He, I understand you're angry,

602
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,420
but this is reality.

603
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,330
Macau can't afford to offend Japan now,

604
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,200
and in the future,

605
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,830
we certainly can't afford to offend
the British and Americans either.

606
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,500
Do you know why?

607
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,460
It's all because Macau is weak.

608
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,600
We can only accept all this.

609
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,520
Mr. He,

610
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,840
I have some advice for you.

611
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,420
The course of the global war

612
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,890
is already very clear.

613
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,330
The victory of
the British and American Allied Forces

614
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,610
is just a matter of time.

615
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,570
You're a businessman.

616
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,930
Surely you understand better than we do

617
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,650
the principle of
seeking profit and avoiding harm.

618
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,460
Regarding the Guerrilla Unit,
we can only endure for now.

619
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,630
This isn't just for Macau,

620
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,560
but also a necessary way
for you to protect yourself.

621
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,810
And helping transport this shipment
of diesel for Britain and America

622
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,150
is laying the groundwork for the future.

623
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,870
When the Japanese are driven away

624
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,910
and Britain and America return,

625
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,170
who will remember

626
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,230
that small guerrilla unit
eliminated by the Japanese?

627
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,350
The British and Americans

628
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,940
will only remember that you were the one

629
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,910
who helped them

630
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,500
at the critical moment.

631
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,560
Mr. He.

632
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,890
The diesel is being loaded.
All that's left is your signature.

633
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,820
As for other people and matters...

634
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,910
please don't invite trouble.

635
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,040
Please.

636
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,960
I'm sorry.

637
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,180
Putting profit before principles

638
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,110
is something I, He Xian,
never learned growing up

639
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,840
and will never do in the future.

640
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,830
I will not sign

641
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,220
this guarantee.

642
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,630
And I will not participate

643
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,510
in this SS Sai On Plan either.

644
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:23,910
Moreover,

645
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,040
not just this time—

646
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,500
from this point on, we Chinese merchants

647
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,430
will no longer

648
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,670
cooperate with your government
in any of its affairs.

649
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,760
Let me give you a piece of advice too.

650
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,700
If you only see profit

651
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,090
and ignore righteousness,

652
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,150
you'll eventually reap what you sow.

653
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,930
Xian.

654
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,500
Xian.

655
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:48,470
How did it go with the government?

656
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:51,730
President He.

657
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,000
Did the government refuse to
change its decision?

658
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,700
If that's the case,

659
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,460
all of us in the medical department

660
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,920
have a difficult request.

661
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,610
We hope you understand.

662
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,810
If you all want to resign collectively

663
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,040
as a form of protest,

664
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,810
as the acting President of the Board
of the Kiang Wu Charitable Association,

665
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:18,600
I, He Xian,

666
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,180
will be the first to sign.

667
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,280
Xian, what are you doing?

668
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,720
Xian.

669
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,120
Let's talk about this...

670
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,630
See for yourselves.

671
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,080
We personally promised He Xian

672
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,220
the surgical authorization
for Kiang Wu Hospital.

673
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,870
Why go back on your word?

674
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:08,350
Exactly. He Xian just called both of us.

675
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,750
He's backing out of
the Steamship Sai On plan

676
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,710
and told us to withdraw quickly too.

677
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:13,850
What should we do now?

678
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,250
If He Xian backs out, we still have you.

679
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,870
As long as you act as the guarantor,

680
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,000
the SS Sai On Plan can proceed
as normal, right?

681
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,690
But He Xian repeatedly warned us

682
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:25,710
that having only us Portuguese handle this

683
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,350
is too risky.

684
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,620
Don't listen to his alarmist talk.

685
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,100
The SS Sai On is a government vessel.

686
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,330
With proper transit permits,

687
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,540
who would be suspicious?

688
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,190
Besides, from the beginning of loading,

689
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,730
I've specifically deployed
additional police forces

690
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,100
throughout the entire pier
to strengthen security.

691
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,060
There's no way
the information could leak out.

692
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,300
Mr. Rodrigues,

693
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,440
this shipment of diesel is
under your name after all,

694
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,770
and the declaration deadline
has already passed.

695
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,120
If we don't ship it now,

696
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,870
once the Japanese discover it,

697
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,480
you'll be the one charged with smuggling.

698
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,659
But...

699
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,889
There are no "buts."

700
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,390
The cargo is already loaded on the ship.

701
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,730
We're just waiting for the paperwork.

702
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,790
What are you still hesitating about?

703
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,930
Put some muscle into it!

704
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,530
Water Ghost?

705
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,330
-Water Ghost, are you alright?
-Mr. Liang!

706
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,590
-Quick!
-Water Ghost.

707
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,800
Are you alright?

708
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,860
My hand slipped,

709
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,100
so I bumped into something.

710
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,810
Are you badly injured?

711
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,390
Do you need to see a doctor?

712
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,790
It's nothing, Mr. Liang.

713
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,290
Didn't Master Huang say

714
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,750
that today,

715
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,610
none of us can leave here?

716
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,160
Quick,

717
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,890
get up first.

718
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,930
I can bear it.

719
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,540
I can still continue working,

720
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,100
Mr. Liang.

721
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,100
Let me take a look.

722
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,690
He probably injured the bone.

723
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,700
Well then.

724
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,090
I'll send someone

725
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,530
to take you to a doctor.

726
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,170
No need, Mr. Liang.

727
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,850
I can't let the others

728
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,010
break the rules because of me.

729
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,260
Alright.

730
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,910
That's good too.

731
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,840
Take this money

732
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,060
with you.

733
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:08,960
Mr. Liang,

734
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,730
I can't take your money again.

735
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,380
What's mine is yours.

736
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,140
Fei,

737
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,100
help him off the ship.

738
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,980
O-Okay.

739
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,390
Mr. Liang,

740
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,460
thank you.

741
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,080
Get up quickly.

742
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,160
Come on, let's go.

743
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,560
Everyone, back to work.

744
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,280
So it's confirmed then?

745
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,040
Lok Pak went to the consulate

746
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,000
to apply for the transit permit.

747
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,700
The departure time

748
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,580
is tomorrow at 5 AM sharp.

749
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,580
Good.

750
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:41,350
Do you think we should notify the Navy now

751
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,430
to set up an ambush

752
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,850
and catch them red-handed?

753
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,430
No.

754
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,770
I have connections with the Navy.

755
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,590
I'll contact them.

756
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,980
You're a diplomat—

757
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,560
better to act like you know nothing.

758
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,160
Leave it to me.

759
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,210
I understand.

760
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,310
Then I'll leave the rest to you.

761
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,750
Are you ready?

762
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,310
-All ready.
-Yes.

763
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,600
According to the action plan,

764
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,270
each team, depart separately.

765
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,400
At 10 o'clock sharp,

766
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:14,870
we'll act on time.

767
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,960
-Yes!
-Yes!

768
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,000
Xian, I know you're angry right now,

769
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,690
but acting impulsively
won't solve anything.

770
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:24,250
When facing the bandit-like Japanese,

771
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,290
the Portuguese Macau government's
weakness and timidity

772
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,440
are nothing new.

773
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,230
It's in their nature.

774
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,910
We're frustrated
by their lack of resistance,

775
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,180
but we can't just let our anger

776
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,120
make us break ties

777
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,040
or turn against them.

778
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,930
That would only make the situation worse.

779
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,730
Dr. Ke,

780
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,460
things have already come to this point.

781
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,990
What situation
do you still want to maintain?

782
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,510
Because...

783
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,330
our biggest enemy

784
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,950
is the Japanese.

785
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,190
Dr. Ke,

786
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,080
normally, I can accept

787
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,230
whatever you say,

788
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,480
but just this once,

789
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,330
I can't swallow it.

790
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,940
Wanqi,

791
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,790
Xian is a man guided by his emotions.

792
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,910
He can't control his temper right now.

793
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,730
Don't just stand there.

794
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,310
Talk some sense into him.

795
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:12,910
Dr. Ke,

796
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,020
I can't swallow it this time either.

797
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,500
I have only one thing
to say to those Portuguese:

798
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,960
let's go our separate ways

799
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,020
and make a clean break from now on.

800
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,590
Then, Xian,

801
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,210
regarding the SS Sai On Plan,

802
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,340
will the government risk continuing?

803
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,990
I've already withdrawn

804
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,080
and notified Rodrigues and Lok Pak.

805
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,140
How could they possibly continue?

806
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,880
But did you follow up later?

807
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,900
I've also told you.

808
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,270
I didn't even sign.

809
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,370
What can they do?

810
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,290
Xian.

811
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:13,560
Wanqi.

812
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,890
Whether you can accept this or not,

813
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,070
I still need to say something.

814
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,580
No matter how great the indignation,

815
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,020
it must be met
with even greater restraint.

816
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,850
Because compared to the bigger picture,

817
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:27,600
our personal feelings

818
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,530
are too insignificant to mention.

819
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,960
I know both of you are people
who understand priorities,

820
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,360
can reason,
and put the greater good first.

821
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,100
Think carefully

822
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,160
about what to do next.

823
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,080
Buddy, have you eaten yet?

824
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,000
This is for you.

825
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,910
No, no, no.

826
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,210
Take it, take it.

827
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,440
Take a break.

828
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,010
Let's take a break.

829
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:34,410
[Duty Room]

830
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:34,940
Okay.

831
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,480
[Duty Room]

832
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:09,940
Mr. Liang!

833
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,560
Mr. Liang!

834
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:12,890
Mr. Liang!

835
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:13,920
Water Ghost,

836
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:15,560
what's going on with you?

837
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,640
Why are you back again?

838
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,020
Mr. Liang, this is bad!

839
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,290
I had just left the clinic

840
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,480
when I ran into Huang Gongjie

841
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,370
and saw him heading this way with his men!

842
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,830
So I came back to warn you!

843
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:25,750
Huang Gongjie?

844
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:26,970
Where are they now?

845
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,170
They'll be here any minute!

846
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,520
I'll keep watch here!

847
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,020
Go quickly and alert the Portuguese police
and the crew on the ship!

848
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,810
Hurry!

849
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,420
[No Entry Without Permission]

850
00:41:58,770 --> 00:41:59,550
What's that?

851
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,710
Come on! Quickly!

852
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,270
Try harder!

853
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,270
Let's go.
