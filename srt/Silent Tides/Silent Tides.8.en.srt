I am the British Consul to Macau, Reeves.

The situation is roughly as follows:

111
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,390
After receiving the consulate's report,

112
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,920
the British government tried every means
to contact the Communists,

113

114
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,450

through the Chongqing office

116
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,190
Although the Communists
did not acknowledge

117

the existence of a Communist underground
organization in Macau,

118
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,090

to seek medical treatment
and purchase medicine from you, Mr. Ke.

120
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,740
I believe the underlying meaning
of this response

121
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,450
is that they have agreed for me

I really can't.

189
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,730
It's not for you.

190
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,080
Zai has been discharged.

191
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,610
He needs proper nutrition.

192
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,790
Come on, just take it.

193
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,920
You can pay me back later if you insist.

194
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,290
Thank you.

195
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,550
Have you heard the news?

196
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,220
The Hong Kong-Macau Chamber of Commerce
New Year's Eve gathering?

197
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,650
Yes.

198
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,390
You understand better than anyone

199
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,340
how difficult things
are in Macau right now.

200
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:34,940
As it happens,

201
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,880
many businesspeople from Hong Kong
have fled to Macau.

202
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,860
The General Chamber of Commerce
is organizing this gathering

203
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,830
to unite the business communities
of Hong Kong and Macau,

204
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,630
pool our efforts,

205
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,960
and overcome these tough times together.

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,810
Mr. He,

207
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,610
with your abilities, you should attend.

208
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,420
In my current state,

209
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,370
what good would my presence do?

210
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,510
Going would still be a way
to show your support for Macau.

211
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,470
Besides,

212
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,210
Besides, Wanqi is one of
the organizers of this gathering—

213
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,740
seeing you there would
surely make him happy.

214
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,320
[Nanhua Medical Club]

215
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,440
Brother, be careful.

216
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,520
Walk slowly.

217
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,090
Okay.

218
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,760
Miss Qiao,

219
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:37,770
have you heard any news
about your brother yet?

220
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,150
I don't have the means

221
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,010
to get news from Hong Kong either.

222
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,300
The only thing I can do now is

223
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,540
to buy a copy
of The Hong Kong Island Daily every day

224
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,600
to see if there's any news about
captured individuals.

225
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,660
Your brother was a manager at HSBC

226
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,610
and a well-known public figure.

227
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,490
If anything major happened,

228
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,660
it would definitely be
reported in the papers.

229
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,690
On the flip side,

230
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,990
the lack of news

231
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,310
might actually be proof
that the situation is stable.

232
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,520
Are you cold?

233
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,180
He just got discharged—

234
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:13,910
don't stay out too long.

235
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,300
You should head back soon.

236
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,110
Go.

237
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,440
If I

238
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,880
hear any news about Yu and her daughter,

239
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,440
I'll come find you at the Flower-Stern Ferry
as soon as possible.

240
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,310
Thank you for your trouble, Miss Qiao.

241
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,260
Not at all.

242
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,280
They saved my life too.

243
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,920
If

244
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,570
you hear any news about them first,

245
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,970
please send word to me
at Bachongtian Club.

246
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,440
Bachongtian Club?

247
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,300
I applied for a job at Bachongtian Club.

248
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,630
They needed a musician.

249
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,900
In these times,
we all have to find a way to survive,

250
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,660
don't we?

251
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,240
It's good to rely on your own skills

252
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,490
to make a living

253
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,410
and stand on your own feet.

254
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,800
Thankfully, we didn't
let you pawn off this suit—

255
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,280
otherwise, you wouldn't have
anything decent

256
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,010
to wear for today's gathering.

257
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,460
What's wrong?

258
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,330
Are you still worried about

259
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,380
meeting your old colleagues

260
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,240
from the Finance Street tonight?

261
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,160
Isn't Mr. Ma also going?

262
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,300
As long as he explains things to everyone,

263
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,300
those misunderstandings
should clear up naturally.

264
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,140
Dr. Ke mentioned

265
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,140
that batch of goods
hasn't been fully dealt with yet—

266
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,070
Mr. Ma might not be
in a position to explain right now.

267
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,040
Don't worry.

268
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,970
I've made it through this long already,

269
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,770
and I can handle a few
more harsh words from others.

270
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,680
With everyone from the Hong Kong
and Macau business circles

271
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,760
gathering together tonight,

272
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,110
it should at least make it easier

273
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,840
to look for job opportunities.

274
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,710
We still have

275
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,560
a bit of the money

276
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,380
Dr. Ke lent us left.

277
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,640
Tonight, I'll make a couple of dishes

278
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
and prepare a New Year's Eve dinner.

279
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,380
We'll wait for you to come home

280
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,300
so our family can celebrate together.

281
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,880
Okay.

282
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,040
Daddy,

283
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,610
we'll wait for you to come back
and spend New Year's together.

284
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,160
Yes.

285
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:07,760
Hello.

286
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,290
Hello. Please sign in here.

287
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,830
The gathering will start in an hour.

288
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,660
This is now free networking time,

289
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,970
a chance for friends
from various business circles

290
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,690
in Hong Kong and Macau
to get to know each other.

291
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,300
Got it.

292
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,520
Hey,

293
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,730
isn't this the big boss

294
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,900
He Xian?

295
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,380
Mr. Lyu, is he your friend?

296
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,060
Oh,

297
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,090
I wouldn't dare say so.

298
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,800
Us small fries

299
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,350
aren't worthy of
being friends with Mr. He.

300
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,470
A man like him can even

301
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,850
swindle the entire
Hong Kong Finance Street—

302
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,970
all his own peers—to profit
from the nation's suffering.

303
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,850
That's a skill

304
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,970
I could never learn, even if I tried.

305
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,520
Hey, he's the banker who exploited the war

306
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,140
with the Japanese
to cheat his own colleagues.

307
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,700
Who else could it be?

308
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,600
We didn't realize it

309
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,380
until Macau reopened

310
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,910
and we saw him
buddying up with Huang Gongjie—

311
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,470
turns out he's been in bed
with the traitors all along.

312
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,520
Huang Gongjie? You mean...

313
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,260
Yes,

314
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,190
that very traitor

315
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,400
who hoarded all the grain in Zhongshan.

316
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,680
Macau's current plight

317
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,440
is entirely thanks to
that damned collaborator.

318
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,590
Alright, everyone,

319
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,760
I think

320
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,490
the purpose of today'
Hong Kong-Macau gathering

321
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,760
is to overcome this crisis together

322
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,960
and solve the famine.

323
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,380
But what I don't understand is:

324
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,190
why should an accomplice of the traitor

325
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,550
who created this famine

326
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,590
be allowed to mix in here?

327
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,720
What do you all think

328
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,310
we should do about it?

329
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,310
What should we do?

330
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:42,850
Get out!

331
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,190
Yes, make him get out!

332
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,020
Yes, get out!

333
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,540
Get out!

334
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,690
Get out!

335
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,580
Get out!

336
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,310
Get out!

337
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,340
Get out!

338
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,590
Get out!

339
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,380
Who was it?

340
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,210
Who's talking such foul nonsense
right here in public?

341
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,190
The voice is loud,

342
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,540
and the words stink. Who was it?

343
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,040
Go on, keep talking,

344
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,070
keep hurling insults.

345
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,200
Hey, Captain Huang,

346
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,450
don't misunderstand.

347
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,110
We just ran into a few peers

348
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,660
and were chatting, that's all.

349
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,490
Xian,

350
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,020
just point out who insulted you just now.

351
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,640
I, Huang Gongjie, will stand up for you.

352
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,090
Ah.

353
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,280
Hey, Captain Huang,

354
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,590
weren't you saying

355
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,090
you wanted to find a good buyer
for that batch of grain?

356
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,690
I was just discussing it with some peers,

357
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,880
and we've just made some progress.

358
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,020
With such a big deal,

359
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,370
it's inevitable that some might
feel jealous and complain a little.

360
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,900
Please don't take it too seriously.

361
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,990
So there's progress

362
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:29,950
on that business deal?

363
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,570
Yes.

364
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,610
Why don't we move to another place

365
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,640
where I can brief you in detail?

366
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,760
Fine.

367
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,640
Let's go to my place.

368
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,400
Let's go.

369
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,350
Great!

370
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,440
Traitorous scum!

371
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,830
Everyone, remember this:

372
00:16:58,830 --> 00:16:59,880

00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,710
Captain Huang.

561
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,730
You're the head of a family, right?

562
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,150
Elders above and children below, right?

563
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,750
If not for yourself,

564
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,060
at least think about your family.

565
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,580
I've already said all the nice things
that I can.

566
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,290
I'm tired of talking.

567
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,270
After you drink this cup of tea,

568
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,740
our deal would be set.

569
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,840
Chief.

570
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,100
Mr. He, how about this.

571
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,420
Go wait for me in the ballroom downstairs.

572
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,680
We'll talk more later.

573
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,340
Rong,

574
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,490
take Mr. He to the ballroom downstairs.

575
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:44,210
Put it on my tab,

576
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,640
alright?

577
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,140
Okay.

578
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:02,920
Mommy.

579
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,180
Mommy.

580
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,300
Mommy!

581
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:07,950
Wake up!

582
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,790
Mommy!

583
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,420
Mommy!

584
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,580
Mommy.

585
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,760
Little girl.

586
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,020
What's the use of crying here?

587
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,030
Hurry and find some food.

588
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,960
Your mother might still have a chance.

589
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,390
Mommy, wait for me.

590
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,950
I'll go find food right now.

591
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,200
Sit here.

592
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,170
Maybe you should tell Captain Huang that

593
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,370
I'm going back first.

594
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,230
He'll look for you later.

595
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,480
Stay put. Don't go anywhere.

596
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,900
Ladies and gentlemen,

597
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,790
hello.

598
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,420
I am pleased to announce

599
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,100
that the famed violinist,
Miss Qiao Yinwan,

600
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,290
has officially joined Bachongtian Club

601
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,190
as our lead musician.

602
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,740
Let's give a warm round of applause

603
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,670
to welcome her first performance!

604
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,640
You!

605
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,210
Play The Warship March for me.

606
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,840
Liven up

607
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,420
this banquet!

608
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,160
You, lead musician.

609
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,450
Captain Inoshita orders you

610
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,780
to play The Warship March.

611
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,660
I don't know that song.

612
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:54,920
What?

613
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,170
Switch to

614
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,670
Song of the Etajima Boys then.

615
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,470
Hurry and play!

616
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,680
Switch to

617
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,680
Song of the Etajima Boys then.

618
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,030
Start playing!

619
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,900
I don't know any Japanese songs.

620
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,540
Captain Inoshita!

621
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,160
Captain Inoshita.

622
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,900
Captain Inoshita!

623
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,890
Captain Inoshita!

624
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:18,620
Don't be angry.

625
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,480
Don't be angry.

626
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,610
Miss Qiao

627
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,180
doesn't have the sheet music

628
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:22,680
and she also

629
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,740
hasn't rehearsed.

630
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,190
Indeed, she doesn't really know

631
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,620
these Japanese songs.

632
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,750
Please understand.

633
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,600
You don't know Japanese songs?

634
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,360
Then you must know Chinese songs, right?

635
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,600
If you don't know Japanese songs,

636
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,620
surely you know Chinese ones?

637
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,590
So play one of your Chinese songs.

638
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,990
Celebrating the Japanese Army's Return.

639
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,940
Play this one.

640
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,950
Celebrating the Japanese Army's Return.

641
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,690
Alright.

642
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,010
When Will the Gentleman Return?

643
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,170
No!

644
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,930
Celebrating the Japanese Army's Return.

645
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,450
A song celebrating our Imperial Army

646
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:03,140
returning to occupy Shanghai.

647
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,280
Not only must you play it,

648
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,710
everyone here must sing along!

649
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,900
Celebrating the Japanese Army!

650
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,920
Celebrating the Japanese Army?

651
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,650
Understood?

652
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,270
It's about the same.

653
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:21,730
Miss Qiao.

654
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,130
Given the situation,

655
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,130
perhaps you could compromise.

656
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:31,900
Miss Qiao!

657
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,420
Hey, hey!

658
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,580
-Where are you going?
-Captain Inoshita!

659
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,340
Come back right now!

660
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,010
Miss Qiao isn't feeling well.

661
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,610
I'll go check on her.

662
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,360
Please rest first.

663
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,340
Manager, arrange another program.

664
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:43,750
Okay.

665
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,480
I'll arrange another program!

666
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,050
Got it.

667
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,880
Keep watching them.

668
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,490
We found it.

669
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,720
The corpse truck
did indeed leave from

670
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,410
Kiang Wu Hospital.

671
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,100
However...

672
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,480
However what?

673
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,780
Usually mortuary staff
transport the bodies.

674
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,530
A chief doctor transporting the body

675
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,590
is unprecedented.

676
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,710
I heard that

677
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,050
Dr. Ke Lin volunteered to do it.

678
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,710
Tell Yamaguchi and Fearless Biao

679
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,820
to meet at the cemetery.

680
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:31,920
Why are you being like this?

681
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,530
It's just a song.

682
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,640
You call that a song?

683
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,990
Miss Qiao.

684
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,260
I know you're upset.

685
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,880
I know the Japanese go too far.

686
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,920
But when you're living under
someone else's roof,

687
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,840
sometimes you have to bow your head.

688
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,970
You know how vicious

689
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,250
the Japanese are.

690
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,420
So sometimes,

691
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,680
we don't need to clash with them

692
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,540
over small matters and defy them.

693
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,490
We'll only suffer for it.

694
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,790
I'm sorry, Dr. Lok Pak.

695
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,220
I can't be as diplomatic as you.

696
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,030
And I certainly will not

697
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,450
applaud or sing praises

698
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,140
to a bunch of bandits

699
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,450
who invade our land and kill our people.

700
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,710
If a job demands I flatter the devil,

701
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,190
then I'm sorry,

702
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,270
I quit right now.

703
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:17,490
[East Asia Hotel]

704
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,210
Yinwan!

705
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,120
But please don't forget, Dr. Lok Pak.

706
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,520
Beneath your Portuguese citizenship,

707
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,220
you also have Chinese blood
flowing in your veins.

708
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,160
Hello?

709
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,420
Your Excellency the Governor.

710
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,620
Has it been verified?

711
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,140
It has been verified.

712
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,680
Good.

713
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,440
I'll notify everyone immediately

714
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,640
to meet at your place.

715
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,380
Don't push me.

716
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,250
My mother is starving!

717
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,230
Don't push me!

718
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,230
She won't last-

719
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,290
Give me some space!

720
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,640
She has almost nothing to eat,

721
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,230
she's starving to death!

722
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,190
Give me some!

723
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,250
She's dying!

724
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,840
Save my mother!

725
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,800
She's starving to death!

726
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,710
Yu?

727
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,580
Ms. Qiao!

728
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,470
Yu!

729
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:38,660
Where did you go?

730
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,820
Everyone's looking for you.

731
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,400
My mother is starving to death!

732
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,660
Please save my mother!

733
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,010
It's you!

734
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,080
Go play the violin!

735
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,730
Get lost!

736
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,730
Damn it!

737
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,270
Stop right there, you bastard!

738
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,040
Stop!

739
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,380
Yu, let's go.

740
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,230
Take me to your mom.

741
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,199
What are you doing?

742
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,070
Go back and play your violin.

743
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,860
Let me go!

744
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,090
Yu, go find your mom first.

745
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,320
Are you looking down on me?

746
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,239
Go, Yu!

747
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,440
Don't worry about me.

748
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,320
You're an

749
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,900
anti-Japanese!

750
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,150
Very bad person!

751
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,810
Captain! Captain!

752
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:39,199
Bastard!

753
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,330
Stop!

754
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,380
What are you doing?

755
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,719
What? Let go!

756
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,969
If you don't let go,

757
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:46,850
I'll shoot.

758
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,710
What are you guys doing?

759
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,620
Colonel Sawa.

760
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,510
Look at this.

761
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:56,350
This is Portuguese-ruled Macau.

762
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,800
Is the Japanese Navy

763
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,280
going to openly attack me,

764
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,610
the Economic Director?

765
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,170
Put your gun down.

766
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,020
Yes, sir.

767
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,170
What is going on?

768
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,110
These two Chinese people dared to attack

769
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,170
Captain Inoshita.

770
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,220
They must be severely punished.

771
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,840
Captain Inoshita.

772
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,380
Captain Inoshita!

773
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,800
Captain.

774
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,670
Quick, call a doctor.

775
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,780
Hurry!

776
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:47,320
Let's sing!

777
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,110
Colonel Sawa.

778
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,070
Let's drink.

779
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,320
Let's drink together.

780
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,940
Help the Captain back to rest.

781
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,990
Have another drink!

782
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,690
Let me go!

783
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,820
Did you see these two people

784
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,310
hit Captain Inoshita?

785
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,610
Captain Inoshita

786
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,360
was chasing after this woman
from the band.

787
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,740
When I came downstairs,

788
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,320
Captain Inoshita was lying on the ground

789
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,900
and these two were standing here.

790
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,700
If not them, then who?

791
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,940
Miss Qiao

792
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,910
is just a defenseless woman.

793
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,070
How could she possibly hit anyone,

794
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,050
let alone injure a Japanese Navy captain?

795
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,660
Colonel Sawa.

796
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,470
You saw how drunk Captain Inoshita was,

797
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,740
didn't you?

798
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,820
He accidentally fell and hurt himself.

799
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,300
How can you blame others?

800
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,280
Chief.

801
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,970
I specially invited Mr. He

802
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:59,400
to the Special Operations Team
to discuss business.

803
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,530
He's also my friend.

804
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,630
I don't think he would

805
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,630
hit someone from the Imperial Army.

806
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,110
Did Captain Inoshita

807
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,630
fall on his own?

808
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,700
I'm sorry,

809
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,510
we didn't see.

810
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,150
I suppose so.

811
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,110
Nonsense!

812
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,550
Colonel Sawa.

813
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,570
I specially invited Miss Qiao

814
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,570
to be the lead musician.

815
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,320
If you want to pursue this matter further,

816
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,840
then come after me.

817
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,280
Captain Inoshita

818
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,720
accidentally fell while drunk.

819
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,630
It was purely an accident.

820
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,860
You two

821
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,650
may leave now.

822
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:19,650
Mr. He,

823
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,860
we have other matters to attend to today.

824
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,790
We'll discuss our business later.

825
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:28,830
Let's go.

826
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,110
Mr. Lok Pak.

827
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,340
You're heading to the Government House
for a meeting?

828
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,050
Don’t let me hold you up.

829
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,300
Remember.

830
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,490
The Imperial Army is waiting for you

831
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,650
to make a wise decision.

832
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,170
Goodbye.

833
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:06,760
[Hong Kong–Macau Business Community
New Year’s Eve Gathering]

834
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,630
Everyone.

835
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,340
Dear colleagues from
the Hong Kong-Macau Chamber of Commerce,

836
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,170
we sincerely apologize.

837
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,130
Chairman Gao of
the General Chamber of Commerce

838
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,950
and everyone on duty
have received an urgent notice

839
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,590
and have just left for
an important meeting at Government House.

840
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,050
Therefore, today's

841
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,800
gathering has to be postponed.

842
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,510
Please wait patiently for further notice.

843
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,110
Thank you.

844
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,340
Miss Qiao.

845
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,430
Did Yu mention where her mother was?

846
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,580
I was in such a hurry earlier

847
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,340
that I didn't get a chance to ask.

848
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,540
What should we do now?

849
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,250
Where should we look for them?

850
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,340
Excuse me, may I ask

851
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,720
if you've seen a 13 or 14-year-old girl

852
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,880
crying and running with something?

853
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,800
Hello.

854
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,720
Did you see a little girl,

855
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,650
about this tall?

856
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,670
Mommy, Mommy!

857
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,170
Mommy! Mommy!

858
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,840
Mommy!

859
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,450
Wake up, Mommy!

860
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,810
Mommy!

861
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:26,010
Mommy!

862
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,670
Wake up, Mommy!

863
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,220
Xiao Yu.
Xiao Yu.

864
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,450
Yu?

865
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:50,880
Yu!

866
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:52,340
Yu!

867
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,840
Xiao Yu.
Xiao Yu.

868
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,090
Xiao Yu.
Xiao Yu.

869
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,090
Yu!

870
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:05,090
Yinwan.

871
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,580
Yu's shoe.

872
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,900
It's her shoe.

873
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,570
Xiao Yu.
Xiao Yu.

874
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,950
Yu!

875
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,990
Are you looking for

876
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,720
that Boat Dweller girl called Yu?

877
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,380
Yes.

878
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,910
Have you seen her?

879
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,720
About this tall, wearing blue clothes,

880
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,800
with her mother?

881
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
No need to look anymore.

882
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,760
They've been taken away.

883
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,800
Taken away?

884
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:25,860
What do you mean?

885
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,720
The two of them have been
sleeping outside our door

886
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,010
for several days now.

887
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,530
She just passed away

888
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,010
and the Tongshan Hall's corpse truck
took her away.

889
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:34,920
Passed away?

890
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,440
Yes.

891
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:37,360
How is that possible?

892
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,710
Why not?

893
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,590
When that girl arrived
and saw her mother was dead,

894
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,840
she couldn't catch her breath

895
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,220
and collapsed on the spot.

896
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,220
The Tongshan Hall corpse truck
happened to pass by

897
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,260
and took them both away.

898
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,340
Are you sure she's dead?

899
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,200
She was still able to run just now.

900
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,590
Look at these streets.

901
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,050
Children like her

902
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,180
are taken away by the dozens every day.

903
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,380
Who has the time to check carefully?

904
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,090
Even if she still had a breath left,

905
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,570
by the time they haul her to the cemetery,

906
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:06,380
she'll certainly dead.

907
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,120
That's not true.

908
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,900
She must still be alive.

909
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,520
Yu must still be alive.

910
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,650
Where did the corpse truck
take the bodies?

911
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,650
Taipa.

912
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,720
The new government cemetery.

913
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,260
Let's go.

914
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,150
Report.

915
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:28,990
I asked the cemetery staff.

916
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:31,790
The Kiang Wu Hospital corpse truck
never arrived.

917
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,200
It should take only an hour
from the hospital.

918
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,720
That truck hasn't arrived in two hours.

919
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,820
Seems like that truck
is really suspicious.

920
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,720
Should we immediately
search for and arrest

921
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,180
that doctor called Ke Lin?

922
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,630
Are you Dr. Ke Lin?

923
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,950
I am. May I ask what this is about?
