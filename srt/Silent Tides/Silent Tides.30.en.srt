00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,780
[Silent Tides]

2
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,979
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,180
Xian.

4
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,280
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

5
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,020
If Asahina wakes up,

6
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,330
I'll find a way to send you a message:

7
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,090
"Fortune favors the good."

8
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,320
But if the message I receive is

9
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,140
"We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it,"

10
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,210
then it means
Asahina really can't wake up.

11
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,700
If that's the case,

12
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,630
we'll need to work together,

13
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,430
just as you said—

14
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,650
using the body

15
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,200
to draw the real enemy out of hiding.

16
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:15,730
Yes.

17
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,940
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

18
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,710
Qiwen,

19
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,310
I understand.

20
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,740
Everything will be fine.

21
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,329
Colonel Sawa.

22
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,810
Let's put my family matters aside for now.

23
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,230
You don't need to worry about it.

24
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,430
I'll continue to wait

25
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,280
until Consul Imai

26
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,520
comes to meet me.

27
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,730
Okay.

28
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,730
Very well.

29
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,560
Then...

30
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,350
let's just keep waiting.

31
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,240
Colonel Sawa,

32
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,010
didn't you say you knew He Xian inside out

33
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,940
and could definitely make him confess?

34
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,470
It's been so long! What's the progress?

35
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,530
He Xian

36
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,450
is indeed not easy to deal with.

37
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,490
Please give me more time.

38
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,700
I'll definitely find another way.

39
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,130
General Matsui

40
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,320
has already called twice,
pressing for results!

41
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,540
I can wait, but the Command can't!

42
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,130
I'll ask you one thing:

43
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,360
can you handle this He Xian or not?

44
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,480
Two hours.

45
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,170
Please give me two more hours!

46
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,030
I will...

47
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,200
I will definitely crack him!

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,230
No. One hour!

49
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,390
Not a minute more!

50
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,230
If there's still no progress,

51
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,620
then I'll negotiate with him myself!

52
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,950
Understood.

53
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,740
Damn it!

54
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,520
This He Xian...

55
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,360
Chief,

56
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,490
why don't we just
lay our cards on the table?

57
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,130
After all, his father and son

58
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,380
are in our hands.

59
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,810
If we really put guns

60
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,280
to his father's and son's heads,

61
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
I'd like to see how he can stay tough!

62
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,600
Where exactly are they being held?

63
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,550
At my Yayue Tea House,

64
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,890
on Rua da Felicidade.

65
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,020
Yayue Tea House, Rua da Felicidade.

66
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,540
Can you bring them here?

67
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,580
We can't.

68
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,320
The Portuguese police have that place
completely surrounded.

69
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,470
We can only call

70
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,630
and let him hear

71
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,380
the voices of his father and son
over the phone.

72
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,190
No.

73
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,550
Phone calls alone aren't enough
to make a threat stick.

74
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,990
Besides, the phones here

75
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,650
may already be tapped
by the Portuguese police.

76
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,840
We can't use this move
unless absolutely necessary.

77
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,870
If the call goes on too long,

78
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,080
the Portuguese police might trace the call

79
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,210
and track us down.

80
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,280
T-Then what should we do now?

81
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,630
What are you doing, you wretched woman?

82
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,690
I want to see the police.

83
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,140
I want to see the police!

84
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,770
I want to see the police!

85
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,080
What else do you want?

86
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,250
What do I want?

87
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,580
What do you want?

88
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,960
I want to see the police!

89
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
Miss Qiao.

90
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,950
I must say

91
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,960
we caught you at just the right time.

92
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,850
Do you want to meet someone?

93
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,720
I don't want to see anyone.

94
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,710
I want to see the police.

95
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,520
I want to see the police!

96
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,780
What if the person you're going to see...

97
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,720
is Xian?

98
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,080
Where is he?

99
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,500
What a coincidence.

100
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,240
He's just upstairs.

101
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,170
Surprised?

102
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,380
I bet

103
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,780
he's...

104
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,810
eager to see you too.

105
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,430
I have one request.

106
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,010
Before seeing Xian,

107
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,930
let me freshen up.

108
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,640
By using a woman,

109
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,190
we can make He Xian admit
he's the murderer?

110
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,340
This woman is no ordinary person.

111
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,630
She's not only
a key anti-Japanese operative

112
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:32,750
but also a spy He Xian sent to
Special Operations Team headquarters.

113
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,280
In the past, she caused

114
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,950
significant losses to our Imperial Army.

115
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,520
And she has an intimate relationship
with He Xian.

116
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,900
He Xian's weakness

117
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,370
is his need to portray himself as a man
of loyalty and righteousness.

118
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,670
Using Qiao Yinwan against He Xian

119
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,270
hits the mark perfectly.

120
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,250
No matter what, I just want to remind you,

121
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,820
Colonel Sawa...

122
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,310
this is your last chance.

123
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,720
Please rest assured.

124
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,840
This time...

125
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,450
I'll succeed without fail.

126
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,580
Mr. He.

127
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,950
My apologies.

128
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,000
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

129
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,820
Where is Consul Imai?

130
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,600
It's already afternoon,

131
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,200
and he still hasn't woken up?

132
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,710
He has, he has.

133
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,180
He's finally up.

134
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,690
However,

135
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,950
before you see Consul Imai,

136
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,390
there's someone here

137
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,650
I think you might

138
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,830
want to meet first.

139
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,180
Bring her in.

140
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,200
Yinwan?

141
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,530
-Sawa Eisaku...
-He Xian!

142
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,030
What exactly do you want?

143
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,440
Well, that depends on

144
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,770
what you're going to do, Mr. He.

145
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,050
As long as Consul Imai and I

146
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,630
can complete our mission,

147
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,740
there's no need

148
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,190
to continue deploying forces
to blockade Macau.

149
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,350
Everyone will be happy,

150
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,550
and peace will

151
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,960
return to the world.

152
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,050
And why must we

153
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,560
give Miss Qiao, a mere woman,
such a hard time?

154
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,580
Sawa Eisaku.

155
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,150
Give me some time.

156
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,220
I'll help you persuade him.

157
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,310
Begin.

158
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,340
Xian.

159
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,450
Yinwan.

160
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,860
I'll go find Sawa Eisaku.

161
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,170
All of this is aimed at me.

162
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,390
No matter what,

163
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,460
I cannot let you suffer any harm.

164
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,680
How important you are to Macau...

165
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,350
and how much responsibility you carry—

166
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,600
I think you

167
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,550
understand that better than I do.

168
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,410
Colonel Sawa,

169
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,620
didn't you say you'd use this woman

170
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,150
to force He Xian to confess?

171
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,320
Now the woman keeps

172
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,450
telling He Xian not to worry about her.

173
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,330
Isn't that counterproductive?

174
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,170
Mr. Imai,

175
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,820
please rest assured.

176
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,370
I knew all along that Qiao Yinwan would
try to persuade He Xian like that.

177
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,290
But the more she does that,

178
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,930
the more guilty He Xian will feel,

179
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,620
making him more likely to confess.

180
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,860
Let's wait and see.

181
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,200
Xian.

182
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,600
Do you remember

183
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,410
what you said to me

184
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,790
after my brother died?

185
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,970
Only great love

186
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,900
can accomplish a greater cause.

187
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,080
Each of us may have

188
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,500
attachments and weaknesses in our hearts.

189
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,920
Xian.

190
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,980
What you are facing

191
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,420
is the most vicious

192
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,580
and cruel enemy in the world—

193
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,950
the darkest of the dark,
the blackest darkness.

194
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,190
You might have to face

195
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,790
bonds forged in heartbreak.

196
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,960
I want you to remember this:

197
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,690
"Only with a selfless heart

198
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,540
can one be invincible."

199
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,670
Only with a selfless heart

200
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,900
can I be invincible?

201
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,780
This woman is really something.

202
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,720
But even if she keeps persuading him
like that,

203
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,770
He Xian won't really disregard
the bigger picture, will he?

204
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,080
Let's wait a bit longer.

205
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,410
When she really tries to
take her own life,

206
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,410
He Xian...

207
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,270
will definitely crack.

208
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,910
It feels like forever
since we last had a proper conversation.

209
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,670
While we still have time,

210
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,530
let me play a piece for you.

211
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,840
Still that one, "Auld Lang Syne."

212
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,560
All right?

213
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,570
How was it?

214
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,730
That was lovely.

215
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,060
I also want to be like my brother—

216
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,329
to do my part for Macau

217
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,869
and for our country.

218
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,420
[Yayue Tea House, Rua da Felicidade]

219
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,110
[Yayue Tea House, Rua da Felicidade]

220
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,590
Yinwan!

221
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,930
Yinwan...

222
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,470
Yinwan!

223
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,780
Mr. Imai...

224
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,270
This is...

225
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,610
an accident.

226
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,170
Please believe me.

227
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,600
I'll definitely find another way

228
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,870
to get He Xian to confess!

229
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,690
Enough!

230
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,390
You've made promise after promise,
guarantee after guarantee,

231
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,400
but have you delivered even once?

232
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,190
And now look what happened.

233
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,270
Your trump card didn't just fail—

234
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,430
she killed herself.

235
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,160
It almost caused a firefight
between our forces!

236
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,900
And you still want me to trust you?

237
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,610
What, do I have to die too

238
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,280
before you're satisfied?

239
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,610
Mr. Imai...

240
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,390
-Mr. Imai, I did all this for...
-Say no more!

241
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,060
I'm the plenipotentiary appointed
by the Imperial government

242
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,590
and the Command
to handle the Macau Incident!

243
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,740
I'm now taking over

244
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,960
all matters related to this incident!

245
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,850
I'll immediately hold formal talks
with He Xian,

246
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,870
Macau's negotiating representative!

247
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:19,480
Mr. Imai!

248
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,390
Let go of me!

249
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,260
You wait here!

250
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
You must be Mr. He.

251
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,130
I am the plenipotentiary
for the Macau Incident

252
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,480
from the Empire of Japan,

253
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,540
the newly appointed Consul to Macau—

254
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,720
Imai Keiichi.

255
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,580
My apologies for keeping you waiting.

256
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,500
The unfortunate incident just now

257
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,700
was purely an accident.

258
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,030
I personally had no prior knowledge of it.

259
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,490
If it has caused you any distress,

260
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,580
please accept my apologies.

261
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,110
Mr. He,

262
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,830
shall we begin the negotiations now?

263
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,110
Mr. He?

264
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,220
"Only with a selfless heart

265
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,980
can one be invincible."

266
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,330
Consul Imai,

267
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,480
I am He Xian,
the negotiation representative

268
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,220
from Macau.

269
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,330
Please.

270
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,890
Since Consul Fukue Yasumitsu

271
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,280
was assassinated,

272
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,200
the Macau authorities have treated
the matter with the utmost importance.

273
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,000
We have already deployed
sufficient police forces

274
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,300
and are fully committed to
the investigation,

275
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,110
striving to solve the case
as soon as possible.

276
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,570
However, in just two days,

277
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,110
the situation
has continuously deteriorated,

278
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,740
and conflicts have escalated.

279
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,850
Yet you, as Japan's
plenipotentiary representative,

280
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,760
have, up to this point,

281
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,300
had no direct contact whatsoever

282
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,960
with the Macau government.

283
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,350
Instead, you've been staying in
this East Asia Hotel

284
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,200
and have been caught in
a dangerous armed confrontation

285
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,280
between our sides.

286
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,430
Does all this seem reasonable to you?

287
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,350
Or could it be that there are people
with ulterior motives behind this,

288
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,650
deliberately planning,

289
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,720
stirring up trouble,

290
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,740
and even using you

291
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,240
as a hostage or a tool

292
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,800
to escalate conflicts
and heighten tensions?

293
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,370
Nonsense!

294
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,410
Mr. Imai.

295
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,650
Please don't listen to his nonsense!

296
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,410
Consul Imai,

297
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,160
I am officially negotiating with you

298
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
on behalf of the Macau authorities.

299
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,240
If you still retain any basic respect

300
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,350
for this negotiation,

301
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,110
then don't allow irrelevant personnel
to interrupt at will

302
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,240
and interfere with our negotiations.

303
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,090
Colonel Sawa,

304
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,930
I'm the plenipotentiary representative.

305
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,410
Please mind your place.

306
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,720
Also, speak in Chinese

307
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,200
as a sign of respect for Mr. He.

308
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,650
I understand.

309
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,760
Mr. He, please continue.

310
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,200
In short,

311
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,890
Macau has consistently strived

312
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,020
for a peaceful resolution of disputes
in this conflict.

313
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,060
We have maintained

314
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,120
the utmost sincerity and restraint.

315
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,170
The Macau military and police forces
outside the East Asia Hotel

316
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,590
have encircled the area
without launching an attack

317
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,700
and haven't fired a single shot.

318
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,150
That alone is the best proof.

319
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,110
In light of this,

320
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,310
on behalf of the Macau government,

321
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,780
I solemnly request that your side

322
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,870
immediately lift

323
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,980
the unreasonable military blockade
of Macau,

324
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,910
de‑escalate the situation,

325
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,430
resolve disputes peacefully,

326
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:54,030
and severely punish those responsible for
the murder of Mr. Rodrigues and others.

327
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,110
As Japan's plenipotentiary representative,

328
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,200
I am deeply concerned about

329
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,430
the rapid deterioration

330
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,500
and escalation of conflicts

331
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,870
in the Macau Incident.

332
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,130
Given how far the situation has escalated,

333
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,650
now is not the time to

334
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,300
look into the reasons behind it

335
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,780
or assign blame to either side.

336
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,410
After all, if we trace the root cause,

337
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,170
the origin
of this Japanese-Portuguese conflict

338
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,910
still lies in the assassination
of Consul Fukue Yasumitsu.

339
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,190
Until the case is solved

340
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,760
and the perpetrators
are brought to justice,

341
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,170
the Japanese Imperial Army

342
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,800
cannot lift
the military blockade of Macau.

343
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,710
On this point,

344
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,290
I must ask for your understanding, Mr. He.

345
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,450
Consul Imai, what you just said

346
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,850
hits the nail on the head.

347
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,090
We in Macau

348
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,650
also cannot allow the Fukue case
to remain unresolved.

349
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,200
Mr. He, what do you mean?

350
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,520
The main purpose

351
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,960
of my coming here to negotiate

352
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,410
is to inform you

353
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,890
that after our relentless efforts,

354
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,870
the truth behind
Consul Fukue's assassination

355
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,590
is about to

356
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,560
come to light.

357
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,890
Wasn't it claimed that the Macau police

358
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,240
had no leads whatsoever?

359
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,850
That's because you've been deceived
all along

360
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,450
and never had any direct contact

361
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,040
with the Macau government or the police.

362
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,700
That's why we haven't had the chance

363
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,090
to inform you about the progress

364
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:02,960
of the case.

365
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,370
In fact,

366
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,540
the person who was personally involved

367
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,560
in the incident and is also a key witness,

368
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,910
Mr. Asahina Taiki,

369
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,790
has already regained consciousness

370
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,390
after treatment at the hospital.

371
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,690
Moreover, he has stated

372
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:19,490
that he possesses conclusive evidence
of the murderer's identity.

373
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,650
Is that so?

374
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,350
How is it that I

375
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,910
know nothing about such major news?

376
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,730
Impossible.

377
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,540
He's making this up out of thin air.

378
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:35,000
Stop talking nonsense!

379
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,870
Mr. Imai,

380
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,090
after the incident,

381
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,060
Yamaguchi never saw Asahina wake up.

382
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,060
Consul Imai,

383
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,360
this isn't Colonel Sawa's fault.

384
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,130
Because Major Yamaguchi
simply doesn't know.

385
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,020
Not just him—

386
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,390
even the Macau military police

387
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,260
guarding the hospital
have been kept in the dark.

388
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,410
Why is that?

389
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,290
And how did you know about it?

390
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,090
Because the Fukue case itself
is full of suspicious points.

391
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:02,000
Since the perpetrator's identity
remains a mystery

392
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,040
and he's still at large,

393
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,220
we in Macau

394
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,830
had to implement
the strictest confidentiality measures

395
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,240
to prevent the real culprit from
acting out of desperation

396
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,630
and attempting to silence him.

397
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,390
Therefore,

398
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,480
under Governor De Solaire's direct orders,

399
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,780
the medical team responsible for treatment

400
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,110
has maintained strict confidentiality

401
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,690
regarding Mr. Asahina Taiki's
actual condition.

402
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:20,890
They've announced publicly

403
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,280
that he never regained consciousness.

404
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,800
And apart from the medical staff,

405
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,980
Governor De Solaire,

406
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,380
Inspector General Gonçalves, and myself,

407
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,800
you

408
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,590
and these two gentlemen in this room

409
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,740
are the only ones who know

410
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,170
that Mr. Asahina Taiki

411
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,620
has already regained consciousness.

412
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,270
What did Asahina tell you?

413
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,100
Who exactly is the perpetrator?

414
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,050
Unfortunately,

415
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,860
aside from saying that he recognized

416
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,220
the killer when he first woke up—
before he had

417
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,010
fully regained consciousness—

418
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,780
he has refused to say anything else.

419
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,040
Why is that?

420
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,880
We also found this very strange.

421
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,520
The doctor even suggested that

422
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,480
if he didn't want to talk to the police,

423
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,280
he could talk to Major Yamaguchi

424
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,960
or other Japanese officials.

425
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,590
But he was extremely frightened

426
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,920
and adamantly refused.

427
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,830
Only when he learned

428
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,910
that you had arrived in Macau

429
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,590
did he say he would

430
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,960
tell the truth about the whole matter,

431
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,090
but only if he could meet you in person.

432
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,560
So you mean

433
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,890
I must go to the hospital
to see him myself?

434
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,460
Yes.

435
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,320
Mr. Imai, you absolutely cannot go.

436
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,680
Once you leave here,

437
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,590
your safety cannot be guaranteed.

438
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,790
The murder of Consul Fukue is a warning.

439
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,920
Don't fall into the killer's trap.

440
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,000
Now I finally understand,

441
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,150
Consul Imai,

442
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:31,170
why you've been staying in
this East Asia Hotel

443
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,930
and avoiding any direct contact

444
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,950
with the Macau government.

445
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,590
Consul Imai,

446
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,090
if the Macau authorities

447
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,050
truly intended to harm you,

448
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,040
would all those police troops outside—

449
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
all those machine guns, cannons,
and armored vehicles—

450
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,370
remain silent

451
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,970
for an entire day
without firing a single shot?

452
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:49,700
Mr. Imai,

453
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,560
that's just because they fear
the Imperial Army...

454
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,890
Mr. He,

455
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,590
please continue.

456
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,950
When I came here,

457
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,720
Governor De Solaire personally asked me
to tell you

458
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,220
that he's been waiting outside
the hotel for you.

459
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,910
If you decide to visit the hospital,

460
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,600
he will be
personally accompanying you throughout.

461
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,200
Wouldn't that reassure you?

462
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,590
Mr. He, I've decided.

463
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,120
I'll go to the hospital now.

464
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,200
Consul Imai, please.

465
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,370
Wait!

466
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,970
Mr. Imai, please wait a moment.

467
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,370
Leaving here will put you at risk.

468
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:32,880
Therefore,

469
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,600
please allow me to arrange

470
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,550
personal security for you.

471
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,380
Then I'll trouble you with that,
Colonel Sawa.

472
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,070
Also,

473
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,920
the Portuguese Governor

474
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,840
will accompany you personally.

475
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,470
So,

476
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,620
Mr. He should remain here.

477
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,550
This

478
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,060
seems more prudent.

479
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,940
Mr. He, are you willing to stay behind?

480
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,400
Very well.

481
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,090
I'll stay at the hotel

482
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,490
and wait for the case to be clarified.

As a doctor,

496
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,630
how could you bring your own lunch

497
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,000
into the intensive care ward?

498
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,740

00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,850
I'm sorry, Dr. Ke.

I'm really sorry.

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,220

[Ward 2]

510
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,590
Are you sure

511
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,040
that was a liquid diet for the patient?

512
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,640
It looked and tasted like it.

513
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,810
In any case,

514
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,670
it definitely wouldn't be
a doctor's lunch.

515
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,670
My guess is they quietly brought it in,

516
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:51,420
fed it to him,

517
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,370
and carelessly forgot to
hide the container.

00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,630
when the hospital claimed

520
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:01,860
that Asahina
hadn't regained consciousness,

521
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,500
they were deliberately covering it up?

522
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,730
I can't be certain about that.

523
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,350
They're guarding him too tightly.

524
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,190
This is the only slip-up
I managed to spot.

525
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:14,950
I understand.

00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,240

533
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,080
isn't that sending me straight into

What if Asahina hasn't woken up at all?

538
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,410
He's just setting a trap

when he spoke to us!

545
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,330
If Asahina hadn't woken up,

546
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,220
wouldn't the lie

547
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,630
have been exposed
the moment Imai went there?

would tell such a big lie?

00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,350
This way, please.

565
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:57,200
[Ward 2]

566
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,330
[Washroom]

567
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,680
Consul Imai,

568
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:07,890
I'm

569
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,150
Yamaguchi Hisami,

570
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,520
Deputy Chief
of the Sawa Agency.

571
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,130
I've been stationed at the hospital

572
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,660
to protect Secretary Asahina's safety.

573
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:16,680
Consul Imai,

574
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,880
this is Mr. Asahina's attending physician,

575
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,410
Director of the Medical Department
at Kiang Wu Hospital—

576
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,950
Dr. Ke Lin.

577
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,970
Doctor, may I ask

578
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,720
how Mr. Asahina is doing?

579
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,020
Can we ask him some questions?

580
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,740
The patient is recovering well.

581
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,670
His condition is stable now.

582
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,980
But you'll need to wait a bit
before questioning him.

583
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,700
Why?

584
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,190
Here's the situation:

585
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,610
besides the gunshot wound,

586
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,480
the patient also suffered severe shock
and psychological trauma.

587
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,590
Since regaining consciousness,

588
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,350
he has been extremely frightened.

589
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,950
He keeps saying, "It's them;

590
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,670
they're trying to kill me,"
and things like that.

591
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,850
He hasn't been able to
rest properly at all.

592
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,200
To help him recover quickly,

593
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,150
we've added some

594
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,780
sedatives to his food

595
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,090
so that he can sleep peacefully.

596
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,690
Just now, after we received notice
that you, the Governor of Macau

597
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,950
and the Japanese Consul, would be coming
to ask him questions,

598
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:59,890
I administered some medication

599
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,260
to help him

600
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,720
wake up.

601
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,610
But it takes 20 minutes for the medication

602
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,470
to take effect.

603
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,400
After that, you can question him.

604
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,540
I see.

605
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,380
How about this—

606
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,980
before the patient wakes up,

607
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,840
why don't you all wait in my office?

608
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,480
I can also give you
a detailed explanation about

609
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,250
the patient's injuries

610
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,650
and treatment progress.

611
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,159
Consul Imai,

612
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,159
what do you think?

613
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:23,790
Alright.

614
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,159
Let's wait in the office then.

615
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:26,750
Okay.

616
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,739
This way, please.

617
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:31,929
[Duty Room]

618
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,630
You all, remain here.

619
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,790
Major Yamaguchi,

620
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,080
we still need to protect Consul Imai.

621
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,210
I'll be responsible

622
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,870
for protecting Consul Imai.

623
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,080
There are too many people coming
and going in this ward area.

624
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,710
What if

625
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,000
something happens to Consul Imai
when he comes back later?

626
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,800
Don't forget,

627
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,850
the culprit who killed Consul Fukue
is still at large.

628
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,480
Officer Ferdinand.

629
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,420
Please

630
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,440
take them

631
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,600
and immediately inspect

632
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,210
all rooms in this area

633
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,250
to eliminate any potential security risks.

634
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,480
But our assignment is to guard the ward.

635
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,440
Consul Fukue

636
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:17,270
was just killed in Macau.

637
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,850
If anything happens to
Consul Imai as well,

638
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,850
can you take responsibility for that?

639
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,980
Start immediately.

640
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,410
No choice then.

641
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,450
You take upstairs,

642
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,850
and I'll take this floor.

643
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,750
Dr. Ke,

644
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,020
please brief us on

645
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,980
Mr. Asahina's specific injuries

646
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,580
and the course of treatment.

647
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,260
[Ward 2]

648
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,320
The specific situation is...

649
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,260
Asahina Taiki was severely injured

650
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,820
and remains in critical condition.

651
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,730
In fact,

652
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,700
he hasn't even woken up yet.

653
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:28,430
What?

654
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,970
How dare you make such a joke?

655
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,370
How dare you tell such an enormous lie?

656
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,390
Governor De Solaire,

657
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,950
is this how you treat me,

658
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,350
the plenipotentiary representative
of the Empire of Japan?

659
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,550
Consul Imai,

660
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,290
no need to waste words with them.

661
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:51,930
Let's go.

662
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,710
Hold on.

663
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,070
Consul Imai.

664
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,600
What was your purpose
for coming to the hospital?

665
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,730
Wasn't it to find out who killed Fukue?

666
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,950
But Asahina hasn't woken up at all.

667
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,790
Who am I supposed to ask?

668
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,190
Asahina hasn't woken up.

669
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,160
But he's still telling us
who the killer is right now.

670
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:50,850
Fearless Biao.

671
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,830
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!

672
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,700
It's a mistake!

673
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,570
It was Sawa...

674
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,050
Yamaguchi, what are you doing?

675
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,010
I'm sorry,

676
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,830
Consul Imai.

677
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:13,170
Seeing that Fearless Biao
was the real culprit...

678
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,510
Out of righteous indignation,

679
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,810
I instinctively fired.

680
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:25,290
It was also to protect your safety.

681
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,380
What have you done?

682
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,480
And you still claim
it was a momentary impulse?

683
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,140
You clearly just wanted to
silence him forever!

Is this Mr. Imai?

699
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,620
Is everything going smoothly
at the hospital?

700
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,540
That's basically what happened
at the hospital.

701
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,360
Colonel Sawa,

702
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,270
as for the truth behind the Fukue case,

703
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,280
I don't think I need to say more.

704
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,150
You should know very well
what you've done.

705
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,370
Mr. Imai, please let me explain.

706
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:48,150
I never expected

707
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,140
that Fearless Biao was a traitor.

708
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,430
Colonel Sawa.

709
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,670
Save your act
for the Portuguese Macau government.

710
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,030
I'm calling just to inform you

711
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,450
that the investigation into the Fukue case

712
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,930
and the current critical situation
in Macau will be

713
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,460
reported to the Expeditionary Army Command
by General Matsui.

714
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,850
I advise you to face reality

715
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,350
and stop while you can,

716
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,870
before you're in too deep.

717

718
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:21,710
what happened?

719
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,680
Is it something at the hospital...

720
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,560
He Xian.

721
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,560
You want me to lose?

722
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,790
It won't be that easy.

723
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,320
It won't be that easy!

724
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,570
Call Wang Qiuzai and tell him
to get ready.

725
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,730
