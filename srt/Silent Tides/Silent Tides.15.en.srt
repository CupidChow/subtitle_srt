[Episode 15]

3
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,120
I can't guarantee

4
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,770
that I'll be able to borrow it,

5
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,100
but I'll definitely give it my all anyway.

6
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,400
As for Banco Nacional Ultramarino,

7
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,259
I'll find a way out.

8
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,039
We're short of time,

9
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,500
so I won't go into details.

10
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,080
But right now, my biggest concern is
neither of these.

11
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,390
After this morning's incident,

12
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,870
the Japanese must now suspect

13
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,229
that the HSBC treasurer

14
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,050
disclosed the secret

15
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,509
of the forcibly issued HKD
before his death.

16
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,920
The entire rubber business is a scam.

17
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,480
Unless the Japanese have their doubts
completely erased,

18
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,220
whatever trap we set this afternoon,

19
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,310
they're unlikely to fall for it easily.

20
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,639
So this is the key issue.

21
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,070
How about

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,420
I give it a try?

23
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,000

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
what's your plan?

25
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,540
If we want the Japanese to believe
that the treasurer didn't leak anything,

26
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,100
we must take the initiative
to give them an answer.

27
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,720
And only one person is suited

28
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,950
to give them this answer.

29
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,010
Who is it?

30
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,990
A person who should be kept far away
from this conflict

31
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,140
and kept safe

32

I called you here

56
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,399
In the past,

57
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,120
I, Ma Wanqi, would have given you my word

58
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,240
that your money

59
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,700
would be returned in full.

60

But this time,

61
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,920
I cannot make any guarantees.

62
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,120
Because once the plan fails,

63
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,190

will face total ruin,

64
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,460

the protagonist of this story,

71

but all the hardships he has endured

72
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,560

for the Japanese in Hong Kong,

77
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,010
but now he has specifically come to Macau

78
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,870
to continue covering up for them?

has a huge impact on the market.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,800
That's why the Japanese

82
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,720
are using your brother's identity

83
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,480
to deceive Macau's merchants and banks,

their control over HKD
in today's exchange.

86

and its citizens

88
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,310

suffering tremendous losses.

90

Didn't the treasurer

Why didn't you

94

tell the citizens of Macau directly?

because of my brother's lies,

102

Do you really want to know?

Even though I can't compensate
for everything,

116
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,050
at least I can reduce some of the losses.

117
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,380
Every little bit helps.

Since Banco Nacional Ultramarino
can't honor its commitment,

122

191
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,090
The so-called newly issued
Hong Kong dollars by HSBC

192
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,630
were actually stolen by the Japanese

193
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,070
from HSBC's vault.

194
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,550
There are no reserve funds at all.

195
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,090
They're equivalent to
a pile of waste paper.

196
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,270
And the news says

197
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,790
that the total for this batch of HKD
is only 10 million.

198
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,790
That is an out-and-out lie.

199
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,320
The actual amount issued far exceeds
what was reported in the news.

200
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,240
Moreover, the Japanese will choose a date

201
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,790
to invalidate all these Hong Kong dollars.

202
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,940
-They're all exposed. Oh, no.
-If you have Hong Kong dollars,
sell them off.

203
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,980
Now everything is ruined.

204
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,030
Is it true?

205
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,680
Who on earth is this person?

206
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,800
I don't know.

207
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,860
Isn't it Miss Qiao Yinwan?

208
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,860
You know her?

209
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,320
She's the sister of Qiao Renyu,

210
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,370
the Chief Accountant of HSBC.

211
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,910
Qiao Yinwan, a violinist.

212
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,390
Besides, these Hong Kong dollars

213
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,740
were issued by her brother.

214
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,510
What she says must be true.

215
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,410
Hurry and sell off
all your Hong Kong dollars, everyone.

216
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,260
Yes, hurry and sell off
your Hong Kong dollars.

217
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,520
Come and sell off your Hong Kong dollars.

218
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,710
Inform the traders.

219
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,110
Sell them off!
Sell all the Hong Kong dollars off!

220
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,510
Yes.

221
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,960
What did you say?

222
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,160
What's wrong?

223
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,310
The trader reported

224
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,080
that Banco Nacional Ultramarino

225
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,050
just withdrew all their sell orders

226
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,820
and started buying instead.

227
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,000
What?

228
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,870
Miss Qiao, I'm the Chairman
of Tai Fung Bank.

229
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,700
You just said the amount
of Hong Kong dollars issued is incorrect.

230
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,750
Then what is

231
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,890
the exact amount?

232
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,540
It's exactly 40 million.

233
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,750
Forty million?

234
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,740
That much?

235
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,530
You also said

236
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,140
that the Japanese want to invalidate HKD.

237
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,250
Then what will they use to replace it?

238
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,010
After the Japanese

239
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,740
sell all these Hong Kong dollars,

240
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,130
they'll force HSBC

241
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,100
to issue new Hong Kong dollars.

242
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,580
By then, all the old Hong Kong dollars

243
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,240
can only be exchanged at a discount
for new ones.

244
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,070
Hurry and sell off your Hong Kong dollars!

245
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,660
What nonsense is she talking about?

246
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,870
General Manager.

247
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,030
This woman claimed
to be revealing the truth,

248
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,870
but what she said about the amount
of Hong Kong dollars issued

249
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,140
and the follow-up measures
is completely wrong.

250
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,400
What she said

251
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,860
couldn't possibly come from
the HSBC treasurer.

252
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,860
It was totally fabricated.

253
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,090
Report!

254
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,560
What is it?

255
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,420
Our informant at Tai Fung Bank reported

256
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,370
that Huang Sanhe just escorted
Tai Ho Brotherhood's

257
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,370
cash reserves

258
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,960
into Tai Fung Bank.

259
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,370
Tai Ho Brotherhood?

260
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,480
It's the largest smuggling gang
in the area.

261
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,810
It's very powerful

262
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,760
and is also in cahoots
with those Chinese merchants.

263
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,030
How do you know

264
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,100
he was escorting
Tai Ho Brotherhood's cash reserves?

265
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,780
All the boxes have the characters
"Ho Yee" on them.

266
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,450
Those are the cash boxes
for the gang's savings.

267
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,950
Huang Sanhe brought
20 to 30 boxes this time.

268
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,980
It seems that he's betting
everything he has.

269
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,440
You mean
there are dozens of boxes of dollars?

270
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,480
Not just that.

271
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,740
Huang Sanhe also brought many gold bars.

272
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,470
Qiao Renyu's sister was spreading lies
in public.

273
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,620
What is the exact amount
of Hong Kong dollars issued?

274
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,170
It's exactly 40 million.

275
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,320
Hurry and sell off all your
Hong Kong dollars.

276
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,000
Yes, hurry and sell off
your Hong Kong dollars.

277
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,080
Banco Nacional Ultramarino
withdrew sell orders and started buying.

278
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,160
Tai Fung Bank also secretly transferred in
a large sum of money.

279
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,470
What are they up to?

280
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,450
You.

281
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,640
Why are you smiling?

282
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,900
Someone

283
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,770
claims to be a financial genius

284
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,920
who never loses,

285
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,450
yet he was thrown into disarray
by a classic case of crisis profiteering.

286
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,110
I never expected this.

287
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,630
Mr. Qiao,

288
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,550
what do you mean by 'crisis profiteering'?

289
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,940
What could I mean?

290
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,960
I'm just a spy, aren't I?

291
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,030
If I tell you,

292
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,710
you'll only think
I'm colluding with Chinese merchants.

293
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,240
Why would I ask for trouble?

294
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,610
I

295
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,760
misunderstood you before.

296
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,070
I sincerely apologize to you.

297
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,900
I hope you can speak candidly,
holding nothing back.

298
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,620
If I tell you,

299
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,270
won't you think

300
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,750
I'm setting a trap for you?

301
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,630
Qiao Renyu!

302
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,680
Don't forget

303
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,410
you're still a prisoner
of the Imperial Army.

304
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,860
Can't you still understand

305
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,330
the current situation?

306
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,810
With Specie Bank's backstop this morning,

307
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,790
the Chinese merchants
were completely overwhelmed.

308
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,860
So he could only stir up trouble

309
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,960
to make you doubt yourselves.

310
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,550
That's why Banco Nacional Ultramarino

311
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,600
suddenly sold off all their holdings?

312
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,920
With just one trick,

313
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,350
you've already stopped
defending the market.

314
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,840
Then they

315
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,910
used the HSBC treasurer's death in Macau

316
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,030
to release a so-called secret
from the treasurer,

317
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,510
which threw the market into panic

318
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,790
and caused HKD to plunge.

319
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,530
The only thing I didn't expect

320
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,720
was that they even used my sister.

321
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,530
They're indeed resourceful.

322
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,250
So

323
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,670
the HSBC treasurer

324
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,000
didn't disclose any secrets at all?

325
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,160
Your sister was simply bought
by the Chinese merchants,

326
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,040
using her special identity

327
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,200
to make up lies and create panic?

328
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,860
I know my sister.

329
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,740
She knows nothing about finance.

330
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,860
As for how they found her

331
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,890
and what lies they used to trick her,

332
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,270
that remains unclear to me.

333
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,670
But they've already achieved their goals.

334
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,830
HKD is plunging.

335
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,210
The market is in panic.

336
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,980
Specie Bank has stopped
defending the market.

337
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,910
And they,

338
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,700
if I'm not mistaken,

339
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,540
must be taking this chance

340
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,430
to snap up
all the retail investors' dollars

341
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,980
at low prices.

342
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:30,840
[HKD: 2.51]

343
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,520
[HKD: 2.41]

344
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,160
I want to buy 200,000 HKD.

345
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,430
I want to buy 300,000 HKD.

346
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,040
I want to buy 350,000 HKD.

347
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:37,560
Okay.

348
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,860
There are people
buying Hong Kong dollars here too.

349
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,040
Hello?

350
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,130
The Chinese merchants' agents are buying?

351
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,970
This is Ogata speaking.

352
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,000
Are you sure?

353
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,920
General Manager, I'm sure.

354
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,260
The agents arranged by
the Chinese merchants

355
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,030
[Specie Bank]

356
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,530
are all taking advantage of the HKD plunge

357
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,590
to secretly buy them
priced at 2.4 dollars.

358
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,500
Nice bit of crisis profiteering there.

359
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,170
They really put on a convincing show.

360
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,640
Ask all the traders

361
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,860
to defend the market immediately

362
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,970
and buy them all.

363
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,240
But the market is in panic now.

364
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,000
And our remaining funds

365
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,800
may not hold up
under such heavy selling pressure.

366
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,210
You just focus on defending the market.

367
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,880
I'll handle the panic.

368
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,090
Mr. Qiao.

369
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,320
Next,

370
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,540
we need you to help
calm the retail investors.

371
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,250
What else can I do?

372
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,280
The panic outside

373
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,800
was all caused by your sister
who used her special relationship

374
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,080
with you.

375
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,100
The trouble caused by the sister
of HSBC's Chief Accountant.

376
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:01,440
There's nothing more effective
at scotching rumors

377
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,270
than a personal rebuttal

378
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,500
from the Chief Accountant himself.

379
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,880
Honored colleagues
from the banking industry

380
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,319
and citizens of Macau,

381
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:18,710
I'm Ogata Yozo,
the General Manager of Specie Bank.

382
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,980
Just now,

383
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,910
we found that someone
with ulterior motives

384
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,480
was spreading rumors about HKD.

385
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,390
This is a deliberate act

386
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,820
to create panic among us

387
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,850
for profiteering.

388
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,270
Such actions,

389
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,520
in my opinion, have seriously disrupted

390
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,010
the financial stability in Macau.

391
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,240
Yinwan, let's go.

392
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,110
-Japanese Specie Bank...
-It's okay.

393
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,640
I want to see what he's up to.

394
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,190
He's just continuing to lie.

395
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,610
With us here, we won't let him succeed.

396
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,140
-Let's go.
-It's okay, Xian.

397
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,130
I want to see.

398
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,050
Only one person is qualified

399
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,490
to tell you the truth about HKD.

400
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,140
Now, let's welcome Mr. Qiao Renyu,

401
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,930
the Chief Accountant of HSBC,
to publicly clarify the facts

402
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,180
and reveal the truth about this matter.

403
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,650
Renyu.

404
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,000
Yinwan.

405
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,860
I'm Qiao Renyu,
the Chief Accountant of HSBC.

406
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,680
The total amount
of the newly issued Hong Kong dollars

407
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,800
is indeed 10 million dollars,

408
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,020
and it is backed by
sufficient reserve funds.

409
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,350
-There is absolutely no problem.
-Renyu!

410
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,680
Yinwan.

411
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,830
Mr. Qiao.

412
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,530
Furthermore,

413
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,820
the Japanese Imperial Army

414
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,260
hasn't interfered in any
normal operations of HSBC.

415
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,750
The rumor that HKD is being invalidated

416
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,830
is absolute nonsense.

417
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,010
You're lying!

418
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:48,660
Stop right there!

419
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,660
What are you doing?

420
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,350
Hands off!

421
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:50,860
Freeze!

422
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,350
Renyu, I don't know
what threat you're under,

423
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,420
but no matter what,

424
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,330
you cannot be complicit in it

425
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,940
by doing such unconscionable things
for the Japanese.

426
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,740
Please tell everyone the truth.

427
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,740
I'm begging you, Renyu.

428
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,420
Tell everyone the truth.

429
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,220
Please, I'm begging you, Renyu.

430
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,480
Tell everyone the truth.

431
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,550
Mr. Qiao.

432
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,960
Are you going to continue
allowing your sister

433
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,590
to spread rumors
and mislead the public here?

434
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,260
Renyu.

435
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,020
Yinwan.

436
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,950
I don't know what threat you're under

437
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,720
or what benefits you've received
from certain people,

438
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,010
but why are you here
slandering the Imperial Army

439
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,010
and smearing HSBC?

440
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,400
I can only tell everyone

441
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,470
that I'm the Chief Accountant of HSBC,

442
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,760
and only I

443
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,090
can speak on behalf of HSBC.

444
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,660
Compared to your lies,

445
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,900
what I say will undoubtedly
be believed as the truth.

446
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,810
You must trust the Japanese Imperial Army!

447
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,540
Trust HSBC!

448
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,740
Qiao Renyu.

449
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,310
From today on,

450
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,740
I, Qiao Yinwan, will no longer have you
as my brother

451
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,350
who serves as a lackey for the Japanese.

452
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,220
Qiao Renyu!

453
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,400
You traitor!

454
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,270
Qiao Renyu!

455
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,720
You traitor!

456
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:39,770
Qiao Renyu!

457
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,170
You traitor!

458
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,000
Mr. He,

459
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,250
I never expected you to use my sister

460
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,830
and then attack me.

461
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,770
What other schemes
do you Chinese merchants have?

462
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,230
Bring them all out.

463
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,010
I'm waiting.

464
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,510
Let's go.

465
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,460
What's going on?

466
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,610
Thank you.

467
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,400
Let Yinwan rest first.

468
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,680
Don't disturb her.

469
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,970
Later,

470
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,730
I'll explain it to her.

471
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,320
Now,

472
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,720
pull yourselves together.

473
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,650
We still have a tough battle ahead.

474
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,770
[Mingde]

475
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,540
[HKD: 3.02]

476
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,880
Apart from the retail market
where there are no big sell orders,

477
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,520
those Chinese merchants' agents
have all stopped buying.

478
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,510
General Manager,

479
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,310
should we increase our buy orders
and push the price up?

480
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,250
No.

481
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,030
Hold steady for now.

482
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,940
The Chinese merchants and BNU might still
make unexpected moves.

483
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,350
Observe the situation for now.

484
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:28,790
Yes.

485
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,400
Mr. Qiao.

486
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,320
Your sister must have been misled
by someone.

487
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,650
She got a little carried away
at that time.

488
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,140
You don't need to worry too much about it.

489
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,680
Once this battle is over,

490
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,350
you can give a more detailed explanation
to her.

491
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,700
By that time,

492
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,530
you and your sister will be reconciled.

493
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,580
I've done everything I can,

494
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,670
as you requested.

495
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,140
Mr. Ogata,

496
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,530
you can drop the act.

497
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,990
Mr. Qiao, don't quit now.

498
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,440
Although we've defended the market
for now,

499
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,770
there are still 2 or 3 hours
until the close.

500
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,830
Those Chinese merchants

501
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,220
won't just sit there
and wait to be defeated.

502
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,950
What moves might they have
up their sleeves next?

503
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,070
Mr. Qiao,

504
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,520
please foresee what they might do.

505
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,980
I'm hungry.

506
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,250
What?

507
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,140
I want an apple pie.

508
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,350
Hello?

509
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,830
Mr. Rodrigues.

510
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,600
HKD has climbed back to 3 dollars.

511
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,600
While Specie Bank is fully engaged
in defending the market,

512
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,450
should we consider
selling some of our holdings

513
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,610
to relieve our future pressure?

514
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,260
No.

515
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,010
We need to hold steady for now.

516
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:52,820
Don't sell them.

517
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,160
Putting all our hopes on one final move

518
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,520
is far too risky.

519
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,850
Mr. Qiao,

520
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,280
how is it?

521
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:29,020
Based on today's market data,

522
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,700
with the Chinese banks and
Banco Nacional ltramarino's transactions,

523
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,670
they should have about 40 million left.

524
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,140
That matches

525
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,540
my calculation exactly.

526
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,090
If you were in their position,

527
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,860
would there still be a way
to turn the tables?

528
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,970
According to the current situation,

529
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,440
it's virtually

530
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,770
impossible.

531
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,350
Virtually?

532
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,600
So there's still a slim chance?

533
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,940
There is no slim chance,

534
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,810
unless...

535
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,270
Unless what?

536
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,030
Let me put it this way.

537
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,660
Specie Bank has the upper hand now.

538
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:07,740
Its only weakness is

539
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,710
that, after the previous upheavals,

540
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,870
its market-support funds
have been severely depleted.

541
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,070
Their remaining funds can't withstand

542
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,470
another market crash.

543
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
That is to say,

544
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,220
they might capitalize
on our limited market-support funds

545
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,740
to launch a sudden attack?

546
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,680
Specie Bank's remaining funds

547
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,180
can only absorb

548
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,790
about less than 10 million
Hong Kong dollars.

549
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,750
If the opposition

550
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,890
suddenly sells off 7 or 8 million

551
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,200
—or even just 5 million—
Hong Kong dollars at once,

552
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,370
HKD will plunge immediately,

553
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,330
causing panic in the market again.

554
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,190
Once you buy them back
to defend the market then,

555
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,790
all retail investors will be
panic selling.

556
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,060
This market,

557
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,490
will you still be able to defend it then?

558
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,450
Oh, no.

559
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,380
If that happens,

560
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,750
all our efforts will be for nothing,

561
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,950
resulting in total loss
and irreversible consequences.

562
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,220
Mr. Qiao, based on your experience,

563
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,700
when are they most likely

564
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,190
to launch a sudden attack?

565
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,580
If it were me,

566
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,390
I would time it

567
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,740
for the last half an hour
before the close.

568
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,700
If it were too early,

569
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,810
I'd worry your market-support funds
wouldn't be sufficient.

570
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,550
If it were too late,

571
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,170
I'd worry there wouldn't be enough time
to buy your holdings.

572
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,170
Half an hour

573
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:19,620
is just right.

574
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,270
That makes sense.

575
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,050
Now I know what to do.

576
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,320
With Specie Bank's strength,

577
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:45,260
it still needs us to organize funds
to defend the market?

578
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,080
Not only Lyun Coeng

579
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,450
but also all other major
Japanese businesses in Macau

580
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,410
have received an urgent order

581
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,520
to mobilize immediately.

582
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,730
I'm entrusting this matter to you.

583
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,960
But I heard that HKD is
extremely volatile today.

584
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:03,600
If the market support fails,

585
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,830
won't we go down with Specie Bank?

586
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,330
You think I want to help Ogata
defend this market?

587
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,060
After all, he is backed
by the Expeditionary Army.

As for what to do when the time comes,

you'll have to play it by ear.

591
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,460
You mean...

592
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,920
Respect can be showed, but our interests
should also be considered.

593
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,720
If the situation turns unfavorable
and losses are inevitable,

594
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,520
you need to observe carefully
and make judgments.

595
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,100
Lyun Coeng is also owned
by the Expeditionary Army.

596

Why should we sacrifice ourselves?

00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,030
Don't recognize, accept,

739
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,760
or use this batch of
invalid forcibly issued HKD.

740
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:54,660
Xian,

741
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,990
what's going on?

742
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,830
Is what they said on the radio true?

743
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,070
Why is it different

744
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,310
from what you told me?

745
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,380
Yinwan,

746
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:08,949
I'm sorry.

747
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,199
I lied to you.

748
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:27,650
Yes.

749
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,840
General Manager.

750
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,000
It's Rodrigues.

751
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,949
Is this Mr. Ogata speaking?
This is Rodrigues.

752
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,659
Regrettably, today's closing price for HKD

753
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,700
didn't reach the pre-agreed level
of 3 dollars or above.

754
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,990
Your side has failed
to honor your commitment.

755
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,920
So the rubber business we agreed upon

756
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,460
can only be canceled.

757
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,670
I'm sorry.

758
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,900
A scam.

759
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,230
It's all a scam!

760
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,320
From the very beginning,

761
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,690
it was

762
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,490
a trap!

763
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,400
A trap!

764
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,500
How...

765
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:41,920
How could I

766
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,550
have believed you?

767
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,170
How could I have fallen into your trap?

768
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,750
I never failed!

769
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,380
-I was fooled by a bunch of
Chinese merchants!
-Qiao Renyu.

770
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,250
You bastard!

771
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,530
Tell me.

772
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,340
When did you collude
with the Chinese merchants?

773
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,230
How were the serial numbers leaked?

774
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,300
You bastard!

775
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,670
So you knew all along
that my brother wasn't a traitor?

776
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,370
Yes.

777
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,790
I knew it from the moment

778
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,940
he didn't expose

779
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,070
the forged signature of Lee Kong Chian

780
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,640
on the rubber contract.

781
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,040
Was it

782
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,300
also my brother who told you
the serial numbers

783
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,760
that were just broadcast?

784
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,340
Yes.

785
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,390
Then why didn't you tell me before?

786
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,930
To eliminate the harm of this batch of
forcibly issued HKD,

787
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,990
we had to publish the serial numbers.

788
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,300
But this also meant

789
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,690
that your brother must be sacrificed.

790
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,800
For you,

791
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,410
that would be too cruel.

792
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,260
So...

793
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,100
So you made me

794
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,680
go on believing my brother was a traitor

795
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,040
and then used me

796
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,580
to spread false information.

797
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:23,450
Am I right?

798
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,200
You're his sister.

799
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:31,750
You were the most suitable person
to play this part.

800
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,030
But if there had been
even a hint of pretense

801
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,000
in the performance meant for the Japanese,

802
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,090
it would have been detected,

803
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,550
leading to total failure.

804
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,680
So

805
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,280
I had to continue keeping it from you.

806
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,980
Yes.

807
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,540
You were afraid that I couldn't act
convincingly enough.

808
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,580
So you made me go on believing
my brother was a traitor

809
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,440
and publicly disown him,

810
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,170
severing our ties as siblings.

811
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,980
I even slapped my brother hard

812
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,030
across his face.

813
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,510
Is that right, He Xian?

814
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,720
Yinwan.

815
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,250
I didn't expect that you two would meet.

816
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,180
But it was already too late by then.

817
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,920
Yinwan.

818
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,850
Your brother is a man of great wisdom.

819
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,510
Even when faced
with such an unexpected situation,

820
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,910
he remained so resilient

821
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,990
and calm.

822
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,940
Not only did he not screw it up,

823
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,230
he even managed to get

824
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,690
the hint I dropped to him,

825
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,710
completing the final blow
to the Japanese.

826
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,280
Your brother

827
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:05,990
played a pivotal role

828
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,320
in this victory.

829
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,910
I don't want to hear this.

830
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,830
I don't want to hear this.

831
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,200
Tell me!

832
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,900
Tell me now!

833
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,520
Chief,

834
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,540
he won't survive another blow.

835
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,720
Take him back to Hong Kong

836
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,730
and interrogate him!

837
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,850
Mr. Ogata.

838
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,930
Ogata!

839
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,060
I warned you repeatedly,

840
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,900
but you insisted on your own way.

841
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,690
In just one day, not only
were all our efforts for nothing,

842
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,550
but now all the serial numbers
have been exposed,

843
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,820
causing over 100 million
forcibly issued HKD

844
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,310
to lose its strategic value.

845
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,380
For the losses you've caused the Empire,

846
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,260
you'll have to atone for it yourself.

847
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,720
General Manager!

848
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,470
General Manager!

849
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,020
General Manager!

850
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,570
Damn it!

851
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,130
Xian.

852
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,650
The rescue plan went wrong.

853
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,670
[Pier 12]

854
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,040
After leaving Specie Bank,

855
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,610
no matter where they went,

856
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,010
they should have passed our ambush point.

857
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,090
We didn't expect them
to turn early towards the pier.

858
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,450
By the time we got here,

859
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,800
it was already too late.

860
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,500
Yinwan.

861
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,110
