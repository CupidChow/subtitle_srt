00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,479
I really picked the right person.

00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,120
In today's Macau,

10
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,900
apart from Mr. Fu and Mr. Cui,

11
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,810
who else could put up
tens of millions at once?

12
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,420
So I went straight to them—

13
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,180
that saved a lot of time.

14
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,010
However,

15
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,070
they have a condition.

What condition?

17
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,790
Everyone knows the grain in Zhongshan
was seized by you, Captain Huang.

If I'm the one selling it for you,

19
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,330
why should they trust me?

20
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,370
So

even though the contract is signed,

But if the return trip
is loaded with grain

64

After all, Lyun Coeng

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,640
You mentioned a year—

192
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,230
have you really learned them

193
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,350
in just one month?

194
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,380
I'm just at a beginner's level.

195
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,660
I still have a long way to go.

196
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,800
Can you handle these procedures?

197
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,280
No problem.

198
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:42,940
Mr. He,

199
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,960
is it alright if he takes charge of
the transit permits?

200
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,060
As long as the transit permits
are completed quickly,

201
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,190
I have no objection.

202
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,780
Shipping grain early?

203
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,680
Why the rush?

204
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,230
I want to get a better price.

205
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,670
I've done the math—

206
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,110
once the Portuguese Macau government
signs the deal,

207
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,440
if we're the first to bring the grain in

208
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,810
and sell it,

209
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,970
we can make three to four million.

210
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,570
The Special Operations Team

211
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,850
takes twenty percent.

212
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,440
The remaining eighty percent goes to you.

213
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,190
Since the grain has to
be sold sooner or later,

214
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,520
there's no harm in planning ahead.

215
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,040
But there's one thing—

216
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,900
the Portuguese Macau government
canceled the vote yesterday.

217
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,660
It looks like they're going to
hold out until the deadline.

218
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,690
What if

219
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,980
something goes wrong?

220
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,230
Don't worry about that.

221
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,360
My own people are escorting the ships.

222
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,110
They'll only enter the port
after I notify them.

223
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,380
I guarantee not a single sack of grain

224
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,040
will enter Macau
before the contract is signed.

225
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,330
That's more like it.

226
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,760
Then handle it

227
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,710
yourself.

228
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,490
Yes.

229
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,300
Who exactly wants to see me?

230
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,360
Why so mysterious?

231
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,400
You'll find out when you meet them.

232
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,090
Let's go.

233
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,170
Mr. He?

234
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,610
Rice!

235
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,770
Don't fight!

236
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,790
It's mine!

237
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,190
Hey.

238
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,420
Mr. Yang, what are you doing?

239
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,590
Wait, Mr. He.

240
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,010
It's Brother Xian.

241
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,210
It was all my fault before.

242
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,540
Brother Xian, you repaid evil with kindness
and saved my life.

243
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,560
I'll never forget

244
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,720
your life-saving grace.

245
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,800
Please get up.

246
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,380
Come on.

247
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,070
Brother Xian, if you need anything
in the future,

248
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,000
just let me know.

249
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,930
The transit permit is all set.

250
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,780
Secretary He, you're truly efficient.

251
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,660
I should be thanking you
for the opportunity.

252
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,040
Then I'll prepare the shipping order.

253
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,560
Okay.

254
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,180
Here,

255
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,590
this is the deposit.

256
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,680
And this too.

257
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:22,940
What's this?

258
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,800
You like to hedge your bets, Xian?

259
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,560
Isn't Hou Heng owned by Mr. Fu?

260
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,970
When I signed the contract with him,

261
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,060
he gave this to me

262
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,750
and told me to go play a bit.

263
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,400
But I'm so busy now.

264
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,440
I don't have time.

265
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,310
You helped

266
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,990
a lot

267
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,190
with the transit permit today,

268
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,290
so I'll pass it on to you.

269
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,230
No,

270
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,030
Brother Xian,

271
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,580
I never gamble.

272
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,330
Oh, I see.

273
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,160
Hey,

274
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,640
how about

275
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,180
giving it to me?

276
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,330
Huh?

277
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,310
Rong,

278
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,070
It's not that
I don't want to give it to you.

279
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,420
Captain Huang said

280
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,090
we can't be careless with this job.

281
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,290
You can't go gambling before it's done.

282
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:04,850
Come on,

283
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,260
I didn't say I'd go today.

284
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,260
Can't I go another day?

285
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,940
Thanks.

286
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,420
Rong,

287
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,420
you're in charge of escorting the ships.

288
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,330
Keep all of these safe.

289
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,060
Alright.

290
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,090
Are we done?

291
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,900
If we're done, let's go.

292
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,700
Don't dawdle.

293
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,440
Secretary He has been such a great help.

294
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,280
I should at least treat him to a meal.

295
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,990
No need,

296
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,850
don't be so polite, Brother Xian.

297
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,230
I must treat you to this meal.

298
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,690
If you don't come,
you're not giving me face.

299
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,190
Rong, come with us.

300
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,900
You two go ahead.

301
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,020
I won't disturb you. I'm leaving.

302
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,270
[Hou Heng]

303
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,800
[Hou Heng]

304
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,060
[Hou Heng]

305
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,900
These past few days
have really opened my eyes.

306
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,590
Now I understand what they mean by

307
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,920
"the young are to be feared."

308
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,760
Not at all.

309
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,660
I should thank you for your support.

310
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,690
This time, it's all thanks to you

311
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,920
for bringing such a big business deal

312
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,710
and recommending me to the Chairman.

313
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,310
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
had the chance to prove myself.

314
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,400
So your ability to learn two languages

315
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,680
in just one month,

316
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,590
and memorize Macau's commercial laws

317
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,940
backwards and forwards—

318
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,140
was that my doing too?

319
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,620
All right.

320
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,230
Let's skip the flattery.

321
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
Secretary He, I toast you with tea

322
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,070
to congratulate you on your promotion.

323
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,800
You don't need to call me
Secretary He anymore.

324
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,060
Just call me Hongshen.

325
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,330
In that case,
I won't stand on ceremony—

326
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:37,940
Hongshen.

327
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,100
Cheers.

328
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,190
Small. Small. Small.

329
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,640
Open it!

330
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,800
-Big! Big!
-Open it!

331
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,050
Big! Big!

332
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,450
Well, look who it is,

333
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,640
Officer Yang.

334
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,400
You're doing pretty well, huh?

335
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,090
Huh?

336
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,560
Are you surprised to see I'm still alive?

337
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,550
Surprised?

338
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,900
Disappointed?

339
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,250
Excuse me,

340
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,270
I'm too tough to die.

341
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,830
I haven't been killed by you traitors yet.

342
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,690
How about that?

343
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,170
What do you mean by this?

344
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,830
Are you looking for trouble?

345
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,690
Yes, I'm here to give you trouble.

346
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,090
Got a problem with that?

347
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,610
You made me take the fall
and rot in prison.

348
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,010
It almost cost me my life.

349
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,560
We need to settle the score.

350
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
Fine.

351
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,810
-Open it!
-Open it!

352
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,520
Yes.

353
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,140
14 points. Big.

354
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,540
Great!

355
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,230
Bleed him dry!

356
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,410
Bankrupt this bastard!

357
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,470
Alright!

358
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,860
Yang,

359
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,940
I used to call you Officer Yang

360
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,760
because of your fancy police uniform.

361
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,220
You really think you're something special?

362
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,900
Can't take a loss?

363
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,590
If you can't take it, get the hell out.

364
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,930
I can't take it?

365
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,440
One-on-one?

366
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,760
Fine.

367
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,920
One-on-one!

368
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,920
Whoever loses

369
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,170
crawls out of here!

370
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,280
Han,

371
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,320
take good care of
our two distinguished guests.

372
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,510
I really didn't expect

373
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,680
the transit permit
to be this troublesome.

374
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,660
You know the process so well,

375
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,260
yet it still took a whole day.

376
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,920
If the transit permit were lost,

377
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,490
wouldn't my business be finished?

378
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,830
Not necessarily.

379
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,010
The paperwork can be reissued—

380
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,940
it would just take some extra time.

381
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,380
How long?

382
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,290
Since all the originals are on file,

383
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,140
it'll be faster than the first time,

384
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,900
but still at least an hour or two.

385
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,210
Xian, why are you suddenly
asking about this?

386
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,470
You just got your permits processed.

387
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,599
It couldn't possibly get lost, right?

388
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,010
You don't know—

389
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,020
I'm really not at ease about

390
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,510
the guy who came with me.

391
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,580
What's wrong with him?

392
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,380
Do you know what his nickname is?

393
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,790
Gambler Rong.

394
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,120
No wonder he never puts the dice down.

395
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,600
The moment he sees chips,
his eyes light up.

396
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,710
So he's a gambling addict.

397
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,900
And it's not just gambling—

398
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,300
he's a heavy drinker too.

399
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,450
Normally I'd keep my distance
from someone like that.

400
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,940
But this job is backed by Huang Gongjie.

401
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,710
He specifically assigned Gambler Rong
to escort the ships.

402
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,840
I couldn't stop him.

403
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,730
I can only hope nothing goes wrong.

404
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,550
I need to go to Zhongshan tonight.

405
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,880
I won't stay any longer.

406
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,550
Hongshen.

407
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,900
I'm over a decade older than you.

408
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,670
Since you call me Brother Xian,

409
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,370
let me give you some advice.

410
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,750
You've just established yourself
at Lyun Coeng,

411
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,640
and now you're handling such a big deal.

412
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,600
You must be careful in everything you do.

413
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,010
Follow the rules.

414
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,860
Don't let anyone get a hold of you.

415
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:22,780
Alright.

416
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,620
Thank you for your advice.

417
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:25,880
Well,

418
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,270
I'll be going now.

419
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,120
The ship sails tomorrow—

420
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,850
it's all up to you
to check everything carefully.

421
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,360
Open it!

422
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,010
Chang wins!

423
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:41,530
Again!

424
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,340
Oh no!

425
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,840
One more!

426
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,550
Again?

427
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,750
You already owe me 50,000 dollars.

428
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,160
If it were just my money, I wouldn't care.

429
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,750
But my boss is not easy to deal with.

430
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,010
If you can't pay today,

431
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,480
you won't be leaving this place.

432
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,710
Are you threatening me?

433
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,110
Let's see who dares to collect the debt
from me.

434
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,340
I do.

435
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,900
What do you say?

436
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,160
Mercy, Leader!

437
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,110
Mercy, Leader!

438
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,640
Leader!

439
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,990
Master Sanhe, Master Sanhe!

440
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,680
Wait.

441
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,900
Mr. Fu.

442
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
This is an internal matter
of the Tai Ho Brotherhood.

443
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,170
But Hou Heng is my establishment.

444
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,850
This is Macau. We follow the law here.

445
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:48,880
A death would be inappropriate.

446
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,750
Besides, I have other customers here.

447
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,440
Don't frighten them.

448
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:54,970
Fine.

449
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,600
I have to respect

450
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,380
your wish.

451
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,750
Tai Ho Brotherhood's internal matters
can wait.

452
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,750
But my brother Yang's gambling stake

453
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:08,740
is payment for goods
from our Tai Ho Brotherhood.

454
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,680
Today, I've come here

455
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,180
to collect my payment,

456
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,680
my debt.

457
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,100
That's acceptable, right?

458
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,660
Debt collection in a casino
is perfectly fine.

459
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,010
As long as no one gets killed.

460
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,210
Master Sanhe, please proceed.

461
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,900
Did you hear that, Rong?

462
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,510
Debts must be paid.

463
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,840
It's only right.

464
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,180
Pay up.

465
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,970
Leader, please,

466
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,290
g-give me a few more days.

467
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,250
I'll definitely pay you back.

468
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,390
So you can't pay today?

469
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,230
What are you waiting for?

470
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,140
Cut off his hands to settle the debt.

471
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,100
Spare me, Leader.

472
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,670
Leader!

473
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,450
Have mercy, Leader!

474
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,600
Leader! Leader, please spare me!

475
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,100
Leader!

476
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,940
Wait!

477
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,440
How do you still not understand?

478
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,180
Is Master Sanhe someone
who cares about a few thousand pataca?

479
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,640
What did you do
to make Master Sanhe so angry?

480
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,340
Have you forgotten?

481
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,710
Leader.

482
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,290
I'm a jerk! I'm an animal!

483
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,750
Leader, please spare me this time.

484
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,640
I promise I'll change.

485
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,680
I promise I'll change, Leader.

486
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,880
Promise to change? How will you change?

487
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,600
Leader.

488
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,640
I swear to return
to the Tai Ho Brotherhood.

489
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,470
I promise never to betray
the brotherhood again.

490
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,930
Leader, I'll never betray the brotherhood!

491
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,840
Leader.

492
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,530
Rong is still an old member
of our brotherhood.

493
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,210
Although he made a serious mistake,

494
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,550
he was misled by Huang Gongjie after all.

495
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,550
Why not give him another chance?

496
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,440
Zhong.

497
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,170
You're such a kind-hearted person.

498
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,370
Fine, it's your call.

499
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,010
Thank you, Leader!

500
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,190
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

501
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,390
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

502
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,210
Do it.

503
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,550
Mr. Liang.

504
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,290
You betrayed the brotherhood first.

505
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,040
Since you have sworn loyalty,

506
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,320
have you forgotten
the finger-cutting blood oath rule?

507
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,340
Hurry and do it!

508
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:47,990
Rong.

509
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,390
Rong.

510
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:08,160
[Nanhua Medical Club]

511
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,760
Gambler Rong betrayed us
and joined the enemy.

512
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,250
His crime deserves death.

513
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,140
Making him a scapegoat now

514
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,100
is already letting him off easy.

515
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,090
But that young man from Lyun Coeng,

516
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,710
can he be trusted?

517
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,630
I've dealt with him before.

518
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,860
He's not a bad person,

519
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,010
just trying to make a living there.

520
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,550
I've warned him already.

521
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,820
He's just been promoted to secretary.

522
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,820
He needs to be thorough and careful.

523
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,050
It should be fine.

524
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,970
But even if we get the Lyun Coeng fleet

525
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,510
to delay departure by a few hours,

526
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,290
once Zhongshan Pier

527
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,680
finishes loading 10 million kilograms
of grain onto the ships,

528
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,340
there won't be much time left.

529
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,010
When the real and decoy fleets
meet head-on

530
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,540
during the return journey,

531
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,450
the deception will be exposed immediately.

532
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,340
At worst,

533
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,510
we can block the Hengmen Waterway.

Mr. Ma has already found a house for us.

You're our family's only strong worker.

I can't move everything...

540
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,750
I can't move everything by myself.

Don't worry, Qiwen.

542
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,480
I'll definitely come back.

be good at home

545
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,650
and listen to Grandpa and Mom.

546
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,440
Yes.

You can't call me Ms. Qiao anymore.

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,690
Let me demonstrate for you first.

564
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,270
I will play

565
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,540
the theme song from "Waterloo Bridge,"

566
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,160
"Auld Lang Syne,"

567
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,540
also known in Chinese as

568
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,990
"Yilu Ping'an (Safe Journey)."

569
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,660
[Tai Ho Brotherhood's Pier, Macau]

570
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,840
Raise the sails!

571
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,400
[Pier 2, Macau]

572
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
[February 18, 1942] [5:15]

573
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,320
Hurry, hurry.

574
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,210
Stop, stop.

575
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,120
He! He!

576
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,360
We agreed to depart at 5 o'clock,

577
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,290
but you're late.

578
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,790
I'm sorry.

579
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,950
I overslept.

580
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,210
Are the ships ready?

581
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,750
The fleet is ready.

582
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,060
Let's go.

583
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,250
I need to verify the shipping documents

584
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,580
before they can depart.

585
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,720
Where are the documents?

586
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,080
[Shiqi Pier, Zhongshan County]

587
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,750
Well,

588
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,490
Mr. He.

589
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,950
You must be tired
after coming all this way.

590
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,250
Magistrate Zhao,
you've come in person to meet me.

591
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,340
It's my honor.

592
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,660
It's my duty.

593
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,230
Captain Huang's big business deal

594
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,090
deserves my personal attention.

595
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,190
The granary is this way.

596
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:42,680
Please.

597
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,610
Thank you for your trouble.

598
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,600
You know who I am.

599
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,620
Do I really need those papers to sail?

600
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,430
I'm sorry,

601
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,920
but these are company rules.

602
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,290
I'm responsible for this shipment,

603
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,960
and I won't let the ship sail
without proper documentation.

604
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,030
So what do I

605
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,770
do now?

606
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,870
You'll need to get
complete replacement documents.

607
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,700
Replacement?

608
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,690
How long will that take?

609
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,190
Government offices
don't open until 8 o'clock.

610
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,690
Even if I send someone to wait at the door

611
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,030
to process the paperwork immediately,

612
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,490
it'll still be after 9:30.

613
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,080
9:30?

614
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,050
Magistrate Zhao,
I've finished counting the goods.

615
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,450
The quantity is correct.

616
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,600
Here's the payment.

617
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,050
Quickly distribute it
to those grain merchants,

618
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,920
so they'll stop protesting
at the county office every day.

619
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,340
Got it.

620
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,160
County Magistrate!

621
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,610
Lyun Coeng's grain fleet
has arrived at the pier.

622
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,210
Magistrate Zhao,
the paperwork is in order, right?

623
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,030
Well,

624
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,490
how could Lyun Coeng's team
have any problems?

625
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,420
Mr. He, you're being too cautious.

626
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,280
Better safe than sorry.

627
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,660
Well then,

628
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,150
let's load the ships.

629
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,160
Brothers!

630
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,210
Start loading!

631
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:58,990
Yes!

632
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,880
Mr. He, you're being too formal.

633
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,080
Magistrate Zhao, you've been so helpful.

634
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,920
A small token of appreciation
is only right.

635
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,360
Then I won't be polite.

636
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,910
Thank you. Thank you.

637
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,290
Come in.

638
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,710
Magistrate Zhao.

639
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,520
Mr. He.

640
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,250
The cargo has almost been loaded.

641
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,160
In about 15 minutes,

642
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,420
we'll be ready to sail.

643
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,290
Alright.

644
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,690
I'll issue you a transit permit
right away.

645
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
Magistrate Zhao,

646
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,160
regarding the transit permit,

647
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,490
we might need to trouble you

648
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,230
to make it

649
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,690
to be applicable
for the Modaomen Waterway.

650
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:40,900
If the real and decoy fleets meet head-on

651
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,430
during the return journey,

652
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,290
the deception will be exposed immediately.

653
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,160
At worst,

654
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,270
we can block the Hengmen Waterway.

655
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:48,900
The Lyun Coeng fleet must navigate

656
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,000
[Hengmen Waterway]

657
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,750
[February 18, 1942] [11:00]

658
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,750
the Hengmen Waterway to enter here.

659
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,250
Why so slow?

660
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,190
Hurry!

661
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,470
You,

662
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,150
go faster.

663
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,520
I can't go any faster.

664
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,240
The ship is at maximum speed.

665
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,330
Faster!

666
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,900
As long as the engine doesn't explode,

667
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,830
push it to the limit! Do you hear me?

668
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,870
Raise the sails!

669
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,030
The Tai Ho Brotherhood
has lived on these waters for centuries.

670
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,620
Blocking the waterway
is no big deal for us.

671
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,790
Brothers!

672
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,530
Let's get to work!

673
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,690
Once we block the Hengmen Waterway,

674
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,160
on our return journey,

675
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,750
we'll have a reason

676
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,210
to navigate the Modaomen Waterway instead.

677
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,990
Modaomen?

678
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,440
Why?

679
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,230
Well,

680
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,320
I just heard from ships
coming from Hengmen

681
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,340
that the river

682
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,580
has been completely blocked

683
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,550
by bamboo rafts.

684
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,640
I'm afraid it won't be cleared today.

685
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,640
So we have to navigate
the Modaomen Waterway instead.

686
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,640
Navigating the Modaomen Waterway

687
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,240
will cost a two-hour detour.

688
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,930
We have no choice.

689
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,450
Taking this detour

690
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,200
will burn a lot more coal.

691
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,490
How unlucky.

692
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,530
Magistrate Zhao,

693
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,450
we'll have to trouble you to make

694
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,430
the transit permit to be applicable
for the Modaomen Waterway.

695
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,380
Well, don't worry yet.

696
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,340
I'll call the Hengmen checkpoint

697
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,160
to see if it's really that badly blocked.

698
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,620
If it's truly serious,

699
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,450
then

700
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,080
I'll have to ask you both

701
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,530
to detour through the Modaomen Waterway,

702
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,210
alright?

703
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,000
Thank you for your trouble.

704
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,580
Hello?

705
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,880
Is this the Hengmen checkpoint?

706
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,120
This is Zhao Dinghua.

707
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,550
I heard the Hengmen Waterway
has been blocked.

708
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,660
Is it serious?

709
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,250
Oh, I see.

710
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,120
How long will it take?

711
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,450
All right.

712
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,700
Notify me as soon as it's cleared.

713
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,320
The Hengmen checkpoint
has indeed been blocked.

714
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,450
It's quite serious.

715
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,420
But you two gentlemen

716
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,900
are really lucky.

717
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,230
A Japanese warship needs to pass through.

718
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,290
This big Japanese warship
has powerful engines

719
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,250
and strong firepower.

720
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,030
They're in a hurry to pass through,

721
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,160
so they're clearing the waterway now.

722
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,190
Such good luck.

723
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,770
We really should thank the Imperial Army.

724
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,540
How long will it take?

725
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,820
They said

726
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,050
it shouldn't take long.

727
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:44,750
Once there's any news,

728
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,080
they'll notify me immediately.

729
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,620
Gentlemen, please be patient.

730
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,920
I'll make you some tea.

731
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,620
Thank you very much.

732
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,980
Master Huang.

733
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,170
Why is it taking so long?

734
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,680
I hope nothing's gone wrong.

735
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,860
Magistrate Zhao.

736
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,320
Is the waterway clearance

737
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,190
reliable?

738
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,620
As you know,

739
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,290
this shipment must arrive

740
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,580
in Macau before 6 o'clock.

741
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,080
I think we'd better navigate
the Modaomen Waterway instead

742
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,210
to avoid any delay.

743
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,820
Alright, I'll call to check the situation.

744
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,130
Hello, this is Zhao Dinghua.

745
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:42,790
Oh.

746
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,710
Are you sure?

747
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,510
Good. Good.

748
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,750
Alright.

00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,980
Mr. He, that was a call
from the Hengmen checkpoint.

750
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,210
They said that with the current progress,

751
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,160
the waterway will be clear
in half an hour at most.

752
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,320
Look, it'll take you at least

753
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,660
an hour or two
to reach the Hengmen checkpoint.

754
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,450
Now,

755
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,680
you don't need to take a detour.

756
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,690
That's great.

757
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,290
In that case,

758
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,660
we'll still navigate the Hengmen Waterway.

759
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,659
Please issue us the transit permit.

760
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:09,389

Alright.

764
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,110
Mr. He.

765
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,530
Why did you let him issue the permit
for navigating the Hengmen Waterway?

766
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,030
It's already past noon.

767
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,150
The Modaomen Waterway is far away.

768
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,030
If we don't leave now,

769
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,880
it'll be impossible for us

770

we haven't passed through
the Modaomen checkpoint,

just one phone call from Magistrate Zhao

777
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:50,010
and the whole fleet will be finished.

778

been altered?

Oh, I see.

797
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,380
We planned to navigate
the Hengmen Waterway,

798

on the river surface there,

800
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,470
so Magistrate Zhao modified our permit

801
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,930
to navigate the Modaomen Waterway instead.

802
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,030

When the time comes,

809

both the Navy and the Army
will withdraw completely.
