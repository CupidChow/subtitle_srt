in Macau

at Kiang Wu Hospital.

Why

13
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,670

to collect corpses?

Why did it take over two hours?

23

This afternoon, the hospital received
a request from Tongshan Hall.

24
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,620
Multiple bodies of plague victims

25
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,340
were found in the shantytown area.

but they aren't equipped to carry
out epidemic prevention or disinfection.

To stop the plague from spreading,

30
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,690
the hospital had to dispatch
an epidemic control officer.

31
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,650
As it happened,

32
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,470
we also had bodies here that needed
transferring to the cemetery.

33
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,430
Since I was already handling
the transfer,

34
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,370
I took the opportunity to go over

and containment procedures—

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,800

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,710
The Governor has decided

190
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,800
to hold an Executive Council meeting
tomorrow afternoon

191
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
to vote on whether

192
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,730
to sign the agreement.

193
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,100

[Hong Kong and Macao Business Community

195
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,360
the vote fails tomorrow,

196
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,640
the final deadline is only 4 days away.

197
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,040
If we can't secure food supplies

198
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,900
and end this famine,

199
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,060
we won't make it
past this life-and-death crisis.

200
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,340
Esteemed colleagues from the business
communities of Hong Kong and Macau,

201
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:57,490
[Hong Kong and Macao Business Community
New Year's Eve Gathering]

202
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,200
whether Macau can save itself

203
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,350
will depend on all of us
pooling our wisdom and strength.

204
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:04,960
Does anyone

205
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,450
have any ideas?

206
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,490
Mr. Fu,

207
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,820
Mr. Cui,

208
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,540
you two

209
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,180
are among Macau's top business leaders.

210
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,900
What are your thoughts?

211
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,440
If it's a matter of money,

212
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,800
I would

213
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,950
sell everything I own

214
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,380
without hesitation.

215
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
I would do the same without question.

216
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,450
The sad truth is,

217
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,270
even with money,
there's simply no food to be had.

218
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,300
Excuse me,

219
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,210
[Hong Kong and Macao Business Community
New Year's Eve Gathering]

220
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,330
is Mr. He Xian

221
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,490
of Huilong Bank here?

222
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:06,950
Mr. Ma,

223
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,100
why are you looking for that traitor?

224
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,430
Traitor?

225
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,990
Are you sure this is the place?

226
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,410
This is definitely

227
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,340
the address from the sign-in book.

228
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,660
Watch your step.

229
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,670
Father, Xian is back.

230
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,990
We're here. This is He Xian's family.

231
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,710
Alright, you go ahead and talk.

232
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,070
Mr. He.

233
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,020
-Qiwen.
-Mr. He.

Mr. Ou.

What brings you all here?

237
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,730
I'm home, Dr. Ke.

238
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,040
Get some rest.

239
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:24,970
Lyu.

240
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,760
Xian.

241
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,570
-Mr. He.
-What brings you here?

242
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,300
Xian,

243
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,440
I'm Ma Wanqi.

244
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,510
Back at the pier,

245
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,020
I had no idea it was you, Xian,

246
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,800
and I certainly never imagined
my business

247
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,530
would bring such hardship
to you and your family.

248
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,280
Please accept my deepest apologies, Xian.

249
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,190
It's alright.

250
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,080
I only did what was right.

251
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,920
As long as that shipment
arrived safely,

252
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,390
it was all worth it.

253
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,360
Xian,

254
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,400
it was our fault
for mistaking a good man for bad.

255
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,530
I can't bring myself

256
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,760
to apologize further.

257
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,710
This is

258
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,830
the short-term loan
I took out from Huilong Bank back then,

259
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,120
now repaid in full,

260
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,710
principal plus interest.

261
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,770
And this is from me.

262
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,680
Xian, when we just arrived,

263
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,760
we met your father, your wife,
and your children—

264
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,970
all waiting for you
for the New Year's reunion dinner.

265
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,900
They've been hungry for so long.

266
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,300
We happened to bring
a few New Year's gifts.

267
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,160
Consider this your New Year's Eve feast.

268
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,560
Please, you all must eat.

269
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,210
Xian,

270
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,570
I know how much

271
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,420
you've suffered these past days,

272
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,760
and how much pain you must
be holding inside.

273
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,310
But the truth has come out now,

274
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,710
and all that is behind us.

275
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,250
What good is this food

276
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,680
if only our family

277
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,180
gets to eat?

278
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,970
Let him cry.

279
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,900
Let him cry it out—

280
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,359
because he isn't crying for himself.

281
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,859
Tonight,

282
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,020
to save a child,

283
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,569
we went to a place—

284
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,730
a living hell

285
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,720
we never wish to set foot in again.

286
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,860
What place?

287
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,380
Taipa Cemetery.

288
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,850
The mass grave.

289
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,030
So, no one's willing to stay?

290
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,680
Hey.

291
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,570
What's wrong?

292
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,030
The Consulate received a cable from MI6.

293
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,530
They hope to recruit 1 or 2 officers

294
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,790
from those who escaped Hong Kong

295
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,880
to voluntarily stay behind

296
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,210
and establish a British Military
Service Station in Macau.

297
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,370
A British Military
Service Station in Macau?

298
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,140
What is it that for?

299
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:42,900
First,

300
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,660
if any more

301
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,920
British personnel escape from Hong Kong,

302
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,380
there'll be someone
to receive them here.

303
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:47,950
Second,

304
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,820
using Macau's status as a neutral port,

305
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,400
it would serve as an outpost
intelligence station to secretly

306
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,600
gather information on Japanese forces
in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macau.

307
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,820
So, to stay behind as spies?

308
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,010
Yes.

309
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,990
No wonder everyone went quiet.

310
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,320
Has MI6 lost their minds?

311
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,820
All of them are

312
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,520
on the Japanese wanted list.

313
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,680
What's the point of staying behind?

314
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
A death wish?

315
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,400
But right now, the Allies

316
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,600
have zero presence
across Hong Kong and Macau.

317
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Someone has to gather intelligence,

318
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,650
prepare for a future counteroffensive.

319
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,800
Counteroffensive?

320
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,670
Just staying alive
is hard enough as it is.

321
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,460
I've told you so many times—

322
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,150
people here don't wrap
their turbans this way.

323
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,690
Thank you.

324
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,340
Everyone, please be careful.

325
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,600
Watch your step.

326
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,720
Thank you.

327
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,430
Wait.

328
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,670
I know this is important to you,

329
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,150
so I redeemed it.

330
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,450
On the New Year's Day, no less,

331
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,420
and I still have to go back

332
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,680
and clear any trace of you staying there.

333
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,990
Getting mixed up with you people

334
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,680
is just my luck.

335
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:48,750
Who is it?

336
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,510
What happened?

337
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,340
Did the evacuation fail?

338
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,300
Are you alright?

339
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,410
I'm fine.

340
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,400
Where are the others?

341
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,340
They left.

342
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,160
Then why didn't you go?

343
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,490
I'm not leaving.

344
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,130
Why not?

345
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,320
I've decided.

346
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,750
I'm staying in Macau

347
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,900
to establish a BMSSM.

348
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,340
What?

349
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,250
What's in your hand?

350
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,010
Trash.

351
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,230
You don't have a fever.

352
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Why are you talking nonsense like that?

353
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,410
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

354
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,980
Spying under the noses of the Japanese,

355
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,750
gathering intelligence.

356
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,180
You know how to do all that?

357
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:18,750
Not yet,

358
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,350
but I can learn.

359
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,320
A society lady like you—
who are you going to learn from?

360
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,580
Who'll teach you?

361
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,240
Do you think the spies
and the Japanese in Macau

362
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,510
are playing house with you?

363
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,190
This is a line of work
that gets you killed.

364
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,250
Lyons ran off faster than a rabbit,

365
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,590
and you want to stay and show off?

366
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,850
But I have my advantages.

367
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,320
First, I'm just a military dependent—

368
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,980
I won't be on any wanted lists,

369
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,360
the Japanese won't notice me.

370
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,880
Second, before I got married,
I worked at the telegraph office.

371
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,470
I know how to operate a telegraph.

372
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,270
Do you have a telegraph machine?

373
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
Even if one fell from the sky for you,

374
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,180
what intelligence would you gather?

375
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,440
Where would you get it?

376
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,160
And after you get it,
who would you send it to?

377
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,940
Who's your contact?

378
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,140
Did MI6 give you communication codes?

379
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,450
I… I haven't thought about that yet.

380
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,310
You haven't thought about it,

381
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,230
and you've already appointed yourself

382
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,160
a female spy of the British Empire?

383
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:15,860
I know—

384
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,030
you're doing this to wait for William,
aren't you?

385
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,760
Let me tell you, stop dreaming.

386
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,180
The Japanese aren't as simple
as you think.

387
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,030
Do you really think it's easy
to escape from a POW camp?

388
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,880
This has nothing to do with him.

389
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,940
When I decided to stay in Macau,

390
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,800
I wasn't even thinking about him.

391
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,740
Then what were you thinking about?

392
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,470
I am not obliged to answer your questions.

393
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,720
From today,

394
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,340
this is the BMSSM,

395
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,910
and I am its station chief.

396
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,130
Take it slow.

397
00:24:59,130 --> 00:24:59,490
[Following the Fall of Hong Kong,
under the direction of Mao Zedong]

398
00:24:59,490 --> 00:24:59,950
Hello.

399
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:01,840
Easy.

400
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,130
Watch your step.

401
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,470
[and the deployment of Zhou Enlai,
CCCPC Southern Bureau,]

402
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,400
Watch your step.

403
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,750
[specifically, the Eighth Route Army
Hong Kong Office,]

404
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,410
Be careful.

405
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:07,990
[and the AJGF worked
in close coordination]

406
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,720
Take it slow.

407
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,370
[to launch a large‑scale rescue operation
for patriotic democratic figures,]

408
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,100
Commander Ou.

409
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,380
[cultural progressives,
international friends,]

410
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,130
Comrade Zhengping,
thank you for your hard work.

411
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:14,350
You've worked hard too.

412
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,270
[and their relatives
stranded in Hong Kong.]

413
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:16,620
Here,

414
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,920
you've worked hard, comrade.

415
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,380
[Over the course of 6 months,
covering more than ten thousand li,]

416
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,210
Everyone, take your time, slow down.

417
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:19,580
Comrade.

418
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,120
Thank you.

419
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,720
Thank you for your hard work.

420
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,880
[they successfully rescued
over 800 individuals,]

421
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,560
[preserving a great number of cultural
elites for the Chinese nation.]

422
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:28,750
[This effort profoundly strengthened
and expanded]

423
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,400
Everyone, be careful.

424
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,950
Thank you. Thank you so much.

425
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,930
You've worked hard.

426
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,180
[the Anti‑Japanese National United Front,]

427
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:33,780
Thank you.

428
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,140
[leaving a profound and indelible mark
on the history of the Chinese revolution.]

429
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,270
You've worked hard.

430
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,380
You've worked hard. Thank you, Comrade.

431
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,180
-You've worked hard.
-Thank you for your hard work.

432
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,950
Thank you for your hard work.

433
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,750
Thank you for your hard work, comrade.

434
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,350
Thank you for your hard work.

435
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,820
Macau's predicament

436
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,290
goes beyond the surface-level blockade—

437
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,920
what we really need to understand

438
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,250
is the reason behind it.

439
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,910
The reason behind it?

440
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,120
Occupying Macau by force

441
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,250
would be effortless for the Japanese.

442
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,840
So why go to all this trouble,

443
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,290
taking such a roundabout approach

444
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,180
with this so-called "cooperation plan"?

445
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,450
What is

446
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,530
their real objective?

447
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,750
I see it now—

448
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,260
they're after supplies.

449
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,490
Before Hong Kong fell,

450
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,080
the Japanese had already set up

451
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,380
many trading companies in Hong Kong

452
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,530
disguised as British
or Chinese enterprises,

453
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:27,990
aiming

454
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,120
to buy up China's

455
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,470
strategic specialties

456
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,750
and large quantities
of Anglo-American industrial goods.

457
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,610
But now that Hong Kong has fallen,

458
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,140
the mainland will naturally
stop shipping those specialties here,

459
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,190
and Britain and the U.S. have
declared war on them—

460
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,320
the supply channel for strategic materials
has been cut off.

461
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,180
So the Japanese

462
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,820
must find a new trade route.

463
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,020
That's why they aren't openly
occupying Macau—

464
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,880
in order to keep it

465
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,970
as an international free port
serving the entire region

466
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,750
between China and Southeast Asia.

467
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,380
That way,
they can keep securing
China's strategic resources

468
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,400
and British and American industrial goods.

469
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:58,850
Mr. He,

470
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,050
you're an expert in finance.

471
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,250
Looking at it from the perspective
of wartime finance,

472
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,920
I believe you can draw another conclusion.

473
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,530
I get it now.

474
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,500
Please, explain it to us.

475
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,710
Importing strategic materials
requires foreign currency.

476
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,510
Since the Pacific War broke out,

477
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,340
Hong Kong's role
as an international financial hub

478
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,620
has become nominal.

479
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,860
Japan wants to find
a new international financial foothold,

480
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,010
and that place can only be—

481
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,860
and

482
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,400
will only be—Macau.

483
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,360
Now that we've figured out
the scheme behind all this.

484
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,950
But how can we help Macau

485
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,620
survive this crisis?

486
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,700
Do you know how much grain
I have on hand right now?

487
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,010
Ten million kilograms!

488
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,010
And this entire deal—
I'm putting it in your hands.

489
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,010
Dr. Ke,

490
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,420
Mr. Ma,

491
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,590
I've made up my mind—

492
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,580
I'm going to buy

493
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,100
back the food supplies for Macau.

494
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,750
Brother Xian, you said before
that this kind of deal

495
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,820
couldn't be done—

496
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,900
what changed your mind?

497
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,270
He Xian, what do you mean by this?

498
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,990
Showing up on the first day
of the New Year with a pile of pig slop—

499
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,360
are you looking for trouble?

500
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,120
Huh?

501
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,450
Rong.

502
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,440
Captain Huang,

503
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,460
this "pig slop" Rong mentioned

504
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,490
was actually my family's
New Year's Eve dinner last night.

505
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,970
If I hadn't been lucky enough

506
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,370
to run into a few friends,

507
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,230
who knows what would've
become of that meal.

508
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,120
So, Captain Huang,

509
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,690
do you still need to ask
why I changed my mind?

510
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,120
See?

511
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,100
No one in this world says no to money.

512
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,860
Captain Huang,

513
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,420
since you're handing the business to me,

514
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,160
it means you recognize me.

515
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,940
But friendship is one thing;

516
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,120
business is another.

517
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,660
If we're going to cooperate,

518
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,360
I still need you to be straight

519
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,450
with me about your bottom line.

520
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,690
Fair enough.

521
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,030
Brother Xian, you speak frankly,

522
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,830
so I won't hide anything either.

523
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,530
The rice from Zhongshan

524
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,940
costs 60 avos per kilogram—

525
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,230
covering purchase, storage,

526
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,030
loss, and transport.

527
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,690
Ten million kilograms total,

528
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,420
total cost, 6 million patacas.

529
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,970
And the selling price?

530
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,950
Four patacas per kilogram—

531
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,550
is that unreasonable?

532
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,750
With a 6 million investment,

533
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,490
you're planning to sell
for 40 million patacas.

534
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,620
Captain Huang, your appetite is huge.

535
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,020
But in Macau right now,

536
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,120
whoever has grain calls the shots.

537
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,340
I'll look for buyers

538
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,120
at 4 patacas per kilogram.

539
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,730
I have one condition:

540
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,400
6 million patacas in cash

541
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,330
at the time the contract is signed.

542
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,840
The remaining 34 million patacas

543
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,900
must be paid

544
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,400
with Banco Nacional Ultramarino
post-dated checks,

545
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,030
to be cashed upon delivery.

546
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,260
Captain Huang,

547
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,420
who in Macau right now

548
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,680
can come up with 40 million patacas
in one go?

549
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,810
Buyers like that won't be easy to find.

550
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,290
If one isn't enough,

551
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,970
we'll find several.

552
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,640
I believe you can manage it.

553
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:33,580
Alright,

554
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,920
I'll think of a way

555
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,120
to handle the buyers.

556
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,180
There's one more thing:

557
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,600
this deal

558
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,580
can only go through

559
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,470
after 6 p.m. on the 18th.

560
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,880
That's the final deadline
the Imperial Army

561
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,190
gave the Portuguese.

562
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,360
Only once the Portuguese
sign the agreement

563
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,420
will the Japanese lift the blockade.

564
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,380
Until then,

565
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,470
on Imperial Army orders,

566
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,880
not a single grain of rice
can enter Macau.

567
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,190
So that's it.

568
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,540
Captain Huang,

569
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,850
why didn't you say so earlier?

570
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,110
You got my hopes up for nothing.

571
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,710
This deal…

572
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,010
can't be done.

573
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,360
Why not again?

574
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,840
Why has the price of grain
in Macau skyrocketed?

575
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,100
It is entirely because the Japanese
have blockaded Macau.

576
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,940
The moment that blockade is lifted,

577
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,530
grain from all over will flood

578
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,180
into Macau like crazy.

579
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,580
By then,

580
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,310
forget 4 patacas per kilogram—

581
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,460
you'll be lucky not to lose money.

582
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,450
I hadn't thought of that.

583
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,440
Then what should we do?

584
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,580
There's no other way.

585
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,580
It's off.

586
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,160
Wait—

587
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,190
what if

588
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,620
we ship the rice

589
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,640
from Zhongshan here

590
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,690
before they sign?

591
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,600
Didn't you just say

592
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,860
the Japanese won't allow

593
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,050
any grain into Macau
before the agreement is signed?

594
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,510
I said ship it here—

595
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,790
not into Macau.

596
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,170
Keep the grain barges anchored
near the piers.

597
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,000
The moment the Japanese sign,

598
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,620
I'll be the first to know,

599
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,730
and I'll notify you.

600
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,490
You bring the boats in and unload.

601
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:15,190
That way,

602
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,390
we don't violate Imperial Army orders.

603
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,530
That's brilliant.

604
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:20,780
Alright,

605
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,160
let's go

606
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,300
with your plan.

607
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,730
Then we

608
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,180
have an agreement.

609
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,620
Yes, we do.

610
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,640
I've already taken stock
of all of Hengfengyu's assets—

611
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,270
including property and ancestral holdings—

612
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,040
and it only adds up to 3 million patacas.

613
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,640
Looking across all of Macau,

614
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,270
only the two of you

615
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,720
can come up with such a vast sum.

616
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,580
Don't worry about the post-dated checks.

617
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,550
The contract states

618
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,820
they can only be cashed
after the goods are delivered.

619
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,710
Since this contract

620
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,340
will never actually be executed,

621
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,880
no matter
whether the plan succeeds or fails,

622
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,140
Huang Gongjie won't be able
to cash them.

623
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,720
The real risk lies in
that 6 million patacas in cash.

624
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:04,680
Exactly.

625
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,600
The risks in this matter
are truly enormous.

626
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,100
If you both need time to consider…

627
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,790
No need.

628
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,880
We'll sign this contract.

629
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:23,980
Mr. Huang,

630
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:28,180
there's something I'm not sure
I should say or not.

631
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:28,710
Go ahead.

632
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:32,970
Mr. Huang,

633
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,180
the whole of Macau is starving,
skin and bones.

634
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,580
With the grain in our own hands,

635
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,100
why worry
about not being able to sell it?

636
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,140
Why drag that He Xian into it

637
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,730
and let him take a cut in the middle?

638
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,820
You don't get it?

639
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,600
Right now

640
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,840
we've got the label of "big traitors"
hanging over our heads.

641
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,400
Who'd want to do business
with us directly?

642
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,290
Besides,

643
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,580
even if the deal goes through,

644
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,400
we still have to hand over
a cut to the Imperial Army.

645
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,230
If they find out

646
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,510
we're selling rice
at 4 patacas a kilogram,

647
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,640
how much would be left
for us to pocket?

648
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,820
That's why we need

649
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,699
a trusted middleman—

650
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,170
someone who can handle the buyers

651
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,110
and keep the Imperial Army in the dark.

652
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,110
And if something goes wrong one day,

653
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,909
it's He Xian who handled it—

654
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:20,340
what's that got to do with us?

655
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,969
Mr. Huang, you are truly a leader.

656
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:24,900
You see further than the rest of us.

657
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,400
This deal really does have
to go through him.

658
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:28,400
No,

659
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,670
I… that's not what I meant.

660
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,360
What I'm saying is,

661
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,409
I've got a bad feeling about him.

662
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,670
Mr. Huang,

663
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,110
remember last time?

664
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,070
I was just about to catch
that foreign woman,

665
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,360
and he chose that exact moment
to spill the grain and ruin everything.

666
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,620
What does that tell us?

667
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,120
He did it on purpose.

668
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,820
I don't think so.

669
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:48,840
You've been to his place,

670
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,370
and you know his situation.

671
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,320
Who would spill lifesaving grain

672
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:54,780
for some unrelated foreigner?

673
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,380
Mr. Huang,

674
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,820
believe me or not, this has to be said—

675
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,560
this is a business
worth tens of millions.

676
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,080
What if he gets greedy

677
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,570
and, to make money faster,

678
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,990
delivers the goods to Macau

we'll all

lose our lives.

684
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,860
You're right to remind me.

685
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,830

by the Portuguese Macau government?

will hold an Executive Council meeting

whether to sign the agreement early.

to arrange another meeting with me.

out today wasn't me.

00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,840

00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,100
the government will no longer
consider signing the agreement early.

742
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,630
We've found buyers

743
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,220
and steadied
the Portuguese Macau government.

744
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,530
Now we need

745
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,120
to tackle the shipping.

746
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,110
To pull off a switch like that
under the noses of the Japanese

747
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,240
and their traitors,
and to have a fleet large enough

748
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,300
to move 10 million kilograms at once—

749
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,450
in the entire Lingding Channel,

750
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,910
there's probably only one
that fits the bill.

751
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,440
The Tai Ho Brotherhood?

752
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:50,160
[Grand Hall of the Tai Ho Brotherhood]

753
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,830
Master Sanhe!

754
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,030
Mr. Ma.

755
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,230
[Righteous Ho's Hall]

756
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:56,870
Master Sanhe.

757
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,280
In the dead of night,

758
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,840
braving the Japanese blockade

759
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,170
to come all the way
to my Hengqin headquarters—

760
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,450
what urgent matter brings you here?

761
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,260
Master Sanhe,

762
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:03,880
do you remember

763
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,720
that friend I once mentioned?

764
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,760
The one who

765
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,280
taught me through action

766
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,320
that the most important thing in life

767
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,110
is keeping your word
and staying true to your conscience.

768
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,920
Of course I remember.

769
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,720
I even said

770
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,260
that if you ever found that friend,

771
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,490
be sure

772
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,420
to introduce him to me.

773
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,630
That's exactly why I'm here today—

774
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,090
to personally introduce this friend
to you.

775
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,270
[Righteous Ho's Hall]

776
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,440
[Loyalty lasts forever]

777
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,200
Mr. Ma,

778
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,170
Mr. He,

779
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,170
I admire

780
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,250
your integrity and courage.

781
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:43,920
But

782
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,030
the risks of this matter

783
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,470
are truly immense.

784
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,090
The slightest mishap
could mean ruin for the entire gang.

785
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,420
As the leader,
how could I answer to our ancestors,

786
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,440
or to the families of all our brothers?

787
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,170
Zixia,

788
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,300
this is a matter for the whole gang.

789
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,320
Don't be rash.

790
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,970
Uncle,

791
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,130
what I'm about to say
isn't a matter for the gang—

792
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,670
it's personal.

793
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,060
In the past, I was blind.

794
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,610
I failed to recognize a man of honor

795
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,700
and misunderstood Xian time and again.

796
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,300
Only today have I understood
your true virtue and righteousness.

797
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,510
I'm deeply

798
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,570
ashamed.

799
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,280
So before our ancestors

800
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,380
and every elder and brother of the gang,

801
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,440
I want to offer Xian tea as an apology.

802
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,410
Master Huang,

803
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,530
you mustn't.

804
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,490
Please, get up.

805
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,670
Mr. He,

806
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,340
in the past, the Tai Ho Brotherhood
wronged you.

807
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,900
It's only right for Zixia

808
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,530
to apologize.

809
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,360
Xian,

810
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,620
Master Huang is sincere.

811
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,420
No need to stand on ceremony.

812
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,380
If you don't drink that apology tea,

813
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,970
given his martial skill,

814
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,030
not even nine bulls could pull him up.

815
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,410
Master Huang,

816
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,300
please get up.

817
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,330
Thank you, Xian.

818
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:33,800
Uncle,

819
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,900
now I'll speak

820
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,510
of gang business.

821
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,450
The two gentlemen made it
very clear earlier—

822
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,050
our Tai Ho Brotherhood has always
walked the jianghu by righteousness.

823
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,530
If we all shrink back

824
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,260
at a time like this,

825
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,920
how can we possibly live up
to the phrase "Loyalty lasts forever"?

826
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,470
Uncle,

827
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,130
I, Huang Zixia, the master
of the Haifeng Hall,

828
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,590
am willing to lead all my hall's brothers

829
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,940
in following Xian and Mr. Ma.

830
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,970
We will go through fire and water

831
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,170
without hesitation.

832
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,320
Leader, I respectfully

833
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,850
ask your approval
for our voluntary request.

834
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:14,170
Leader,

835
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,030
all brothers—

836
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,940
the famine in Macau

837
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,170
was forced upon its people
by Huang Gongjie,

838
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,130
helping the Japanese.

839
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,820
Yet in the jianghu,

840
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,720
everyone knows Huang Gongjie

841
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,180
was once a traitor
of our Tai Ho Brotherhood.

842
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:32,230
If we stand by

843
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,840
and do nothing
while this traitor commits evil,

844
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,970
how will the jianghu
see our Tai Ho Brotherhood?

845
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:41,880
Leader,

846
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,340
all brothers of my Haiyun Hall

847
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,990
are willing to transport grain for Macau,

848
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,710
to atone for the sins
of our gang's traitor.

849
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,140
Leader, we await

850
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,300
your permission.

851
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,050
Leader,

852
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,130
our hall's brothers
are also willing to join.

853
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,760
We're willing!
