my friend Miss Qiao Yinwan

who was a treasurer at HSBC in Hong Kong.

199
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,870
So I came to take a look.

200
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,020

I called several newspapers

Is the deceased really
the treasurer of HSBC?

Good afternoon.

259

Based on the condition of the body,

260
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,160
I can confirm that the time of death

261
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,000
was likely between

262

the time of death

268
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,750
he did die just after being brought
to the clinic.

Before he died,

270
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,190
was there any chance
he regained consciousness

271
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,550
or even said something?

272
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,010
Given his injuries, he would've already
been in a deep coma.

Unless he had been forcefully resuscitated

275
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,170

before we can react,

394

Including what we bought earlier,

we've already bought over 5 million.

411
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,650
we still can't hold the closing price.

412
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,030
According to our calculations,

00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,880
the Japanese

414
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,200

500
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,040
Let's start with the current losses.

501
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,610
The Banco Nacional Ultramarino

502
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,220
currently holds over 15 million

503
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,500
Hong Kong dollars,

504
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,010
which exceeds

505
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,740
50% of the bank's total assets.

506
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,040
As for our Chinese merchants,

Tai Fung Bank alone

508
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,210

the total amount exceeds HKD 30 million.

512
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,140

all the assets of these Chinese banks.

514
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,610
This means that

515
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,400
if the Hong Kong dollar continues to fall,

516
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,810
all Chinese banks will immediately
go bankrupt.

517
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,240
And once the Japanese announce that
they're abolishing the Hong Kong dollar,

518
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,470
even the Banco Nacional Ultramarino

519
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,070
will not escape bankruptcy.

522
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,360

532
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,280
is this small victory
even worth celebrating?

533

plus what various businesses spent on
stockpiling supplies—

535
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,610
we've made at least HKD 50 million.

536
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,430
That's enough to
help the Empire manufacture

537
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,430
over 500 Zero fighters.

538
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,180
Moreover, Macau's finances

539
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,050
have been completely crushed by us.

540

What I've acquired

543
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,180
is not 50 million—

544
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,180
it's 120 million Hong Kong dollars.

545
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,210
If we spend all of it according to plan,

546
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,330
what we can earn for the Empire

547
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,510

Unfortunately,

550
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,820
Macau's market is too small.

551
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,270
So we still have HKD 70 million remaining.

552
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,940
In any case,
notify all Japanese businesses

Liang Yanming and the others won't say.

750
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:04,920
However,

751
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,630
since the amount is so large,

752
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,220
Wanhua's father was concerned

753
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,080
and insisted on knowing.
Lok Pak finally revealed

754
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:19,060
that it's a payment for goods
from Rodrigues.

755
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,200
Tai Fung Bank has already purchased
over HKD 20 to 30 million,

756
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,550
and it's still not enough?

757
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,210
They need to borrow tens of millions more?

758
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,090
What exactly are they buying
from Rodrigues?

759
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,920
That, I really don't know.

760
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:41,090
[Banco Nacional Ultramarino]

761
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,350
Nonsense.

762
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,280
Who told you

763
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,550
that I have Lee Kong Chian's inventory?

764
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,170
Mr. Rodrigues,

765
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,710
you don't need to hide it anymore.

766
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,590
Yesterday, you filed with
the Port Authority

767
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,490
about a fleet originally headed for Europe

768
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,690
but rerouted back to Macau.

769
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,170
The fleet is enormous,

770
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,570
and it just departed from Southeast Asia.

771
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,880
If the cargo aboard isn't
Lee's rubber shipment,

772
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,610
then tell me,

773
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,390
what else could it be?

774
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,110
Your Sawa Agency is really well-informed.

775
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,190
Fine.

776
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,300
I admit it.

777
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,740
The goods are in my possession.

778
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,360
But

779
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,950
I already have a buyer.

780
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,870
I can't sell the same goods twice, can I?

781
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,060
But your buyer

782
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,370
is still borrowing money everywhere.

783
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,460
They clearly can't afford this shipment.

784
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,880
Even if they could afford it,

785
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,770
shouldn't the highest bidder win?

786
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,630
How about this—

787
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,800
whatever Hengfengyu offers,

788
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,440
our Lyun Coeng will add 10% more.

789
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,200
Another 10%?

790
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,740
Mr. Saito,

791
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:48,370
do you have any idea
how large this shipment is?

792
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,440
It's worth over 13 million U.S. dollars.

793
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,900
Adding 10% makes it
15 million U.S. dollars.

794
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,310
That's not a small amount.

795
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,500
Fifteen million U.S. dollars...

796
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,190
That much?

797
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,440
It's only 15 million U.S. dollars.

798
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,340
Converted into Hong Kong dollars
at the current

799
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,920
exchange rate, that would be...

800
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,950
Wait, hold on.

801
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,690
For this deal, I only accept U.S. dollars,

802
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,970
not Hong Kong dollars.

803
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,210
The Hong Kong dollar is the main currency
for business transactions in Macau.

804
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,700
Mr. Rodrigues, your request

805
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,190
is somewhat unreasonable.

806
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,610
Haven't you seen
how badly the Hong Kong dollar

807
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,010
has fallen lately?

808
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,320
Who knows what will happen next—

809
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,120
whether it will continue to drop

810
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,820
or even completely collapse?

811
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,850
I know.

812
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,380
That's merely a temporary fluctuation.

813
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,240
Hasn't the news already reported

814
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,860
that HSBC recently issued

815
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,790
only 10 million Hong Kong dollars?

816
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,180
So I believe

817
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,070
the Hong Kong dollar will definitely
rebound soon.

818
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,550
Gentlemen,

819
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,140
if I may be frank,

820
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,730
the newspapers in Hong Kong now

821
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,380
just write
whatever your Japanese Imperial Army

822
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,510
wants them to write.

823
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,210
They follow your orders.

824
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,000
What if they issued

825
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,040
more than 10 million Hong Kong dollars?

826
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,280
In short, I cannot take this risk.

827
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,430
Well then,

828
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:12,900
in the coming days,

829
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,730
I will use facts to show you

830
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,860
that the future value

831
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,320
of the Hong Kong dollar
will certainly rise.

832
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:30,690
You're planning to drive up
the Hong Kong dollar's value?

833
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:34,740
This is Rodrigues's condition.

834
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,090
Only when the exchange rate
returns to above HKD 3

835
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,710
will he consider cooperating with us.

836
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,860
And he has promised to
keep it confidential

837
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,850
from the Chinese merchants.

838
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:47,120
We still have HKD 70 million.

839
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,090
If we don't support the market,

840
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,130
how can we use this pile of

841
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,330
soon-to-be-worthless Hong Kong dollars

842
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,890
to buy the rubber he has?

843
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,210
But our mission from Headquarters

844
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,270
is to dump
these unbacked Hong Kong dollars

845
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,950
and thereby control
Macau's financial system!

846
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,870
The mission has already been accomplished.

847
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:10,670
Wouldn't it be safer to avoid creating
unnecessary complications?

848
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,980
It's precisely because we

849
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,100
need to ensure the mission's success

850
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,320
that I must compete with
the Chinese merchants for this rubber!

851
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,310
If the Hong Kong dollars in the hands of
the Chinese merchants become

852
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:22,060
rubber that countries desperately need,

853
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,190
it would be like allowing them
to revitalize their assets—

854
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:28,360
turning waste paper back into gold!

855
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,380
And when that happens,

856
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,580
how are we supposed to control
Macau's financial system?

857
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,600
So this matter

858
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,150
is settled.

859
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,360
Gentlemen,

860
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,300
allow me to make some introductions.

861
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,680
These two are
President Saito of Lyun Coeng Company

862
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,000
and General Manager Ogata
from Seikei Bank,

863
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,730
which provides financial backing
to Lyun Coeng.

864
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,610
Here is Chairman Ma Wanqi
of Hengfengyu Bank

865
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,320
and

866
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,680
Manager He Xian,
representative of Tai Fung Bank,

867
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,680
which provides financial backing
for Hengfengyu.
