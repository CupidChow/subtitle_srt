[Silent Tides]

00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,979
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,350
Look, that's Macau waters ahead.

4
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,690
What's that?

5
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,960
It's a boat!

6
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,310
Hurry! Cut the engine!

7
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,970
Zixia!

8
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,190
Shut the engine down.

9
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,670
Fire the flare!

10
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,320
Come on, get down.

11
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,829
Pals,

12
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:47,530
let's start the boat.

13
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,590
Oh, no.

14
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,610
Wanqi is planning to draw them away.

15
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,460
Over there!

16
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,670
Over there! Row that way!

17
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,340
Fire at them!

18
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,860
Comrades,

19
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,620
get ready for battle!

20
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,280
-Yes!
-Yes!

21
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,750
Major Yamaguchi.

22
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,900
I was ordered to arrest Qiao Yinwan.

23
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,760
Why did you
bring me to the Government House?

24
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,560
Actually, Qiao Yinwan is right here now.

25
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,780
How is that possible?

26
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,030
We've been following her.

27
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,960
Just this evening,

28
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,330
she was picked up by a car
flying the Portuguese flag

29
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,790
and taken directly
to the Government House.

30
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,760
Sir,

31
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,180
that woman is coming out.

32
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,880
About the results of our meeting,
I will report

33
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,519
in detail
to Governor De Solaire when I return.

34
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,160
I will surely spare no effort
to make the cooperation happen.

35
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,649
Thank you for your help, Mr. Lok Pak.

36
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,000
Freeze!

37
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Major Yamaguchi?

38
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,340
Your Excellency the Governor.

39
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,010
What are you doing?

40
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,070
Your Excellency the Governor,

41
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,540
I am Deputy Chief Yamaguchi Hisami

42
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,790
of the Intelligence Agency
from the Imperial Army stationed in Macau.

43
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,380
By order of General Yazaki,

44
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:43,990
I'm here to arrest this woman.

45
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,990
Arrest Miss Qiao?

46
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,970
On what grounds?

47
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,960
What on earth is this about?

48
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,750
Your Excellency the Governor,
here's the thing.

49
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,240
Recently,
the underground anti-Japanese forces

50
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,530
stole a batch

51
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,800
of important strategic materials
in Hong Kong.

52
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,400
Based on our investigation,

53
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,830
this woman, Qiao Yinwan, is

54
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,200
a key participant in this theft.

55
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,170
Therefore, I'm here to arrest her.

56
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,410
Governor Isoya,

57
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,680
I, on behalf of the Macau government,

58
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,710
came in good faith to discuss with you

59
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,510
about the implementation
of military currency in Macau.

60
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,050
Even though we haven't
reached a conclusion yet,

61
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,710
there's no need to use my fiancée
to threaten me.

62
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,960
If this is the case,

63
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,280
our cooperation will just end here.

64
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,420
Mr. Lok Pak,

65
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,110
there's been a misunderstanding.

66
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,530
I knew nothing about this beforehand.

67
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,320
I doubt that.

68
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,080
How else could there be
such a coincidence?

69
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,610
I brought my fiancée
to the Government House,

70
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,420
and your men were waiting
at the door to arrest her.

71
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,680
If this isn't a threat,

72
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,960
then what is it?

73
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,850
You just said Miss Qiao committed a crime.

74
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,140
Is there any evidence?

75
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,630
Well, we're still verifying that.

76
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,920
And that theft you mentioned,

77
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,130
when did it take place?

78
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,660
About an hour and a half ago.

79
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,130
Nonsense!

80
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,830
Miss Qiao has been attending

81
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,670
a special welcome dinner party
that I hosted

82
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,880
for Mr. Lok Pak.

83
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,320
I am the witness.

84
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,740
How could she possibly have time
to be involved in any theft?

85
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,080
You're right.

86
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,060
Mr. Lok Pak
represents the Macau government

87
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,620
and was invited to discuss
the military currency cooperation plan.

88
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,620
He is an honored guest of the Empire.

89
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,690
Even I wouldn't dare to neglect him.

90
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,480
You bunch of bastards,

91
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,330
how dare you slander his fiancée

92
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,210
and sabotage
the Empire's major cooperation plan?

93
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,100
Such audacity!

94
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,540
Sorry.

95
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,770
Apologize to Mr. Lok Pak
and Miss Qiao now!

96
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,620
We're sorry. Please forgive us.

97
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,940
Regarding this matter,

98
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,670
I will
severely hold Yazaki Kanju accountable

99
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
and demand an explanation from him.

100
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,540
Get lost now.

101
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,250
Yes.

102
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,130
Mr. Lok Pak,

103
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,510
Miss Qiao,

104
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,250
I sincerely apologize
for this misunderstanding.

105
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,620
Please forgive us.

106
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,100
I promise

107
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,240
that this will absolutely
never happen again.

108
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,040
I also hope that you, Mr. Lok Pak,

109
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,310
won't let this affect your mood

110
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,450
or our cooperation plans.

111
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,420
Since you, Your Excellency the Governor,
really didn't know about this,

112
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,060
then...

113
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,690
Then we'll just

114
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,100
let it go.

115
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,360
Please.

116
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,159
Let's go.

117
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,570
Thank you.

118
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,310
My pleasure.

119
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,200
When He Xian approached me,

120
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,270
I really had no idea

121
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,290
that you were involved
in such a risky plan.

122
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,760
I was even more surprised

123
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,770
that you had the audacity

124
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,710
to risk your life
dealing with the Japanese.

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,390
Compared to my brother,

126
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,120
I've done very little.

127
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,950
Thankfully, it turned out well in the end.

128
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,440
Also, I once thought

129
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,950
that He Xian was

130
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,289
misleading you

131
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,870
and hurting you.

132
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,070
But now it seems

133
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,350
that he really does

134
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,660
care about you as a friend

135
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,150
and isn't so cold-hearted after all.

136
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,190
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
gone to such lengths

137
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,330
to come up with this plan,

138
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,590
having me protect you.

139
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,110
What's wrong?

140
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,230
I'm wondering
how Xian and the others are doing.

141
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,810
Chief,

142
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,560
it's not that our men
didn't give it their all.

143
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,780
The guerrillas suddenly attacked

144
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,850
with a dozen boats

145
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,940
and hundreds of men.

146
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,540
Our men couldn't hold out,
so we had to retreat.

147
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,490
I'm telling the truth.

148
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,330
If I'm lying,

149
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,380
may I be struck down by lightning.

150
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:37,880
Otherwise,

151
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,190
I...

152
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,850
I wouldn't have lost so many of my men.

153
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,750
Were the printing plates

154
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,370
on the boat you sank

155
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,040
or the one that got away?

156
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,580
The boat that escaped was

157
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,020
apparently slower than the others.

158
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,250
It should be...

159
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,400
Wait.

160
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,710
You just said the firefight at sea

161
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,470
happened less than an hour ago.

162
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,270
That's right.

163
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,850
If those printing plates were
really on that boat,

164
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,400
they must be hiding the goods

165
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,750
somewhere in Macau now.

166
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,180
But Macau is so big,

167
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,330
and we don't know who did it.

168
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,850
It's really hard to track them down.

169
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,080
What about He Xian from Tai Fung Bank?

170
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,120
Any movements from him these days?

171
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,210
He Xian?

172
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,110
Chief,

173
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,350
why are you asking about He Xian now...

174
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,210
Answer me.

175
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,930
Tai Fung Bank

176
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,380
put up a notice 2 days ago,

177
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,090
saying they'd be
doing inventory for 3 days.

178
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,280
He Xian must be inside the bank.

179
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,110
"Must be"?

180
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,310
Have your men

181
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,060
actually seen him in person?

182
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,560
Well,

183
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,780
actually not.

184
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,670
However,

185
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,440
the bank has a regulation

186
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,070
that during inventory, the General Manager
and other managers must be present.

187
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,850
No one else is allowed to enter.

188
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,280
He Xian is the manager there,

189
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,800
so he must be inside the bank.

190
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,490
Plus, my men have confirmed

191
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,220
that his wife delivers food
to the bank every day.

192
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,680
This information is definitely correct.

193
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,520
Let's go.

194
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,300
Master Sanhe, I've got to go.

195
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,190
Okay. Zixia,

196
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,340
escort Xian home.

197
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,350
You in the back, place it properly.

198
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,410
The intelligent agents are at your door.

199
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,740
What should we do, Xian?

200
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,990
Go straight and keep driving.

201
00:11:59,160 --> 00:11:59,830
Okay.

202
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,520
Coming!

203
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,570
Who is it?

204
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,720
It's you.

205
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,180
What's the matter,

206
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,580
barging into someone's home late at night?

207
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,240
Who are you?

208
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,060
How dare you break

209
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,640
into a private residence
in the dead of night?

210
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:18,950
Who is that man?

211
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,040
This is Colonel Sawa,

212
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,370
the Agency Chief from the Imperial Army
stationed in Macau.

213
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,690
It's already 2 AM.

214
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,850
How weird.

215
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,510
Mr. He isn't

216
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,020
even home.

217
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,180
What are you going to do?

218
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,240
What are you doing?

219
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,090
I told you Xian is resting.

220
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,400
This is so rude of you.

221
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,300
You can't do this!

222
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,820
Agency Chief Sawa?

223
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,260
Captain Huang?

224
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,390
Who is there?

225
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:09,700
Xian?

226
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,800
Be careful.

227
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,040
What's happening?

228
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,610
It's the intelligent agent.
Go open the door.

229
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,180
I...

230
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,100
Hurry!

231
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:18,780
Okay.

232
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,450
Who is it? Coming!

233
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,830
It's you.

234
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,450
I told you Xian is resting.

235
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,940
This is so rude of you.

236
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,810
You can't do this!

237
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,980
Agency Chief Sawa?

238
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,240
Captain Huang?

239
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,190
Xian,

240
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,260
you seem to have had
quite a few drinks tonight.

241
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,140
It's my son's birthday,
and I was too happy.

242
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,800
So I had a couple extra drinks.

243
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,940
I had a bit too much,

244
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,600
so I just went upstairs to bed.

245
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,020
What's going on?

246
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,210
Chief Sawa, Captain Huang,

247
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,400
what brings you here at my home so late?

248
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,540
Mr. He,

249
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,300
have you been home all night?

250
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:03,710
Daddy.

251
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,460
Of course.

252
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,710
Little girl,

253
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,320
you're so cute.

254
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,520
Little boy,

255
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,540
it's your birthday today, right?

256
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,490
Mm.

257
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,820
Your daddy was busy today

258
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,570
and couldn't stay home for your birthday.

259
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,860
Are you upset?

260
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,810
Daddy has been home the whole time

261
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,540
and celebrated my birthday with me.

262
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,780
Why would I be upset?

263
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,730
Little girl.

264
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,560
Today,

265
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,010
was your brother's birthday cake

266
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,140
delicious?

267
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,460
Yes.

268
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,820
Yes?

269
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,730
So how many pieces did you have?

270
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,450
Two.

271
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,540
Two pieces?

272
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,660
It must be really tasty.

273
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,420
I'd like to try some too.

274
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,680
So,

275
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,090
besides you and your brother,

276
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,190
who else

277
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,540
had some

278
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,970
of that delicious birthday cake?

279
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,250
Mommy and Grandpa had some, too.

280
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,330
Mommy and Grandpa?

281
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,810
Why didn't your daddy

282
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,260
have any?

283
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,160
Let me guess.

284
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,920
Because

285
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,260
he wasn't home,

286
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,210
right?

287
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,180
No,

288
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,090
it was because the piece for Daddy

289
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,590
had flowers on it.

290
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,950
I liked them,

291
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,680
so Daddy gave his piece to me

292
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,280
and didn't have any himself.

293
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,530
Chief Sawa,

294
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,810
Captain Huang,

295
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,330
I'll ask you again.

296
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,800
Why have you come to my home
in the middle of the night?

297
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,190
What exactly is this about?

298
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,420
Xian, calm down.

299
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,810
We're just here investigating a case.

300
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,010
You're investigating a case at my home?

301
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,210
Captain Huang,
if you don't explain clearly,

302
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,080
I'll call the police.

303
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,640
Mr. He,

304
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,260
why don't you pick it up?

305
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,710
May I help you?

306
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,440
Hello?

307
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,570
Xian, it's me.

308
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,560
Dr. Ke?

309
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,190
What is it?

310
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,880
Wanqi is here with me.

311
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,410
Come over as soon as you can.

312
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,329
Mr. He, I have a car.

313
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,609
How about I drive you to the clinic?

314
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,829
Don't bother.

315
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,270
It's nothing.

316
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,599
It's not easy to get a taxi at night.

317
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,400
Besides,

318
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,620
because of the misunderstanding just now,

319
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,930
I've caused trouble for your family.

320
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,180
Consider this

321
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,050
my apology.

322
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,200
What's wrong?

323
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,680
Mr. He, are you afraid to accept a ride?

324
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,840
Is there

325
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,190
anything inconvenient on Mr. Ma's side?

326
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,550
Since you insist,

327
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,490
I won't stand on ceremony.

328
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,550
Please.

329
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,790
Dr. Ke!

330
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:10,950
Yes?

331
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,580
Xian.

332
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,950
I rushed over as soon as I got the call.

333
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,970
Chief Sawa and Captain Huang
happened to come to my house

334
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,970
and insisted on giving me a ride here.

335
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:21,830
Where is Wanqi?

336
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,790
Inside.

337
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,880
Wanqi?

338
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,120
Wanqi!

339
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,250
Ms Ming,

340
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,400
Wanqi was perfectly fine
when he and I were

341
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,710
doing inventory at Tai Fung Bank today.

342
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,710
How did he suddenly end up like this?

343
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,880
It's all my fault.

344
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,100
I noticed Mr. Ma had been busy lately,

345
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,790
so I made him some late-night snack.

346
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,970
But while he was drinking the soup,

347
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,860
he accidentally choked on it.

348
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,180
What?

349
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,840
Look.

350
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,970
Choked on soup

351
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,770
and passed out, coughing blood?

352
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,160
Hey, Dr. Ke,

353
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,580
do you think

354
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,580
this is possible?

355
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,290
Of course not.

356
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,030
So you're saying

357
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,450
that Mr. Ma ended up like this

358
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,510
for some other reason?

359
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,010
That's right.

360
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,420
I initially heard it was because he
choked on soup and coughed up blood.

361
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,420
I also thought that was impossible.

362
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,750
But Mr. Ma

363
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,660
has been coughing severely lately.

364
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,620
So I gave him

365
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,080
a chest examination

366
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,710
and found out the truth.

367
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,320
What truth?

368
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,750
Mr. Ma

369
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,940
has tuberculosis in his lungs.

370
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,590
It's already quite serious.

371
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,070
The choking was just a trigger
for the bleeding.

372
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,740
Tuberculosis is the real cause.

373
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,550
That's a terminal illness!

374
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,450
Hold on.

375
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,490
Dr. Ke,

376
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,120
are you

377
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:55,940
sure of it?

378
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,790
Captain Huang,

379
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,920

387
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,250
why do you think that the incident
about the printing plates was

their doing?

389
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,390
It couldn't be anyone else.

390
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,320
We've been to He Xian's home

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,950

celebrating his son's birthday.

00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,880
He couldn't have been in Hong Kong.

00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,640
I think Ma Wanqi seems rather suspicious.

00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,140
How could he possibly drink some soup

396
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,930

are the results still not out yet?

403

cause him to cough up blood

00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,800
Ask me anything you want.

569
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,750
X-Xian, you've got me wrong.

570
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,920
I was discussing something else with them.

571
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:40,330
How could I possibly arrange for someone
to monitor you?

572
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:41,990
Really not?

573
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,190
Really not. Trust me.

574
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,380
That's good then.

575
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,250
I'm relieved to hear that.

576
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,600
After all, I'm a businessman.

577
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,860
If I always have
the Special Operations Team following me,

578
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,460
what will others think of me?

579
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,720
Those who know

580
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,940
might think Captain Huang
cares about his friend,

581
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,710
providing me with free bodyguards.

582
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,040
But those who don't know

583
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,230
might think that Agency Chief Sawa is

584
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,920
treating me as an anti-Japanese rebel,

585
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,710
ready to take action against me
at any moment.

586
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,080
How can I continue
doing business normally in this case?

587
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,510
Xian,

588
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,470
you're overthinking this.

589
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,010
That's not true.

590
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,940
Absolutely not.

591
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:14,190
You know very well
whether it's true or not, Captain Huang.

592
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,400
I just want to say

593
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,250
I don't want to see them anymore.

594
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,320
Otherwise,

595
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,600
I might as well consider myself
an anti-Japanese rebel

596
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,130
and turn myself in to Agency Chief Sawa.

597
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,450
If it comes to that point,

598
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,990
I promise that I'll say anything I know

599
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,290
and not hide any secrets.

600
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,690
Like all the things that you,
Captain Huang, have confessed to and done

601
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:35,100
and all the documents you've signed
and left behind,

602
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,840
I will hand over them all

603
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,040
to the Imperial Army.

604
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,690
Then there would be
no need for surveillance.

605
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,400
How about that, Captain Huang?

606
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,120
X-Xian, you must be joking.

607
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,320
I promise

608
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,920
that things like what happened today

609
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,970
will absolutely never happen again.

610
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:48,530
For real?

611
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,060
For real.

612
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,770
If anyone dares
to disturb your peace again,

613
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:57,360
I, Huang Gongjie,
will be the first to teach them a lesson.

614
00:32:59,180 --> 00:32:59,940
Good.

615
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,950
My wife and children are waiting
for me for dinner.

616
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:04,950
I'll be going now.

617
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,120
Take care.

618
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,510
Now he's starting to threaten me.

619
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,080
Mr. Huang,

620
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,350
why do you have to swallow your pride
in front of him?

621
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,160
I think we should just go all the way
and have him...

622
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,320
You think we can finish him that easily?

623
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,140
He has leverage over us.

624
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,010
Besides, things are different now.

625
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,140
He's now

626
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,370
the Acting General Manager
of Tai Fung Bank

627
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,920
and the so-called Chinese Business Manager

628
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,720
of Banco Nacional Ultramarino.

629
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,290
We really can't do anything to him.

630
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,250
So what do we do next?

631
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,850
Continue the surveillance?

632
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,300
The Chief has ordered us

633
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,290
to report his movements every day.

634
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,270
But...

635
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,420
But what?

636
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:08,840
Huh?

637
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:12,130
If you dare let him discover you again,

638
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,130
I won't spare you!

639
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,360
Qiuzai,

640
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,050
we need to monitor He Xian

641
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,650
while not letting him find out.

642
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,949
What should we do?

643
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,380
Why are you asking me?

644
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,780
I have no idea, either!

645
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,400
Bottom line is

646
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,780
that Chief Sawa
must receive daily reports.

647
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,550
He Xian must not be alarmed.

648
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,900
Figure out the rest ourselves!

649
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,130
I'll help you manage Tai Fung Bank for now

650
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,760
and hand it back when you recover.

651
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,670
Mr. Lin is handling things in Hengfengyu,

652
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,590
so there's no problem.

653
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,090
Okay.

654
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,720
Wanqi,

655
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,790
just focus on getting better.

656
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,820
Leave all business matters to Xian.

657
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,130
Thank you for your help, Xian.

658
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:17,790
No worries.

659
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,840
You could give this soup to me.

660
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,170
I'll have the staff in the kitchen
keep it warm.

661
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,130
Xian, Mrs. He,

662
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,130
so you're here, too.

663
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:27,670
Yes.

664
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,170
Wanqi,

665
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,070
I made this lung-nourishing soup
following Mrs. He's recipe.

666
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,220
Drink it while it's warm.

667
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,200
Didn't Ms Ming tell you

668
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,400
that I'm in a meeting?

669
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,350
Please leave.

670
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,070
Xian and his wife aren't outsiders.

671
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,440
We're in the middle of something.

672
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:50,900
Get out.

673
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:52,970
Wanqi.

674
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,470
Leave.

675
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,760
Take care, Mr. He, Mrs. He.

676
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:18,820
Qiwen,

677
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,240
Wanqi usually

678
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,400
goes along with Baixin.

679
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,080
What was that just now?

680
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,290
Can't you tell?

681
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,010
When Baixin came
to learn soup-making from me,

682
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,070
she talked about Wanqi's condition.

683
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,820
I just realized today

684
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,380
that Wanqi hasn't told her
he has tuberculosis.

685
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,790
Why?

686
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,710
Tuberculosis is incurable.

687
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,120
What other reason could there be?

688
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,570
He doesn't want to be a burden to Baixin

689
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,900
and would rather play the bad guy himself.

690
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,650
Now that I think about it,

691
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,820
I was helping Wanqi

692
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,100
pick an engagement ring a few days ago.

693
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:51,170
[Kiang Wu Elementary School]

694
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:51,820
Mr. Liang,

695
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,030
don't overwork yourself lately.

696
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,560
Remember to take more rest.

697
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:55,820
Alright.

698
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,360
Mr. Liang,

699
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,700
I understand

700
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,360
that you're under great pressure
with the recent prices.

701
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,470
But in Zhongshan,

702
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,400
the enemy is implementing
extremely strict inspections.

703
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,130
And in Macau,

704
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,780
Japanese businesses are
snapping everything up regardless of cost,

705
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,590
driving prices through the roof.

706
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,990
At current prices,

707
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:15,650
it's already very difficult
to purchase goods.

708
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,130
I understand.

709
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,970
The entire rear area is

710
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,960
almost entirely dependent
on this year's new airlift, the Hump,

711
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,130
to maintain

712
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,110
our pitiful amount of imports.

713
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,050
But how much can the air force
actually transport?

714
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,090
Not to mention that they have to fly
over the Himalayas.

715
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:35,740
You know what?

716
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,920
Dozens of aircraft crash every month.

717
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:41,510
The Nationalist Government
has no choice now

718
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,240
but to use Customs Gold Units

719
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,490
as an emergency measure.

720
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,300
But our limited gold reserves

721
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,770
won't last long.

722
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:52,070
The mainland's local specialties can't be
transported out to exchange for money,

723
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,840
so we must find other ways to raise funds.

724
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,950
You mean...

725
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,450
A task has come down from Chongqing.

726
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,490
They want the Macau party branch to assist

727
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,420
in using Macau's financial market

728
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:09,050
to urgently issue a batch

729
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,720
of wartime government bonds globally

730
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,320
to address the pressing needs
of the rear area.

731
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,990
Issuing government bonds isn't

732
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,300
something ordinary financial institutions

733
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,490
can handle.

734
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,590
I'm afraid we have to mobilize

735
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,900
the entire financial sector in Macau

736
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,150
to collectively underwrite

737
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,150
for this to work.

738
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,200
The Chinese merchants are
easy to convince.

739
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,570
Tai Fung Bank can take the lead

740
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,440
to organize all banks of Chinese merchants

741
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,840
to underwrite the bonds.

742
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,170
The key is Banco Nacional Ultramarino.

743
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,800
In terms of scale and reputation,

744
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,200
it's still No.1 in Macau.

745
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
Moreover,

746
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,880
only BNU can handle overseas issuance.

747
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,380
Therefore,

748
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,070
we must get them involved.

749
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,090
I'll figure out a way to handle this.

750
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,970
Good.

751
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,250
Thank you for your efforts then.

752
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,760
Our Macau branch

753
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,150
will definitely increase
promotional efforts

754
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,080
to support government bond sales.

755
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,800
Let's do it this way.

756
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:03,760
That's

757
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,360
my detailed plan
for government bond underwriting.

758
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,260
Overall,

759
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,780
the Chinese government's

760
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,780
extensive promotion
of these wartime government bonds is

761
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,940
evident to all.

762
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,090
With reasonable underwriting commissions,

763
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,340
if Banco Nacional Ultramarino
can participate in it,

764
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,010
we will also obtain

765
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,650
exclusive overseas underwriting rights,

766
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,110
making this a secure
and profitable business.

767
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,370
Whether it's feasible

768
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,780
depends on the directors' approval.

769
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,170
In my opinion, Manager He's proposal is

770
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,200
detailed and specific.

771
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,030
I don't see any problems.

772
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:37,340
Moreover, all major Chinese banks in Macau

773
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,530
have actively

774
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,530
participated
in this government bond underwriting.

775
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,400
If BNU stays out of this,

776
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,340
it wouldn't match its position

777
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,530
as Macau's No.1 bank.

778
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,270
This won't do, no matter what.

779
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,570
Therefore,

780
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,090
I'm in favor of Banco Nacional Ultramarino

781
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,420
participating
in this government bond underwriting plan.

782
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,360
This matter

783
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,740
requires more caution, I'm afraid.

784
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,530
What?

785
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,130
Are there any problems
with the underwriting plan?

786
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,130
Manager He,

787
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,090
your plan is fine.

788
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:09,940
However,

789
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,900
I want to remind everyone

790
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,220
that if a bank publicly underwrites
Chinese government bonds,

791
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,920
will the Japanese allow it?

792
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,940
What will they do?

793
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,070
So what if the Japanese don't allow it?

794
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:25,240
The bonds our bank is
issuing this time are

795
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,650
both reasonable and legal.

796
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,800
Does BNU need to ask

797
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,630
the Japanese for permission
to conduct normal business?

798
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,150
Indeed, that's logical.

799
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:37,720
But this is still issuing bonds
for the Chinese government.

800
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,940
If we Portuguese
get too involved in Chinese affairs,

801
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,740
as domineering as the Japanese are,

802
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,940
we might bring trouble upon ourselves.

803
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,450
Mr. Antonio,

804
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,030
Mr. Aveiro,

805
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,610
so regarding Chinese affairs,

806
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,320
the Portuguese had better not interfere,

807
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,420
or help,

808
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,980
or participate in them.

809
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:57,930
Is that what you two mean?

810
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,180
Very well then.

811
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:05,260
I'd like to ask all directors present

812
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,460
to recall something.

813
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,010
Since the Pacific War broke out,

814
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:11,760
the Japanese have repeatedly
caused trouble for no reason,

815
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,900
pushing Macau to the brink several times.

816
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,850
How did Macau survive these crises?

817
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,920
Was it solely through Portuguese efforts,

818
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,320
or through Sino-Portuguese cooperation?

819
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,840
Or more often, it was the Chinese people's
relentless fighting at the front

820
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,040
that turned the tide.

821
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,320
You're always
thinking about not offending the Japanese

822
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,750
to avoid trouble.

823
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,420
But looking at those past events,

824
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,480
when did Macau ever provoke trouble?

825
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:35,110
It was always the Japanese
stirring up trouble for no reason

826
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,800
and trying to destroy Macau!

827
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,700
Do you want to avoid disaster

828
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,050
by pleasing the Japanese?

829
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,630
Given the way they are,
is that even possible?

830
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,420
Macau

831
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,650
does not belong to the Portuguese.

832
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:51,440
You want Portuguese and Chinese

833
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,110
to stay out of each other's affairs.

834
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,150
But as the Chinese proverb goes,

835
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,940
if the lips are gone,
the teeth will feel the cold, too.

836
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,070
Be it the Portuguese

837
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,080
or the Chinese,

838
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,420
since we live on the same land,

839
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,650
looking out for each other is
our only choice.
