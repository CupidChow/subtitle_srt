[Episode 28]

3
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,810
Now the entire Macau

4
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,289
has been completely blockaded

5
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:42,560
by the Japanese.

6
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,759
The fleet can't leave at all now.

7
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,539
Besides, the shipment is enormous.

8

Just unloading them

9
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,009
took 2 whole days.

10
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,070
With so little time,

11
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,320
how could we possibly
transport everything?

12
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,650
Even if we could,

13
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,430
Macau is tiny.

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,930
Is there a building or a street

15
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,290
that the Sawa Agency doesn't know?

16
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,950
With such a massive shipment,

17
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,290
where could we possibly hide it?

18
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,410
What Xian means is that

19
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,960
everyone should immediately gather
all available manpower

20
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,340
and seize as much of the supplies
as possible.

21
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,400
As for where to hide it,

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,910
he's already working on a solution.

23
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,170
What kind of solution?

24
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,340
Xian said

25
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,840
that for now, the only option

26
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,130
is to take another risk
and use the blind spot

27
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,530
right under their noses.

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,370

29
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,310
Why did you need to see me so urgently?

And this matter

35
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,840
must remain secret

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,040

44
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,260
Chief,

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,440
I've heard that Consul Imai
is a veteran spy.

46
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,860
He's spent most of his life
working in China

47
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,750
and has headed
several intelligence agencies.

48
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,970
With his experience,

49
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,600
if he actually connects
with the Portuguese Macau government

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,660
and spots our flaw,

51
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,030
we may lose control of the situation.

52
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,900
Then let's just not let him connect

53
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,130
with the Portuguese Macau government.

54
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,960
Not let him connect?

55
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,980
I know Imai well.

56
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,370
He is an experienced spy
and a China expert.

57
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,210
That's true.

58
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,970
But aside from his seniority,

59
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,160
he's actually foolish and timid,

60
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,940
a complete incompetent person.

61
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,090
Otherwise,

62
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,540
why would I recommend him
to serve as consul in Macau?

[Liu Jike's Egg Cake]

64
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,140
Mr. Imai,

65
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,580
are you aware
that the Portuguese Macau government

66
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,240
[Imai Keiichi,
the New Japanese Consul in Macau]

67
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,500
is the prime suspect
in the assassination of Consul Fukue?

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,360
What?

69
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,660
The previous cargo ship attack
was carried out

70
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,570
by the Portuguese Macau government

71
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,030
in secret collusion
with the Allied Forces.

72
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,990
Mr. Fukue was outraged

73
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,690
and intended to recommend to the Command

74
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,330
that Macau be occupied by force.

75
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,810
However,

76
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,740
we didn't expect
that just after he left the consulate,

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,430
he would be killed by a masked assassin.

78
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,830
So if this wasn't

79
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,960
the work
of the Portuguese Macau government,

80
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,340
who else could it have been?

81
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,160
I see.

82
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,050
So that's why Mr. Fukue was assassinated.

83
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,250
If you don't stay vigilant

84
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,690

with the Portuguese Macau government

86
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,790
I'm afraid you will follow the same path
as Mr. Fukue.

87
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,670

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,159

what should I do then?

92

Don't worry, Mr. Imai.

93

94

to the Portuguese Macau government

and then take the bait by chasing us.

190
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,970
That way, you'll have more time

191
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,250
to move them.

192
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,020
How can that work?

193
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,130
The Japanese have sealed off

194
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,730
all the waters around Macau.

195
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,360
If you sail out now,

196
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,410
that's suicide.

197
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,630
That's right, Master Sanhe.

198
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,690
You can't sail out.

199
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,630
Mr. He,

200
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,300
usually you're the one in charge.

201
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,650
This time,

202
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,870
let me decide.

203
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,100
Brothers

204
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,960
of the Tai Ho Brotherhood!

205
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,580
Yes!

206
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,250
Since the founding

207
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,720
of our Tai Ho Brotherhood, in honor of

208
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,410
the spirit of the Song dynasty's
Prime Minister,

209
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,030
General Wen,

210
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,240
our ancestors

211
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,340
have laid down rules for us to follow:

212
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,740
every brother of the gang

213
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,290
must uphold loyalty and honor in jianghu.

214
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,270
After all these years

215
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,450
of sailing the seas

216
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,700
and making our living in the underworld,

217
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,870
brothers,

218
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,390
please ask yourselves honestly:

219
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,510
have we truly

220
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,790
put loyalty and honor first?

221
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,640
I'm ashamed to say it,

222
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,240
but we haven't.

223
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,050
Including myself, as the Leader,

224
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,500
sometimes

225
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,300
we've put profit above all else.

226
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,420
That's why outsiders

227
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,620
see us as

228
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,550
disreputable pirates

229
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,870
and smugglers.

230
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,290
To be honest,

231
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,720
they're not entirely wrong.

232
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,600
But in the past few years,

233
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,040
when we set profit aside,

234
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,400
stood up for our country and our people,

235
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,410
and fought against the Japanese,

236
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,910
only then did we feel
we could finally straighten our backs

237
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,150
and stand as men with dignity.

238
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,960
What man has ever lived that will not die?

239
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,780
Let my loyalty
shine in the pages of history.

240
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,560
Everyone,

241
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,100
it's time to make a decision.

242
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,280
Brothers!

243
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,640
What's your choice?

244
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,220
We'll follow Master Sanhe to the death!

245
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,870
We'll follow Master Sanhe to the death!

246
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,560
We'll follow Master Sanhe to the death!

247
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,670
We'll follow Master Sanhe to the death!

248
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,220
We'll follow Master Sanhe to the death!

249
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,030
We'll follow Master Sanhe to the death!

250
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,620
Mr. He,

251
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,140
Mr. Ma,

252
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,200
Luo,

253
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,760
you all heard that.

254
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,880
Hurry up

255
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,240
and save the supplies.

256
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,780
Just now,

257
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,460
I deliberately

258
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,620
sent Zixia away.

259
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
You should understand what I meant.

260
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,550
Just one thing.

261
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,720
Please tell him later

262
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,460
that no matter what happens

263
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,170
to us today,

264
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,960
he must not act on impulse.

265
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,540
As long as

266
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,530
he's alive,

267
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,760
the Tai Ho Brotherhood
still has its roots.

268
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,200
Please.

269
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,370
Brothers of the Tai Ho Brotherhood!

270
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,950
Yes!

271
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,340
Follow me to the ship!

272
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,660
Aye-aye!

273
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,000
Let's go!

274
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,190
Open the gate!

275
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:36,870
Open the gate!

276
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,530
Open the gate!

277
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,270
Get out of the car!

278
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,320
-Move!
-Hurry!

279
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,940
-Keep up!
-Go!

280
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,100
-Hurry!
-Keep up!

281
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,320
-Hurry!
-Let's go.

282
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,480
Keep up!

283
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,370
Hurry!

284
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,500
Hurry!

285
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,480
Didn't they say the Tai Ho Brotherhood

286
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,870
had the inner harbor
completely locked down?

287
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,800
Why isn't there a single soul here?

288
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,190
Turn on the navigation lights!

289
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,600
Raise the flag!

290
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,780
Weigh anchor!

291
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,000
Huang Sanhe?

292
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,200
Trying to run off with the goods?

293
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,330
Let's see how far you can get this time.

294
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,720
Sawa,

295
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,200
why did you bring me to a hotel

296
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,660
instead of the consulate?

297
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,100
The consulate is a diplomatic institution
after all.

298
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,010
Actually, on Portuguese turf,

299
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,810
there's no security guarantee.

300
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,840
Otherwise,

301
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,460
Mr. Fukue

302
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,750
wouldn't have been attacked
right at the entrance.

303
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,940
East Asia Hotel is different.

304
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,340
This is the base of
the Sawa Agency's Special Operations Team.

305
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,480
As for security,

306
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,980
you'll see for yourself soon.

307
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,990
Mr. Imai.

308
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,440
I had him

309
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,360
select dozens of elite subordinates

310
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,460
to ensure your safety.

311
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,240
Mr. Imai,

312
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,980
are you satisfied with the arrangements?

313
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,610
I'm terribly sorry

314
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,790
for troubling you, Sawa.

315
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,990
After what happened to Consul Fukue,

316
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,450
I can't afford

317
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,790
the slightest carelessness.

318
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,000
Mr. Imai,

319
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,410
are the accommodations acceptable to you?

320
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,550
They're very good.

321
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,460
Hello?

322
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,850
It's Captain Huang.

323
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,080
Excuse me for a moment.

324
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,110
It's me.

325
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,460
What's the situation?

326
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,480
What did you say?

327
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,910
The Tai Ho Brotherhood's fleet
is escaping with the goods?

328
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,410
An entire fleet.

329
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,700
They've just left the harbor.

330
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,880
They're trying
to break through our blockade

331
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,329
under cover of night with the goods.

332
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,480
I'll lead the full team
in pursuit immediately.

333
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,210
Understood.

334
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,260
I'll contact the navy at once

335
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,390
to seal off the area.

336
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,550
Attack them from both front and rear.

337
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,369
Don't let a single ship escape.

338
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,310
Yes.

339
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:19,579
Let's go.

340
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,569
Sawa.

341
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,030
Wasn't Captain Huang supposed to be

342
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,090
investigating the vehicle
involved in the Fukue case?

343
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,040
Why is he suddenly chasing a fleet?

344
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
Here's the thing.

345
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,530
Before you arrived,

346
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,350
we obtained an important lead.

347
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,700
An important lead?

348
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,160
Yes.

349
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,200
Behind Mr. Fukue's assassination

350
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,010
lies a case

351
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,700
of major strategic supplies smuggling
in Macau.

352
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,300
That's why Captain Huang
went to investigate both cases at once.

353
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,520
Then why didn't you
mention this to me earlier?

354
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,410
At the time,

355
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,010
the lead was still being verified,

356
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:04,830
so I didn't report it hastily.

357
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,940
Mr. Imai,

358
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,850
I need to contact the navy now.

359
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,610
I'll brief you

360
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,270
on the details shortly.

361
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,380
There they are!

362
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,180
Leader, there's a Japanese warship ahead

363
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,180
blocking our way!

364
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,550
Leader,

365
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,440
a ship is following

366
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,370
right behind us.

367
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,610
I've been sailing in Lingding Channel

368
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,900
fighting winds and waves for 50 years.

369
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,220
It won't be that easy to stop me.

370
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,080
Change course!

371
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,030
The longer we delay them, the better!

372
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,030
Let's keep running them in circles!

373
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,530
Uncle,
I've brought back the empty vehicle.

374
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,920
Xian, where are the Leader and others?

375
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,040
Fire!

376
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,620
Fire!

377
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,250
Move forward!

378
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:47,890
Fire!

379
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,560
Fire!

380
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,050
Attack!

381
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,270
Mr. Imai,

382
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,410
that's roughly the situation.

383
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,290
Once we seize this crucial batch
of strategic materials,

384
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,070
the credit

385
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,850
will be 10 times
that of solving Mr. Fukue's case.

386
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,460
Then, with both charges combined,

387
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,160
the Imperial Army will have
legitimate grounds to occupy Macau.

388
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:23,290
I will make sure you're credited
as the top contributor.

389
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,500
Whether to send troops to occupy Macau

390
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,200
is not for you or me to decide.

391
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,310
Sawa,

392
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,460
I have only one requirement.

393
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,460
From now on, any intelligence

394
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,540
or action concerning Macau

395
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,140
must be reported to me first.

396
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:44,640
Yes.

397
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,690
Zixia.

398
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,500
Master Sanhe left a message for you
before he left.

399
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,080
He wanted you to remember

400
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,140
that as long as you're here,

401
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,540
the Tai Ho Brotherhood
still has its roots.

402
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,770
Hurry up, guys!

403
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,850
Hurry!

404
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,740

Captain Huang,

438
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,270
the goods aren't on the ships.
We didn't find a drop of fuel.

439
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,900
You youngsters are no match for me.

440
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,430
Uncle Sanhe,

441
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,810
rest in peace!

442
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,400
Idiot!

443
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,480
The goods
must still be in Rodrigues's warehouse.

444
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,000
Have the Special Operations Team back
immediately.

445
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,590
Go!

446
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,880
Stop! Stop!

447
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,010
Stop moving!

448
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,220
Chairman, what's wrong?

449
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,240
All ships of the Tai Ho Brotherhood

450
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,090
have been intercepted and destroyed
by the Japanese Army.

451
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,130
The
Sawa Agency's Special Operations Team's

452
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,180
speedboats are returning

453
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,090
and will reach the harbor shortly.

454
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,590
So they've realized they were fooled.

455
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,920
Mr. He and the others

456
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,220
are unloading goods
at the Lyun Coeng warehouse.

457
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,850
The intelligence agents
will head straight here very soon.

458
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,240
Leave now.
After you're out of the warehouse,

459
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,160
make sure to erase the tire tracks

460
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,740
at the intersection
leading to the Lyun Coeng warehouse.

461
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,200
Tell them
not to send any more vehicles here.

462
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,770
But there are traces everywhere,

463
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:56,830
inside and outside the warehouse.

464
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,110
There's no time to clean them all up.

465
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,740
Once the intelligence agents arrive,

466
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,500
they'll still figure out
where the goods went.

467
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,460
Don't worry about here.

468
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,980
I'll take care of it.

469
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,940
Chairman, how can you handle it alone?

470
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,960
Besides, the intelligence agents
will be here soon.

471
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,660
I've already called the police.

472
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,940
Inspector General Gonçalves
is on his way here with officers.

473
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,090
The police will protect me. Go now!

474
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,570
Go now! Hurry!

475
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:25,570
Let's go!

476
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,830
To Rodrigues' warehouse!

477
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,760
Yes!

478
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,070
Get in the car!

479
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,900
Hurry! Hurry!

480
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,000
Hurry!

481
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,200
Yinwan,

482
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
things are too chaotic right now.

483
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,050
Go back to the hotel first.

484
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,110
We'll handle the aftermath.

485
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,050
Be careful then.

486
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:01,270
[Department Store]

487
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,110
Stop the car!

488
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,090
Stop the car!

489
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,140
Stop the car!

490
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,530
Why are you here?

491
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,880
The intelligence agents are coming.

492
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,440
The Chairman sent us here

493
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,310
to stop all empty trucks
that have finished unloading.

494
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,840
We're not allowed
to return to the warehouse.

495
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,420
Where's Rodrigues?

496
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,790
Master Sanhe,

497
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,590
I should have personally served you tea,

498
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,850
but there's no tea here.

499
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,300
So please forgive me

500
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,530
and follow

501
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,570
our custom for once.

502
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,960
Have a sip of wine
from my hometown, Portugal.

503
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,920
What's that smell?

504
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,920
-Gasoline?
-Gasoline.

505
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,780
It's gasoline.

506
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,690
Rodrigues is trying to destroy
the evidence.

507
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,730
Rodrigues!

508
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,740
Put out your lighter.

509
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,940
Don't think I wouldn't dare touch you

510
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,800
just because you're a Westerner!

511
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,790
Right now,

512
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,350
the Imperial Army
has law enforcement authority in Macau.

513
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,350
We're carrying out an official duty!

514
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,970
If you dare set this place on fire,

515
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,290
I can shoot you dead right now!

516
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,070
Master Sanhe,

517
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,860
top-grade Cuban cigars.

518
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,350
I cherish them
and don't usually smoke them.

519
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,810
Rodrigues!

520
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,610
Don't forget,

521
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,480
you're a Portuguese!

522
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,240
And the largest Portuguese merchant
in Macau.

523
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,790
Are you really going to take the fall
for those anti-Japanese rebels

524
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,660
and burn down your own warehouse?

525
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,770
There are no Portuguese or Chinese here.

526
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,920
There is only Rodrigues from Macau.

527
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,030
And the people of Macau
have only one belief:

528
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,550
we will never bow our heads.

529
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,010
Chief.

530
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,010
The situation is critical.

531
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,210
The Portuguese police are after us now,

532
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,540
in large numbers.

533
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,110
We can't hold them off.

534
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,740
If the garrison arrives,

535
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,020
we'll be in real trouble.

536
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,340
What should we do now?

537
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,340
Don't panic.

538
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,410
Take your men and retreat
to the East Asia Hotel immediately.

539
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,150
What?

540
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,840
Retreat to the hotel?

541
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,340
We're retreating to the hotel?

542
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,070
isn't Consul Imai there?

543
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,590
Won't everything be exposed?

544
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,050
It can't be hidden anyway.

545
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,150
We might as well make it public.

546
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,330
The bigger the mess, the better.

547
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,699
Make it so big that Imai can't contain it.

548
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:20,170
That will help push the Imperial Army

549
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,719
to occupy Macau.

550
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,620
Go all out.

551
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,250
Even if you tear the roof off,

552
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,130
I, Sawa Eisaku,

553
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,889
will cover for you.

554
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,880
Yes!

555
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,000
Pass the word.

556
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,030
Move all weapons and ammunition
stored by the Sawa Agency

557
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,980
to the East Asia Hotel immediately.

558
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,460
Yes.

559
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,420
Master Huang.

560
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,010
Sir, Mrs. He.

561
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,210
What's wrong, Zixia?

562
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:11,960
Stay at home.

563
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,590
Don't go anywhere.

564
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:16,010
Fei,

565
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,610
stay here and guard them.

566
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,750
All other brothers
will come back with me to Haohai.

567
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,510
Send word by carrier pigeon to all our
branches in the Guangdong–Hong Kong area.

568
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,500
Assemble all manpower
of the Tai Ho Brotherhood at once

569
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,630
and head to Macau...

570
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,410
to avenge the Leader
and our fallen brothers!

571
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:39,070
[East Asia Hotel]

572
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,650
Hurry!

573
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:03,540
Keep up!

574
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,030
Keep up!

575
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,550
Squad 1,

576
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,460
cut all communications

577
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,840
and take every guest in the hotel hostage!

578
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,690
-Yes!
-Yes!

579
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,550
Squad 2,

580
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,280
guard the main entrance!

581
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,730
No one is allowed to enter!

582
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:17,380
-Yes!
-Yes!

583
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,420
Squad 3,

584
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,890
guard the rooftop!

585
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,880
If the Portuguese Macau government's
troops or police

586
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,960
make any move,

587
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,040
let's fight them to the death!

588
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:49,400
[East Asia Hotel]

589
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,890
[East Asia Hotel]

590
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,530
Take everyone hostage!

591
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,230
Sawa,

592
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,780
what's happening outside?

593
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,670
Why are there suddenly
so many troops and police?

594
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,880
Mr. Imai, something big has happened.

595
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,630
The Portuguese Macau government

596
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,400
is going to openly use force against you.

597
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,230
Use force?

598
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:13,780
Yes.

599
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,640
Against me?

600
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,590
Huang Gongjie has led his men

601
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,380
into the East Asia Hotel.

602
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,030
The garrison and police
have surrounded the hotel

603
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,420
to prevent their escape.

604
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,280
Prevent their escape? At a time like this?

605
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,530
Why not attack directly?

606
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,400
Why?

607
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:41,760
Exactly.
They even dared to kill Rodrigues.

608
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,500
What are we waiting for?

609
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,260
Let's storm in and avenge Rodrigues!

610
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,920
Everyone, please stay calm.

611
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,730
We cannot start a fight.

612
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,860
The Special Operations Team
has not only taken

613
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,800
all the hotel guests hostage,

614
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,920
but more importantly,

615
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,550
Imai and Sawa Eisaku
are also inside the hotel.

616
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,090
So we can't touch them
because the Japanese are involved?

617
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,070
Huang Gongjie is nothing
but the Japanese's lackey.

618
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,090
Rodrigues's blood debt

619
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,440
should be on the Japanese!

620
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,650
Why show him any restraint?

621
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,510
The Special Operations Team is certainly
acting under Sawa Eisaku's orders.

622
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,570
But the Japanese consul is inside.

623
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,550
Once fighting starts,

624
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,320
they'll claim that Macau struck first.

625
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,590
The Japanese
already have troops at our borders.

626
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,520
They will seize the chance
to occupy Macau.

627
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,650
Your Excellency the Governor,

628
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,800
including you,

629
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,480
all of our families are still in Macau.

630
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,340
Even if we don't think of Macau,

631
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,820
we have to think of our own safety
and that of our families.

632
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,550
Your Excellency the Governor,

633
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,150
Inspector General Gonçalves is right.

634
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,190
We must remain calm now

635
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,820
and not fire the first shot.

636
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,510
You Portuguese cowards,

637
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,340
trying to be spineless again, huh?

638
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,440
Brothers, let's go ourselves!

639
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,130
Stop!

640
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,840
Hurry! Stop them!

641
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,770
Get out of my way!

642
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,380
What are you doing?

643
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,610
Keep being cowards!

644
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,780
Why are you stopping us?

645
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,260
I'm telling you,

646
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,060
my bullets don't discriminate.

647
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,980
Zixia!

648
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,800
Master Huang!

649
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,340
What are you doing?

650
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,110
What am I doing?

651
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,110
Huang Gongjie is right in there.

652
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,440
Uncle and our fallen brothers

653
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,130
are all waiting for me to avenge them!

654
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,150
Huang Gongjie's Special Operations Team
numbers two or three hundred.

655
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,880
Aren't you going to your death?

656
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,410
Once I pull this trigger,

657
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,000
it's on.

658
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,690
These cowards will have to get involved
whether they want to or not!

659
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,720
Fine, even if they

660
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,880
keep standing aside,

661
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,310
the Tai Ho Brotherhood has thousands

662
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,550
of brothers across all branches.

663
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,560
I'll call them all here!

664
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,090
Let's see how he dies today!

665
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,530
Zixia!

666
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,600
You know better than anyone

667
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,830
what Master Sanhe and the others

668
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,290
died for.

669
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,440
If you pull the trigger today,

670
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,480
you'll give the Japanese an excuse
to deploy troops to Macau.

671
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,300
Then what about those supplies?

672
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,810
What about all of Macau?

673
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,570
Wouldn't Master Sanhe
and the others die in vain?

674
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,000
I understand how you feel.

675
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,230
We all want revenge for Master Sanhe.

676
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,070
Huang Gongjie will definitely be punished,

677
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,320
but not today.

678
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,130
Rodrigues?

679
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,460
The son of the former governor of Macau

680
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,670
and the biggest Portuguese merchant
in Macau?

681
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,530
They even dared to kill such a

682
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,210
prominent figure from a neutral country?

683
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:18,870
Has your Special Operations Team gone mad?

684
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,170
[Loyalty, Strength, Success, Morals]

685
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,360
I told you,

686
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,210
Rodrigues obstructed
the investigation first.

687
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,170
The Special Operations Team
only fired warning shots

688
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,380
and accidentally caused harm.

689
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,400
But again,

690
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,230
Rodrigues
colluded with anti-Japanese elements

691
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,650
to smuggle strategic supplies
for the Chinese Army

692
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,850
and the Anglo-American Allied Forces.

693
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,090
He deserved to die anyway.

694
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,970
And the Portuguese Macau government,

695
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,680
knowing he was the main culprit
in the major smuggling case,

696
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,880
still surrounded the Japanese Consul.

697
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,210
Do you know what that means?

698
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,880
It's a declaration of war
against the Empire of Japan.

699
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,900
No.

700
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,590
The situation isn't clear yet.

701
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,480
[Loyalty, Strength, Success, Morals]

702
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,350
We can't jump to that conclusion.

703
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,970
The Portuguese troops and police
have already surrounded the hotel.

704
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,780
This is clearly an act of war.

705
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,120
Even for your personal safety,

706
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,880
you should report to the Command

707
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,670
and demand

708
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,170
the Imperial Army
land in Macau immediately

709
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,230
to suppress the
Portuguese Macau government by force.

710
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,090
But the Portuguese haven't fired yet,
have they?

711
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,090
That means

712
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:24,090
they don't want to start a fight.

713
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,150
Mr. Imai,

714
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,090
the whereabouts of those
strategic supplies are still unknown.

715
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,010
They were clearly hidden
by those anti-Japanese elements.

716
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,570
Once the Imperial Army applies pressure

717
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,030
and finds them,

718
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,580
occupying Macau will be fully justified.

719
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,920
And for you,

720
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,000
it will be a major achievement.

721
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,570
And what if we don't find them?

722
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,530
Wouldn't that mean
I deceived my superiors?

723
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:49,000
Then the responsibility would fall on me.

724
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,420
We will

725
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,430
definitely find them.

726
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,920
Colonel Sawa,

727
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,630
you keep saying
you're helping me investigate the case,

728
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,480
yet your focus has been entirely

729
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,480
on some so-called strategic supplies
no one has seen.

730
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,010
Now the supplies haven't been found,

731
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,670
Rodrigues has been killed,

732
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:09,190
and things have escalated into

733
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,320
an armed standoff between both sides.

734
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,370
What exactly are you trying to do?

735
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,710
I'm only trying to uncover the truth

736
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,060
behind Fukue's case

737
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,560
and eliminate

738
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,050
the anti-Japanese forces
in Macau for the Command.

739
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,360
Say no more.

740
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,670
My mission from the Command

741
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,500
is to uncover the truth of Fukue's murder,

742
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,830
apprehend the culprit,

743
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,630
and seek an apology and compensation
from the Portuguese Macau government,

744
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,230
not to provoke a war.

745
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,170
The Imperial Army's
current military strength

746
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,850
does not allow for reckless escalation.

747
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,770
You two, stay outside and keep watch.

748
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,840
If anyone fires on the Macao–Portuguese
troops or police on their own initiative

749
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,340
and attempts
to trigger a military conflict,

750
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,800
report to me immediately!

751
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,730
-Yes!
-Yes!

752
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,240
Colonel Sawa,

753
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,150
what I need now is direct negotiations

754
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,690
with the Portuguese Macau government.
