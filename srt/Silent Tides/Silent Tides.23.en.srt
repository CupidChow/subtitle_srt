00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,150
To maintain trade relations
between Japan and Portugal,

4
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,090
the Headquarters has ordered

5
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:47,789
the immediate and unconditional return of

6
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,950
all seized goods of Portuguese merchants,

7
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,420
and such actions must not be taken again
in the future.

Are you even listening?

9
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,570
So you're saying

10
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,840
those Portuguese
don't need to pay any price

11
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,810
for sheltering Chinese merchants?

12
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,700
How are we supposed to
suppress Chinese merchants in the future?

13
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,160
How can we control Macau's trade rights?

14
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,430
At this point,

15
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,560
are you still

16
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,590
dreaming about controlling all of Macau?

17
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,340
Stop dreaming.

18
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,220
Just face reality properly.

What's that?

142
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,870
With this cooperative supply line,

143
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,870
the Japanese will no longer control
Macau's economy,

144
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,370
which's a good thing.

145
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:35,890
But

146
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,250
Macau's trade will likely

147
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,750
grow exponentially very soon.

148

Chinese communities in the past

all countries are desperate for
raw materials.

155

Once the transportation route
is established,

156
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,910
the Nationalist government's

157
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,960
exportable strategic goods alone could

158
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,320
dwarf Macau's previous overall trade

159
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,620
by ten times or more.

160
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,940

What goes out must come in.

164

If exports grow ten or a hundredfold,

165
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,610

Now, with trade channels open,

173
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,120
the concern is whether we can

That's correct.

Well, who says

That'd be more than great.

00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,210
it will inevitably become the focus of
a three-way struggle.

Hello, Mr. He.

You used to visit our shop often,

384

so I met you several times.

What can I do for you?

Thank you.

No problem, Mr. He.

391
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,340
I'll be going now.

392
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,870

395
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,060
which company's sweet soup they ordered?

Shuncheng Dairy Company.

00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,830
That sounds so familiar.

398
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,550
Who mentioned it before?

399
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,720
I can't remember.

400
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,770
I'm back.

Here, these are for you.

403
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,310
Wow, sweet soup!

404
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,460
Why did you buy sweet soup again?

405
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,010
Children need to protect their teeth.

406
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,720
They shouldn't eat so many sweet things.

407
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,940
I didn't buy these.

408
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,200
Shuncheng just delivered them.

409
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,730

411
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,530
did you buy these?

412
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,340
It wasn't me.

413
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,450
Kids must have pestered
Father to buy them.

414
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,310
Please be lenient just this time.

often ordered from.

Hello?

Brother Xian.

420
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,750
The Special Operations Team
ordered a lot

421
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,640
sweet soup from Shuncheng Dairy Company.

422
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,640
And Yamaguchi Hisami took a box out

423
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,780
to somewhere we didn't know.

424
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,610
I remember your family

425
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,790
often orders sweet soup from this brand.

Although I don't know if these two things

427
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,310
are specifically connected,

428
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,110
I just felt I should let you know.

429

I've treated all of his wounds.

His condition is basically stable now.

Call me if you need anything.

Based on the explosion site,

the criminal used homemade explosives.

441
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,090
The power wasn't very strong.

specific clues yet.

What's there to investigate?

445

the candidate for chairman of
Banking Association,

447
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,870

448
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,440
Tell me,

449
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,640
who else could it be if not the Japanese?

450
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,460
That's right.

451
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,200
They didn't even spare
his family and children.

452
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,630
It's absolutely vicious.

453
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,920
What are you police waiting for
if you don't arrest them?

454
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,410
Inspector General Gonçalves,

455
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,450
Mr. Liang's murder happened first,

456
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,420
and now this situation has occurred.

457
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,310
If the government and police

458
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,980
continue to tolerate the Japanese,

459
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,200
who will still believe in

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,360

462
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,710
you always make me clean up after you.

463

Before taking action,

464
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,570
you should've at least informed me.

465
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,940
If I told you,

466
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,570
would you have agreed?

467
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,020
Of course not!

468
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,680
He Xian was just nominated as a candidate,

469
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,370
and then a bomb was sent to his home.

470
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,680
Even a fool knows who did it.

471
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,620
I've told you many times,

472
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,170
Macau is not our occupied territory.

473
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,010
Do you have to openly defy
the Portuguese Macau government

474
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,880
and ruin the Empire's future?

475
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,220
If we allow He Xian to become
chairman of Banking Association,

476
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,350
that'll truly destroy everything
the Empire has in Macau.

477
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,030
If you wanted to bomb him,
you should have killed him.

478
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,390
Now look what's happened.

479
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,590

and ended up worse off than before.

481
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,170
But the operation

482
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,860
may not be without effect.

What do you mean?

484
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,560
It means that this bomb

485
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,910
was just a warning.

486
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,960
He may not dare to risk his family's lives

487
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:19,610
to participate in tomorrow's election.

488
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,110

491
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,330
he called to show his concern.

492
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:42,710
Second,

493
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,420
he wants to know if Xian'll attend
the election tomorrow.

494
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,670
Maybe we shouldn't bother him
at this time.

495
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,510
If he doesn't participate in
tomorrow's election,

496
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,040
what will happen to
Macau's finance and trade?

497
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,950
The bomb was sent to Xian's home.

498
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,240
I think he should withdraw.

499
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:10,720
His

500
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,620
withdrawal would be completely reasonable.

501

Whether to participate in
the election or not,

502
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,700
I believe Xian

503
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,450
can definitely make his decision.

and the patient needs to rest.

508
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,380
We should go home now

509
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,060
and give Xian some time alone.

510
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,650
