00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,220
Excuse me. Make way.

194
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,550
I never expected we'd meet in such a way.

195
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,570
Well,

196
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,200
after all this time apart,

197
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
we've got to have a drink.

198
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,240
This is Portuguese Potter wine,

199
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,550
a present from the Imperial Army.

200
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,290
Excellent stuff.

201
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,020
Have a taste.

202
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm so happy we ran
into each other today.

203
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,790
Please, help yourself to the food.

204
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:00,410
Mr. Huang.

205
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,700
How is it?

206
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,740
Brother Xian,

207
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,790
please, make yourself at home.

208
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,190
I'll step out for a moment
and be right back.

209
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,140
Didn't you get a single word out of him?

210
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,250
The bullet pierced his lung.

211
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,500
Adrenaline won't help either.

212
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,620
Dr. Tanaka says the bullet
pierced his lung—

213
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,670
the man's done for,

214
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,670
not even adrenaline could save him.

215
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,360
Then why even bother?

216
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,620
Why haven't you touched anything?

217
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,500
All this was made for you.

218
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,080
Today, we don't leave
until we're drunk!

219
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,860
Come on.

220
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,130
It tastes great.

221
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,370
Help yourself to the meat.

222
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,190
You walked right into the trap!

223
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,320
Now, look what happened?

224
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:12,110
James died

225
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,640
and I nearly got tricked down with him.

226
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,390
Are you satisfied now?

227
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,680
Yang Chang,

228
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,790
we're not like you—
with food and drink assured.

229
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,390
Not going would have meant
waiting to die anyway.

230
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,750
We had no choice.

231
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,600
Shh...

232
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,340
Who is it?

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,730
Who's there?

234
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,500
I'm David,

235
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,810
the secretary of the British Consulate.

236
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,820
It's the note we sent
asking the Consulate for help.

237
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,460
So,

238
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,690
the money I took from you that day—

239
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,120
that was all you had at that time.

240
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,910
And you gave it to me
without holding back a single cent?

241
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,890
That's all in the past now.

242
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,320
That's something
I can't just let go of.

243
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,700
Brother Xian, if it weren't for your
extraordinary generosity back then,

244
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,960
how could I have gotten the funds
to flee to Macau,

245
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
to rebuild, to make something of myself

246
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,000
and reach where I am today?

247
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,460
Yeah,

248
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,580
I... I really never expected it either.

249
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,110
Brother Xian, you're the real deal.

250
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,620
From now on,

251
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,910
as long as I, Huang Gongjie, am in Macau,

252
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,910
you will live in comfort.

253
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,460
Have a drink!

254
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,080
Come on, cheers.

255
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,810
I... I can't really drink.

256
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,600
Even half a glass gets me drunk.

257
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,390
Then have some food—

258
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,990
go on, help yourself. Eat up!

259
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,670
Mr. He,

260
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,600
where are you from originally?

261
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,250
Do you have any family still there?

262
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,820
What other businesses were you in

263
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,670
before the bank?

264
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,560
I'll say it again.

265
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,580
I will not say it again.
I don't want your cursed money.

266
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,670
I want to live.

267
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,200
To live! Damn it!

268
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,200
I'm sorry.

269
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,700
Since Japan declared the war,

270
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,170
the Empire's presence
across Southeast Asia

271
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,820
has completely collapsed.

272
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,410
Our consulate is now

273
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,500
under full surveillance
by the Sawa Agency.

274
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,960
We can barely guarantee our own safety,

275
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
let alone arrange

276
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,360
to secure a passage for your group.

277
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,500
After all this—

278
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,050
even James's life—

279
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,820
they just turned their backs on us.

280
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,240
For God's sake.

281
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,300
David,

282
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,170
standing in front of you

283
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,000
are soldiers of the British Army.

284
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,050
They fought to the death

285
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,320
for the Empire, and then

286
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,350
the Empire just abandons them?

287
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,770
The only person willing
to lend a helping hand,

288
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,770
and who was wrongfully imprisoned

289
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,170
by the British, might I add,

290
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,910
is this Chinese person,

291
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,160
Yang Chang.

292
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,360
Compared to his kindness,

293
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,690
his tolerance,

294
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,480
and his courage,

295
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,320
the Consulate and Empire

296
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,180
should be ashamed of themselves.

297
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,690
So you used to be

298
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,850
in the grain and oil business before.

299
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,320
That was all years ago.

300
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,010
Captain Huang, it's getting late,

301
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,410
and I've taken up enough of your time.

302
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,670
I should head back now.

303
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,220
No rush. We've only just gotten
to the main point.

304
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,530
Right now, I've got a big deal
on my hands

305
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,070
and I'm struggling
to find the right person for it.

306
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,950
You're an expert in grain and oil,

307
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,070
so this deal simply has to go to you.

308
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,790
In my current state,

309
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,850
how could I possibly handle any deal?

310
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,100
Captain Huang,
my family is waiting for me.

311
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,230
I really must go.

312
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,220
Don't be in such a hurry.

313
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,980
You must hear me out—

314
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,530
I'm sure you'll be interested,

315
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,190
alright?

316
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,480
What does Macau lack most right now?

317
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,690
Isn't it grain?

318
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,720
And do you know

319
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,780
why people in Macau are going hungry?

320
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,450
It's because the Japanese
have blockaded Macau.

321
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,190
The Imperial Army has sealed off the sea,

322
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,849
but there's still land, isn't there?

323
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,650
It's said that the grain from Zhongshan
has also been seized.

324
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,109
Do you know who seized it?

325
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,220
Me, Huang Gongjie—

326
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,520
I seized it single-handedly.

327
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,960
Do you know why the Imperial Army
ordered me to seize the grain?

328
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,020
It's to starve Macau into collapse,

329
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,190
to make those foreigners
in the Portuguese Macau government

330
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,280
surrender completely.

331
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,910
Do you know how much grain
I have in my hands right now?

332
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,930
Ten million kilograms exactly.

333
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,410
Grain prices in Macau
have already soared seven or eightfold.

334
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,150
Once those foreigners
in the Portuguese Macau government

335
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,020
finally yield

336
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,480
and the Japanese lift the blockade,

337
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,110
we'll ship the grain from Zhongshan

338
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,520
to Macau and sell it.

339
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,690
How much do you think we'll make?

340
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,560
First create a famine,

341
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,040
then sell grain at exorbitant prices—

342
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,200
that's your business.

343
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,590
Is there any business in the world
more profitable than this?

344
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,170
I, Huang Gongjie, am a man

345
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,430
who values loyalty and repays kindness.

346
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,560
I'm handing this deal to you.

347
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,780
Just help me find a buyer,

348
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,280
and I'll cut you in for 10% of the profit.

349
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,610
With just this one deal,

350
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,870
you could earn back

351
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,110
ten times what Huilong Bank was worth.

352
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,970
Captain Huang,

353
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,980
I'm not up to this task.

354
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,110
You'd better find someone more capable.

355
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,860
But I've set my eyes on you,
Brother Xian,

356
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,610
because your credibility is unmatched.

357
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,410
Entrusting this to you
is the only way I'd feel at ease.

358
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,020
Captain Huang…

359
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,870
Brother Xian,

360
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,830
you're not looking down on me, are you?

361
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,690
How could I possibly look down on you?

362
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,560
It's just that this deal
is simply too big.

363
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,240
You'll have to give me some time

364
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,930
to think it over properly.

365
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,280
What if I mess it up

366
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,740
and hold up your plans?

367
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:59,330
You really are a careful man.

368
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,480
Fine, I'll let you think it over—

369
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,610
but be quick,

370
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,090
otherwise this golden opportunity

371
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,090
will be snatched up by someone else.

372
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,410
Alright,

373
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,520
I'll take my leave then.

374
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,280
Wait.

375
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,410
Rong!

376
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,410
Yes, Mr. Huang.

377
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,720
It's all set.

378
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,020
It's just a little something

379
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,420
to show my appreciation.

380
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,740
Captain Huang, I can't accept these.

381
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,240
Brother Xian,
let's not stand on ceremony.

382
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,150
Never mind whether we collaborate

383
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,220
on big deals in the future—

384
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,350
right now you've hit hard times,

385
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,280
and as your brother,
how could I stand by and do nothing?

386
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,910
Rong, take the men

387
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,650
and deliver all these things
to Brother Xian's home.

388
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:35,910
Yes, sir!

389
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,640
Captain Huang, Captain Huang.

390
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,670
I truly appreciate your kindness.

391
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,150
But "accept no reward without merit"
is the family motto of the Hes.

392
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,300
Processing your withdrawal at that time

393
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,910
was merely part
of my professional obligation as a banker.

394
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,040
I really can't accept any of this—
the money or the gifts.

395
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,650
Brother Xian,
you really are a man of principle.

396
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,450
Fine, if you won't take the money,

397
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,720
I won't insist.

398
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,830
But you have a family depending on you,
both old and young—

399
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,370
surely you can't let them all go hungry.

400
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,040
If your consulate
really wants to save them,

401
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,830
maybe I have an idea.

402
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,410
What kind of idea?

403
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,460
Remember those agents searching
through the refugees

404
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,330
when we entered Macau?

405
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,380
At that time,

406
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,930
they were looking for a group

407
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,460
of famous Chinese.

408
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,110
Do you know

409
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,500
who sent them to Macau?

410
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,780
You must remember the night

411
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,280
you escaped to Macau,

412
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,780
when a ship collided
with a Japanese gunboat. Right?

413
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,040
Commander Ou Xin

414
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:51,870
from the Zhongshan Anti-Japanese
Guerrilla Force—

415
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,540
he's a big hero.

416
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,430
He rammed the ship to stop the Japanese.

417
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,130
Everybody knows him
in Hong Kong and Macau.

418
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:00,610
But...

419
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,390
you mean the Communist Party of China

420
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,200
is protecting those celebrities?

421
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,240
At the border gate,

422
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,890
I saw a young man with them
the whole time.

423
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,040
He's the younger brother

424
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,460
of Dr. Ke from the Kiang Wu Medical Team.

425
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,020
When the gate opened,

426
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,300
I saw them getting

427
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,700
into the Kiang Wu Medical Team ambulance

428
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,040
and leaving.

429
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,190
So,

430
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:35,260
you want us to seek help
from the Communist Party of China?

431
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,890
But we don't know who they are.

432
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,760
You could try your luck
at Kiang Wu Hospital.

433
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,800
This is far enough, thank you.

434
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,970
I live on the boat.

435
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,960
Thank you for coming all this way.

436
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,850
No can do.

437
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,780
Mr. Huang asked me to escort you
all the way home.

438
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,620
I wouldn't dare cut corners on his orders.

439
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,480
What are you looking at?

440
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,390
What are you looking at? Huh?

441
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,240
W-What is it?

442
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,890
Qiang.

443
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:24,690
Sorry. Qiang.

444
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,240
Please come in.

445
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,040
Xian,

446
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,460
what's all this…

447
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,930
I ran into a friend outside.

448
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,330
These are gifts from him.

449
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,170
Mr. He,

450
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:44,000
we've delivered
both the goods and you safely.

451
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,500
We'll take our leave now.

452
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,590
Thank you.

453
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:49,160
Xian,

454
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,890
since when do you have friends
like this in Macau?

455
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,930
And so much stuff…

456
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,730
who are these people anyway?

457
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,130
Father,

458
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,430
it's not something I can explain quickly.

459
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,590
I'll tell you later.

460
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,430
Kiddos, you must be starving.

461
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,170
Come on, there's plenty
of good food here.

462
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:04,540
Here you go.

463
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,850
Wow, so many pastries,

464
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,130
and even meat!

465
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,390
-Father, have some.
-Father, Qiwen, have some.

466
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,280
I'm in no hurry.

467
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,740
A few neighbors on the boat

468
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,000
are so hungry they can't even
get out of bed.

469
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,610
There are so many things here—

470
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,000
I'll take some over to them.

471
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,740
Alright.

472
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,090
I'll take this, then.

473
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,500
Where are Yu and Yu's mom?

474
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,540
Take it.

475
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,350
Thank you.

476
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:32,740
Here.

477
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,430
Take it.

478
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,700
Qiang. Qiang!

479
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,200
Are you so hungry
you've lost your mind?

480
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,930
Quick, take it.

481
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,540
Qiang?

482
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,960
I'd rather starve to death

483
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,810
than eat this dirty stuff
from that damned traitor.

484
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,010
What damned traitor?

485
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,950
Back when I was a runner,

486
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,040
I saw with my own eyes
how he bootlicked the Japanese.

487
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,040
God only knows how
many of our own people he got killed.

488
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,240
I went to look for them—

489
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,020
couldn't find them anywhere.

490
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,620
There are too many refugees.

491
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,240
He Xian,

492
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,590
I'm asking you—

493
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,460
who sent all this stuff?

494
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,800
And what kind of people are they?

495
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,540
Weren't you just calling them "friends"
a moment ago?

496
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,960
And now you have nothing to say?

497
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,130
Too scared to say,

498
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,200
or too ashamed?

499
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,780
Father,

500
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,390
what's going on?

501
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,320
What's going on?

502
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,230
I'm telling you,

503
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,350
these people are traitors.

504
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,650
You brought all these things back.

505
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,130
How can you dare say
you knew nothing about what they meant?

506
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,670
Huang Gongjie insisted.

507
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,740
He said it was to repay the favor I did
by handling his withdrawal back then.

508
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,890
I never wanted them in the first place.

509
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,670
But look at how our family
has ended up now!

510
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,090
You—

511
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,780
Father!

512
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,060
Grandpa!

513
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,700
Listen to me!

514
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,810
Our He family has been clean
and honorable for generations.

515
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,890
We'd rather starve to death
than eat a single grain

516
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,890
-from a traitor.
-Father...

517
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,060
Father, don't be angry.

518
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,090
-Throw them away!
-Father.

519
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,280
Can't bear to, is that it?

520
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,130
Grandpa!

521
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,330
Fine, then get out.

522
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,430
Get out of this house!

523
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,480
Father, don't be angry.

524
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,960
Xian was just thinking of the children.

525
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,980
It hasn't been easy for Xian either,

526
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,700
Father.

527
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,460
Calm down.

528
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,090
-Don't be angry, okay?
-Grandpa, don't chase Daddy away.

529
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,170
-My boy!
-Son!

530
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:18,850
Son!

531
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,220
[Kiang Wu Hospital]

532
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,420
Please open the door!

533
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,080
Save our child, please!

534
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,760
Open the door, please!

535
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,760
Doctor!

536
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,540
I'm sorry,

537
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,240
but Kiang Wu Hospital has been designated
by the government

538
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,060
as an epidemic prevention facility.

539
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,110
We only admit cholera,

540
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,450
typhoid, and malaria patients—

541
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,890
we cannot accept other cases.

542
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,780
Is anyone there? Doctor?

543
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,130
Please, save our child.

544
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,060
Night emergency fee requires
an additional ten patacas.

545
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,830
Payment first, please.

546
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,950
We left in a hurry—

547
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,740
could the doctor
please see the child first?

548
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,780
-We'll make up the payment afterward.
-Then I'm afraid we can't help you.

549
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,670
Hey, please.

550
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,520
Doctor,

551
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,030
I'm begging you. Don't—

552
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,050
Wait, what is he saying?

553
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,170
What is he saying?

554
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,330
Oh no, he's starting to run a fever.

555
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,540
We still need to find a hospital.

556
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,100
Let's go.

557
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,350
Mr. He?

558
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,000
The route to Zhongshan has been verified.

559
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,170
We hope arrangements
can be made promptly

560
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,030
for a safe transfer method
from Macau to Zhongshan.

561
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,090
Dr. Ke.

562
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,350
Dr. Ke!

563
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,570
[Nanhua Medical Club]

564
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,740
Dr. Ke, how is my son?

565
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,670
It's pneumonia,

566
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,590
compounded by prolonged hunger

567
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,450
leading to severe malnutrition.

568
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,930
The child has been showing symptoms
for quite some time—

569
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,780
why didn't you bring him in earlier?

570
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,910
If it had been any later,

571
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,110
the consequences could have been dire.

572
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,170
It's my fault.

573
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,370
I'm not a good mother—

574
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,050
I didn't take good care of him.

575
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,590
My boy...

576
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,300
My son ending up like this

577
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,080
is all because of me.

578
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,050
But I just don't understand:

579
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,220
how did I fall

580
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,350
to this point?

581
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,720
As a son,

582
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,220
as a father,

583
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,690
as a husband—

584
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,590
I've failed in every way.

585
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,390
Mr. He,

586
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,550
I've only had a few brief dealings
with you,

587
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,690
but you left a very strong

588
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,850
impression on me.

589
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,650
The first time was at the Macau pier,

590
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,460
where you single-handedly confronted
the Specie Bank,

591
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,390
not only soundly defeating the Japanese

592
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,850
but also restoring dignity

593
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,780
for every Chinese person present.

594
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,190
The second time was inside the checkpoint—

595
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,300
facing a search by spies and traitors,

596
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,540
you saw the danger

597
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,540
and courageously stepped in to help.

598
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,480
But what impressed me most

599
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,690
was when you exchanged currency

600
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,760
for Mr. Ma Wanqi—

601
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,620
it moved me deeply.

602
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,110
Mr. He,

603
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,580
that is my impression of you.

604
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,690
Dr. Ke,

605
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,680
I don't deserve even a fraction

606
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,260
of the praise you've given.

607
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,190
Even if I were all those things you say,

608
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,620
what difference would it make?

609
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,090
Am I not still a failed businessman?

610
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,430
Doesn't my whole family
still go hungry?

611
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,040
As a father, don't I still

612
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,090
have to watch helplessly

613
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,760
as my son's life

614
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,980
hangs by a thread?

615
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,130
And look at Macau now—

616
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,400
Japanese invaders, traitors,

617
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,800
robbers, scoundrels,

618
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,670
all running wild

619
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,470
and doing whatever they please.

620
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,040
In times like these,

621
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,060
what right and wrong,
what black and white, is there?

622
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,140
Mr. He, if you think that way,

623
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,590
let me tell you something.

624
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,800
Because you stuck to your principles

625
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,060
and acted with integrity,

626
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,110
returning the U.S. dollars to
the Portuguese merchant, Mr. Rodrigues,

627
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,150
you not only prevented
the remaining resistance supplies

628
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,880
from being sold to the Japanese

629
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,390
but also secured for Wanqi and others

630
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,000
a lasting source

631
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,760
to continue supplying materials

632
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,360
for the resistance effort
within the country.

633
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,410
That really happened?

634
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,020
Not only that—

635
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,990
because of that act of integrity,

636
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,780
you directly saved the lives
of countless refugees

637
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,060
trapped inside the border gate,
who were in imminent danger.

638
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,350
Because of your integrity,

639
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,550
Mr. Rodrigues chose to change his vote,

640
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,580
which led the Portuguese Macau government
to agree to open the gates—

641
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,890
and those saved

642
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,600
were thousands upon thousands
of our fellow refugees.

643
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,050
After hearing all this,

644
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,990
can you still believe that what you did

645
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,130
was meaningless?

646
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,650
Today's China:

647
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,110
its land shattered,

648
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,370
the nation in peril,

649
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,690
suffering profound,

650
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,020
the road ahead obscure.

651
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,720
Reality may

652
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,610
be dark for a time;

653
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,240
evil may

654
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,690
run rampant for a while.

655
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,480
But as long

656
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,850
as you hold fast to these principles,

657
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,300
you are those

658
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,960
solitary yet unyielding

659
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,020
sparks of light

660
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,980
in the boundless darkness.

661
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,450
Mrs. He,

662
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,950
I was also among those

663
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,190
who misunderstood Mr. He several times.

664
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,260
Only today did I truly come
to understand—

665
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,660
completely understand—

666
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,720
what kind of person he really is.

667
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,240
Thank you both.

668
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,350
Dr. Ke,

669
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,850
thank you.

670
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,230
Rua de São João de Brito: 9;

671
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,190
Rua do Padre António: 13;

672
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,800
Rua de Santa Rita: 35.

673
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,300
No need to list them one by one.

674
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,410
Just give me the total.

675
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,200
Yes, sir.

676
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,150
In a single day yesterday,

677
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,590
the 3 major charitable organizations,
including Tongshan Hall,

678
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,250
collected 314 bodies from the streets—

679
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,370
not counting the epidemic-related deaths
at Kiang Wu Hospital.

680
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,580
At this rate,

681
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,520
today's death toll from starvation

682
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,050
is expected to exceed 400.

683
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,949
What about Lisbon?

684
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,960
Same as the previous diplomatic notes.

685
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,850
The Japanese government's reply

686
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,770
remains that it cannot interfere

687
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,639
with the military's
normal security operations.

688
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,520
So

689
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,449
Lisbon's diplomacy

690
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,730
is essentially useless.

691
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,270
Is the Portuguese government just going

692
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,230
to stand by and let the Japanese

693
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,960
do whatever they want in Macau?

694
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,280
Their advice to Macau is:

695
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,050
to avoid the situation

696
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,679
spiraling out of control,

697
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,850
as long as Portuguese sovereignty

698
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,060
over Macau is not threatened,

699
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,520
all other concessions to the Japanese side
can be considered.

700
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,930
[Under the threat of Japanese military
force during World War II,]

701
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,180
[the Portuguese colonial government
in Macau signed a series]

702
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,860
[of cooperation agreements with Japan.
Not only did they promise]

703
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,000
[to completely suppress all anti-Japanese
organizations and activities in Macau,]

704
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,290
[but they also handed over nearly all
of Macau's foreign trade,]

705
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,830
[shipping, customs, and even
arms smuggling interdiction rights]

706
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,010
[to be jointly controlled
by the Japanese.]

707
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,270
Consul Fukue,

708
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,020
the Governor has personally signed,

709
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,880
agreeing to all 7 conditions
proposed by your side.

710
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,270
Please expedite reporting

711
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,710
to your command headquarters

712
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,060
and ensure your military

713
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,460
lifts all blockades
on Macau immediately.

714
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,220
Rest assured, both of you.

715
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,770
Since Macau has made a wise choice,

716
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,510
the Japanese Imperial Army

717
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,980
will naturally respond
with full goodwill.

718
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,810
I will

719
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,310
call General Yazaki right now.

720
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,890
Wait.

721
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,610
Colonel Sawa.

722
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,900
Let me see.

723
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,230
The contents here

724
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,640
seem incomplete, don't they?

725
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,210
All 7 conditions are present—

726
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,870
how could it be incomplete?

727
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,800
But originally,
this proposal was

728
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,890
accompanied by 3 additional suggestions

729
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,640
from our side, wasn't it?

730
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,320
Colonel Sawa,

731
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,140
those 3 were merely suggestions

732
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,940
and were never included
as part of the conditions.

733
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,470
But if Macau

734
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,230
is willing to cooperate
with the Japanese Imperial Army,

735
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,370
why drag its feet

736
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,960
and ignore

737
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,450
the good and sincere cooperative
suggestions we proposed?

738
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,100
Are these "good suggestions"?

739
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,160
This amounts to de facto occupation.

740
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,480
If that's the case,

741
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,350
why not just send troops

742
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,810
to occupy Macau directly,

743
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,230
so Portugal

744
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,620
doesn't have to bear the empty title
of sovereign power in vain?

745
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,260
The Japanese Imperial Army

746
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,730
fully respects

747
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,160
Portugal's sovereignty.

748
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:51,960
What we hope for

749
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,350
is simply to achieve closer,

750
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,850
all-encompassing cooperation
with the Macau government.

751
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,780
Go back and tell your Governor

752
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,410
that what the Empire of Japan wants

753
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,930
is not just the 7 conditions,

754
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:06,040
but the entirety—
including the 3 suggestions.

755
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,770
Furthermore,

756
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,030
in light of the Imperial Army's
sincere eagerness

757
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,780
to finalize this cooperation,
the Governor

758
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,480
must sign within 10 days—

759
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,890
by 6:00 PM

760
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,850
on February 18th.

761
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,060
After that, the offer expires.

762
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,100
See you.

763
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:34,850
These past days,

764
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,140
the Portuguese government
has repeatedly lodged diplomatic protests.

765
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,640
Not only am I, the Macau Consul,
under immense pressure,

766
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,350
but so is His Excellency

767
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,980
the Foreign Minister in Tokyo.

768
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,890
We finally compelled
the Portuguese Macau government

769
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,520
to agree to the 7 conditions,

770
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,950
achieving the results demanded
by the command headquarters.

771
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,320
Colonel Sawa, what authority do you have

772
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,710
to unilaterally insist on turning the
3 suggestions into rigid conditions,

773
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,060
forcing the Portuguese Macau government
to sign everything?

774
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,480
It's impractical

775
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,610
and a blatant overreach of authority.

776
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,240
Colonel Sawa,

777
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,000
how do you

778
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,500
explain this?

779
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,330
General, before I explain,

780
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,270
there is something
I'd like you to see first.

781
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,680
This is the "porridge" being distributed
by the MGCC to the refugees.

782
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,180
Twenty days ago,
there were 16 distribution points.

783
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,520
A week ago, it dropped to 7.

784
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,180
Today, only 2 remain.

785
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,080
I sent my men disguised
to queue for 6 hours

786
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,100
at one of them

787
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,850
to get this bowl
of what they call porridge.

788
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:59,730
In other words,
Macau has been drained dry.

789
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,320
Colonel Sawa,

790
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,460
when you first proposed the plan,

791
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,060
you confidently stated

792
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,160
that a month-long blockade at most
would secure a complete victory.

793
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,250
Yet now the blockade
has already lasted 40 days.

794
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,290
The Navy is eager
to redeploy forces southward

795
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,880
and has repeatedly requested to withdraw
from the blockade.

796
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,390
By continuing to tie up the Empire's
precious military resources,

797
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,390
are you so certain
you won't break your promise again?

798
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,950
Due to the desperate struggles
of those Chinese merchants,

799
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,880
Macau did hold out a few extra days.

800
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,620
But those Chinese merchants are now
on their last legs—

801
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,080
they can't possibly produce
any more grain.

802
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,770
General,

803
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,600
we have now reached

804
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,230
the final stage
of this contest of endurance.

805
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,630
It all comes down to
who can hold out longer.

806
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,270
Since we are firmly
in the winning position,

807
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,290
why should we abandon the opportunity

808
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:47,390
to achieve de facto control over Macau?

809
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:51,450
General.

810
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,290
As long as we hold out

811
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,310
until the final deadline—February 18th—

812
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,110
we will secure Macau completely

813
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,640
for the Empire.

814
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,980
I guarantee it.

815
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:14,680
[Kiang Wu Elementary School]

816
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,060
It is indeed
the Old General's handwriting.

817
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:22,820
Look,

818
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,540
this signature

819
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,090
matches perfectly
in every stroke.

820
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,700
We've also been searching all along—

821
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,580
who would have thought

822
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,750
they were right here in Macau.

823
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,060
Where is the messenger?

824
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:34,680
Outside.

825
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,150
He says he's Dr. Ke Lin's younger brother.

826
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,170
You've come from Yan'an?

827
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,470
Where I'm from isn't important.

828
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,390
What matters is

829
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,090
that we're all Chinese.

830
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,330
Hmm.

831
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,350
What are your conditions for the rescue?

832
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,930
To take him back to Yan'an,

833
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:56,640
or to have him issue statements
condemning the Nationalist government

834
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,900
and supporting the Chinese Communists?

835
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,820
Mr. Liang, you worry too much.

836
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,890
We've long assured all involved

837
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,780
that we impose no conditions
on those we rescue.

838
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:07,810
Then what's the purpose?

839
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,200
For the sake

840
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,880
of the Chinese conscience—

841
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:11,990
will that suffice?

842
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,560
What do you need me to do?

843
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,460
We do need your help with one matter.

844
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,460
Please, go ahead.

845
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,620
We've heard

846
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,270
you're well acquainted
with Mr. Ma Wanqi of Hengfengyu?

847
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:24,930
Yes, quite.

848
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,840
It's like this:

849
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,660
once the person reaches Zhongshan,

850
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,260
we will make proper arrangements.

851
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,700
But with the Japanese enforcing
a complete blockade of Macau now,

852
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,290
we need to find a secure transfer route

853
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,520
from Macau to Zhongshan

854
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,600
as quickly as possible.

855
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,730
Mr. Ma, entrusted by you,

856
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,740
has been providing

857
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,710
certain special supplies to Chongqing.

858
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,910
He is well-connected in those circles.

859
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,390
If it's about finding
such a secret route,

860
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,850
I believe he would be
the most resourceful.

861
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:56,960
Okay.

862
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,180
I will speak to him about this.

863
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,680
Wanqi is someone
who puts his heart into any task.

864
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,680
If he agrees,

865
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,020
he will ensure it's handled properly.

866
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,870
Thank you very much, Mr. Liang.

867
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,910
You're Dr. Ke Lin's younger brother?

868
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:11,730
As far as I know,

869
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,730
Dr. Ke Lin is very close with Wanqi.

870
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,480
Why come to me through you,

871
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,140
taking such a roundabout way?

872
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,680
I've already

873
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,610
caused enough trouble
for my brother in this matter.

874
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,770
As for what follows—

875
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:24,980
especially

876
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,140
the more confidential transfer
and escort work—

877
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,180
it's neither appropriate

878
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,560
nor suitable for him
to become too deeply involved.

879
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,770
So, what you're saying

880
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,060
is he's…

881
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,590
Completely out of the loop.

882
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,520
He doesn't seem like...

883
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,470
Well,

884
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,890
perhaps it's best
if he remains outside it all,

885
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,810
to avoid unnecessary trouble.

886
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,180
To be honest,

887
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:47,980
in Macau,

888
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,390
Dr. Ke Lin is my closest

889
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,270
and most respected friend.

890
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,530
In times like these,

891
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,910
having a true friend
you can confide in isn't easy.

892
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,600
Rest assured, Mr. Liang.

893
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,330
He's also my own elder brother.

894
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,510
I, too, hope he can
live peacefully and steadily,

895
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:04,440
fulfilling his role as a doctor.
