you've been pushing for the Imperial Army
to directly occupy Macau.

170

But General Matsui
firmly opposes this strategy.

to repay a favor.

185
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,360
A favor? What do you mean?

186
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,100
Last time I asked you to put on an act
in front of Wang Qizheng,

187
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,370
didn't I promise you

188
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,190
that I'd help you make a fortune?

189
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,900
It was nothing.

190
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,060
Xian, you're taking it too seriously.

191
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,650
Is your President Saito from Lyun Coeng

192
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,320
going crazy lately,

193
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,030
buying up supplies everywhere?

194
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,680
He wants everything, no matter what it is.

195
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,980
That's true. These Japanese

196
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,290
have gone desperate.

197
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,510
I heard that in their country,

198
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,480
even cooking pots from ordinary homes

199
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,180
and nails from the roof beams
have all been collected.

200
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,380
So now, no matter what can be purchased,

201
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,030
Saito is willing to pay top dollar.

202
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,010
As long as one can get the goods,

203
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,720
the company offers
frighteningly high commissions.

204
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,650
That's perfect.

205
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,050
Recently, I've gathered

206
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,140
inventory from all merchants across Macau.

207
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,810
There are some machines,
equipment, instruments,

208
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,010
and some small parts.

209
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,460
But they're either too old

210
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,790
or incomplete sets.

211
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,230
Nobody elsewhere would want them.

212
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,020
But I wonder if President Saito

213
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,890
would mind.

214
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,980
Mind? He wouldn't.

215
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,570
Right now, for any metal products

216
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,740
that can be melted down and reused,

217
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,810
he'd be more than happy to take.

218
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,610
Not to mention

219
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,340
there are so many usable items there.

220
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,170
But one thing,

221
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,000
Xian,

222
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,900
do you really plan
to sell them to the Japanese?

223
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,190
Didn't you just say

224
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,360
Saito offers such high commissions?

225
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,000
Once this deal is done,

226
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,650
the fortune I promised you

227
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,840
will be yours.

228
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,100
But, Xian,

229
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,480
are you serious?

230
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,300
You still don't believe me?

231
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,110
However,

232
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,310
I have one condition.

233
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:17,960
Chairman,

234
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,100
this is the list of supplies
I've recently acquired.

235
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,240
Looks like quite a lot.

236
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,590
Well done.

237
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,870
Well done.

238
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,530
You're too kind.

239
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,190
Although the quantity is large this time,

240
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,720
the equipment and parts are incomplete,

241
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,610
and they cost a high price.

242
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,840
Why worry about high prices?
Who cares if they're incomplete?

243
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,680
These supplies,

244
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,750
for factories back home
suffering from bombings,

245
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,760
are as precious as gold.

246
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,550
Manager He,

247
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,810
you've done well.

248
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,310

However,

252
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,120
what's urgent now

253
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,230
is how to transport these supplies.

254
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,740
As you know,

255
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,890
all the merchant ships in Macau

256
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,430
have been requisitioned by Command.

257
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,660
We have no ocean transport capability now.

258
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:26,830
Maybe there's a way
in Guangzhou or Hong Kong?

I just remembered.

261
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,420
There's an opportunity.

262
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,450
There are supplies
confiscated by Colonel Sawa

263
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,420
in the Steamship Sai On incident.

264
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,790

arranged a ship

265
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,650
to transport them back home soon.

266
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,060
Our Lyun Coeng shipment isn't that large.

267
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,090
It would only take up a small corner
of the warehouse.

268
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:45,140

They are both crucial supplies

Why are you apologizing?

297
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,740
I promised you before

that you could use the dividends
from Tai Fung Bank to buy land.

Tell me.

00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,410
Why do I want to buy properties?

So our family has assets and a foundation.

Yes.

309
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,100
A family must first
establish its foundation

310
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,359
to give its members peace of mind.

311
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,940
But as the old saying goes,

312
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,880
wealth never survives 3 generations.

313
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,599
And why is that?

314
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,440
Because even with great wealth,

315
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,550
you can't prevent

understand the greater path,

and country before family,

00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,490
then why worry that this family

do the right thing

330

Yes.

Why is that right?

333
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,940
Because one should
prioritize the greater good

334

Here's the news from Xiao Feng.

378
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,480
The 2 Japanese ships
carrying our tungsten ore and diesel

379
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,010
have already set sail
from the Hong Kong pier.

380
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,690
Then hurry upstairs and send the message.

381
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,880
Don't worry, Xian.

382
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,490
The bomber squadron
is already on standby at the airport.

383
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,280
None of them will escape.

384
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:10,950
Ping,

385
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,150
cover for me for a moment.

386
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,910
Hurry up.

387
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,680
Hurry.

388
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,350
Who would've thought?

389
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,900
After we suffered such a big loss,

390
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,210
Xian would use a pile of junk

391
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,570
to lure them out.

392
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,340
Xian always has a plan.

393
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,970
For all the tungsten ore and diesel,

394
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,900
it would've been painful enough
to lose them ourselves,

395
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,900
let alone letting those Japanese
have them.

396
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,810
Dream on.

397
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:48,550
[Hang Taai Mercearia]

398
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,770
Kong it.

399
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,710
I just got word

400
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,680
that those 2 Japanese ships,

401
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,020
boom, had been blown to bits!

402
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,840
Win via Draw after Kong with Four Kongs!

403
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,670
Isn't that a big hand?

404
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,950
It's beautiful.

405
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,110
Yes.

406
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,230
Yinwan.

407
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:21,820
Yes?

408
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,370
When the war is over,

409
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,280
what are your plans for the future?

410
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,260
I've thought about it,

411
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,190
but I haven't decided yet.

412
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,510
But I have.

413
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,090
After all this is over,

414
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,650
I'll resign from the government

415
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,100
and sell Bachongtian Club.

416
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,730
Why?

417
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,280
You've stayed at Bachongtian Club

418
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,610
because you have something you want to do.

419
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,060
I've always known

420
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,420
that you long for a pure stage.

421
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,690
Your violin

422
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,350
should be played for those

423
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,400
who truly appreciate music.

424
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,500
I'm so tired after all these years.

425
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,810
I want to leave all these disputes behind

426
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,280
and fulfill my dream

427
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,080
to establish

428
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,940
a genuine,

429
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,910
pure orchestra

430
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,750
and return to the original purpose
of music.

431
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,810
That's wonderful.

432
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,360
Yinwan.

433
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:13,830
Yes?

434
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,190
Will you do this with me?

435
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,780
In this war,

436
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,560
many children have lost their families
and homes.

437
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,550
After the war ends,

438
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,900
I should return to the orphanage

439
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,870
to help those children

440
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,800
find hope in their lives again.

441
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,910
Well then...

442
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,440
Then I'll go with you.

443
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,530
Whatever you do,

444
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,060
I'll support you.

445
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,950
Dr. Lok Pak.

446
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,190
Actually, I think

447
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,660
you should do

448
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,230
what you truly want to do.

449
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,120
I...

450
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,600
[Chengxin Company Order]

451
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,360
Getting so much cargo this time.

452
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,200
When I first got the order,

453
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,430
I didn't expect the quantity
to be so large.

454
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,100
Mr. He and Mr. Ke's appetite

455
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,780
is getting bigger and bigger.

456
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,330
It's not about my appetite.

457
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,040
The war situation is developing rapidly,

458
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,640
and domestic demand is high.

459
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,680
Ever since the bombers
from Zhijiang Airport

460
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,890
could fly directly
to the Japanese homeland

461
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,130
and drop bombs on their Imperial Palace,

462
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,990
the Japanese have been panicked.

463
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,250
Yang Chang's intelligence station

464
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,040
has also received notice from above.

465
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,000
They say the Japanese

466
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,830
are desperately moving troops,

467
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,580
preparing for a large-scale attack
on Zhijiang.

468
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,840
Hundreds of thousands of national troops
are preparing to meet them head-on.

469
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,240
The battle line is already far from
the Yunnan-Guizhou rear.

470
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,410
Once the battle begins,

471
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,650
relying on the Burma Road and the Hump

472
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,800
for limited supplies won't be enough.

473
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,180
So,

474
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,230
the supplies coming through Macau
this time

475
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,690
are more than ever before.

476
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,510
That's right.

477
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,820
And in North and Central China,

478
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,370
taking advantage
of the enemy's vulnerable rear,

479
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,820
the Eighth Route Army
and the New Fourth Army

480
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,970
are also about to launch
a full counteroffensive.

481
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,180
The supply gap is significant,

482
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,780
so we've asked Mr. Rodrigues

483
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,030
to help with the procurement.

484
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,010
Excellent.

485
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,900
The day we have long awaited—

486
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,430
the counteroffensive—has finally arrived.

487
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,440
I think the goods
will arrive in a day or two.

488
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,000
You'll need to prepare more manpower;

489
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,600
otherwise,

490
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,810
I won't be able to unload everything.

491
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,330
Luo, don't worry.

492
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,920
However many people you need,

493
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,640
I'll send them to you.

494
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,360
Good.

495
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,140
Also,

496
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
the Japanese anti-smuggling rights
in Macau

497
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,290
have been canceled,

498
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,690
but this shipment is extremely important.

499
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,900
Better safe than sorry.

500
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,020
So when the time comes,

501
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,220
we'll all keep watch at the pier.

502
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:05,650
Yeah.

503
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,360
Sure.

504
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,640
I'll have Gonçalves
send more Portuguese police

505
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,190
and find a reason to secure the pier

506
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,320
to ensure the safety of this shipment.

507
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,610
This is also it.

508
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,980
Mr. Fukue!

509
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,600
Look at these.

510
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,010
I've gathered all the investigation
and surveillance information

511
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,320
about anti-Japanese forces in Macau

512
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:54,220
from the past 3 years!

513
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,340
I plan to compile

514
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,970
a detailed analysis report,

515
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,810
along with new recommendations
for Macau operations,

516
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,470
to submit to Command as soon as possible.

517
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,050
New recommendations for Macau operations?

518
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,380
What recommendations?

519
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,310
Of course, the armed occupation of Macau.

520
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,140
What else could it be?

521
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,640
Mr. Fukue.

522
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,690
You know everything that's happened
these past 3 years.

523
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,800
The entire Macau

524
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,200
has been completely controlled by He Xian

525
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,140
and anti-Japanese elements.

526
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,300
The Anglo-American forces
have established contact with them,

527
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,820
and the Portuguese Macau government
has joined their camp.

528
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,170
If the Imperial Army deploys immediately
to occupy Macau,

529
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:46,420
the Macau issue
can be completely resolved!

530
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,490
Then why did you ask me to come?

531
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:55,500
I want you to jointly submit
this proposal with me.

532
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,210
General Matsui is very displeased with me

533
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,960
and doesn't agree with
the military occupation strategy.

534
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,180
I alone can't convince Command.

535
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,280
Why?

536
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,740
You don't want to co-sign?

537
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,760
Well then,

538
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,840
you can take the lead in submitting it,

539
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,740
and I'll co-sign. That works too.

540
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,180
It seems I do need to submit

541
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,500
a formal written proposal to Command.

542
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,360
That's more like it.

543
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,630
I'll draft the report immediately.

544
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,810
You'll just need to sign it.

545
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:44,430
I'm submitting it myself,

546
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,980
not jointly with you.

547
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,140
Not jointly with me?

548
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,320
Then what do you

549
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,160
plan to recommend?

550
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,540
I recommend that Command

551
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,390
abolish the Sawa Agency.

552
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,330
What are you thinking?

553
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,200
Have you lost your mind?

554
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,390
I'm not crazy!

555
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,220
You are!

556
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,770
Your sheer obstinacy

557
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,760
has led to

558
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:34,200
the irreversible situation in Macau.

559
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,240
I did it all for the Empire,

560
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,360
for the Sacred War,

561
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,500
and for the Emperor!

562
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,610
No!

563
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,550
You simply

564
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:51,260
can't accept defeat!

565
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,460
Ever since you were repeatedly
defeated by those Chinese merchants,

566
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,660
especially by He Xian,

567
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,700
Sawa,

568
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,220
you've gone mad!

569
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,790
You're escalating the situation.

570
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,220
Even when the Imperial Army

571
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,090
is in such an unfavorable position,

572
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:11,290
you still want to use them
to occupy Macau!

573
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:28,610
Your insane ideas

574
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,750
have seriously jeopardized
the Empire's Sacred War.

575
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,570
As the Consul in Macau,

576
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,420
I must take responsibility
for the Empire's interests.

577
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:42,750
Therefore,

578
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,750
I will submit a report to Command,

579
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,750
detailing all your actions
over the past 3 years

580
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,330
with comprehensive documentation.

581
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,750
I believe that once Command
receives my report,

582
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,070
they'll take appropriate action
against Sawa Agency.

583
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,490
Great. The goods have finally arrived.

584
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,640
Chief.

585
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,000
Chief.

586
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,490
Chief.

587
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,560
Are you alright?

588
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,510
Chief,

589
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,690
Captain Huang has important information
to report.

590
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,030
Chief,

591
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,530
we just discovered something important.

592
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,630
At the inner harbor pier,

593
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,800
Rodrigues' company

594
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,080
has 2 large cargo ships that have docked.

595
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,620
Since they started unloading,

596
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,690
the Portuguese police have completely
sealed off the entire port.

597
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,020
Nobody is allowed near.

598
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,030
But the people unloading

599
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,640
seem to all be
from the Tai Ho Brotherhood.

600
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,630
Our people simply can't get close.

601
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,460
Also,

602
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,900
He Xian and his people were there too.

603
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,950
They kept watch for 2 whole days

604
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,230
while they were unloading the cargo.

605
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,700
They didn't leave

606
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,400
until all the goods were placed

607
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,890
in Rodrigues' warehouse.

608
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:34,870
Chief,

609
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,280
according to Captain Huang's report,

610
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,650
the underground anti-Japanese forces
in Macau

611
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:43,250
are organizing the transport
of new supplies,

612
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:46,100
and the quantity is unprecedented.

613
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,000
What do you think we should do?

614
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,110
Major Yamaguchi,

615
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,800
well, this...

616
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,000
Keep monitoring the situation first.

617
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,900
I'll report to Chief later.

618
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:09,660
Yes.

619
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:11,920
Wait.

620
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,000
Chief.

621
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,440
There's a mission

622
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,880
I need you to arrange right away.

623
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,030
What is it? Please give me your orders.

624
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,700
Chief,

625
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,310
are you sure about this?

626
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,020
Was I

627
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,240
not clear enough?

628
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:22,950
Yes.

629
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:24,950
In this matter,

630
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,210
I'll follow your instructions.

631
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,070
I'll do my best.

632
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,420
Consul,

633
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,710
the early morning ship to Guangzhou

634
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,400
will depart in one hour.

635
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,460
The car is ready.

636
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,900
This is a top-secret report for Command.

637
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,690
Asahina,

638
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,280
you're responsible for safekeeping it.

639
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:00,910
Yes.

640
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,010
Let's go.

641
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,520
Consul!

642
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:09,060
[Operating Room]

643
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,880
Stand guard here

644
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,680
and don't move an inch.

645
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,760
I'll go report to Chief.

646
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:23,920
Yes.

647
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,300
Hello?

648
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:29,790
Dr. Ke.

649
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,690
What?

650
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,150
Yasumitsu Fukae has been assassinated?

651
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,390
This will be like an earthquake for Macau.

652
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,480
Contact everyone immediately

653
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,550
to prepare for contingencies.

654
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,320
Especially regarding
the Portuguese Macau government,

655
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,530
you must stay informed of the situation

656
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,930
and try to keep them calm.

657
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,870
Alright, I understand.

658
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,070
Wang Qiuzai and Fearless Biao

659
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,880
have been hidden
in my underground smoking room.

660
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,780
That place is very secluded.

661
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,650
Ordinary people would never find it.

662
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,420
However...

663
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,340
However what?

664
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,780
Fearless Biao,

665
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,540
when he grabbed the briefcase,

666
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,440
seems to have been spotted
by Fukue's secretary.

667
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:12,910
Just...

668
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,980
Just a glimpse.

669
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,470
It shouldn't be a problem.

670
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,650
Hello?

671
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,940
I got it.

672
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,580
Keep watching closely.

673
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,040
Report immediately if anything happens.

674
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,300
Bring Fearless Biao back.

675
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,190
Now?

676
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,860
Yamaguchi just reported

677
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,520
that Asahina has been taken to surgery.

678
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,020
The hospital says
his injuries are very serious.

679
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,790
There's little hope for his recovery.

680
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,050
Wang Qiuzai is responsible
for reconnaissance.

681
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,300
He can stay hidden.

682
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,730
But Fearless Biao

683
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,280
is the action team leader
of your Special Operations Team.

684
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,530
He's always at the forefront
of everything.

685
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,160
At a time like this, he can't be hiding.

686
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:20,170
Otherwise, people might become
suspicious of him.

687
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,350
Yes,

688
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,460
I'll take care of it right away.

689
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,330
Hello?

690
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,730
Is it General Matsui?

691
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,560
This is Sawa Eisaku.

692
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,550
I have terrible news.

693
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,000
Consul Fukue...

694
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,820
Consul Fukue...

695
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,220
Just now,

696
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,450
he was killed!

697
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,830
I'm sorry!

698
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,180
I'm sorry!

699
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,470
Yes!

700
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:10,700
Yes.

701
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:12,730
Yes.

702
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:49,800
♪ City of joy ♪

703
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,400
♪ City of love ♪

704
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:57,670
♪ Paradise of dreams ♪

705
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,420
♪ Flourishing Tokyo ♪

706
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,120
This

707
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,170
is the newly-received ultimatum

708
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,380
from the Empire of Japan
to the Portuguese Government

709
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,840
and the Macau government.

710
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,240
It states that the assassination
of Yasumitsu Fukae

711
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:19,520
is the greatest provocation
against the Empire of Japan.

712
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,150
The Macau government bears

713
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,980
undeniable responsibility for this.

714
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,850
Therefore,

715
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,800
the Japanese
Southern China Expeditionary Army

716
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,210
has imposed a punitive blockade on Macau

717
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,960
and reserves the right
to take further military action

718
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,000
until the facts of this case are clarified

719
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,840
and the perpetrator is properly punished.

720
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,630
The Japanese side has appointed

721
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:43,390
Keiichi Imai,
Deputy Consul General of Guangdong,

722
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,010
to urgently take over
as the new consul in Macau

723
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:46,940
and proceed to Macau,

724
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,630
demanding that upon Consul Imai's arrival,

725
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,780
he takes over all investigative authority
for this case.

726
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,690
The Macau government and police
must fully cooperate

727
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:57,090
without any interference or obstruction.

728
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,600
Allowing the Japanese
to conduct investigations in Macau?

729
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,770
This is an outright usurpation
of our judicial sovereignty!

730
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,230
Exactly. This is absolutely unacceptable.

731
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,870
How can we possibly let
the Japanese handle the investigations?

732
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,730
The government should immediately
protest to Japan

733
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,950
and demand they respect international law!

734
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,800
Everyone!

735
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,090
Look carefully.

736
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,230
This is Japan's ultimatum

737
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,030
with no room for negotiation.

738
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,320
The Japanese are fully prepared

739
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,650
to deploy troops to Macau at any moment.

740
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,760
Accept it, or declare war.

741
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,860
No other options!

742
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,230
The immediate issue

743
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,970
is that a foreign consul
has died in Macau.

744
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,240
No matter what,

745
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,510
we do bear some responsibility.

746
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,960
The Japanese don't trust
the Macau government,

747
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,430
and we have no choice
but to accept it now.

748
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,670
Your Excellency the Governor,

749
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,260
there's big trouble with the Fukue case.

750
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,590
What has happened?

751
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,270
The police have just found

752
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,730
the abandoned vehicle
involved in the murder on the shore.

753
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,360
Investigation shows
it belongs to Rodrigues' company.

754
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,690
My company's car?

755
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,960
Yes. Along with the car,

756
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,280
your secretary Santos' body
was also found.

757
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,390
One of the murder weapons
from the Fukue case was in his hand.

758
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,520
Damn it.

759
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,200
This is a frame-up.

760
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,790
This is clearly a setup!

761
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,360
Your Excellency the Governor,

762
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,690
when will the new Japanese Consul arrive?

763
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,670
Keiichi Imai has left Guangzhou

764
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,800
and will arrive in Macau at 10 tonight.

765
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,340
So in 5 more hours,

766
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,510
the Japanese will take over

767
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,570
the investigation of the Fukue case?

768
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:34,050
Yes.

769
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,000
I guess their first search target

770
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,780
will definitely be my company
and warehouse.

771
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:39,670
So we must act before then

772
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,210
and quickly move these supplies

773
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,000
into hiding.

774
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,560
But my fleet has just arrived at the port.

775
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,270
Now the entire Macau

776
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,800
has been completely blockaded

777
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,050
by the Japanese.

778
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,300
The fleet can't leave at all now.

779
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,050
Besides,
the quantity of goods is so large.

780
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,870
Just unloading them

781
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,450
took 2 whole days.

782
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,760
In such a short time,

783
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:04,900
how can we possibly transport everything?
