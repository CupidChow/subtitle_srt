00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,670
[Hong Kong, December 24, 1941]

4
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,420
Xian,

5
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,650
could you not go tomorrow?

6
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,630
With so much to handle
at home right now,

7
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,530
could you skip going to Huilong tomorrow

8
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,810
and help me pack instead?

9
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,280
If our whole family
really moves to Macau,

10
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,390
we won't know anyone there,

11
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,020
and every little thing will cost money.

12
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,090
You have to think about Father
and the children too.

13
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,079
Besides,

14
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,210
Huilong's withdrawal has been open
for half a month already.

15
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,040
Most who were able to withdraw their money
have already done so.

16
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,590
There's just that one last person left.

17
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,050
How can you be sure
they'll show up tomorrow?

18
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,150
Look at how chaotic Hong Kong has become…

19
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,480
people are dying, and others are fleeing.

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,020
What if…

21
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,350
what if that person
has already left Hong Kong.

22
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,340
But what if

23
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,230
that person hasn't?

24
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,320
By the way, Yinwan,

25
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,579
let me talk to you
about something serious.

26
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:20,930
Hmm?

27
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,700
Tomorrow, don't go to the orphanage.

28
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,829
Pack your luggage in advance instead.

29
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,950
So urgent?

30
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,740
Yes.

31
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,280
Didn't the British Governor say

32
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,410
Hong Kong could hold out for
at least another six months?

33
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,170
It won't be six months—

34
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,170
I'd say

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,829
just a day or two at most.

36
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,560
That fast?

37
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,930
That's exactly why we need
to prepare early.

38
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,640
Once there's a ceasefire,

39
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,710
the transport links
between Hong Kong and Macau

40
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,420
are sure to be among the first to reopen.

41
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,280
Then, we can go to Macau together.

42
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's not talk about this anymore.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,730
After all, it's Christmas Eve.

44
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,140
We can leave these troubles for tomorrow.

45
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,240
Hey,

46
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,260
how about I play you a tune?

47
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,790
Do you want to listen?

48
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,300
Moonlight shines

49
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,810

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,400
Little one...

51
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,680
Renyu!

52

Moonlight shines

53

54
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:27,430
Little one, be good and go to sleep.

55
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:33,720
Tomorrow Mom has rice shoots
to plant so deep,

56
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:39,770
and Granddad takes the buffalo
up the hill to keep.

57
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,180
What did you say?

58
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,620
You've mixed up in a smuggling affair.

59
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:46,960
It's nothing.

60
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,300
I just wanted to make some extra money.

[William Jones, Royal Navy Lieutenant]

62
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,720
If I had known that Huang Gongjie

63
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,130
was crazy enough to smuggle tungsten ore,

[Mary Jones,
Wife of Lieutenant William Jones]

65
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,570
I would never have done it.

66
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,000
Now it's too late to cover it.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,260
The Governor has already
started the full investigation.

68
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,000
Tungsten ore?

69
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,620
Is it... that important?

70
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,980
It's a kind of rare and critical
strategic material for a country's war.

71
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,870
It is used to make warships,

72
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,150
tanks, armored vehicles,
and armor-piercing shells,

73
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,300
and every nation expected it.

74
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,360
What?

75
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,190
A key strategic resource,

76
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,830
and you let it fall into the hands
of the Japanese.

77
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,440
William,

78
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,060
t-that's treason.

79
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,670
I know, I know, I...

80
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,730
I know, I know, I...

81
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,950
I only work with Yang Chang.

82
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,100
I didn't expect the situation

83
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,310
to become this messy.

84
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,140
Yang Chang?

85
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:33,890
Is that

86
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,750
the Chinese sergeant
who keeps coming to our house?

87
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,120
No wonder he kept bringing you envelopes.

88
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,650
So that was the bribe money—

89
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,930
to keep the operation quiet.

90
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,830
Listen, it's okay, alright?

91
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,230
This is not a problem.

92
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,630
I just need your help now.

93
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,540
Colonel Lyons is the one
running this investigation.

94

He's also your cousin, right?

95

I need you to put in a good word
on my behalf.

96
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,800
Just convince Lyons

97
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,390
to put the blame on Yang Chang,

98
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,390
nothing else.

99
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,570
He's a Chinese.

100
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,300
The case wouldn't be affected.

101
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,660
Never imagined my husband

102
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,990
would be involved in something so sordid.

103
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,000
Mary, listen.

104
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,810
Do you have any idea
how much a lieutenant earns?

105
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,700
Do you think I can afford
all of this? I can't.

106
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,330

Speak to the Colonel.

113
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,800
He would help me if you do.

Once I am safe,

116
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,950
I will help him.

117
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,010

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,210
Colonel Lyons!

189
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,400
Save me. Save me!

190
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,000
I implore you! I implore you!

191
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,050

[Withdrawals & closures:

193
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,940
Xian,

194
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,760
someone's buying the wardrobe.

195
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,910
They're coming to pick it up soon.

196
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,970
Can you help me pack the clothes
into the luggage?

197
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,890
[Notice: This bank will close indefinitely
due to the war.]

198

[Withdrawals & closures:

199
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,020
Got it.

200
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:38,480
Don't just say it—do it.

201
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,090
[Notice: This bank will close indefinitely
due to the war.]

202
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,270
Start packing, okay?

203
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:40,940
[Withdrawals & closures:
within 15 days with deposit slip.]

204
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,540
I'm going out to check on Dad.

205
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,880
Please come in.

206
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,310
[Mr. Quiver,
Chief Manager of HSBC Hongkong]

207
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,070
Jose, what is it?

208
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,440
Mr. Quiver,

209
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,060
those items in the vault

210
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,060
must be getting rid of immediately.

211
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,810
Otherwise, HSBC
will make an unforgivable mistake,

212
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,540
and we'll all go down
in history as criminals.

213
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,520
Jose,

214
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,660
I don't get it.

215
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,090
Why are you so anxious?

216
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,560
Those Hong Kong dollars
and printing plates are safe.

217
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,230
This is Hong Kong,

218
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,940
the crown jewel of the British Empire
in the East,

219
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,640
and it will always belong
to the British Empire.

220
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,590
So in just the past two weeks,

221
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,020
the British Empire

222
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,540
has lost New Territories and Kowloon.

223
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,180
With just the tiny island
of Hong Kong left,

224
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,710
how long do you think
the British Empire can hold out?

225
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,440
The Royal Army is invincible.

226
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,500
The British Empire is not like China.

227
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,540
Those reddish-head Japanese...

228
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,680
They might be bullying the Chinese.

229
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,680
What do you think?

230
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,700
I'm Chinese too.

231
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,280
Dear Jose,

232
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,660
I didn't mean you.

233
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,680
I never considered you
as some ordinary Chinese.

234
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,520
You're my dear friend.

235
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,020
Mr. Quiver,

236
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,830
I'm Chinese.

237
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,940
It's fair if you want
to ignore my advice.

238
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,230
It's fine if you want
to stay here with HSBC

239
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,230
and with those two financial time booms.

240
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,730
And it's fine if you want to cling
to your faith in imperial invincibility.

241
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,280
But I'm done with it.

242
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,810
I quit.

243
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:25,990
Jose!

244
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,810
Xian, have you done packing?

245
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:32,580
[Notice: This bank will close indefinitely
due to the war.]

246
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,840
[Withdrawals & closures:

247
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,990
I'm sorry,

248
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,680
Qiwen.

249
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,680
It's alright.

250
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,020
Just be safe

251
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,530
and come back soon.

252
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,420
Thank you.

253
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,900
Jose,

254
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,150
wait a minute.

255
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,680
I'm sorry.

256
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,230
You were right.

257
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,160
What do you mean?

258
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,520
Governor Sir Mark Young just called.

259
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,160
The government has decided
to surrender to the Japanese army.

260
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,140
We have to take preventive measures

261
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,330
before they take over the bank.

262
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,540
How much time do we have left?

263
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,660
The agreed signing time is 6 p.m.

264
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,880
Jose, please.

265
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,560
I was wrong before.

266
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,590
But now HSBC needs you.

267
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,070
Please.

268
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,040
Stay,

269
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,800
even if just to handle

270
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,230
the transfer of the goods.

271
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,970
Please.

272
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,300
Hello?

273
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,590
Renyu.

274
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,520
What did you say?

275
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,970
Surrender?

276
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,760
I don't have time to explain now.

277
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,190
You—pack your things,

278
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:52,970
get ready,

279
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,310
and ask around
about any boats in the area.

280
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,560
Get to Macau at the earliest opportunity.

281
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,660
Mary, listen.

282
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,390
Pack all our valuables at home.

283
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,470
Hurry.

284
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,470
T-The British is surrendering, alright?

285
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,350
Hong Kong is doomed.

286
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,880
W-What about you?

287
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,920
There are still two things at the bank
I must take care of.

288
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,760
How can you still care about the bank

289
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,060
at a time like this?

290
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,970
It's not that I want to delay.

291
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,780
These two shipments are critical—

292
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,800
I must secure them.

293
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,170
If the Japanese get them,
it'll be a disaster.

294
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,380
We have six or seven hours

295
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,940
until the ceasefire.

296
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,160
Now go and pack.

297
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,800
Be good.

298
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,160
W-What about you?

299
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,850
I'll meet you later

300
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,400
after I finish the mission at the port.

301
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,280
Just leave.

302
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,470
Okay.

303
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,130
Wait! William, hold on.

304
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,880
What?

305
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,070
If we're leaving,

306
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,760
then what about Yang Chang?

307
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,670
Yang Chang?

308
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,900
The Chinese man
who took your place in prison.

309
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,350
You promised me

310
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,310
you'd get him out.

311
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,300
How can you still think

312
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,630
of Yang Chang right now?

313
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,230
William, he took the fall for you.

314
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,680
You can't just abandon him.

315
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,060
Besides, it is no small affair

316
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,260
and we'll get asked questions
when we get back to England.

317
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,080
You can't just leave him
rotting in there forever.

318
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,760
Alright. Thanks for reminding me.

319
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,560
I promise, no worries.

320
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,450
I will get him out of prison.

321
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,640
I swear.

322
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,090
Okay.

323
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,730
Mummy...

324
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,190
Sweetheart,
I know you don't want to leave it.

325
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,810
But I promise

326
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,860
we'll get a new one, alright?

327
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,400
Hey, look,

328
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,970
I don't like wearing this.

329
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,130
When we get home tonight,

330
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,470
I'll pick some flowers

331
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,900
and make you a flower crown.

332
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,570
It'll be much prettier than this,
I promise.

333
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,850
Really?

334
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,710
Really!

335
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,610
I promise.

336
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:30,800
Be careful.

337
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,950
Don't let it snag your hair.

338
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,470
Hmm.

339
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,440
Good kids.

340
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:53,680
Who is it?

341
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,090
It's Qiu.

342
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:55,880
It's Qiu.

343
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,560
Don't worry, no one followed me.

344
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:00,990
Mr. Huang.

345
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:01,720
How did it go?

346
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,140
Haggled with Fearless Biao for ages.

347
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,470
Finally got it settled.

348
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,780
Once the ceasefire in Hong Kong starts,

349
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,990
he'll take us to Macau on his speedboat—

350
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,040
the one he uses for his opium runs.

351
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,590
Only thing is, his price
is a real rip-off.

352
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,050
He's asking for this much.

353
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,540
A hundred? That's not bad.

354
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,570
A hundred what?

355
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,370
Ten thousand!

356
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,190
Ten thousand?

357
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,110
The bloody nerve!

358
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,160
Who does this Fearless Biao think he is?

359
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,940
He's nothing but

360
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,110
a two-bit pimp

361
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,400
and opium pusher!

362
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,690
Exactly.

363
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,290
Mr. Huang,

364
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,190
he used to be ready

365
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,680
to lick your boots!

366
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,060
And now he's charging this?

367
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,400
How dare he?

368
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,160
Times have changed.

369
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,280
I'm no longer

370
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,880
the Second Helmsman
of the Tai Ho Brotherhood.

371
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,400
And now the Brotherhood

372
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,470
has put a kill-on-sight order

373
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,210
out on all of us.

374
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,420
We're lucky Fearless Biao

375
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,920
is even willing to take us.

376
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,020
And right now,

377
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,590
we wouldn't dare

378
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,680
trust anyone else's boat.

379
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,900
Mr. Huang,

380
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,900
I got some important news this time.

381
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,090
The bank where you keep your money—
Huilong Bank—

382
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,420
is operating normally,

383
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,560
and withdrawals are still allowed.

384
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,160
Mr. Huang,

385
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,510
this is what they call

386
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,910
"heaven never seals off all exits."

387
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,440
But there's a catch—

388
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,640
today's the last day.

389
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,010
Let's go!

390
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:12,470
Let's go, Mr. Huang.

391
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,880
Come back here!

392
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,740
Come back here!

393
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,839
W-What's wrong,

394
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,440
Mr. Huang?

395
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,450
Today's the last day.

396
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,099
I opened the account anonymously

397
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,470
to hide it from the gang,

398
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,210
but you need the deposit slip

399
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,970
to get the money out.

400
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,680
That slip…

401
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,420
when the gang caught us…

402
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,730
This...

403
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,500
Mr. Huang,

404
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,950
how could something so important

405
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:42,990
be destroyed?

406
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,050
I-Is that any way to talk to Mr. Huang?

407
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,250
But… that's our lifeline in there.

408
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,400
What do we do now?

409
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,340
Let's just rob it!

410
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,050
Lieutenant William,

411
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,900
Why did you bring these convicts?

412
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,290
Who else could I entrust

413
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,530
such a dangerous mission to,
except for them?

414
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,360
But they're civilians.

415
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,160
It's the responsibility of the bank

416
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,860
and the navy to transport these supplies.

417
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,920
They're serious criminals, not civilians.

418
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
Move! Move! Move!

419
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,010
Get all prisoners out of the trucks!

420
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,090
Go! Go! Go!

421
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,290
All the prisoners, out of the trucks!

422
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:37,680
Go! Go!

423
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:44,750
Yang Chang,

424
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,860
This is your chance.

425
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,120
I arranged it for you. You can go.

426
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,540
You're serious, right?

427
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,900
Thank you, my friend!

428
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,070
But first,

429
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,490
move the goods.

430
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,450
You're gonna get me killed.

431
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,440
Go! Go! Go!

432
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,050
I'll count to three,

433
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,230
and I'll start shooting.

434
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,190
One.

435
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,720
Quick! Load the goods onto the ship.

436
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:21,550
Two.

437
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,620
Okay. Okay. Okay.

438
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,310
I'll go.

439
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,210
Go!

440
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,550
I'll go.

00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,870
Hurry up! Go!

448
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,550
Go! Go! Go!

449
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,440

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,050
Right now! Go!

Lieutenant William!

455
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,620
Stop! Stop! Stop!

456
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,460
We haven't finished the job.

457
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,620
You can't leave!

458
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,470
Go!

459
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,820
No, no, no!

460
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,680
What are you doing?

461
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,540
Get out of here!

462
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,230
Mr. Qiao, look!

463
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,120
Look!

464
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,230
Mr. Qiao, even the warships
have surrendered now.

465
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:02,730
W-What

466
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,680
do we do?

467
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,560
These damned British...

468
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,320
First, load the goods onto the trucks.

469
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:07,600
Got it.

470
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,290
We'll figure out a way.

471
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,050
Okay.

472
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,600

[Huilong Bank]

474
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,250
I finally found you!

475
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,800
Do you still remember me?

476
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:26,840
I-I'm

477
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,140
a client of Huilong Bank.

478
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,100
Y-You

479
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,920
haven't forgotten me, have you?

480
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,880
Three months ago,

481
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,600
I opened an anonymous account
at Huilong Bank.

482
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,660
I've been depositing

483
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,690
quite a bit back and forth since…

484
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,360
Look,

485
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,640
Sir, I know you need the deposit slip

486
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,860
to make a withdrawal at Huilong Bank.

487
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,530
But with the war going on,

488
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,180
I lost mine.

489
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,290
But doesn't the bank keep its own ledger?

490
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,880
You told me yourself,
since I was a major client,

491
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,860
you'd record my account

492
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,680
on the very last page of one.

493
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:01,880
Yes, that's right… it's this ledger,

494
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,970

495
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,530
on...

496
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,860
on the last page.

497
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,010
What...

498
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,130
happened...

499
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,940
Sorry.

500
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,100
The bank was hit in an air raid
and caught fire.

501
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,730
That last page...

502
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,470
it burned.

How have I ended up like this?

Don't you know that, Master Huang?

512
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,600

during this immediate
post-ceasefire period.

751
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,080
Comrade Ke Zhengping.

752
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,030
Here!

753
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,340
You will lead the escort mission

754
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,400
for this transfer,

755
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,630
ensuring the safe arrival
of the first protected group

756
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,260
to Macau.

757
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,610
Once there,

758
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,950
implement concealment measures first,

759
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,470
then

760
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,880
look for the right opportunity

761
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,400
to expedite their onward relocation
to the rear.

762
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,130
Understood.

763
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,110
What about the boat to Macau?

764
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,740
It has already been arranged.

765
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,940
Any other questions?

766
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:28,570
No.

767
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,700
Time is critical. Meeting adjourned.

768
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,030
Comrade Ke Zhengping,

769
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,430
stay for a moment please.

770
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,800
On the Macau side,

771
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,720
there is a comrade
with the code name "Buddha's Hand"

772
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,920
who will be handling
your Macau concealment

773
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,450
and onward relocation.

774
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,450
That means

775
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,110
you and your protection unit

776
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,340
will be under the direct command
of Comrade Buddha's Hand

777
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,340
from the moment you arrive in Macau.

778
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,220
Understood.

779
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:50,900
Then…

780
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,510
how do I contact Comrade Buddha's Hand?

781
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,860
We haven't been able to inform him yet

782
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,400
of your specific departure time.

783
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,490
But Comrade Buddha's Hand is

784
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,420
a seasoned veteran.

785
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,740
The organization believes that

786
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,150
with his experience and capability,

787
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,110
he will be able to make

788
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,380
the most accurate assessment

789
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,440
and arrange the most suitable
reception for you.

790
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:06,920
Hmm.

791
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,050
Understood.

792
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,800
You dare set me up?

793
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,280
I kill you all!

794
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,920
Every damn Japanese soldier in Hong Kong

795
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,630
is after you foreigners right now.

796
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,950
Good luck surviving—

797
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,950
I'm catching a boat to Macau.

798
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,130
You can all rot here!

799
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,300
Stop right there!

800
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,650
Aren't you afraid all that noise
will bring the Japanese soldiers running?

801
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,920
You said it yourself—

802
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,270
Japanese soldiers are all over Hong Kong.

803
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,880
We can't escape anyway.

804
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,340
So I'll shout.

805
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,440
I'll shout as loud as I can,

806
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,570
and bring every Japanese soldier here.

807
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,760
When they arrive

808
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,400
and find

809
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,150
a former

810
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,480
British Marine Police sergeant here too,

811
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,880
do you think they'll arrest you or not?

812
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,740
Are you insane?

813
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,590
Mary!

814
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:21,840
You damn bitch,

815
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,040
have you lost your mind?

816
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,010
That's right.

817
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,390
Quite possibly.

818
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,050
If we die,

819
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,980
we die together.

820
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,970
No one gets out alive!

821
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,180
What the hell do you want from me?

822
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:14,740
Didn't you just say
you're taking a boat to Macau?

823
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,380
Take us with you!

824
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,700
Why on earth should I take you to Macau?

825
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,800
Can you really stand by

826
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,030
and let those beasts gun us down?

827
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,860
-Daddy!
-Daddy!

828
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,610
-Xian, you're finally back.
-Daddy!

829
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,760
Do you realize

830
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,050
how late it is?

831
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,060
The whole family's been worried sick.

832
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,090
I'm sorry,

833
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,740
I tried to get back sooner,

834
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,440
but there were

835
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,130
Japanese checkpoints blocking
so many roads along the way.

836
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:00,660
I had to circle around forever
to make it home.

837
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,810
What's all this?

838
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,380
We agreed

839
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,820
we'd leave for Macau

840
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,550
once the war ceases, didn't we?

841
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,900
I've been asking around all evening,

842
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,670
and the neighbors said

843
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,000
there are already boats to Macau
leaving from Tsim Sha Tsui.

844
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:14,820
Really?

845
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,280
Hmm.

846
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,610
We don't know how many boats there are

847
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:17,800
or whether

848
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,900
we can get on,

849
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,670
but many neighbors are going
to try their luck.

850
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,150
We should go too and see.

851
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,360
Xian,

852
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,840
what's wrong?

853
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,610
The last depositor

854
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,500
came to withdraw his money.

855
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,110
The last depositor?

856
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,150
The 30,000-something dollars left
in our family savings…

857
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,680
it was a depositor's money.

858
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,420
Now that he has taken it…

859
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:41,990
we…

860
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,770
have no money left to go to Macau.

861
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,340
Not a single one was captured?

862
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,830
Affirmative, sir.

863
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,550
We raided the addresses

864
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,880
of all Chinese targets.

865
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,250
They had all vanished.

866
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,490
Clearly,

867
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:00,700
a coordinated protection operation
was carried out.

868
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,530
Additionally, several hours ago,

869
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,700
multiple officers escaped
from the British military barracks.

870
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,650
The exact number and ranks
are still being verified.

871
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:10,880
Report!

872
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:11,840
Enter.

873
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,590
Unidentified vessels have appeared
near the beach in Tsim Sha Tsui.

874
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:21,850
Many Hong Kong citizens are gathering
along the shore, attempting to board.

875
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,030
No wonder the targets vanished.

876
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,990
Seal the coastline immediately!

877
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,060
Do not let them escape!

878
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:32,950
Yes, sir!

879
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,150
Don't blame yourself too much

880
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,450
about the withdrawal.

881
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,150
About the money—

882
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,320
look,

883
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,420
I sold some things

884
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,170
from the house today,

885
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,490
and some jewelry too.

886
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,440
We have 470 dollars now.

887
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,240
That should cover the boat tickets,
shouldn't it?

888
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:55,800
I understand your worries.

889
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,170
It's about having no money, right?

890
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,780
Back then,

891
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,630
you started as an apprentice

892
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,340
at the age of 13,

893
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,800
went into business on your own at 16.

894
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,260
With no capital,

895
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,150
I scraped

896
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,950
together 200 dollars to get you started.

897
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,020
You peddled oils and grains

898
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,510
street by street,

899
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,800
worked as a middleman,

900
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,770
earned every bit

901
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,380
through hard work.

902
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,840
And later,

903
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:26,720
we opened our own bank.

904
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,610
We built it up, step by step.

905
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,650
At worst,

906
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,810
we start over from scratch.

907
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,840
Yes,

908
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,070
Father is right.

909
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,270
Before, you struggled alone.

910
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,340
Now we have a whole family—

911
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,360
more hands make lighter work.

912
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,340
As long as we're together,

913
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,200
there's nothing we can't get through.

914
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,780
Hmm.

915
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,870
Mummy's right.

916
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,170
As long as we're together,

917
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,360
we'll make it work.

918
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,130
Hmm.

919
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,840
Alright then.

920
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,260
Let's all go to Macau together—

921
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,880
our whole family—

922
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,880
and carve out a new future!
