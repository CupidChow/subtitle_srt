[Silent Tides]

2
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,979
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,440
Everyone, please give

4
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,600
a warm welcome to Miss Qiao
for her wonderful performance.

5
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,040
Okay, everyone.

6
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,560
Next, let's welcome Miss Qiao

7
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,090
to perform "Tzigane" for us.

8
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,240
A round of applause!

9
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,280
Yinwan.

10
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,410
Xian.

11
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,250
What on earth is going on?

12
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,050
Why are you at Bachongtian Club?

13
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,370
I forgot to tell you

14
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,680
that I've resigned
from Kiang Wu Elementary School

15
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,610
and returned to Bachongtian Club.

16
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,370
Why?

17
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,610
I was always a violin player,

18
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,130
and the salary here is much higher.

19
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,950
Would you really come back
to Bachongtian Club for a higher salary?

20
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,370
The Special Operations Team is
right upstairs.

21
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,100
You're jumping into a fire pit!

22
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,029
Come with me.

23
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,590
Miss Qiao,

24
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,770
h-here's the thing...

25
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,240
Your performance just now was

26
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,130
absolutely stunning

27
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,510
and breathtaking.

28
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,180
Colonel Sawa Eisaku
of the Japanese Imperial Army is

29
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,010
specially sending

30
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,470
this flower basket to you.

31
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,510
Dr. Lok Pak,
you truly have an eye for talent.

32
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Bachongtian Club

33
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,860
got an artist like Miss Qiao,

34
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,390
so we are fortunate tonight

35
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,460
to feast our ears on such beautiful music.

36
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,880
And he's rewarding you with 10 gold bars.

37
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,860
Dr. Lok Pak,

38
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,370
please pass these on

39
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,250
to Miss Qiao.

40
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,600
Thank you.

41
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,840
Thank you for your kindness,
Agency Chief Sawa.

42
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:43,920
Chief,

43
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,460
why did this woman, Qiao,

44
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,870
have to come to Bachongtian Club

45
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,420
instead of anywhere else?

46
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,310
She came here just to go against us!

47
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,500
What kind of trouble

48
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,570
could a woman possibly stir up?

49
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,070
Didn't you say

50
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,800
that the money was for Lok Pak?

51
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,390
Why did you give it to her?

52
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,750
Weren't you being too generous with her?

53
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,150
Did I do this for her sake?

54
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,940
You were showing some respect to Lok Pak.

55
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,550
Then you know what to do, huh?

56
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,620
I promise

57
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,330
that I won't let something like this

58
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,680
happen again.

59
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,330
Also,

60
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,490
weren't you supposed
to be monitoring He Xian?

61
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,500
He Xian came to find Lok Pak.

62
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,840
Why haven't I heard your report?

63
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,660
Chief,

64
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,950
we usually report the surveillance results

65
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,830
to you the next day, right?

66
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,010
We haven't had time yet...

67
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,450
Don't make excuses!

68
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,450
Keep a close eye on He Xian

69
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,340
and report to me immediately.

70
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,540
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

71
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,450
Why didn't you tell me that Yinwan

72
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,830
had returned to Bachongtian Club?

73
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,830
I was just about to tell you.

74
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,500
Then why didn't you stop her?

75
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,720
I can't be more delighted
at Yinwan's return to Bachongtian Club.

76
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,850
Why would I stop her?

77
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,120
The Special Operations Team is
right upstairs,

78
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,370
yet she's back here,

79
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,500
smiling while saying thank you
to Sawa Eisaku.

80
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,900
Don't you wonder why?

81
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:06,950
Why?

82
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,030
To avenge her brother's death.

83
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:12,920
No way.

84
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,800
I must persuade her to leave.

85
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,830
It's too dangerous for her to stay here.

86
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,630
In my opinion,

87
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,420
letting Yinwan stay
in Kiang Wu to hang around

88
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,370
with Principal Liang,

89
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,900
and especially with you, is

90
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,320
what's truly dangerous.

91
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,570
Yinwan decided to come back

92
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,260
to Bachongtian Club herself.

93
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,330
As for her safety,

94
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,740
you just saw it yourself.

95
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,000
With me around, no one dares to touch her.

96
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,940
I'd like to suggest you

97
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,820
not forget your position.

98
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,990
From now on,

99
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,120
try to contact Yinwan less often.

100
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,250
What do you mean by this?

101
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,600
As I told you just now,

102
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,920
you also know very well

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,560
that you're on the Japanese

104
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,070
priority watch list.

105
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,700
Wanqi.

106
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,890
What?

107
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,160
Do I look bad in this?

108
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,400
No.

109
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,470
I just don't understand
why you're doing this.

110
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,660
I was thinking

111
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,450
that no matter how severe
your pneumonia is,

112
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,250
you'll recover in a month or two.

113
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,010
When you've recovered,

114
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,660
spring will be coming.

115
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,700
While you have time,

116
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,380
let's hold our wedding, shall we?

117
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,679
I know you're busy

118
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,169
and don't have time
for these trivial matters.

119
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,030
I'll arrange everything.

120
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,680
It won't take up your time.

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,860
What's wrong?

122
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,870
Did I do something wrong?

123
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,450
Baixin,

124
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,900
take a look at these first.

125
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,610
These are all enrollment ads
from foreign universities.

126
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,290
Why are you showing me these?

127
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,410
Didn't you want

128
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,720
to study before?

129
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,450
Now Hong Kong has fallen.

130
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,750
Macau isn't safe, either.

131
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,210
If you want to study,

132
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,630
you can only go abroad.

133
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,790
These schools are all quite good.

134
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,230
Take your time to choose

135
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,820
and see if any of them suits you.

136
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,200
Wanqi.

137
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,260
Are you trying to send me away?

138
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,710
Tell Ms Ming once you've made your choice.

139
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,570
I've given her money
for your travel and tuition.

140
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,030
There's no need to tell me.

141
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:41,770
Yinwan,

142
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,790
come with me.

143
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,150
Xian.

144
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:49,890
What's wrong?

145
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:50,950
What's the matter?

146
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,220
Yinwan,

147
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,270
I know you hate the Japanese.

148
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,050
You came to Bachongtian Club

149
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,250
to find a chance to avenge your brother.

150
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,500
But Agency Chief Sawa's men are
professional intelligence agents.

151
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,450
How can you

152
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,320
fight against them alone?

153
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,660
This is my own business.

154
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,250
The Japanese killed my brother.

155
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,530
They killed so many of our people.

156
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,650
Now I have a chance

157
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,430
to get close to them

158
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,030
and try my best to gather information

159
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,760
to prevent more people
from being harmed by them.

160
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,690
If you were in my place,

161
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,460
you would do the same, wouldn't you?

162
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:33,840
Yinwan.

163
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,340
I understand how you feel.

164
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,110
But it's really dangerous for you to stay

165
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,940
at Bachongtian Club alone.

166
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,490
So what if it's dangerous?

167
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,720
Weren't you also risking your life

168
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,380
to steal the printing plates?

169
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,870
When I learned from my brother

170
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,810
that the printing plates were hidden
in the orphanage,

171
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,200
and that my task was

172
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,370
to play that melody

173
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,830
to pass the message to you,

174
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,620
I hesitated.

175
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,280
I didn't know
if I should play that melody.

176
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,180
Why?

177
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,110
Because I saw with my own eyes

178
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,870
that the place had become

179
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,270
the Japanese Naval Club.

180
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,350
And I also knew

181
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,360
that once I played that melody,

182
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,740
no matter how dangerous the situation,

183
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,580
you'd go there anyway,

184
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,180
even at the risk of your life.

185
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,480
Xian.

186
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,870
My brother taught me with his life

187
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,130
that great love is great righteousness.

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,930
So I must stay at Bachongtian Club.

00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,580
Mr. Ke,

564
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,090
do you really want to be the mediator?

565
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,700
If we want
to turn the situation in Macau around,

566
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,110
the feud between Master Sanhe
and Rodrigues must be resolved.

567
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,210
I'm an outsider.

568
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,330
Perhaps I could have a talk
with Master Sanhe.

569
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,410
I understand, but...

570
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,050
Master Sanhe is furious right now,

571
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,100
and he's still wanted
by the Portuguese Macau government.

572
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,120
I'm not sure

573
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,740
i-if he'll come back.

574
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,240
It's alright.

575
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,580
Just tell him

576
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,400
that I'll be waiting for him here.

577
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:11,930
Okay.

578
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,400
[Kiang Wu Elementary School]

579
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,500
[Purchase government bonds
to protect our country together]

580
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,850
Mr. Liang,

581
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,730
the police have completed the closure.

582
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,590
Sorry for the disturbance.

583
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,510
Mr. Liang,

584
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,500
it's Christmas Eve today.

585
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,200
The Saint Dominic's Church is holding

586
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,570
a midnight mass ritual.

587
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,740
Governor De Solaire, on behalf
of the Macau government, has invited

588
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,700
representatives from various states
and all sectors of Macau

589
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,060
to attend the ceremony.

590
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,760
This is a personal invitation for you
from His Excellency the Governor.

591
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,980
We hope you will attend, Mr. Liang.

592
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,950

[Fundraising Committee Member]

595

Xian.

596
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,600
About what happened yesterday,

597
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,630
it was my fault.

598
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,710
I'm sorry.

599
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,860
Keep an eye on the dance hall business.

600
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,190
I won't be back tonight.

601
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,620
Yes, Boss.

602
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,170
But Miss Qiao has been
looking for you several times today.

603
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,380
If she asks me again,

604
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
what do I say?

605
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,510
Just tell her I'm away on business
for a couple of days.

606
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:14,860
No,

607
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,240
tell her I won't be back for a week.

608
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,860
Understood.

609
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,450
Miss Qiao?

610
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,710
What on earth is going on?

611
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,310
What do you mean?

612
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,880
Such a vague question

613
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,860
has me completely confused.

614
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,720
You said you'd be the first
to vote against the bans.

615
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,940
Why did you go back on your word

616
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,470
and side with the Japanese?

617
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,760
When did I side with the Japanese?

618
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,280
I just cast an abstention vote.

619
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,250
How is that any different
from siding with the Japanese?

620
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,030
All patriotic activities are

621
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,160
banned in Macau now.

622
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,630
Mr. Liang and the students were beaten
by the intelligence agents.

623
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,730
Now, Macau has totally

624
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,050
become a place where the Japanese

625
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,510
can do whatever they want.

626
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,190
Why aren't you saying anything,

627
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,050
Dr. Lok Pak?

628
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,090
Do you think
that being a Portuguese citizen

629
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,350
means China's fate doesn't concern you?

630
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,050
Dr. Lok Pak.

631
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,350
Don't forget

632
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,620
that you are also of Chinese descent.

633
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,170
Chinese blood

634
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,260
runs in your veins.

635
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,320
What on earth made you change your mind?

636
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,460
Can you tell me?

637
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,510
You really need to know why,

638
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,110
don't you?

639
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:47,980
Yes,

640
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,200
I want to know.

641
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,250
Fine,

642
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,610
I'll tell you.

643
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,860
Everything I did was

644
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,420
for your sake.

645
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,280
Why did you come back to Bachongtian Club?

646
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,110
Why did you move into this room?

647
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,830
Was it really, as you said,

648
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,130
just for work?

649
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,160
Yes, I came back here
because of my brother.

650
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,820
It had nothing to do with He Xian?

651
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,180
He Xian?

652
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,480
You know very well deep down inside

653
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,230
whether it had anything to do with him.

654
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,900
Actually, I should have realized earlier.

655
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,750
If you weren't still attached to him,

656
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,270
how could you be so deeply hurt

657
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,400
and care so much?

658
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,220
There's nothing going on

659
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,320
between Xian and me.

660
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,370
It's not like what you're imagining.

661
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,830
You don't need to explain.

662
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,170
Yinwan.

663
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,580
You know my feelings

664
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,860
for you.

665
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,570
You can't accept me

666
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,770
because your heart
belongs to someone else.

667
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,770
I accept that.

668
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,660
But no matter what,

669
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,400
I can't let you risk

670
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,630
your life for others.

671
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,890
I can't just watch you
get yourself killed.

672
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,430
You think

673
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,910
watching every intelligence agent
passing by the door

674
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,470
and eavesdropping on everything they say

675
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,330
will get you useful information?

676
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,590
Do you think they'll never discover you

677
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,550
when you're just a wall away?

678
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,210
It's still better
than doing nothing, right?

679
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,480
Dr. Lok Pak,

680
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,900
I came here

681
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,170
not for any single person.

682
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,630
I'm fulfilling

683
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,590
my duty as a Chinese citizen.

684
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,730
That's exactly why I cast
that abstention vote!

685
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,630
Because I can't change
the situation in Macau.

686
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,440
I can't turn bandits
from evil guys to good ones.

687
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,110
I can't force you
to hold back and do nothing.

688
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,360
Perhaps,

689
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,130
only by banning
anti-Japanese protests in Macau

690
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,860
to stop you from doing anything

691
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,050
can I finally keep you safe.

692
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,700
I don't need protection!

693
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,380
I don't need this kind of life,
living on my knees!

694
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,480
I don't need it!

695
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,320
I need it.

696
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:13,890
Yinwan,

697
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,540
maybe in this lifetime,

698
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,670
I'll never find my way into your heart,

699
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,780
but I will never let anything
happen to you,

700
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,510
especially not under my watch.

701
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,280
Because I, Lok Pak,

702
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,800
will always protect the woman
I cherish and love.

703
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,160
I still need to go
to Saint Dominic's Church for the mass.

704
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,490
Our conversation today

705
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,400
ends here.

706
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,060
I hope you can stay safe

707
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,390
and stop getting yourself into trouble.

708
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,050
Merry Christmas.

709
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,350
Honestly, everyone can tell

710
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,210
that Miss Qiao has feelings

711
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:20,900
for you.

712
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,700
She went to that treacherous place,
Bachongtian Club,

713
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,280
partly because of you, right?

714
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,700
Chang,

715
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,730
there's nothing

716
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,720
between Qiao Yinwan and me.

717
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,950
But doesn't that

718
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,930
just add to your pressure?

719
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,440
Just like Mary...

720
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,010
I still can't get over

721
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,320
this guilt inside me.

722
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,650
I got her killed.

723
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,090
If I hadn't helped her,

724
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,150
she couldn't have established
that British Army Service Station.

725
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,550
And she wouldn't have...

726
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:08,820
You always scold me

727
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,980
for drinking myself numb every day
like a mindless zombie.

728
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,110
But if I don't drink,

729
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,780
all I see is Mary in her nurse uniform

730
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,450
at the last moment of her life.

731
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,400
Without alcohol,

732
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,320
I can't even close my eyes, Xian.

733
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,590
Yes.

734
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,900
Yinwan now is

735
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,530
just like Mary back then,

736
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,730
risking their lives

737
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,960
to fight right under the Japanese's noses.

738
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,590
Have a drink.

739
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,800
Drink more, and your worries will fade.

740
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,030
Wanqi?

741
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,640
Mr. Ma?

742
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,440
Mrs. He told me

743
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,770
that you and Chang were here.

744
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:22,730
You're sick.

745
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:26,820
Chang,

746
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,310
let him drink.

747
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,730
