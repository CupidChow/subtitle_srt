Weren't you supposed to come at 8 o'clock

to collect the payment?

[Rodrigues, Portuguese merchant in Macau]

16
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,430
from our American supplier.

17
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:12,310
This shipment can no longer be paid
in Hong Kong dollars.

18
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,280
It must be paid in US dollars only.

19
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,910
What?

20
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,800
The Headquarters is considering

21
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,670
using Macau as a replacement
for Hong Kong.

22
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,370
Once the Empire controls Hong Kong

23
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,800
or even the entire Southeast Asia,

24
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,320
Macau

25
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,780
will become the only isolated island
in the South China Sea,

26
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,460
or even in the entire Western Pacific,
surrounded by our imperial forces.

27
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,690
Given Portugal's limited military presence
in Macau,

28
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,860
if we're
really going to implement an occupation,

29
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,190
it will be child's play.

30
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,340
Therefore,

31
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,410
whether to directly occupy Macau

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800

Mr. Rodrigues,

36
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,440

Transactions in Macau have always been

38
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,860

where am I supposed to get you
this huge amount of US dollars?

43
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,410
Macau is indeed small,

44

impossible for us to make it!

In a nutshell,

53
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,800
this deal will be canceled unless you

54
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,890

to send a speedboat

58

only open at 9 AM.

Such a large amount of US dollars

63
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,060

just for the exchange.

Here's the thing.

103
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,070
I know that Lin and I are being
quite presumptuous

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,310
to approach you like this.

105
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,430
But I hope you can
hear me out before making

106
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,290
your decision.

107
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,650
Please go ahead.

108
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,340
Yesterday,
at the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal,

109
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,950
there was a fundraising performance
for national salvation.

110
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,080
It was you who helped defeat
the Japanese Specie Bank

111
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,550
and won a large sum of money from them,

112
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,950
right?

113
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,660
I was just doing a favor

114
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,520
by the way.

115
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,020
But this makes me believe

116
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,810
that you are a patriotic Chinese.

117
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,220
That fundraising performance was

118
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,640
for the war supplies

119
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,370
that Lin and I were purchasing.

120
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,500
These war supplies will exert

121
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,159
a direct influence
on the frontline situation.

122
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,840
Lin and I finally gathered enough money

123
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,170
and secured those goods.

124
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:38,870
They must be shipped

125
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,570
within a specific time today

126
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,510
to safely reach the rear areas.

127
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,580
But the supplier suddenly changed his mind

128
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,840
and now demands payment in US dollars.

129
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,780
In such a short time,

130
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,450
we can't complete
such a large currency exchange.

131
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,670
Now, the supplies might not only fail
to reach the frontline soldiers

132
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,080
but could even fall
into the hands of the Japanese

133
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,610
and become tools
for their invasion of China.

134
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
I see now.

135
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,580
Mr. He,

136
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,550
I know it's almost impossible for anyone

137
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,050
to complete this large currency exchange

138
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,400
in such a short time.

139
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,050
We've never met before,

140
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,990
and I know my request is

141
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,960
too presumptuous.

142
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,640
But...

143
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,450
Mr. Ma,

144
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,370
I can't

145
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,710
guarantee success,

146
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,250
but I can promise

147
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,290
that I'll do my absolute best.

148
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,990
Within your specified time,

149
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,020
however much I can exchange,

150
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,070
that's what you'll get.

151
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,550
Thank you, Mr. He.

152
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,450
Thank you.

153
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,130
There's one more thing.

154
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,700
The Japanese are also
coveting these supplies

155
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,690
and will stop at nothing to get them.

156
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,170
So please keep this under wraps

157
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,190
and don't reveal to anyone

158
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,820
the reason for this currency exchange.

159
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,020
Please rest assured.

160
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,930
I'll keep it confidential.

161
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,200
Thank you, Mr. He.

162
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,950

163
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:37,760
What business

164
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,670
got you in such a hurry?

165
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,080
It's still dark outside.

166
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,580
Call Quan right now

167
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,760
and tell him to wait for me at Huilong.

168
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,450
Okay.

169
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,840
I'm leaving.

170
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,340
Mm-hmm.

171
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,110
Such a big order,

172
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,460
and it's so urgent.

173
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,780
Where did you receive it from?

174
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,400
Don't ask

175
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,430
about the client.

176
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,220
I've promised to keep it secret.

177
00:06:59,220 --> 00:06:59,870
Lyu,

178
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,020
I promise you

179
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,840
that the client is
a legitimate businessman.

180
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,450
They just had an emergency come up

181
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,870
and needed help urgently.

182
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,400
Alright,

183
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,950
since you're vouching for it,

184
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,840
I won't ask any more questions.

185
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,460
Fine.

186
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,790
What do you need from me?

187
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,170
How many US dollars
do you have in your account?

188
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,080
I need all of it.

189
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,190
All of it?

190
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:14,750
Yes.

191
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,190
Also, we've got way too many banks
on the Finance Street.

192
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,820
I can't handle it all by myself.

193
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,780
I have

194
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,070
a list here.

195
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,900
Can you

196
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,630
help me visit a few of them?

197
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,340
I'm familiar with all these banks.

198
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,200
No problem. You can leave it to me.

199
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,450
Thank you so much.

200
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,020
In a word,

201
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,900
I need all the US dollars.

202
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,310
Before 7:30,

203
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,820
make sure they deliver it to Huilong.

204
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,310
Quan will settle the payment with them.

205
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:37,810
Okay.

206
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,750
Thanks.

207
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,450
Mr. He?

208
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,750
Come on.

209
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,610
Please come in.

210
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,820
Mr. He,

211
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,480
no worries.

212
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,050
I'll surely deliver it on time.

213
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:58,650
Thank you.

214

[Huilong Bank]

215
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,940
1,600 from Taihua Bank?

216
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,450
Okay.

217
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,280
Thanks.

from Hengfengyu has arrived.

220
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,060
Manager Chen,

221
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,430
thank you for coming.

222
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,140
No,

223
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,700
thank you for all the effort, Mr. He.

224
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,059
Here's the Hong Kong dollars I brought.

225
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,390
They're all in the suitcase.

226
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,850
How are things on your end?

227
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,030
I've contacted all the banks
on the Finance Street

228
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,740
and got all the US dollars here.

229
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,140
This is the total amount.

230
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,270
We're still 6,000 US dollars short?

231
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,120
Yes.

232
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,170
Throughout the Finance Street
of Hong Kong,

233
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,810
there are no more US dollars available.

234
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,050
For the remaining 6,000,

235
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,530
I'm afraid we'll have to wait
until the banks open.

236
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,310
The banks don't open until 9 o'clock.

237
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,450
After getting the US dollars,

238
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,820
I need to rush back to Macau.

239
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,580
If I don't make it back by noon,

240
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,240
that batch of goods just can't be shipped.

241
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,720
Oh, right.

242
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,620
HSBC (Hong Kong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation)

surnamed Qiao.

245
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,500
He's said to be quite willing

246
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,430
to reach out to his fellow Chinese.

247
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,830
Manager Chen,

248
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,090
do you know Mr. Qiao's address?

249
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,080
You're here to visit Mr. Qiao
for business, aren't you?

250
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,620
Yes.

251
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,200
For business matters, go to the bank.

252
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,700
How can you come so early in the morning

253
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,560
to disturb someone at their home?

254
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,790
I'm really sorry,

255
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,320
but I have urgent business.

256
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,120
Could you please let him know?

257
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,050
It's way too early.

258
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,270
It's really not possible.

259
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,170
Please leave.

please make an exception.

You may leave.

266
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,140
Our men hunted him all the way.

267
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,080
We thought Huang Gongjie

268
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:06,690
[Loyalty lasts forever]

269
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,350
would escape to nearby Macau.

270
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,120
But that bastard

271
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,170
knew we would try to intercept him.

272
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,080
He went straight across Lingding Channel

273
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,280
and fled to Hong Kong.

274
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,500
He's still

275
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,140
a wanted man in Hong Kong.

276
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,670
This bastard

277
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,910
won't stay there for long

278
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,860
and will try to escape elsewhere.

279
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,020
Send people
to the Hong Kong outpost immediately

280
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,830
and issue a manhunt order

281
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,160
to kill Huang Gongjie

282
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,290
with no mercy!

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,580
-Yes!
-Yes!

284
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:35,120
Mr. He,

285
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,360
what client is

286
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,270
so important

287
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,390
that you can't even wait
for the bank to open?

288
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,690
I'm sorry, Mr. Qiao.

289
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,840
I've promised my client to keep it secret.

290
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,720
I can assure you

291
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,770
that this foreign exchange
will be used legally and properly.

292
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,100
It's just that the client is
in a special situation

293
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,360
and needs it urgently.

294
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,570
Yes.

295
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,790
Come on, Renyu!
Why are you being so fussy?

296
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,720
Don't you keep
your HSBC clients confidential, too?

297
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,240
Besides, last night

298
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,000
when I mentioned Mr. He to you,

299
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,860
you told me

300
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,050
how amazing he was

301
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,530
and that you wanted to meet him.

302
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,930
Now he's here in person,

303
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,320
asking for your help,

304
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,320
yet you won't do this small favor?

305
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,920
I didn't say I wouldn't help.

306
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,120
But 6,000 US dollars is

307
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,620
not a small amount.

308
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,360
To exchange it before the bank opens,

309
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,600
I need to inform the bank's treasury

310
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,450
in advance.

311
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,430
The money needs to be
temporarily transferred from the vault.

312
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,230
So I should tell them the reason.

313
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,360
The reason is helping a friend!

314
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,100
Mr. Qiao,

315
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,790
if it were my own matter,

316
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,740
I would never trouble you like this.

317
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,770
But to be honest,

318
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,120
my client's matter is critical.

319
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,070
So

320
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,270
I had to come to you for help.

321
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,170
It's okay.

322
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,490
Renyu, stop being so fussy.

323
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,700
It's a small favor.

324
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,500
Just help out.

325
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,670
I didn't say I wouldn't help.

326
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,560
Oh, my!

327
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,410
I'll help.

328
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,370
I'll make the call right now.

329
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,940
Thank you so much.

330
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,500
You should thank Yinwan instead.

Double-check it again later.

346
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,240
Bad news!

347
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,310
The radio just reported

348
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,740
that Japan has attacked Pearl Harbor

349
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,340
and gone to war with America!

What did you say?

351
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,030
Is that true?

352
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,370
What's wrong, Renyu?

353
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,050
Last night,

354
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,850
Japan secretly attacked
Pearl Harbor in America.

355
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:34,950
Oh, no,

356
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,270
we're screwed.

357
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,690
Britain and America are allies.

358
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,450
Japan even dared to attack America!

359
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,000
Then Hong Kong is not safe, either.

360
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,220
I just wondered why He Xian

361
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,550
suddenly exchanged
so much foreign currency.

362
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,740
If the Japanese attack Hong Kong,

363
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,720
the Hong Kong dollar will be doomed.

364
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,050
It will collapse very soon!

365
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,650
The war started at midnight,

366
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,390
and he exchanged
for US dollars before dawn.

367
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,520
He must have gotten inside information
from somewhere.

368
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,620
We're done for.

369
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,210
He's taken all our foreign currency.

370
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,350
We've lost big time.

371
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,550
Oh, no.

372
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,460
What should we do now?

373
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,960
How about I go ask Xian about it later?

374
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,100
No time to waste.

375
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,150
Just go find him now!

376
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,340
-Go ahead!
-Go!

377
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,720
Your bag.

378
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,700
Look at what kind of friend you've made.

379
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,790
What?

380
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,830
Don't you understand?

381
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,080
If Japan and America go to war,

382
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,030
Hong Kong will
immediately end up in crisis.

383
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,910
He Xian is really something.

384
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,890
Even HSBC
didn't receive the news until just now,

385
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,120
but somehow he knew it first.

386
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,700
Before the Hong Kong dollar's sharp drop,

387
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,930
he came to exchange currency

388
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,570
when the banks were still closed.

389
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,980
He was simply using you

390
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,890
to get something without losing anything.

391
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,670
Impossible.

392
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,080
How is it impossible?

393
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,670
The fact is clear.

394
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,030
Or it couldn't be just a mere coincidence.

395
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,170
I'm off to the bank now.

396
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,630
Let's talk when I get back.

397
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:50,910
He Xian is here.

398
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,420
Mr. He!

399
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,570
He Xian!

400
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:53,790
Mr. He,

401
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,790
where's my money?

402
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,270
Mr. He, where are my US dollars?

403
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,200
Exchange our money back right now.

404
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,500
Yeah!

405
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,840
Exchange our US dollars back.

406
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,550
Return it to us!

407
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,880
-Yes! Return it!
-Guys,

408
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,080
what happened?

409
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,980
Stop playing dumb.

410
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,620
Hurry and exchange our US dollars back.

411
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,450
Hurry and exchange it back!

412
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,460
Exchange our US dollars back!

413
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,120
Yes, exchange it back!

414
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,930
Alright.

415
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,900
Xian, tell me the truth.

416
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,050
Did you know about this in advance?

417
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,570
Know what in advance?

418
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,530
The war between America and Japan.

419
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,500
Otherwise, why were you

420
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,120
in such a hurry
to exchange all the US dollars

421
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,050
from every bank?

422
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
America and Japan

423
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,130
have gone to war?

424
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,310
Why are you still playing dumb right now?

425
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,910
How could you do this
to your fellows in this industry?

426
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,450
That's right!

427
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,500
You're so disloyal!

428
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,320
Indeed!

429
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,100
You can't do this!

430
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,190
All right, enough!

431
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,860
Xian,

432
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,360
I don't care if you learned the news

433
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,770
in advance or not.

434
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,570
Exchange everyone's US dollars back,

435
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,290
and we'll forget about this matter.

436
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:40,950
Okay?

437
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,320
Lyu,

438
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,530
I'm afraid that's not possible.

439
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,000
Why not?

440
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,790
I was also entrusted by someone else

441
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,220
to exchange US dollars from you.

442
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,240
The money has been exchanged,

443
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,410
and I've notified my client.

444
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,190
My client is in dire need
of these US dollars for an emergency.

445
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,830
I can't delay their big plan.

446
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,550
Fine.

447
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,740
Then tell everyone

448
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,050
who this client is

449
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,910
and what these US dollars are for.

450
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,190
I'm sorry.

451
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,150
I've promised my client to keep it secret.

452
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,080
I can't tell you.

453
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,190
Listen to him making excuses!

454
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,150
Just tell us!

455
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:09,410
Yeah!

456
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,050
Don't be silent!

457
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:10,390
Say it!

458
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,320
Enough.

459
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,410
Stop it!

460
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,550
He Xian,

461
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,670
on behalf of everyone,
I'll ask you one last time.

462
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,400
Can you return these US dollars

463
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:22,930
or not?

464
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:26,950
Lyu,

465
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,250
if I've caused any losses for anyone,

466
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,950
I can offer nothing but my apologies.

467
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,410
Is this how you do business?

468
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:32,690
You're

469
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,690
being shameless!

470
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,120
What's going on?

471
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,530
The Japanese have attacked.

472
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,530
War's broken out.

473
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,120
Where are you going?

474
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,720
Take cover quickly!

475
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,000
Those US dollars are still in the bank.

476
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,060
I must get them out.

477
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,190

484
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,150
Push harder...

Are you alright?

00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,100
I'm fine.

00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,740

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,390

00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,369
Quan, take this suitcase away.

492
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:20,240
I need to take something out of here.

He's still inside.

Xian told me to bring out the US dollars.

He said
he had something important to grab.

502
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,960
At a time like this,

503
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,220
he's still trying to take something out?

Did you get hurt?

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,350
Where are the US dollars?

516
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,480
Here. They're here.

How could there be such a coincidence?

520
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,740
On today's last Steamship Sai On
heading back to Macau,

521
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,110
there was a fellow from Hong Kong

522
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,450
who witnessed

523
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,870
Huilong Bank being hit during the bombing,

524
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,650
going up in flames,

525
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,960
and being reduced to ruins.

526
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,450
What about the US dollars
you exchanged earlier?

527
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,890
I don't know the exact situation,

528
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,550
except that some people died.

529
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,460
Mr. Rodrigues,

530
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,950
all transport links
between Hong Kong and Macau have been cut.

531
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,690
Even if those U.S. dollars
weren't destroyed in the attacks

532
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:24,150
and are kept intact now,
it's nearly impossible

533
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,210
to recover them before a cease-fire.

534
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,110
I wish I had agreed to take
Hong Kong dollars.

535
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,170
Mr. Rodrigues,

536
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,150
if what I think is correct,

537
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,330
the American suppliers didn't request

538
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,950
the payment currency
be changed to U.S. dollars.

539
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,960
In fact, you learned about

540
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,670
this war before it happened.

541
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,960
That was why you asked for U.S. dollars.

542
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,560
Am I right?

543
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,910
What's the point of saying all this now?

544
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,110
Be it Hong Kong dollars or U.S. dollars,

545
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,410
now I only care about

546
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,830
what I have to do to get paid.

547
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,440
I'm more concerned about

548
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,090
the dozens of cases
of precision instruments and medicine.

549
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,950
You haven't paid a penny
for the previous shipment.

550
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,040
And you're now asking for this new one?

551
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,760
I know

552
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,610
you won't let me

553
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,410
have this new shipment of goods.

554
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,900
But I still have one request:

555
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,020
keep that shipment

556
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,400
and do not sell it to the Japanese.

557
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,190
This mess was caused
by your sudden change of mind on switching

558
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,320
the payment currency to U.S. dollars.

559
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,020
Commercial law

560
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,680
defines war as force majeure.

561
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,780
It won't be considered a breach

562
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,170
of contract if I suspend payments.

563
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,830
If you want the money
for the previous shipment,

564
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,930
you must promise me

565
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,290
not to sell this new shipment
to the Japanese.

566
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,280
Fine, I won't do that, okay?

567
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,630
Can you guarantee I'll get paid?

568
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,390
Whether or not those U.S. dollar bills

569
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,120
are intact or retrievable,

570
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,300
as long as you keep the goods
from the Japanese,

571
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,200
I'll see to it that you get paid.

572
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,890
When the bills are recovered, I'll pay up.

573
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,290
If they're forever lost,

574
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,930
I'll put all my assets for sale,

575
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,980
including my house and land,
or borrow from loan sharks

576
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,130
to make sure you receive
every penny you deserve.

577
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,390
But if you sell the goods to the Japanese,

578
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,630
don't blame me for refusing to pay.

579
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,000
Xian?

580
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,960
You're finally back.

581
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,740
Sit down.

582
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,830
Let me take a look.

583
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,150
Did you get injured?

584
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,690
I'm fine.

585
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,330
Are you really fine?

586
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,390
Yes, I am fine.

587
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,600
When

588
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,060
Quan brought those U.S. dollars back,

589
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,550
he told me that Huilong Bank
was bombed.

590
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,640
I was frightened out of my wits.

591
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,090
Yet you dashed into it
despite the explosion.

592
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,950
Please don't do that again, okay?

593
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,890
What can be more important than your life?

594
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,700
Don't worry.

595
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,060
Where's that box of U.S. dollars?

596
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
Father has it now.

597
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,800
Wait.

598
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:19,670
Father

599
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,630
heard some gossip about you.

600
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,390
He's a bit upset.

601
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,390
I get it.

602
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,000
There are...

603
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,640
six.

604
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,480
Right, six.

605
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,090
Note it down.

606
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,540
Okay.

607
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,000
Renyu.

608
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:46,780
Sir.

609
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,920
Why are you home so late today?

610
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,850
There was a run on the bank
the entire day.

611
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,040
People formed a line
that stretched over a kilometer.

612
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,350
Due to lack of manpower,

613
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,810
I had to work till just now.

614
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,550
Mr. Heng,

615
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,390
I can handle the rest myself.

616
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,480
Go get some rest now.

617
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,390
Okay, got it.

618
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,670
I'll be going then.

619
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,200
Okay.

620
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,390
What are you doing?

621
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,540
The orphanage has taken in
many refugee children.

622
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,260
The housemother
said they were out of food.

623
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,520
I plan to send
what we have at home to them.

624
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,460
But these...

625
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,260
can only last them for a few days.

626
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,890
Renyu,

627
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,910
is there any money on you?

628
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,300
The bank has imposed withdrawal limits.

629
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,150
Each person

630
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,610
can only withdraw 100 Hong Kong dollars.

631
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,520
I can't access my funds either.

632
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,410
Use it sparingly.

633
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,090
Okay.

634
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,200
Father,

635
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,700
I'm back.

636
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,240
Father...

637
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,190
Kneel.

638
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,260
Before our ancestors,

639
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,950
answer truthfully.

640
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:44,930
Yes.

641
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,870
Throughout this day,

642
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,020
did you engage in dishonest conduct
in business?

643
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,980
No.

644
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,190
Did you

645
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,540
break any promises?

646
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,130
No.

647
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,950
In any other thing you did,
did you live up to

648
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,410
the teachings of our ancestors

649
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,000
and act with a clear conscience?

650
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,460
I, He Xian, swear that I haven't done

651
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,000
anything deviated from my duty.

652
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,930
My conscience remains clear.

653
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,280
Nonsense!

654
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,930
How dare you lie before our ancestors!

655
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,390
I'll beat you to death, you dishonorable

656
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,740
disgrace to the family!

657
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,350
Father, Father!

658
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,910
Let go!

659
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,280
On... your knees.

660
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,800
Kneel!

661
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,980
Tell me.

662
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,110
What got into you and drove you

663
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,330
to scam your industry peers

664
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,300
for

665
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,370
filthy lucre?

666
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:43,890
I didn't.

667
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,170
How dare you deny it.

668
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,460
What you've done

669
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,710
has become the talk of the neighborhood.

670
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,370
Now, outside,

671
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,460
everyone is pointing fingers
at the He family!

672
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,090
Are all these people

673
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,000
falsely accusing you?

674
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,800
And...

675
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,650
What's in this box?

676
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,400
U.S. dollars I got exchanged

677
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,290
for a client.

678
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,300
Client?

679
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:13,900
What client?

680
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,640
I promised him confidentiality,

681
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,010
so I can't tell.

682
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,240
Not even to me?

683
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:25,890
No.

684
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:31,890
You...

685
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:33,650
Go on.

686
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,150
Father,

687
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,760
by exchanging currency
for a client this time,

688
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,090
I did cause losses to some industry peers.

689
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,190
But it was purely coincidental.

690
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,760
I had no prior knowledge

691
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,560
of Japan's attacks at Hong Kong.

692
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:47,800
Besides,

693
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,850
I can guarantee

694
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,370
this client is a legitimate businessman.

695
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,220
He had a valid reason
for this urgent exchange of currency.

696
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,780
And this business deal of his

697
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,710
is related to national interests.

698
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,390
Therefore, I had to

699
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,050
do my utmost to help him.

700
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,350
Are you...

701
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,600
telling the truth?

702
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,460
I swear to you

703
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,560
and our ancestors

704
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,490
that every word I've spoken

705
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,630
is absolutely true.

706
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,460
I'll believe you this time.

707
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,650
Get up.

708
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,100
But I have one more question.

709
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,250
You got this box of U.S. dollars

710
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,430
exchanged for a client.

711
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,280
It was so important an issue

712
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,780
that no mistake was allowed.

713
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,720
You did the right thing

714
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,850
by risking your life to bring this box

715
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,260
out of flames.

716
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,980
But why did you rush

717
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,060
back into the fire again afterwards?

718
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,390
Did you care that much about

719
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,320
those measly possessions inside?

720
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,260
You're head of our family.

721
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,310
If something had happened to you,

722
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,040
how would that leave Qiwen

723
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,100
and the children?

724
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,110
Father,

725
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,040
I know I made a very risky move.

726
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,390
But at that moment,

727
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,500
I had no choice
but to go back into the fire,

728
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,630
because this ledger must be preserved

729
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,480
under all circumstances.

730
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,450
Huilong's record of deposit accounts?

731
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,500
[Deposit Accounts]

732
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,150
Yes.

733
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,330
Huilong is a small bank.

734
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,480
Those who deposit money with us

735
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,010
are mostly ordinary people

736
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,240
of modest means.

737
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,510
They entrust their hard-earned money

738
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:42,610
[Li Tianyou deposited 120 dollars]
[Zhao Xuebao deposited 20 dollars]

739
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,650
to Huilong for my management

740
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,950
and interest earnings,

741
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,370
which shows complete trust

742
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:47,450
in me and Huilong.

743
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,470
Now, with Hong Kong in crisis,

744
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,460
everyone lives in uncertainty.

745
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,300
These deposits

746
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,760
could be life-saving money
for many of them.

747
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,400
I must ensure
they don't lose all their assets.

748
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,300
Xian,

749
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,300
you made

750
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,450
the right choice.

751
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,960
What do you plan to do next?

752
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,690
I will, of course,

753
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,000
raise funds

754
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,660
and prepare cash for deposit withdrawals.

755
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:26,800
But now,

756
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,700
all the cash in Huilong has been burned.

757
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,390
All trading has been suspended
on both the stock exchange

758
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,190
and the currency exchange due to war.

759
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,870
I can't cash the investments
made for the clients.

760
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,700
As for the money
we lent to our industry peers,

761
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,430
I failed to get even a penny back

762
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,980
after a whole day of trying.

763
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,190
Tell me.

764
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,310
How much money do you need now?

765
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,200
I did some rough calculations.

766
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,200
If I sell the house

767
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,580
and put together all I can offer,

768
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,400
only 40% of the deposits can be paid out.

769
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,630
That's far from enough.

770
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,430
I'd hate to let the depositors
suffer losses.

771
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,110
So,

772
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,130
I'll raise as many funds

773
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,060
as possible to pay out
the deposits proportionally.

774
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,460
All I ask for

775
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,320
is a clear conscience.

776
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,260
I understand.

777
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
You may leave now.

778
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,390
Qiwen,

779
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,030
I want a word with you.

780
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,330
No need.

781
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,860
I heard what you and Father said.

782
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,060
Just do

783
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,060
whatever you set your mind to.

784
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,280
No need to ask me at all.

785
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:00,720
I'm sorry.

786
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,720
From now on,

787
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,320
I'm afraid you'll be put through

788
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,630
some lean days with me.

789
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,790
What kind of talk is that?

790
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,850
We're husband and wife.

791
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,810
Of course we'll weather through
all difficulties together.

792
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,260
Don't worry.

793
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,260
I'm here to take care of the family,

794
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:19,790
alright?

795
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,530
We'll get through this.

796
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,830
Father.

797
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,690
Father.

798
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,300
Here is

799
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,800
everything I own.

800
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:50,680

00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,560
[Buyer: He Chengxi]
[Deposit]

802
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,820
See if they're enough.

803
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,890
You worked your entire life for these.

804
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,550
You need them for your old age.

805
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:57,970
I can't take these.

806
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,490
The He family's reputation

807
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,000
matters more than me, an old man.

808
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,890
Xian,

809
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,560
sit down.

810
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,720
Father, let me do it.

811
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,990
It's fine to lose the business

812
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,960
and close the money changer.

813
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,850
But we must keep...

814
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,590
a clear conscience.

815
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,190
I'm already

816
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,760
a man with one foot in the grave.

817
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,540
What's the use of keeping all this money?

818
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,460
It will eventually go to my descendants.

819
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:04,070
As long as they learn to be honest people

820
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,720
of integrity,

821
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,720
what does it matter

822
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,110
if they have money or not?

823
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,500
Spending all this
on maintaining a clear conscience

824
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,180
is more worthwhile than on anything else.

825
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,700
Father.

826
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,410
Mr. Lyu,

827
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,930
why do you only pay out 20% of my deposit?

828
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,860
Why can't I withdraw more than 15%?

829
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,800
Yeah!

830
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,650
Mr. Lyu,

831
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,610

832

833
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,150
I can't go on with my life this way!

834
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:43,890
Mr. Lyu!

835
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,370
-This won't do!
-Give us our money back!

836
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,470
When will you pay out my deposit?

837
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,410
Pay up!

838
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,060
Pay up!

839
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,060

840
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,330

842
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,159
Mr. He,

00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,239
can we really make withdrawals
from Huilong?

844
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,310
Yes, you can.

845
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,429
What's the percentage?

846
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,540
One hundred,
when you show you deposit slip.

847
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,290
Do you have your deposit slip now?

848
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,139
Yes, I do.

849
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:38,960
Careful.

850
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,290

Correct.

856

Correct amount.

857
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,270
I'll close your account then.

00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,140
It is true.

938
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,720
When have I ever lied to you?

939
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,140
Eat the porridge now.

940
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,370
Sir, you're back.

941
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:01,930
Yes.

942
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,240
Where is Yinwan?

943
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,480
She was busy at the orphanage all day.

944
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,350
Now,

945
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,480
she's asleep on the sofa.

946
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,400
Do we have any flour left?

947
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,180
Flour?

948
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,830
There should be a little bit left.

949
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,270
Okay.

950
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,960
As long as it's enough to make a pie.

951
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,160
It won't be a problem.

952
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:20,910
Huilong's crisis

953
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,680
has been solved.

954
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,500
We'd better leave soon.

955
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,410
Where to?

956
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,000
Isn't there only one choice?

957
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,850
Just listen.

958
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,300
The sound of artillery
is coming from the Island non-stop.

959
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,770
I think the British

960
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,070
can only hold out for a day or two.

961
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,100
Haven't you already applied

962
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,950
for a license to operate
financial services in Macau?

963
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,610
Once travel between Hong Kong

964
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,140
and Macau resumes as the fire ceases,

965
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,890
we should set off for Macau.

966
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,730
Well,

967
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,410
we'll see about that.

968
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,350
Fine.

969
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,180
Mull it over then.

970
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:09,890
One,

971
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,430
two,

972
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,020
three,

973
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,620
four,

974
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,710
five...

975
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:15,060
Five big apples.

976
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,890
Why five?

977
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,350
Because Grandpa, Dad,

978
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,100
Mom,

979
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,910
you, and I should each have one apple.

980
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:24,960
That's right.

981
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,450
But

982
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,910
the apples in this drawing can't be eaten.

983
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,250
Let me ask you.

984
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,310
Why do we eat apples on Christmas Eve?

985
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:35,310
That's the way

986
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,340
we pray for safety.

987
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,290
Then listen.

988
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,680
As long as these are apples,

989
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,290
be they in a painting

990
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,310
or actually edible,

991
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,250
they'll make our wish
for safety come true.

992
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,710
Really?

993
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,540
Is it sweet?

994
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,730
Yes.

995
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:18,730
What's wrong?

996
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:20,890
Is something bothering you?

997
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,950
Are there depositors
who haven't made withdrawals?

998
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,680
All the depositors

999
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,740
have received their money,

1000
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,980
except our biggest client,

1001
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,670
who deposited a large sum

1002
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,000
and requested anonymity.

1003
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,830
Since that was a special case,

1004
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,890
I made a note about him on the last page

1005
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,660
for differentiation
from the other depositors.

1006
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,460
Though the last page was burned,

1007
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,750
I vividly remember his face and the amount

1008
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,930
of his deposit.

1009
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,370
How much?

1010
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,830
A bit

1011
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:00,910
more than 30,000.

1012
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,250
That is to say,

1013
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,810
if this client withdraws his deposit,

1014
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,330
we'll be left penniless.

1015
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:16,580
It's been over 10 days.

1016
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,680
I don't know why he hasn't

1017
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,520
shown up yet.

1018
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,390
I also have no idea

1019
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,810
whether he'll come
to get this money or not.

1020
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:24,710
But Huilong

1021
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,860
won't stop providing

1022
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,580
withdrawal service until tomorrow.

1023
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,660
Merry Christmas Eve.

1024
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,160
Merry Christmas Eve,

1025
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,850
Renyu.

1026
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,230
Freshly baked apple pie.

1027
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:03,950
Eat up.

1028
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,440
This is for you.

1029
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,090
Grabbing with your hands again?

1030
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,210
This reminds me of the past.

1031
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,640
When you were only 7 years old,

1032
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,720
you devoured a large apple pie

1033
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,700
all at once.

1034
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,480
The priest and the housemother
were shocked.

1035
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,890
I was starving.

1036
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,230
I hadn't eaten all day.

1037
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,740
On every Christmas Eve

1038
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,390
after that day, the housemother

1039
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,680
would make an apple pie
specifically for you,

1040
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,010
regardless of what was served for dinner.

1041
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,730
Then we grew up and left the orphanage.

1042
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:51,040
You became the one
making me an apple pie every year.

1043
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,880
On each and every future Christmas Eve,

1044
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,710
I will always

1045
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,770
make you an apple pie right on time.
