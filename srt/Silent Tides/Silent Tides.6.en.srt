helping them.

6
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:50,420
It must be either from Chongqing
or Yan'an.

7
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,770
Either side would be difficult

8
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,840
to deal with.

9
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,729
Fortunately,

10
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,289
the Japanese Imperial Army

11
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:00,260
has surrounded Macau.

These people

13

won't be able to escape.

will expand the search area

15
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,150

In addition,

17
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,560
we've also deployed professional personnel

18
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,280

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,180
have cut all the phone lines.

23
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,060
This is

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,970

who have fled to Macau

25

Isn't it?

75
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,830
I'll answer your question.

76
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,800
Is there anyone who didn't hear clearly?

77
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,840
Since we announced the acceptance
of refugees,

78
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,420
the Japanese military, under the pretext
of evacuating Hong Kong refugees,

79
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,690
has continuously sent ships
to transport people to Macau,

80
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,930
yet not a single person has been allowed
to board a ship to leave.

81
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,120
Simultaneously, they have imposed controls

82
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,980
on the Gongbei Port,
permitting entry but not exit.

83
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,500
In just half a month,

84
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,090
Macau's population
has exceeded 450 thousand,

85
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,250
three times what it was before the war.

86
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,750
What about the food situation?

87
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:01,270
Macau's original rice reserves
were less than 5 thousand bags,

88
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,310
which are now almost depleted.

89
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,510
Coupled with the Japanese blockade
of the Gongbei Port,

90
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,250
not a single grain of food from Zhongshan
can be transported into Macau.

91
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,510
As of yesterday,

92
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,250
the price of rice in Macau

93
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,360
has risen from 40 cents to one dollar,

94
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,040
an increase of 150 percent.

111
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,190

114
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,800
Why aren't you wearing a coat?

115
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,830
Let me get it for you.

116
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,220
No need. Go check if

117
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,480

118
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,720
Porridge?

119
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,360
Where did you get rice?

120
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
It won't be cold in Macau for much longer,

121
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,960
so I traded clothes for rice.

122
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,130
I'm not cold anyway.

123
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:17,870

it's my suit.

No one will go hungry.

143
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,800
Your Excellency the Governor,

144
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,130
this is a huge misunderstanding.

145
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,790
According to our naval report,

146
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,330
it was those damn pirates

147
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,130
who robbed the Macau grain ship—

148
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,240
not

149
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,270
the Japanese Navy.

150
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,330
Nonsense!

151
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,480
When the grain ship was robbed,

152
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,190
its radio transmission

153
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,560
never mentioned any pirates—

154
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,430
it only reported being intercepted
by the Japanese Navy.

155
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,240
When our rescue team arrived afterward,

156
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,860
they only saw

157
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,980
Japanese warships
filling the incident waters!

158
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,570
With such irrefutable evidence,

159
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,659
are you still trying
to quibble your way out of it?

160
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,740
Here's the thing.

161
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,120
The Japanese Navy

162
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,770
spotted pirates

163
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,130
and was in the process of pursuing them.

164
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,620
It's hardly surprising that

165
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,330
the grain ship's crew saw our warships.

166
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,500
As for what happened after,

167
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,800
the pirates made off with your grain cargo
and fled.

168
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,000
We failed to catch up,

169
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,800
which is why

170
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,570
only our warships were left in the area.

171
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,420
That's complete nonsense!

172
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,100
Nothing you've said is true!

173
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
If you don't believe me,

174
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,160

00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,789
What are you doing?

179
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,700
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,700
I want to make some porridge,

181
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,160
but I don't really know
how to use this stove.

182
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,360
Miss Qiao, you...

183
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,890
Your hands are for playing the violin.

184
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,600
How can you do such rough work?

185
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,270
What if you burn yourself?

186
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,360
Food outside is too expensive.

187
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,260
I thought I could cook for myself

188
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,600
to save some money.

189
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,360
Why put yourself through this?

190
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,100
If you need anything,

191
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:09,630
I can...

192
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,270
I don't need anything.

193
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,770
Thank you, Dr. Lok Pak.

194
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,720
I can't take your money.

195
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,360
And those other things,

196
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,620
please take them back.

197
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,630
Don't bring them again next time,

198
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,390
or I won't open the door for you.

199
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:23,320
Alright.

200
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,860
Okay.

201
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,340
Let me help you.

202
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:33,820
Thank you.

203
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,320
Also,

204
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,540
I should remind you of something else.

205
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,550
From now on,

206
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,110
Macau should temporarily
suspend all maritime trade.

207
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,580
For the Imperial Navy,

208
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,450
to leave pirate gangs with nowhere
to hide,

209
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,150
will seize all suspicious vessels

210
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,890
until the pirates are
completely eradicated.

211
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,260
What you're doing
will completely strangle Macau!

212
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,800
Don't put it that way.

213
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,770
What do you mean by “strangling Macau”?

214
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,290
Eliminating pirates

215
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,640
is also a great deed for Macau
that will benefit generations to come.

216
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,050
Sir,

217
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,310
why not take a longer-term view?

218
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,860
Fine,

219
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,100
I have another question.

220
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,650
You say pirates are active
in the Lingding Channel,

221
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,600
but surely there can't be any
in Zhongshan.

222
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,480
Zhongshan?

223
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,340
Haven't you heard anything about that?

224
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,740
No, I haven't.

225
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,370
No, I really haven't heard of any there.

226
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:39,940
Then,

227
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,580
since there are no pirates in Zhongshan,

228
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,840
why have you closed the Gongbei Port

229
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,410
and prohibited grain from Zhongshan
from entering Macau?

230
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,700
I can explain this matter

231
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,310
to you, sir.

232
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,370
The suspension of grain trade
in Zhongshan County is

233
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,720
purely a measure taken
by the Wang Jingwei government in Nanjing

234
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,780
to crack down on smuggling,

235
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,540
and
it has absolutely no connection with us.

236
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,170
Macau now

237
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,550
has nearly 400 thousand residents,

238
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,440
or even more than that!

239
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,410
By sealing Macau off completely like this,

240
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,750
how many people
are you going to drive to their deaths?

241
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,650
How can you

242
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,440
disregard so many lives

243
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,170
and just watch them die like this?

244
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,900
Your Excellency the Governor,

245
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,270
the Empire of Japan deeply sympathizes

246
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,500
with the difficulties
Macau is currently facing.

247
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,270
Likewise,

248
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,860
the Empire has always hoped

249
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,940
to maintain friendly neighborly relations
with Macau.

250
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,470
Right before your arrival,

251
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,250
we had just drafted

252
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,360
a cooperation plan

253
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,290
that was originally to be submitted
to the Government House.

254
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,890
Since you've come in person,

255
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,660
you might as well take a look at it now.

256
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,140
It's my fault for being useless.

257
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,440
I only found out

258
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,200
the management staff of HSBC

259
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,130
are being detained
in a prisoner-of-war camp,

260
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,790
but I have no idea
about other specific details.

261
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,510
However,

262
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,190
you don't need to worry too much.

263
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,460
After all, Mr. Qiao is

264
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,010
an accountant,

265
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,200
and the Japanese

266
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,660
should not give him too much trouble.

267
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,390
Okay.

268
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,900
In the current situation,

269
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,290
getting news about them is
extremely difficult.

270
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,790
Thank you for your efforts.

271
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,590
It's nothing.

272
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,380
Also,

273
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,340
as I mentioned last time,

274
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,910
my Bachongtian Club

275
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,170
really needs a violinist.

276
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,630
If you would honor us with your talent,

277
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,760
the compensation would be excellent.

278
00:12:59,170 --> 00:12:59,790
I know

279
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,370
you don't want to accept my help.

280
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,100
I understand and respect that.

281
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,870
But

282
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,870
earning a living with your violin

283
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,120
would still be supporting yourself,
wouldn't it?

284
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,250
Thank you for your invitation.

285
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,910
I understand your kindness.

286
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,150
I will

287
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,680
seriously consider your suggestion.

288
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,480
Okay.

289
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,030
[Banco Nacional Ultramarino]

290
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,740
Effective immediately,

291
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,520
all rice and grain merchants in Macau

292
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,530
are prohibited from hoarding
for speculation.

293
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,000
Seventy percent
of each merchant's grain stock

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,790
must be surrendered
to the General Chamber of Commerce

295
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,480
to establish soup kitchens

296
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,010
for unified famine relief.

297
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,290
The specific inventory inspection
and collection work

298
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,590
will be carried out by Ma Wanqi,

299
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,200
member of the Board of Directors
of the General Chamber of Commerce,

300
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,000
in conjunction with
the General Economic Bureau.

301
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,910
By what authority does the government
confiscate our goods?

302
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,870
Even for relief efforts,

303
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,870
demanding 70% is far too excessive!

304
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,110
Everyone!

305
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,940
Everyone!

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,370
In these trying times,

307
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,410
the government

308
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,370
and the General Chamber of Commerce

309
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,200
have no other option.

310
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,320
Lives are on the line.

311
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,740
To ensure

312
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,980
all people of Macau can survive,

313
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,010
we must ask everyone

314
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,180
to pull together through this crisis.

315
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

316
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,610
the Hengfengyu is also
in the grain business.

317
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,040
Let me make my stance clear.

318
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,460
First,

319
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,080
every last grain of Hengfengyu's inventory

320
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,250
will be donated in full
to disaster relief,

321
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,140
with none retained.

322
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,740
Second,

323
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,410
all grain turned over
by the rice merchants here

324
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,420
will be treated as a loan to Hengfengyu.

325
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,060
I, Ma Wanqi, will personally

326
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,820
take responsibility for issuing
promissory notes and formal contracts.

327
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,500
Once this famine is over,

328
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,400
Hengfengyu will be obligated

329
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,910
to repay all the grain in full.

330
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,950
Alright, I understand.

331
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,340
Baixin, we really can't find him.

332
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,070
I've checked not only decent hotels

333
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,100
[Luo Baixin, Fiancée of Ma Wanqi]

334
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,000
but also ordinary inns

335
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,870
everywhere,

336
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,970
yet I still can't get any information
about Mr. He.

337
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,370
Mr. Lin mentioned

338
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,410
Mr. He doesn't own a house in Macau.

339
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,100
If he's not staying at hotels or inns,

340
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,100
where could he be?

341
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,720
Perhaps Mr. He
and his family have rented a place.

342
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,320
Maybe I should inquire about
well-conditioned properties

343
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
that have been recently rented out.

344
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,910
Hundreds of thousands of people
have suddenly flooded into Macau.

345
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,570
There must be countless people
renting places.

346
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,870
It's like finding a needle in a haystack.

347
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,530
I don't think it's realistic.

348
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,120
Qi.

349
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,450
I know Mr. He has been good to you.

350
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,150
No matter what,

351
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,420
we need to find him.

352
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,910
I'll try to find more ways
to help with this.

353
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,410
Okay.

354
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,000
Thank you for your help.

355
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,580
Baixin.

356
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,750
Here.

357
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,000
It's cold.

358
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,000
Take care to stay warm.

359
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,620
Don't worry too much.

360
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,500
Notices have been posted on the streets.

361
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,940
The General Chamber of Commerce says
it will start distributing porridge.

362
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,340
Women, the elderly, and children
among the refugees

363
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,470
can each receive one free bowl per day.

364
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,770
And I'll see

365
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,660
if I can find some laundry work.

366
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,200
We'll get through this somehow.

367
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,400
Supporting the family

368
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,660
is supposed to be my responsibility
as a man.

369
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,190
But now it's come to this...

370
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:19,940
It's okay.

371
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,790
He Xian!

372
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,530
He Xian!

373
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,369

Kicking them out for no reason

421
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,180
isn't appropriate.

What about the 60% stake?

the Japanese joining the board

521
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,380

You don't think
I look like someone from there, right?

President Saito
will preside over today's interviews.

[Empresa Comercial Lyun Coeng]

559
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,590
May I ask, which of you is

560
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,590
Mr. He Xian?

561
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,510
I am.

562
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,740
Please come with me.

563
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,700
[Empresa Comercial Lyun Coeng]

564
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,920
Excuse me.

565
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,030
This is

566
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,290
Mr. Saito, the company's new president.

567
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,430
This is Mr. He Xian.

568
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,200
Hello,

569
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,090
Mr. He.

570
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:06,920
Hello.

571
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,540
Please have a seat.

572
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,140
Please sit.

573
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,680
I just reviewed your resume
and preliminary test answers.

574
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:16,750
Mr. He,

575
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,140
your business experience is so extensive,

576
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,920
and you have such detailed understanding
and broad vision

577
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,480
regarding Macau's trade development.

578
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,000
It's fair to say

579
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,550
you are precisely the talent
Lyun Coeng urgently needs.

580
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,390
I'm flattered.

581
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,550
May I ask a question first?

582
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,660
What is it?

583
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,830
It seems Lyun Coeng
has undergone major changes today.

584
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,090
May I inquire about the situation first?

585
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,330
Yes, there have been some changes.

586
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,810
Just a moment ago,

587
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,880
with the approval of the Macau government,

588
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,310
Lyun Coeng's board of directors
was restructured,

589
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:56,350
and we, the Japanese side,
have taken over completely.

590
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,380
But rest assured.

591
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,070
All the recruitment conditions
previously promised by the company,

592
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,010
including the position and benefits,

593
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,750
will remain unchanged.

594
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,000
Any other questions?

595
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,220
No.

596
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,270
Then let's begin the interview.

597
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,180
Tungsten ore,

598
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,830
tin ore,

599
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,970
hog bristles, and tung oil?

600
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,220
I remember Lyun Coeng

601
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,250
has always been engaged
in trade of daily necessities

602
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,050
between Macau and the mainland.

603
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,240
Why the sudden interest

604
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,370
in procuring these special supplies?

605
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,180
This is
our company's new development objective.

606
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,880
Mr. He,

607
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,330
you had done business
in Guangdong and Hong Kong

608
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,620
for so many years.

609
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,830
With the business connections
you've built,

610
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,000
finding sources for tungsten ore

611
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,570
and tung oil

612
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,500
would surely be effortless for you.

613
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,700
Let me put it this way.

614
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,880
You only need to accomplish one thing—

615
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,500
find the supply sources the company needs

616
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,070
and handle their long-term procurement
for the company.

617
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,130
No matter how much,

618
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,880
Lyun Coeng will buy it all.

619
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,350
The price is not an issue.

620
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,380
Sorry.

621
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,540
I know nothing
about the sources you mentioned,

622
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,570
and I can't procure those supplies.

623
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,180
Mr. He,

624
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,000
are you feeling

625
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,400
being a business secretary is beneath you?

626
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,050
How about this?

627
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,580
As long as you can
find these supply sources for the company,

628
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:33,330
I'll promote you to procurement manager
immediately,

629
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,590
with full authority
over specialty procurement in China.

630
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,160
Double the salary,

631
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,010
plus additional year-end bonuses.

632
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,160
Is that acceptable?

633
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,590
I'm sorry.

634
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,220
I said I can't do it, and I truly can't.

635
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,270
I withdraw

636
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:50,770
from this interview.

Hongshen.

640
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,530
This job at Lyun Coeng
isn't suitable for me.

641
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,260
I'm leaving.

642
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,080
Xian, what on earth happened?

643
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,750
Nothing.

644
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,440
When it comes to job hunting,

645
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,220
everyone has their own aspirations.

646
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,620
You make your own choice.

We're making firecrackers.

The kids have been learning
for a whole day.

651
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,660
It won't be cold in Macau for much longer,

652
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,290
so I traded clothes for rice.

653
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,460
I'm not cold anyway.

654
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,160
It's okay.

to unload cargo at the dock!

Alright, alright!

00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,500
Okay!

673
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:31,500
next,

674
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,250
anyone else?

675
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,200
Who else can?

Qiwen,

680
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,800
I should get going.

681
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,090
Aren't you...

682
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,850
going to work?

683
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,510
Why aren't you wearing a suit?

684
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,900
According to Lyun Coeng's rules,

685
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,850
the first month is considered probation,

686
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,780
starting with street deliveries.

687
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,750
What should I do?

688
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,040
You're going to have a tough time.

689
00:29:59,230 --> 00:29:59,900
It's okay.

690
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,980
During probation,
the company provides meals

691
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,910
and half a catty of grain every day.

692
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,760
Given the current situation in Macau,

693
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,650
getting grain

694
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,070
is better than anything.

00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,160

We only need 10 people!

698
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,740
Raise your hands if you sign up!

699
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:37,010
One, two, three, four, five, six.

700
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,790
Seven, eight, nine.

00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,510

-Thank you.

00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,880
Next time, don't raise prices again.

709
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,980
You can't just hike prices

710
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,010
every time I buy.

711
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,930
Rice prices are rising even faster.

712
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,700
The sea's been blockaded by the Japanese.

713
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,030
How do you think
the liquor was transported here?

714
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:22,290
We risked our lives to transport it here.

715
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,840
If I don't raise prices,
I'll end up like them.

716
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:38,980
Here, this is yours.

718
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,230
Be careful, it's hot.

719
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,180
No more congee today.

720
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,040
Come tomorrow.

721
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,700
No more, no more.

722
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,920
Come tomorrow.

723
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,090
Macau's strength

724
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,320
is truly too weak.

725
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:56,220
Even if the entire business sector
empties its coffers,

726
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,950
it's still a drop in the bucket.

727
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,960
Relying solely on Macau's business sector,

728
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,090
the strength is indeed insufficient.

729
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:07,010
Maybe we can
consider Hong Kong's business sector.

730
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,980
Hong Kong?

731
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,310
That's right.

732
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,460
The foundation and connections

733
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,240
of Hong Kong's business sector

734
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,970
are far stronger than Macau's.

735
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,810
Now that many
from Hong Kong's business sector

736
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,900
have fled to Macau.

737
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,770
Macau is their home too.

738
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,770
They also

739
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,680
must face Macau's difficulties.

740
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,090
Why not mobilize them as well

741
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,510
to join forces
with Macau's business sector

742
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,180
and work together

743
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,400

Why is he carrying goods here?

852
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,170
Give a hand!

857
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,190
So are you going to leave or stay

858
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,500
and continue to work?

859
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,820
If you alone

860
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,140

861
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,460

862
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,820

00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,160
Officer Yang,

865
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,800
was this man really a bank owner before?

866
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,820
Yes.

867
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,340
Geez.

868
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,220
Now in Macau, just for a bite of food,

869
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,920
people have been pushed to such extremes.

870
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,070
Sanhe, I'm back.

871
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:40,920
Zhong,

872
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,050
why did you keep Mr. Ma waiting so long?

873
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,960
Zixia

874
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,260
got into a clash with someone.

875
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,920
He insisted a laborer unload

876
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,500
an entire boat of grain alone.

877
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,210
During this grain transport,

878
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,670
we lost quite a few men.

879
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,030
So Zixia

880
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,880
vented all his anger on him.

881
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,070
It'll be done soon.

882
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,760
In that case,

883
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,360
Master Sanhe, I won't delay further.

884
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,500
If there are other ways
to transport grain here,

885
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,480
you must tell me.

886
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,080

00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,920
there's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

889
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,310
Please go ahead.

890
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,940
Right now in all of Macau,

hundreds of thousands of starving people.

892
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,360
In other words,

there are hundreds of thousands of people
waiting for food.

894
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,810
What have you relied on
to hold out till today?

895
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah.

896
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:28,860
To be honest,

897
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,150
I'm not insisting on being this stubborn.

898
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,940
But a friend of mine

899
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,000
taught me through his actions

900
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:40,210
that the most important thing in life
is to keep one's word

901
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,420
and act with conscience.

902
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,480
I don't know

903
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,440
how much longer I can help

904
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,400
these hundreds of thousands of people
waiting for food.

905
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,340
But I know

906
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,260
I must help them for as long as I can.

907
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,530
Who is this friend of yours?

908
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,970
Funny thing is,

909
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,480
this friend and I share
a kind of spiritual connection.

910
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,810
We've never met before.

911
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,010
Who's there?

912
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,340
It's me, Yang Chang.

913
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,420
Here. Come.

914
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,590
I brought this for you.

915
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,090
Here.

916
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,050
Here.

917
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,460
Why are there just you guys?

918
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,610
Where are Mrs. Jones and James?

919
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,690
I'm asking you.

920
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:43,930
Where are they?

921
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,610
If that's the case,

922
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,690

923
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,380
benefited from your friend's kindness.

924
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,460
Otherwise, the passengers back then
couldn't have disembarked.

925
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,230
If you find this friend in the future,

926
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,570
you must introduce him to me.

927
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:02,340
No problem.

928
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,210
I'll definitely introduce him to you
in the future.

929
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,210
Mr. Ma, please.

930
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,360
Is that okay?

931
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,320
Yes.

932
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,590
Five portions of pay in total—

933
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,380
two and a half catties of rice.

934
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:28,820
Here.

935
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,060
Master Huang,

936
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,690
I've finished moving all the cargo.

937
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,070
You have to keep your word.

938
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:38,860
Don't worry.

939
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,170
I'll keep my word.

940
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:42,900
I will give it to you.

941
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,860
Crawl between my legs,

942
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,640
and it's yours.

943
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,910
Everyone's pressed for time.

944
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,970
What do you say?

945
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,380
Crawl!

946
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,060
Master Huang!

947
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,630
Judging from his age,

948
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,760
he must have a family to support.

949
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,670
He worked so hard

950
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,500
and did all the labor

951
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,800
so that his family
can have something to eat.

952
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,460
I don't know
what happened between you two,

953
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,550
but there's no need
to give him such a hard time.

954
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,280
Zixia,

955
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,280
didn't you hear what Mr. Ma said?

956
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:49,780
Thank you.

957
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,550
Master Sanhe, I'm leaving!

958
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,650
Okay, take care.

959
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,430
