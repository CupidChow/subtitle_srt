[Episode 14]

3
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:42,870
Here is Chairman Ma Wanqi
of Hengfengyu Bank

4
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,509
and

5
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,870
Manager He Xian,
representative of Tai Fung Bank,

6
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,789
which provides financial backing

7
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:49,870
for Hengfengyu.

8
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,420
Chairman Ma.

9
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,370
Mr. Rodrigues,

10
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,259
we clearly negotiated this deal
with you first.

11
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,780
Don't you think it was inappropriate
for you to suddenly arrange

12
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,110
a three-party meeting?

13
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,730
Well...

14
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,350
You're certainly
a long-standing client of mine,

15
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,030
but we haven't signed any contract,

16
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,240
nor have you made any payment.

17
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,870
Besides,

18
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,669
the price we discussed earlier

19
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,600
was agreed upon
before the Hong Kong dollar plunged.

20
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,400
I asked for payment in U.S. dollars,

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,370
but you refused.

22
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,130
Business in Macau has always been settled
in Hong Kong dollars.

23
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,240
Now you suddenly demand U.S. dollars—

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,240
where am I supposed to get that much?

25
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,740
But the Hong Kong dollar has now fallen
too sharply.

26
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,690
Mr. Ma,

27
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,910
you need to understand my position.

28
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,250
How about this:

29
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,520
for the sake of
our many years of friendship,

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,430
if you agree to pay 10% more

31
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,030
and pay in full immediately,

32
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,960
I'll ask Mr. Saito

33
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,690
and Mr. Ogata to leave right now.

34
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,020
That should be fair enough, no?

35
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,020
Mr. Rodrigues...

36
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,890
I'm sorry.

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,710
The amount for this shipment is
just too large,

38
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,870
and now you want to raise the price.

39
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,300
We simply can't afford it.

40
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,160
Moreover,

41
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,190
you know very well
we're currently raising funds

42
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,460
for this payment.

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,660
If you want U.S. dollars instead,

44
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,880
you'll have to give us some time.

45
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,780
So that means you won't pay more,

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,690
and you won't pay immediately?

47
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,930
Mr. Saito, Mr. Ogata,

48
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,810
what about you?

49
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,530
Can you pay in U.S. dollars?

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,560
Before we finalize the payment method,

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,340
we have a small request

52
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:29,870
and wonder if you could accommodate it.

53
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,270
Please go ahead.

54
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,750
It's what I mentioned to you on the phone—

55
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,579
the purchase voucher
for this shipment of rubber.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,200
Let me clarify first—

57
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,680
I personally have absolute trust

58
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,340
in your business reputation.

59
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,230
But the amount involved
in this transaction

60
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,160
is extraordinarily large.

61
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,430
Our bank has its own rules too.

62
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,900
I've been doing business in Macau
for so many years,

63
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,460
and this is the first time I've been asked
to present the purchase contract

64
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,990
for on-site verification.

65
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,860
This is the purchase contract

66
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,460
I signed with Lee Kong Chian.

67
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,090
Here.

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,020
Verify it.

69
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,220
Please give us a moment.

70
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,310
Actually, there's one more guest
with us today.

71
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,930
Mr. Qiao.

72
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,720
Please have a seat.

73
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,060
Allow me to introduce him.

74
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,920
This is

75
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,920
Mr. Qiao Renyu, Chief Accountant

76
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,130
of HSBC Hong Kong,

77
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,480
Mr. Qiao.

78
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,720
Did you bring everything?

79
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,480
The thing is,

80
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,080
Lee Kong Chian

81
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,780
has an account at HSBC.

82
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,400
So the bank has
his signature and seal on file.

83
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,490
Mr. Qiao

84
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,220
has always handled
his financial transactions.

85
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,450
So this time

86
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,420
I specifically asked him to come
and take a look.

87
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,360
Mr. Ogata, you're certainly very cautious.

88
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,990
I'm being cautious

89
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,130
to ensure better cooperation.

90
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,380
This is the contract, Mr. Qiao.

91
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,070
Thank you.

92
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,830
[Lee Kong Chian]

93
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,520

94
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,380
[Lee Kong Chian]

95
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,990
[Lee Kong Chian]

96
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,490
Look.

97
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,360
Mr. Lee Kong Chian

98
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,680
donated a large sum of money to us

99
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,540
and even took a photo with us.

100
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,420
[Lee Kong Chian]

101
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,450
You're not allowed to attend anymore.

102
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,000
You don't have the guts to go yourself,

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,010
but you won't let me go.

104
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,490
You...

105
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:07,830
[Lee Kong Chian]

106
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,000
What are you doing?

107
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,770
[Lee Kong Chian]

108
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,060
What's so confidential

109
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,520
that we must discuss it
at Mr. He's residence

110
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,150
and can't tell anyone else?

111
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,890
The rubber tycoon Lee Kong Chian
has a rule:

112
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,740
only for deals
worth over 10 million dollars

113
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,820
will he personally sign the contract.

114
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,590
Is that true?

115
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,230
Yes.

116
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,770
Most people can't even get
a meeting with him,

117
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,220
let alone get him to sign contracts
for small deals.

118
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,310
So that means

119
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,140
you've never signed a contract with him

120
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,600
and never seen his signature either?

121
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,630
Not just me.

122
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,180
In all of Macau, you can count on one hand

123
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,490
the number of people
who've seen his signature.

124
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,930
[Lee Kong Chian]

125
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,770
Why is a corner of this signature missing?

126
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,810
Yinwan said that

127
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,670
during an argument, her brother Qiao Renyu

128
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,130
accidentally damaged it.

129
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,720
However,

130
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,420
it's just missing a small part at the end.

131
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,890
It doesn't affect recognition.

132
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,510
Fine.

133
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,570
So be it if it's damaged.

134
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,020
[Lee Kong Chian]

135
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,620
Just copy it exactly as it is.

136
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,730
Mr. Qiao.

137
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,400
The signature is real.

138
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,030
Everyone, we've been negotiating for days.

139
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,030
Since neither of you

140
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,340
is willing to settle in U.S. dollars,

141
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,320
I'll reluctantly make a concession.

142
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,820
Tomorrow at 6 PM.

143
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,600
Whichever party

144
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,630
can pay the full amount in one go,

145
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,020
I'll accept Hong Kong dollars
and sign the contract with them.

146
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,950
Any objections?

147
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,440
Payment tomorrow?

148
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,060
Mr. Rodrigues,

149
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,220
you know that right now we

150
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,080
-really can't…
-Alright, Mr. Ma.

151
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,200
After all,

152
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,640
the Hong Kong dollar
has been extremely volatile

153
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,970
in the market recently.

154
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,910
Who knows if there might be

155
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,770
another sharp drop in the future?

156
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,020
For me to accept Hong Kong dollars at all

157
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,580
is already the biggest concession
I can make.

158
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,500
I can't be the only one
taking all the risks, can I?

159
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,670
Mr. Rodrigues,

160
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,840
if Hengfengyu is
really having difficulties,

161
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,110
then perhaps there's no need to
wait until tomorrow.

162
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,970
We can sign the contract now.

163
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:54,950
Wait!

164
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,390
Tomorrow it is.

165
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,230
Hengfengyu agrees to the conditions.

166
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,710
Mr. Ogata, come on!

167
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,900
Let's have a drink together!

168
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:12,540
Come on, come on!

169
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,600
Let's have a drink!

170
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,880
Congratulations, Agency Chief Sawa.

171
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,670
Your Sawa Agency

172
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,290
really can dig up any kind of information.

173
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,580
Cheers!

174
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,550
Cheers.

175
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,630
-Cheers.
-Come on.

176
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,320
Come on, cheers.

177
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,190
Mr. Qiao?

178
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,350
Come on, cheers.

179
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,170
Cheers.

180
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,940
To be honest, I've been wondering

181
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,450
what kind of client

182
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,240
could possibly take on

183
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,200
such a large rubber inventory.

184
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,860
I even planned to sell it off in batches.

185
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:52,500
I didn't expect that...

186
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,850
Would you like some apple pie?

187
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,060
You could actually secure Specie Bank

188
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,740
as your financial guarantor, Mr. Saito.

189
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,940
I just wonder

190
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,180
how things will turn out tomorrow.

191
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,760
This shipment of rubber

192
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,990
will surely be ours!

193
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,170
Mr. Qiao, how have things been for you

194
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,230
in Hong Kong?

195
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,880
Quite well, actually.

196
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,320
It's just that sometimes...

197
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,170
I worry about my family.

198
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,190
Hardship is inevitable
for people fleeing war.

199
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,490
But fortunately,

200
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,910
those hardships are only temporary.

201
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,500
With help from friends,

202
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,920
their lives get better and better.

203
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,030
That's good.

204
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,060
However,

205
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,330
they miss

206
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,930
their family day and night,

207
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,520
holding them dear in their hearts,

208
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,830
and praying every day

209
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,300
for their safety.

210
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,620
As long as they stay strong
and keep waiting,

211
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,950
even with mountains and seas between them,

212
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,950
I believe

213
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,010
the day of their reunion will come.

214
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,440
Good.

215
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,670
To that day,

216
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,040
cheers.

217
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,320
Cheers.

218
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,540
Come on.

219
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,620
Let me toast to you.

220
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,620
You still

221
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,660
need to pay me quickly

222
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,750
for this shipment.

223
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:46,390
Mr. Rodrigues...

224
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,840
-Of course, of course.
-Mr. Qiao.

225
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,240
Don't worry.

226
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,570
You've had your drinks.

227
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,670
-You should go back and rest now.
-We'll pay you on time.

228
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,390
Got it.

229
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,350
I'm sorry, Mr. He.

230
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:02,860
It's fine, it's fine.

231
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,890
Mr. Qiao!

232
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
I'll be going now.

233
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,240
Mr. Qiao!

234
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,670
Alright.

235
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,600
Please!

236
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,820
Let's go!

237
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,250
Let's go.

238
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,360
Excuse me,

239
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,540
my stomach doesn't feel so good.

240
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,050
I need to use the restroom.

241
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,330
Put this in the car for Mr. Qiao.

242
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,410
Go ahead.

243
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,040
I'm really sorry, sir.

244
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,770
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,360
This isn't your fault.

246
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,960
You might need to clean this up
in the restroom.

247
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:48,890
I'm so terribly sorry.

248
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,510
Thank you.

249
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,360
Mr. Huang.

250
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,510
Mr. Qiao, please.

251
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,070
Captain Huang,

252
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,890
is this really necessary?

253
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,020
Stop.

254
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,340
What?

255
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,870
I can't even use the restroom?

256
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,690
No entry means no entry.

257
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,030
It's not convenient right now.

258
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,630
I'm really sorry.

259
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,920
Are you even being reasonable?

260
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,340
My word is law here.

261
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,590
Mr. Huang.

262
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,080
Captain Huang.

263
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,410
Xian,

264
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,240
what's wrong?

265
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,320
My clothes are dirty,

266
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,920
and I need to go in to clean up.

267
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,220
What's wrong with your men?

268
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,940
Why won't they let me use the restroom?

269
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,740
Mr. Qiao is using the restroom right now.

270
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,050
He's an honored guest
of the Imperial Army.

271
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,810
Colonel Sawa has given explicit orders

272
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,940
that no one is allowed to approach him.

273
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,450
It's such a big restroom.

274
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,710
My using it for a moment won't affect him.

275
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:15,830
Xian,

276
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,600
I'm just doing my job.

277
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,860
Please don't make this difficult for me.

278
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,720
Fine, fine.

279
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,810
Your guest must be royalty—

280
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,590
we commoners must keep our distance.

281
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,720
I'll just wait here then, is that okay?

282
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,420
I'm sorry, Mr. He.

283
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,900
Sorry to keep you waiting.

284
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,650
Captain Huang,

285
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,140
can I go in now?

286
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:44,940
Hold on.

287
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,550
Mr. Qiao, we can go now.

288
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,590
Xian, please go ahead.

289
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,580
What's wrong, Mr. Huang?

290
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,700
I can't shake the feeling

291
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,630
that something's not quite right.

292
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Keep an eye on him.

293
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,370
I'll go up and check again.

294
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,170
The Japanese

295
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,910
have forced

296
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,980
the issuance of

297
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,870
a new batch of 120 million HKD.

298
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,400
Once all of this new batch of money
has been spent,

299
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,440
the Japanese will

300
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,310
declare

301
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,790
the Hong Kong dollar invalid.

302
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,350
Then, the Hong Kong dollar will become

303
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,390
worthless paper.

304
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,860
Captain Huang,

305
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,380
why are you back again?

306
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,010
Captain Huang,

307
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,400
what exactly are you looking for?

308
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,930
What treasure did you lose?

309
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Nothing.

310
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,000
Yu.

311
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,010
Miss Qiao,

312
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,400
I know you're very sad.

313
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,260
You once said

314
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,470
your brother was the only family
you had left.

315
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,900
He was always very good to you.

316
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,870
Now that he's in the hands of
the Japanese,

317
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,230
he must be suffering terribly.

318
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,030
Even if he really did do something wrong,

319
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,530
it was probably just so he could
see you again.

320
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,070
If he knew

321
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,680
that even you didn't want him
as your brother,

322
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,060
how could he still hold on?

323
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,030
You actually miss him very much,

324
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,790
don't you?

325
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,420
I know I should hate him.

326
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,460
But I just can't help it.

327
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,260
I can't help thinking about him.

328
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,140
I can't help worrying about him.

329
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,100
I also think about Daddy

330
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,560
and Mommy all the time.

331
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,260
Miss Qiao,

332
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,930
if you miss your brother,

333
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,950
just allow yourself to miss him.

334
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,300
No one will blame you.

335
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,020
Yu.

336
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,980
I really miss him.

337
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,220
I really miss my brother.

338
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,480
Yu, look.

339
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,260
This is a photo of my brother and me

340
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,420
when we were on a ship together.

341
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,510
I was wearing

342
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,740
a little bow tie then.

343
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,260
Can you tell which ones are us?

344
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:39,370
[Kiang Wu Elementary School]

345
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,420
Are you sure these are

346
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,310
the serial numbers of the HKD notes
that were issued under duress?

347
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,630
I've checked

348
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,030
the serial numbers of all newly issued
HKD banknotes

349
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,920
that appeared during this period.

350
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,280
The serial numbers of those dollars
printed after 1937

351
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,910
all fall within the ranges

352
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,800
provided by Qiao Renyu.

353
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,930
Based on the denominations
and serial number ranges,

354
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,860
I've calculated the total amount—

355
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,760
it comes out

356
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,120
to exactly 120 million.

357
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,600
Excellent.

358
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,220
With these specific serial numbers,

359
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,430
we can reveal the truth
about this whole matter

360
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,050
and call on society

361
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,850
to refuse to accept
or use this batch of banknotes.

362
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,520
Qiao Renyu

363
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,180
has made a tremendous contribution

364
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,560
to China's resistance against Japan.

365
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,520
And I mistook him for a traitor.

366
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,420
No,

367
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,300
I must go apologize to her right away.

368
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,920
Mr. Liang.

369
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,320
Yes?

370
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,900
I also thought about going to find Yinwan

371
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,100
to tell her the truth.

372
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,850
I even made it outside her dormitory.

373
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,010
But I still didn't do it.

374
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,380
Why?

375
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,810
Once these serial numbers are published,

the Japanese will immediately know

377
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,880
it was Qiao Renyu who leaked them.

a ruthless retaliation against Qiao Renyu.

When Mr. Qiao revealed these numbers,

383

he was fully aware of the consequences.

share a deep bond.

389

If she were to learn the truth now,

390
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,270
it would be like announcing

391
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,720
her brother's death sentence
right in front of her.

392
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,090

far more cruel
than a temporary misunderstanding.

But for the greater cause,

395
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,830
we have no choice but to keep it secret
for now.

396
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,220

397

at the risk of his life.

00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,220
it's been over half an hour,

556
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,470
and the Chinese merchants'
open and secret traders

557
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,130
still haven't made any moves.

558
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,490
Keep selling.

559
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,440
They can't maintain
their base position anymore.

560
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,670
If they want to buy now,

561
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,930
we've already pushed the price too high.

562
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,510
They can't afford to buy.
All they can do now

563
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,210
is stare helplessly.

564
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,680
There are fewer than

565
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,590
10 minutes until the midday market break.

566
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,570
All morning,

567
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,000
you've used

568
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,060
less than a third of
the market-support funds,

569
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,920
yet you've already crushed your opponents.

570
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,380
Mr. Ogata,

571
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,570
you fought this battle brilliantly.

572
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,850
Not at all.

573
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,780
Mr. Qiao, you're the real expert.

574
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,930
We're evenly matched.

575
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,020
It takes a hero to recognize a hero.

576
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,110
Sell order of 5 million at HKD 3.20!

577
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,660
Five million HKD sell order!

578
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,570
Is anyone taking it?

579
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,570
Anyone taking it?

580
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,400
Five million!

581
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,930
Is anyone taking
the 5 million HKD sell order?

582
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,490
A new 5 million sell order!

583
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:03,820
Impossible!

584
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,610
It's true, General Manager.

585
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,790
All our buy orders

586
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,010
have been taken!

587
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,920
There are still 3 million in sell orders
with no takers!

588
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
What should we do?

589
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:13,540
Find out immediately who's selling!

590
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,100
What did you say?

591
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,440
Banco Nacional Ultramarino?

592
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,830
Are you certain?

593
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,280
It's true. Not only that,

594
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:24,480
BNU just dumped another 3 million

595
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
[Tai Fung Bank]

596
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,010
and the price has already dropped
to HKD 3.10.

597
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,360
It's Banco Nacional Ultramarino,

598
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,360
and they've sold another 3 million?

599
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,889
General Manager, the selling pressure
is overwhelming.

600
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:41,139
Even if we urgently place buy orders,
it won't help.

601
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:43,580
The price has dropped to HKD 3.

602
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,280
Should we keep placing buy orders?

603
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,960
No,

604
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,460
suspend all actions.

605
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,300
Eight million? How is that possible?

606
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,920
Didn't we all agree last night
to follow your orders?

607
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,840
You didn't give any instructions,

608
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,920
so how could our BNU act on its own?

609
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,900
You're asking me? Who should I ask then?

610
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,600
I just need Banco Nacional Ultramarino

611
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,670
to stop selling immediately

612
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,550
and withdraw their sell orders.

613
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,310
I'll go find out right away!

614
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,810
[Hong Kong Dollar; 2.98]

615
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,030
Just before the market closed,

616
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:37,100
did the bank dump 8 million HKD?

617
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,150
Did you or not?

618
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,630
Mr. Ogata,

619
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,780
why did the market suddenly change?

620
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,110
What exactly happened?

621
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,240
Mr. Qiao,

622
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,770
didn't you say the Chinese merchants
would team up with BNU

623
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,540
to secure enough funds?

624
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,370
Why would

625
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,210
BNU suddenly sell such large quantities?

626
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,530
Well...

627
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,840
BNU's sudden selling

628
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,430
is likely intended to drive the price down

629
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,030
so Chinese merchants can buy
at a lower price later.

630
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,130
Impossible!

631
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,590
According to our calculations,

632
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,590
the Chinese merchants' funds
must have already been exhausted!

633
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,490
They have hardly anything left!

634
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,030
They can only sell first to get cash

635
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,840
before buying at lower prices.

636
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:24,760
And all morning,

637
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,840
the four major Chinese banks combined

638
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,280
have only sold less than 10 million!

639
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,690
And the cash from those sales

640
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,370
was all used to buy back!

641
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,020
So where would they get the extra money

642
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,950
to absorb BNU's massive sell-off?

643
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,260
We can't be absolutely certain

644
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,450
our calculations are correct.

645
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,290
What if we're wrong?

646
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,700
What if the Chinese merchants

647
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,420
managed to raise massive funds
at the last minute?

648
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,820
All of this could happen.

649
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,290
We calculated these figures separately,

650
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:51,910
right?

651
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,970
Could we both have been that far off?

652
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,600
If the Chinese merchants
had secured massive funding,

653
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,400
would they still need to

654
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,330
spend the entire morning
locked in battle with us?

655
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,340
So your projection
that the Chinese merchants'

656
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,130
retreat-then-advance strategy

657
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,550
rests solely on the assumption that they

658
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,100
can borrow that 15 million from BNU!

659
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,670
Now that BNU is selling on its own,

660
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,570
it means they never lent money
to the Chinese merchants!

661
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,630
Do you really think the Chinese merchants
could double their position

662
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,360
to over 60 million with nothing but
their original 30 million base?

663
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,550
Mr. Ogata.

664
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,610
Banco Nacional Ultramarino's sell-off

665
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,980
has already proven one thing:

666
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,800
the HSBC treasurer

667
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,150
leaked the truth

668
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,710
about the Hong Kong dollar
before his death.

669
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,700
If that's true,

670
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:33,870
neither the Chinese merchants
nor Rodrigues

671
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:35,450
would trust HKD anymore.

672
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,430
And that rubber deal

673
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,680
was just a trap they set.

674
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,270
And Qiao Renyu here

675
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,860
is deliberately working with them...

676
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,680
to trick you.

677
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,240
The Chinese merchants are fighting
on the front lines,

678
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,300
and the only thing we need to do

679
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,630
is wait as agreed.

680
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,000
I'll go find out right now.

681
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,590
Once they succeed,

682
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,510
we can also withdraw safely.

683
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,770
Isn't that a win-win?

684
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,090
Why undermine them
at this critical moment?

685
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,220
If they fail,

686
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,460
what benefit is that to the bank?

687
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,030
Because the plan designed
by the Chinese merchants

688
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,460
is too risky.

689
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,560
Such a high-risk strategy—

690
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,920
one slip,

691
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,130
and it could lead to total failure.

692
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,820
And the bank would go down with them.

693
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,800
So our only way out

694
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,030
is to take advantage
while they're fighting

695
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,420
and sell our holdings at a decent price.

696
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,820
The board has calculated that

697
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,960
if we move quickly enough,

698
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,650
the loss would be at most 2 or 3 million.

699
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,610
At least the bank can survive.

700
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,550
But the moment we place sell orders,

701
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,630
this game will be over.

702
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:48,210
The Chinese banks will be

703
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,440
completely destroyed by Specie Bank.

704
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:53,750
Isn't that offering them up as sacrifices?

705
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,400
Must it be this way?

706
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,000
Sorry, Rodrigues,

707
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,500
but this is the only safe way
to save the bank.

708
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,520
And it's the board's decision.

709
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,530
When you reached an agreement
with the Chinese merchants yesterday,

710
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,530
you had already decided to do this,

711
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,490
hadn't you?

712
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,810
My dear Rodrigues,

713
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,820
the board kept you in the dark

714
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,510
for the sake of the entire bank.

715
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,000
You're also an executive director
of the bank.

716
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,190
What we're doing

717
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,340
is protecting your interests too.

718
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,450
Xian,

719
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,390
what did Rodrigues say?

720
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,190
He said

721
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,460
the sell-off was a decision made by

722
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,570
the board of Banco Nacional Ultramarino.

723
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,250
His single vote couldn't change it.

724
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,550
After the market opens this afternoon,

725
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,710
Banco Nacional Ultramarino

726
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,240
will immediately dump
all its remaining HKD.

727
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,120
We're finished.

728
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,140
What should we do?

729
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:53,980
We're doomed.

730
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,880
Dr. Ke?

731
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,970
Mr. Ogata,

732
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,450
you don't have to believe me,

733
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,420
but if Robert

734
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,960
had really leaked the secret
about the HKD,

735
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,660
the first to dump
would have been the Chinese banks,

736
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,520
not Banco Nacional Ultramarino.

737
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,260
That's true.

738
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,400
As for why Banco Nacional Ultramarino

739
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,590
suddenly started selling,

740
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,730
I believe our opponent,
facing imminent defeat,

741
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:20,990
had to take desperate measures.

742
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,190
Their only purpose in muddying the waters

743
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,270
is to disrupt your team's morale.

744
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,750
From what I can see,

745
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,110
it seems to be working quite well.

746
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,110
You're wavering.

747
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,130
And that's exactly
what they're aiming for.

748
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,420
You mean

749
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:34,730
they're

750
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,610
just trying to trick me?

751
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,810
Trick me into giving up market support

752
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,460
and selling alongside them?

753
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,120
Besides that,

754
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,780
is there any better way

755
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,310
to drive down the HKD price?

756
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,040
Mr. Ogata,

757
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,170
don't let him mislead you any further.

758
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,110
This morning alone,

759
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,010
you've already purchased
nearly 10 million HKD.

760
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:53,840
If you continue making mistakes,

761
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,110
you'll only ruin
all our previous achievements.

762
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,860
You must stop supporting the market!

763
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,410
Sell whatever you can.

764
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,190
Mr. Ogata,

765
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,410
although I believe

766
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,300
continuing to support the market
will defeat our opponents,

767
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,190
Colonel Sawa's suggestion is more prudent.

768
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,910
The marketplace is a battlefield—

769
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,310
no one wins every battle.

770
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,460
Losing once in a while

771
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,120
won't affect your status
as a financial genius.

772
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,300
Mr. Ogata.

773
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,100
Colonel Sawa!

774
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,610
I am the one in charge of this operation.

775
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,380
I am.

776
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,030
After the market opens this afternoon,

777
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,920
I will continue to monitor the situation.

778
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,500
Only if Banco Nacional Ultramarino
stops selling

779
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,670
and Chinese merchants start buying
in large quantities

780
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,170
will I

781
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,680
continue supporting the market.

782
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,490
I know you're all under a lot of pressure,

783
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,320
but there's no turning back now.

784
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,160
We can't pull out in the middle.

785
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,530
The only way forward

786
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:57,980
is to keep

787
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,080
this game going

788
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,720
and make it even bigger.

789
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,020
We must convince the Japanese

790
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,630
that Banco Nacional Ultramarino's
earlier sell-off

791
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,820
was just an extreme tactic
by the Chinese and Portuguese

792
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,600
to drive down the Hong Kong dollar.

793
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,170
But to keep this game alive,

794
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,060
we must fulfill two conditions.

795
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,730
First, we need

796
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:11,570
Banco Nacional Ultramarino

797
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,230
to stop selling.

798
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:13,860
Second,

799
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,380
we need to raise funds

800
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,210
to maintain the illusion
that we're still buying.

801
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,050
But right now,

802
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,250
neither of these is within our reach.

803
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,720
I actually

804
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,850
have an idea to solve both problems.

805
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,260
Dr. Ke,

806
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:28,830
what's your plan?

807
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:31,100
First, about the money.

808
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,650
Wanqi, let me ask you:

809
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,620
in all of Macau,

810
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,410
who has both the courage

811
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,630
and large amounts of cash

812
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,000
at their disposal?

813
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,710
You mean

814
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,060
the Tai Ho Brotherhood?

815
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,590
The Tai Ho Brotherhood operates
outside the law

816
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,010
with plenty of hard cash

817
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:48,960
that they can't deposit in banks

818
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,770
or financial institutions.

819
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,710
But only they

820
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,590
can provide large sums of money
at any time.

821
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,790
But this battle carries extreme risks.

822
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,950
Whether we can persuade Master Sanhe

823
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,080
to stake his entire fortune to help us—

824
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,660
that depends on you now.

825
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,510
I can't guarantee

826
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,640
that I can borrow it,

827
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,060
but I'll definitely do my utmost.
