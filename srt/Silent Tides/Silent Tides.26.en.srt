[Silent Tides]

2
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,979
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,210
Regarding the detailed confession,

4
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,610
the Zhongshan authorities are currently
conducting further interrogation.

5
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,590
The three cooperating parties are

6
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,890
the Tai Ho Brotherhood,

7
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,600
the Chinese Communist guerrillas,

8
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,460
and various Portuguese
and Chinese merchants

9
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,759
led by Rodrigues and Ma Wanqi.

10
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,560
The mastermind:

11
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,620
Chairman of Macau Banking Association

12
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,919
and General Manager
of Tai Fung Bank, He Xian.

13
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,040
Well? Mr. Fukue.

14
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,210
I was right, wasn't I?

15
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,020
Report!

16
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,630
Chief,

17
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,920
there's an emergency.

18
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,610
Blood pressure:

19
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,690
40/70.

20
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,480
Flashlight.

21
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,240
Director Ke,

22
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,329
what should we do?

23
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,100
Fortunately, Mr. Ma arrived just in time.

24
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,070
Otherwise, the consequences
would have been unimaginable.

25
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,690
It was because Yang Chang
received Commander Ou's telegram

26
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,890
and learned that you were bringing
Captain Long to Macau

27
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,130
that he notified us to send people
to meet and assist you.

28
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,930
That's right.

29
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,490
We didn't know when you would arrive,

30
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,210
so several vehicles kept circling

31
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,890
along the Gongbei blockade line,
searching over and over.

32
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,690
Fortunately,

33
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,079
I managed to find you.

34
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,420
Thank you.

35
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,050
Lin,

36
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,020
how is Captain Long?

37
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,410
Her condition is critical.

38
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,070
She needs immediate surgery.

39
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,040
So...

40
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,800
Should we transfer her to
the Conde S. Januário Hospital?

41
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,730
There's no time.

42
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,670
I have no choice but to use
the Kiang Wu operating room.

43
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,300
I'll perform the surgery myself
right away.

44
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,470
You keep watch outside,

45
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,780
and if anything unexpected happens,

46
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,010
do whatever you can to buy us some time.

47
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,740
Understood.

48
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,170
Do you know who that female Communist
you've been pursuing is?

49
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,430
I only know she's the liaison
between Ou Xin's guerrilla unit

50
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,960
and the Tai Ho Brotherhood.

51
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,640
According to the testimony of Liang Zhong
from the Tai Ho Brotherhood,

52
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,430
this person is Long Haishan,

53
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,830
captain of the White Dove Unit

54
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,270
of the Zhongshan Guerrilla Forces,

55
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,450
who's also the intelligence officer of
the Chinese Communist base in Black Hill.

56
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,360
She

57
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,750
not only holds

58
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,900
all the secrets of
the underground supply line operations,

59
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,650
but also

60
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,000
possesses information about the entire
Communist underground intelligence network

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,810
across
the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau region.

62
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,510
Seems like she really is a big fish.

63
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,779
No wonder the Communists

64
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,110
desperately wanted to bring her to Macau.

65
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,940
In Macau,

66
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,260
only the CHCSJ has
the facilities for surgery.

67
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,650
Yamaguchi,

68
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,680
take your team there immediately.

69
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,970
Make sure to capture her alive.

70
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,500
Yes, Sir.

71
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,290
Captain Huang,

72
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,260
take your men to Tai Fung Bank

73
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,340
and arrest He Xian.

74
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,250
Yes, Sir.

75
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,540
Mr. Fukue,

76
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,340
it's about time we go to
the Portuguese Macau government

77
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,110
to hear what Governor De Solaire

78
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,390
has to say.

79
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,270
Hello, this is Qiao Yinwan.

80
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,860
It's me.

81
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,050
Listen to me.

82
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,210
I just called Tai Fung Bank.

83
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,670
They said He Xian went to
Kiang Wu Hospital.

84
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,430
I'm worried

85
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,620
the hospital's phone lines
might be tapped.

86
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,960
Hurry over there—

87
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,370
the Japanese are going to arrest him.

88
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:12,860
What?

89
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,710
Why would the Japanese want to arrest him?

90
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,700
There's no time to explain.

91
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,950
He knows everything about this.

92
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,190
Just tell him

93
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,920
the Steamship Sai On incident
has been exposed

94
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,340
and Liang Zhong from Tai Ho Brotherhood
has confessed everything.

95
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,250
The Japanese are working with the police
to arrest him.

96
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,980
Tell him to escape immediately

97
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,540
before it's too late.

98
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,040
Xian!

99
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,120
The Japanese are coming to arrest you.

100
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,920
You need to go.

101
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:54,980
Xian,

102
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,880
hurry up and leave.

103
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,480
That's right, you should go.

104
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,360
No need.

105
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,460
Since I signed the ship rental guarantee,

106
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,060
I've already been prepared.

107
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,830
Right now, our biggest concern

108
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,160
should be Captain Long.

109
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,850
Dr. Ke mentioned that

110
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:08,920
this surgery

111
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,650
would take at least 4 hours.

112
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,180
The CHCSJ just called, saying

113
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,730
the Japanese didn't find
what they want there

114
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,530
and will soon arrive at Kiang Wu.

115
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,360
Therefore,

116
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,130
we must do everything

117
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,160
we can to buy Dr. Ke

118
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,810
more time.

119
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,460
Open up! Official business!

120
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,550
Open the gate now!

121
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,960
I'll go stall them.

122
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,740
-Anyone in there? Open the gate!
-Xian, staying here won't do any good.

123
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,590
Leave quickly through the back door.

124
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,120
Be quick.

125
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,890
Go now!

126
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,680
Right, take the back door.

127
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,060
Just go.

128
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,220
Xian?

129
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,710
Open the gate! Hurry up.

130
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,990
Open the gate now!

131
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,740
I'm Ma Wanqi from
the Kiang Wu Charitable Association.

132
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,560
What's your business here

133
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,020
in the middle of the night?

134
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,230
Mr. Ma,

135
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,030
listen to me.

136
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,480
Here's the thing.

137
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,620
He Xian, General Manager of Tai Fung Bank,

138
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,430
is now suspected of being involved in
a case of smuggling supplies.

139
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,120
The police

140
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,310
are here to arrest him
and take him in for investigation.

141
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,240
According to intelligence from
our Japanese enforcement partners,

142
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,190
He Xian has come to Kiang Wu Hospital.

143
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,840
Please open the gate.

144
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,850
We need to go in and find him now.

145
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,930
I'm sorry,

146
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,030
but I haven't seen him in the hospital.

147
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,600
If you want to find He Xian,

148
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,030
go where you should go.

149
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,710
I've received intelligence

150
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,710
that He Xian

151
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,590
is right here in Kiang Wu Hospital.

152
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,930
If you don't open the gate right now,

153
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,550
you'll be

154
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,290
obstructing Japanese-Portuguese
joint law enforcement.

155
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:36,730
Fine.

156
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,140
If you want to search the hospital,

157
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,420
show me the proper search warrant.

158
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,640
Colonel Sawa,

159
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,590
this matter is too rushed.

160
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:50,850
We indeed didn't get a search warrant
before coming here.

161
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,270
Maybe we should wait until it's confirmed

162
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,210
that He Xian is indeed in the hospital,

163
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,700
then go back, obtain a search warrant,
and come back.

164
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,930
Stop making excuses to stall!

165
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,860
Anyone who dares to obstruct the search

166
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,910
will be treated as an accomplice
and convicted accordingly.

167
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,390
Ma Wanqi,

168
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,890
are you going

169
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,440
to open this gate or not?

170
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,150
Colonel Sawa,

171
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,520
calm down. Please calm down.

172
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,559
Colonel Sawa.

173
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,409
Macau abides by the law.

174
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,480
What do you think you're doing?

175
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,789
Put that gun down now.

176
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,430
Xian,

177
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,550
bad news.

178
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,780
Huang Gongjie

179
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,340
has brought a large group of
intelligence agents

180
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,530
and surrounded the hospital's
back door.

181
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,500
What do we do now?

182
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,710
They've blocked both doors.

183
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,510
Xian, how about

184
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,530
you hide somewhere
in the hospital for now?

185
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:01,860
No.

186
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:02,910
Fei,

187
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:03,990
give me the car key.

188
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,600
What do you want to do?

189
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,150
Aren't they here for me?

190
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,670
I'll drive out and draw them away

191
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,140
to buy Dr. Ke more time for the surgery.

192
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,350
I'll come with you.

193
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,960
No, it's too dangerous.

194
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,960
You should know
their target isn't just you,

195
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,080
but also Captain Long.

196
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,380
Only if the two of us work together

197
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,910
can we draw away
all the intelligence agents.

198
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:22,990
Give it to me.

199
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,840
Female Communist!

200
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,890
H-He Xian!

201
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,030
G-Go! Go after them!

202
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,830
Get in the car!

203
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,890
Chief.

204
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,360
He Xian just fled east by car

205
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,570
with the female Communist.

206
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,340
We're chasing them right now.

207
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,360
Don't let them get away. Catch them.

208
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,890
Yes, Sir!

209
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,340
He Xian

210
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,460
escaped through the back door.

211
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,810
Inspector General Gonçalves,

212
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,250
why aren't you taking your men after them?

213
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:15,580
What?

214
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,700
He escaped?

215
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,200
Who saw it?

216
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,810
You're not mistaken, are you?

217
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,220
My Sawa Agency's Special Operations Team

218
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,870
saw him driving away

219
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,320
through the back door with their own eyes.

220
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,650
How could I be mistaken?

221
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,260
Inspector General Gonçalves,

222
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,910
if you deliberately delay any further,
it'll be considered willful harboring.

223
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,370
If He Xian manages to escape
because of this,

224
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,460
I'd like to see how
your Macau Police Department

225
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,820
will explain this to
the Japanese Imperial Army!

226
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,370
Darn you!

227
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:49,870
After them!

228
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,400
Yes, Sir.

229
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,180
What are you waiting for?

230
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,200
Go after them!

231
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,820
They took the bait.

232
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,970
Faster! Drive faster!

233
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,760
Quick! Go around.

234
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,050
Block them from different directions.

235
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:22,620
Yes, Sir!

236
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,210
Drive faster!

237
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,690
Yes!

238
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,890
[Exported Specialty]

239
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,750
Qiao Yinwan?

240
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,320
Colonel Sawa.

241
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,720
Captain Huang.

242
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,570
So it's you guys.

243
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,800
You almost scared me to death.

244
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,570
He Xian!

245
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,550
Where are you hiding the female Communist?

246
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,380
What female Communist?

247
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,440
Such a big operation
in the middle of the night—

248
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,640
what happened?

249
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,450
Stop pretending.

250
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,200
If you're not hiding the female Communist,

251
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,120
why did you run?

252
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,590
Captain Huang.

253
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,650
I drove out of the hospital

254
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,200
in the middle of the night

255
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,120
and ran into a bunch of people
pointing guns at me,

256
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,270
either shooting or
trying to surround me.

257
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,880
Anyone would be scared, okay?

258
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,780
Of course I thought you were robbers.

259
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,660
I thought you were trying to kidnap me.

260
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,190
What else could I do but run?

261
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,540
Inspector General Gonçalves's police car

262
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,600
was sounding its siren the whole way.

263
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,780
Didn't you hear it?

264
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,440
Or did you mistake

265
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,320
the police for robbers too?

266
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:54,850
Look,

267
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,390
with police cars blaring behind yours,

268
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,790
I was even more convinced
you were robbers.

269
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,150
Then what were you doing
at Kiang Wu Hospital?

270
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,340
It was because of me.

271
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,970
I wasn't feeling well

272
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,500
and went to Kiang Wu Hospital
for a check-up.

273
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,580
As a woman,

274
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,480
at such a late hour,

275
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,010
I didn't dare to walk alone.

276
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,320
Xian is my friend.

277
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,660
I asked him to give me a ride.

278
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,720
Is there a problem?

279
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,540
Colonel Sawa.

280
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,720
That's enough.

281
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,310
Are you investigating the supplies case

282
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,480
or their friendship?

283
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,550
Mr. He,

284
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,410
the government ship, Steamship Sai On,

285
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,080
that you guaranteed and rented

286
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,460
was found with a large amount of
undeclared diesel oil.

287
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,080
You're suspected of smuggling supplies.

288
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,590
The police department will now

289
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,010
lawfully detain and question you.

290
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,130
Please cooperate.

291
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,770
I didn't know about this.

292
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,310
Alright,

293
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,130
I'll fully cooperate.

294
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,080
-Arrest him.
-Xian.

295
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,310
Don't worry.

296
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,760
I'll be fine.

297
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,540

00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,270
is trying to divert our attention.

300
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,220
That female Communist
must still be at Kiang Wu Hospital.

301
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,250
Go back there immediately!

302
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:41,800

Clean the wound.

311
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,810
Prepare to suture.

312
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,340

[Operating Room]

314
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,500
How's it going?

315
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,300
Not good.

316
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,460
They're back again.

317
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,390

318
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,680
and there's no time to move Captain Long.

319
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,839
What should we do?

320
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,470
This is a hospital!

321
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,410

to enter without permission?

00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,520

What do you think you're doing?

325
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,850
We're performing surgery here.

326

What gives you the right to barge in?

at Kiang Wu Hospital.

from Zhongshan Guerrilla Forces

Feel free to verify his identity.

350
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,470
So what happened to him?

which punctured his lung.

I didn't have time to take him to CHCSJ.

360
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,120
I had to use Kiang Wu Hospital's
operating room

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,390
to start emergency treatment.

363
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,530
I know I've violated
the Health Bureau's orders,

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,110
but after I finish the surgery,

365
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,090
I'll take full responsibility.

366
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,150
I'll resign.

367
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,510
But the right to life comes first.

368
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,010

this is a life-saving situation.

374
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,130
Now I ask you to leave immediately.

375
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,900

to send reinforcements.

disrupt public order

377
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,240
in hospitals again,

378
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,570
arrest them on the spot.

379
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,120
Yes, Sir.

380
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,790
Colonel Sawa,

381
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,500
are you going to

382
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,340
continue investigating the smuggling case,

383
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,030
or do you intend to keep ignoring

384
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,940
Macau's laws and groundlessly

385
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,970
disrupt the hospital's order here?

386
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,400
Fine.

387
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,950
Then let's see

388
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,940
how your Portuguese Macau government
will clear itself

389
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,050
of this clear-cut smuggling case.

390
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:28,940
Let's go.

391
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,740
Dr. Ke,

392
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,630
I apologize for the disturbance.

393
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:41,990
Thank you.

394
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,740
Zhengping.

395
00:21:59,180 --> 00:21:59,890
Zhengping.

396
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,760
Are you okay?

397
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,180
Lin.

398
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,280
I'm okay.

399
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,050
Mr. He. On behalf of the Macau police,

400
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,600
I will be questioning you

401
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,550
regarding the Steamship Sai On
smuggling case.

402
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,080
Please answer truthfully.

403
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,020
No problem.

404
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,260
Good.

405
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,180
Is this the ship rental guarantee document

406
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,790
that you personally signed
for Steamship Sai On?

407
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,490
Yes.

408
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,700
Steamship Sai On

409
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,760
was indeed rented with my guarantee.

410
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:37,790
Then,

411
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,200
is the massive amount of
undeclared diesel on the ship

412
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,030
also yours?

413
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,310
It was,

414
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,530
but not anymore.

415
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,720
What do you mean? Please explain clearly.

416
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,900
This batch of diesel

417
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,560
was originally imported legally
by Rodrigues.

418
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,620
Since they owed Tai Fung Bank money,

419
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,680
they gave it to me as payment in kind.

420
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,500
So it was mine originally.

421
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,020
Then why isn't it yours anymore?

422
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,730
And if it was legally imported,

423
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,830
why wasn't it declared to the government

424
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,880
during the inspection?

425
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,350
Because just before
the declaration period ended,

426
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,910
I had already sold it to another client.

427
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,700
Since the diesel has changed hands,

428
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,420
it was naturally up to the new client
to declare it on time.

429
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,950
And my client said he would declare it
on time—

430
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,130
I had no reason to doubt him, right?

431
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,540
If you had sold it to someone else,

432
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,380
then why did you still

433
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,620
arrange to rent a ship
to transport the diesel?

434
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,450
Because under
the Portuguese-Japanese joint regulations

435
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,510
issued during the major inspection,

436
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,400
renting a government vessel
required a representative

437
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,400
from Macau's business community
to act as guarantor.

438
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,770
My client didn't have such qualifications,

439
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,960
so I stepped in

440
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,080
to handle the ship rental procedures

441
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,760
on behalf of my client.

442
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,500
So you're saying
the diesel belongs to someone else,

443
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,370
you didn't know it wasn't declared,

444
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,770
and you only guaranteed the ship rental
for your client?

445
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,420
Is that right?

446
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:44,900
Yes.

447
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:45,770
Then,

448
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,110
who is your client,

449
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:49,390
the real owner of the cargo?

450
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,040
I'm sorry.

451
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,150
I signed a confidentiality agreement
with my client.

452
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:54,160
I cannot say.

453
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,510
Mr. He, all evidence now points to you.

454
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,150
If you don't reveal the real owner,

455
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,480
you might end up

456
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,710
taking the blame for smuggling yourself.

457
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,820
As a businessman,

458
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,710
I must maintain my integrity.

459
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,300
I cannot tell you.

460
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:13,850
Keep it steady.

461
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,780
Come on, slowly.

462
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,310
Here.

463
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:19,770
Slowly.

464
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,890
Careful.

465
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,540
Up there. Up there.

466
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,630
Steady now. Steady now.

467
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,610
Come on.

468
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,660
One, two...

469
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,830
Go.

470
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,780
Be careful.

471
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,170
Alright.

472
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:42,920
Mr. He,

473
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,950
since you refuse to disclose
your client's information to the police,

474
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,930
according to the Portuguese-Japanese
Joint Anti-Smuggling Agreement,

475
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,670
the Japanese representative,
Colonel Sawa Eisaku,

476
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,280
will conduct a private questioning
with you.

477
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,340
Please cooperate.

478
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,000
Mr. He.

479
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,470
Back in Hong Kong,

480
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,270
you were nothing but

481
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,260
an obscure small bank merchant.

482
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,530
When you fled to Macau,

483
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,870
you were even

484
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,400
completely broke,

485
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,290
no different from
those tens of thousands of

486
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,340
starving, destitute refugees.

487
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,140
But in just two and a half years,

488
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,370
you've risen to become

489
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,470
the General Manager of
Macau's largest Chinese merchants' bank,

490
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:34,230
the first Chinese business manager at BNU,

491
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,610
and even secured

492
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,950
the chairman position of
the Macau Banking Association.

493
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,270
And all this

494
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,470
took merely two and a half years.

495
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,420
Remarkable indeed.

496
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,350
To be honest,

497
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,470
I, Sawa Eisaku,

498
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,820
truly admire you, Mr. He,

499
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,330
from the bottom of my heart.

500
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,470
But precisely because of that,

501
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,640
I find it

502
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,160
all the more regrettable for you.

503
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,340
Regrettable in what way?

504
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,810
It's regrettable that you, Mr. He,

505
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,180
show no regard for

506
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,180
everything you've worked so hard
to achieve.

507
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,290
You don't even care about

508
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,010
the home you've gone to such lengths

509
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,490
to finally settle down in.

510
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,270
Instead, you chose to take the blame
for someone else,

511
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,380
putting yourself

512
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,150
in an irredeemable situation.

513
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,250
Is it that serious?

514
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,250
Liang Zhong, the master of Haiyun Hall
of the Tai Ho Brotherhood—

515
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,480
Mr. He,

516
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,620
you should know him well.

517
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,040
After Liang Zhong was arrested,

518
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,480
he confessed everything in Zhongshan,

519
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,940
including all the secrets behind

520
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,900
Macau's trade in strategic materials,

521
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,560
as well as

522
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,330
the organizers behind it all.

523
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,300
Mr. He,

524
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,020
you should know

525
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,530
what that means.

526
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,780
According to Liang Zhong,

527
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,560
the owner of the diesel

528
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,390
involved in this smuggling case

529
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,710
wasn't you.

530
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,260
You even

531
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,700
wasn't willing to transport it at first.

532
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,680
The entire smuggling plan
using Steamship Sai On

533
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,110
was actually

534
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,090
orchestrated by
the Portuguese Macau government

535
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,140
and Rodrigues. Isn't that right?

536
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,830
I'm sorry.

537
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,200
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

538
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,730
You understand perfectly,

539
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,270
Mr. He.

540
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,510
Setting aside

541
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,530
the past two and a half years,

542
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,160
let's just talk about

543
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,530
this case of Steamship Sai On
caught in the act.

544
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,560
It was entirely
the Portuguese Macau government's doing.

545
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,800
They directly planned

546
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,750
and organized

547
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,950
the transport of massive war supplies

548
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,470
to aid the British-American Allied Forces
and the Chinese government.

549
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,250
This

550
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:21,800
was a blatant act of war.

551
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,120
And yet, after it happened,

552
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,580
you became

553
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,830
the guarantor for the ship rental,

554
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,490
which made you
the scapegoat of this crime.

555
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,690
Mr. He,

556
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,560
I wonder

557
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,910
what benefits
the Portuguese Macau government

558
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:46,390
promised you

559
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:48,970
that made you

560
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,360
willingly take on this role?

561
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,900
Did they promise you a clean acquittal,

562
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,530
or did they promise that
the government would back you—

563
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,540
letting you off
with only a light punishment

564
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,990
in exchange for

565
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,680
greater benefits down the line?

566
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,720
But in short,

567
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,180
you've been deceived.

568
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,700
Not to mention
for the past two and a half years,

569
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,190
you've been the backbone

570
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,240
of Macau's anti-Japanese
underground supply line,

571
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,590
just this smuggling case
with Steamship Sai On alone

572
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,950
is already backed by

573
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,900
ironclad evidence.

574
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,850
And once the verdict is reached,

575
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:31,970
we Japanese have the right to demand
extradition of the principal offender.

576
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,200
When that happens, let alone
the Portuguese Macau government—

577
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,880
even if Lisbon steps in,

578
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,770
they won't be able to protect you,

579
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,140
Mr. He Xian.

580
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,830
Colonel Sawa, since you keep saying

581
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,530
there are both witnesses
and physical evidence,

582
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,240
then why waste your breath
talking to me here?

583
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,970
I just...

584
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,740
Feel sorry to lose someone
of your caliber.

585
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
I wanted to give you a way out.

586
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,540
Is that so?

587
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,610
Haven't you been dreaming of
destroying me, Colonel Sawa?

588
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,410
Now that the chance has arrived,

589
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,530
why are you suddenly being so polite?

590
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,580
Let me

591
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,230
guess the reason.

592
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,310
That captured suspect from Zhongshan
you mentioned

593
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,010
only has hearsay evidence

594
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,050
and has never directly dealt with
the Macau government.

595
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,350
You can't possibly convict
the Macau government

596
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,650
based on just a secondhand testimony.

597
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:30,970
That's why

598
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,180
you wanted to use me,
someone directly involved,

599
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,720
to falsely accuse the Macau government,

600
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,210
so as to charge the Macau government

601
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,960
with violating neutrality

602
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,660
and participating in the war.

603
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,290
Isn't that right?

604
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,470
Whatever the case,

605
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,540
if you refuse to cooperate,

606
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,310
you'll die a horrible death.

607
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,420
You know perfectly well

608
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,860
how the Portuguese Macau government

609
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,020
has been treating you Chinese people.

610
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,290
I just don't understand

611
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,150
why you feel the need

612
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,680
to be their scapegoat.

613
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,750
To protect them,

614
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,270
you're even willing to risk your own life

615
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,610
and your entire family's future.

616
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,880
Alright, that's all I'll say.

617
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,850
When talking to a smart person,

618
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,700
a hint is enough.

619
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,110
There're two paths before you right now.

620
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,250
One is to confess the truth,

621
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,160
and our Empire of Japan

622
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,250
will guarantee you a secure position

623
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,930
at the very top of
Macau's business community.

624
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,010
And the second

625
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,920
is to remain obstinate—

626
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,310
as for how that path ends,

627
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,390
you know very well yourself.

628
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,160
What's with that laugh?

629
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,470
I was laughing because Colonel Sawa,

630
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,340
you really are quite the schemer.

631
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,640
Forcing me to falsely accuse
the Macau government

632
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,280
to give you a good excuse

633
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,850
for your armed occupation of Macau.

634
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,050
And once I betray the Macau government,

635
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,490
I'll have no way back.

636
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,390
I can only willingly become a traitor

637
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,080
to serve you Japanese

638
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,490
and provide you with endless supplies.

639
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,560
My life

640
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,070
in exchange for the entire Macau

641
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,330
and the countless supplies you dream of—

642
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,440
what a profitable deal indeed.

643
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,050
If you don't cooperate,

644
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,490
you're finished.

645
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,230
Your underground supply network
will be finished as well.

646
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,290
You're doomed either way.

647
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,280
The only difference is

648
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,540
whether you want to save yourself

649
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,860
or those Portuguese.

650
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,420
It's clearly a losing deal,

651
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,580
so why would you

652
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,270
go down with those Portuguese

653
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,300
who can offer you nothing in return?

654
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,110
In your view,

655
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,420
anyone who does anything

656
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,080
only does it to gain

657
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,290
greater benefits for themselves.

658
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,290
Isn't that right?

659
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,390
What else

660
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,980
could it possibly be for?

661
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,440
That's why

662
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,640
you'll never understand.

663
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,540
Because bandits are always
blinded by greed,

664
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,630
and people like you

665
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,090
know nothing but threats and bribes.

666
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:36,920
Alright.

667
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,060
I've said all I have to say.

668
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,850
If you think I'll falsely accuse
the Macau government,

669
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,600
you've miscalculated.

670
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,670
When there's a road to Heaven,
you refuse to take it;

671
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,900
and when there's no gate to hell,
you walk right in.

672
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,670
He Xian,

673
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,900
then

674
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,010
don't blame me for what happens next.

675
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,060
Yamaguchi.

676
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,470
Yes, Sir.

677
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,679
Notify Lin Nianci in Zhongshan County

678
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,820
to immediately bring
the prisoner Liang Zhong

679
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,760
and his detailed confession

680
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,420
to Macau.

681
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:16,620
Yes, Sir.

682
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,520
Dr. Ke,

683
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,210
how is Captain Long?

684
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,420
She's out of danger now.

685
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,500
She should be able to pull through.

686
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,760
What about Zhengping?

687
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,030
He's in the ward.

688
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,980
He'll probably need one or two months
to recover.

689
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:47,929
Any news on your end?

690
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:50,110
Lok Pak called an hour ago.

691
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,260
Sawa Eisaku has ordered Zhongshan

692
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,460
to transfer Mr. Liang and his confession
to Macau.

693
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,620
Yang Chang has urgently notified
Commander Ou.

694
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,080
He said he'll do everything he can
to stop it,

695
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,860
but there's no guarantee

696
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,150
he'll succeed.

697
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,890
What about Xian? Where is he?

698
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,640
He was taken by
the Portuguese authorities.

699
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,080
I understand.

700
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,670
It seems that this time,

701
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,270
whether Xian and Macau
can get through this crisis

702
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,730
is up to Commander Ou.

703
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,710
What should we do with this little one,
Magistrate Lin?

704
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,110
Take him along.

705
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,530
When we get to Macau,
if you recant your confession

706
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,690
or say anything you shouldn't,

707
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,210
as for your precious grandson,

708
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,410
I'll immediately...

709
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,390
Rest assured.

710
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,490
Rest assured.

711
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,180
I won't say anything.

712
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,320
Not a word.

713
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,230
Let's go.

714
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,340
Chief, we received a telegram
from Zhongshan.

715
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,900
Mr. He.

716
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,260
I have news for you.

717
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,520
Lin Nianci,
Magistrate of Zhongshan County,

718
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,650
has already departed with the prisoner.

719
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,630
It's now 6:30.

720
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,420
By 7:00 at the latest,

721
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:34,480
they will rendezvous with
the Imperial Army's escort ship.

722
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,690
I have to warn you.

723
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,460
Once the suspect
is handed over to the navy,

724
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,740
it'll be out of my control.

725
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:43,990
So,

726
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,740
you have at most

727
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,150
half an hour left.

728
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,750
It's your last chance to tell

729
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,740
the truth about Steamship Sai On.

730
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,050
Alright.

731
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,750
I'll say it.

732
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,820
Good.

733
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,110
You're finally willing to talk.

734
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,330
Go ahead and tell me.

735
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,070
It's not too late yet.

736
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,650
But we're in Macau now,

737
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,250
and I rented Steamship Sai On
from the Macau government.

738
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:21,930
Therefore,

739
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,280
I'll only confess to the Macau police.

740
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,380
Inspector General Gonçalves.

741
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:30,940
Mr. He.

742
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,320
Please have all irrelevant personnel leave

743
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,620
and turn off the surveillance.

744
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,850
I'll tell only you.

745
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,360
Colonel Sawa.

746
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,890
No.

747
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,920
This is a Japanese-Portuguese
joint investigation.

748
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,110
I must know the suspect's statement.

749
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,730
But this is still Macau,

750
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,300
and even in a joint investigation,

751
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,890
the Macau police have priority.

752
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,800
Colonel Sawa,
if you don't want to solve this case,

753
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,860
then by all means, keep wasting time.

754
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:05,890
Wait.

755
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,440
Fine.

756
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,400
At this point,

757
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,630
I doubt you can pull any tricks anyway.

758
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,810
I'll leave.

759
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,030
Governor,

760
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,480
He Xian has just confessed

761
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,340
who the real owner of
the smuggled diesel is.

762
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,000
Who is it?

763
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:53,920
I'm sorry, but the suspect's confession
may not be accurate.

764
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,810
The police need to further investigate
and gather evidence,

765
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,580
and after confirming the authenticity
of the confession,

766
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,870
we will inform you of the results.

767
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,010
Your Excellency the Governor,

768
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,670
I request permission to lead a team

769
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,380
to arrest the smuggling suspect
named by He Xian

770
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,070
to verify the truth.

771
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,910
You have my permission.
Take action immediately.

772
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:07,440
Yes, Sir.

773
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:22,990
Boss!

774
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,320
What's wrong? Don't panic.

775
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,980
Take your time. What happened?

776
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,860
Bad news!

777
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,730
Something bad happened!

778
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,660
What happened?

779
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,070
I just called Tai Fung Bank
and the He family to follow up,

780
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,360
only to learn that
He Xian was arrested last night.

781
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,530
Arrested?

782
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:38,460
What's going on?

783
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,730
He was arrested by the Macau police
and Agency Chief Sawa together.

784
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,490
I heard

785
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,880
it was because of
the Steamship Sai On's...

786
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,600
Something like a diesel smuggling case.

787
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,870
Steamship Sai On?

788
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,490
But I've checked the diesel.

789
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:49,670
[No smoking or fire in the warehouse]

790
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,550
Check again.

791
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:54,830
It's correct. This is indeed diesel.

792
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,340
[No smoking or fire in the warehouse]

793
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,030
Boss!

794
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:57,880
But over here...

795
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,320
What I have here is water!

796
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,780
He Xian...

797
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,940
That bastard. He set us up.

798
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,050
He switched it to water to scam us!

799
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,650
Don't move! Nobody move!

800
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,400
Police anti-smuggling raid!

801
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,920
Oh, Officer Gonçalves...

802
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,780
Watch out! The suspect's armed

803
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,860
and suspected of resisting arrest!

804
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:21,600
[Herbal Tea Shop]

805
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:36,090
[Zhang's Ship Supplies Shop]

806
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,700
Magistrate Lin! Magistrate Lin!

807
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,820
What should we do?

808
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,360
Is it the Tai Ho Brotherhood
and the guerrillas?

809
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,540
How would I know?

810
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,350
We'll be shot full of holes
if we stay here!

811
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,450
Quick, retreat toward the pier!

812
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,710
Grandpa!

813
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,690
Grandpa!

814
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,670
This is

815
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,480
what we found in the warehouse.

816
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,580
This is the diesel purchase contract

817
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,000
between Wang Qizheng and He Xian.

818
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,390
It was signed 3 days ago.

819
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:33,310
And this is the receipt for
Wang Qizheng's payment

820
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,440
to He Xian for renting Steamship Sai On.

821
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,550
And this is a secret agreement

822
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,840
for the private sale of diesel
between Wang Qizheng

823
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,970
and Zhongshan County Magistrate,
Lin Nianci.

824
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,100
All these prove that

825
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,810
He Xian did sell the diesel
before the declaration period ended

826
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,290
and rented the ship

827
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,330
on behalf of his client.

828
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:47,580
[No smoking or fire in the warehouse]

829
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,880
It's considered legal operation.

830
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,670
While the one who evaded declaration,
secretly smuggled,

831
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,760
got caught by the police,

832
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,610
and even assaulted officers during arrest,
was Wang Qizheng.

833
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,950
The target of his smuggling

834
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,790
was Zhongshan County Magistrate,
Lin Nianci.

835
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,290
[No smoking or fire in the warehouse]

836
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:00,250
It's fake.

837
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,890
This is complete nonsense.
