[Silent Tides]

00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,940
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,229
Chief,

4
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,160
how did it go?

5
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,720
Is the contract signed yet?

6
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,080
What?

7
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,509
Citizens of Macau,

8
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,780
I am Governor De Solaire.

9
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,740
Over the past two months,

10
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,210
Macau has undergone
unprecedented challenges.

11
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,070
Hundreds of thousands of Macau citizens
and visitors have experienced

12
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:04,830
an unimaginable famine and plague,

13
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,780
even the loss of loved ones,

14
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,360
and other indescribable suffering.

15
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,160
Fortunately, through the concerted efforts
of the General Chamber of Commerce,

16
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,079
charitable organizations,
and caring individuals,

17
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,360
especially the valiant Chinese people

18
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,670
who made sacrifices,

19
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,150
food supplies
have finally arrived in Macau today.

20
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,290
The famine in Macau is over!

21
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,870
Huang Gongjie...

22
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,170
Let's go!

23
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,900
Heinous traitor,

24
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,710
look at you, pulling a long face.

25
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,710
You're not even allowed
to lick the Japanese's boots.

26
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,550
What a wretched lapdog he is!

27
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,460
What are you up to?

28
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,710
You're in Macau,

29
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,210
where laws are in place.

30
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,140
Are you going to trample on the law?

31
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,829
Captain Huang,

32
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:38,980
I left you a present
in the northwest corner

33
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,240
of the warehouse.

34
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,460
Don't forget to go get it.

35
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,120
Guys,

36
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,850
let's go celebrate with drinks.

37
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,210
Let's go!

38
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,579
-Let's go!
-Go.

39
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,340
Get the drinks flowing!

40
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,950
Hey, Master Sanhe.

41
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,290
Master Sanhe, hear me out.

42
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:06,890
Give me a chance

43
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,360
to...

44
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,360
Xian?

45
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,670
Captain Huang?

46
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,390
You finally came.

47
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,810
I almost lost my life.

48
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,760
Rong told you last night

49
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,170
that he wouldn't escort the ships?

50
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,090
Rong said he had something to do.

51
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,290
What else could I say?

52
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,700
Did you carefully review

53
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,620
the shipping documents?

54
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,800
Of course I did.

55
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,430
Since Rong wasn't there,

56
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,700
to be on the safe side,

57
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,670
I conducted the check
with Magistrate Zhao.

58
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,790
Only after he personally confirmed
everything was in order

59
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,930
did I give him the payment and his cut.

60
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,909
Why did Zhao Dinghua

61
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,860
issue a transit permit
for Modaomen Waterway?

62
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,120
I felt reluctant at that time,

63
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,050
being worried that the detour
might cause delays.

64
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,290
But Magistrate Zhao said

65
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,910
Hengmen Waterway had been blocked,

66
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,640
so the ships had to return
via Modaomen Waterway.

67
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,480
What happened next?

68
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,950
Next,
the ships went for Modaomen Waterway.

69
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,670
Because of the sudden route change,

70
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,170
the Japanese officer at the checkpoint

71
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,780
called Magistrate Zhao.

72
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,200
The latter confirmed
everything was fine himself.

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,290
Only then were we allowed to pass through.

74
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,320
What happened after that?

75
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,500
After that,

76
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,300
the ships passed the checkpoint,

77
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,970
and I was suddenly covered with a sack.

78
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,620
I was beaten savagely
without even knowing why.

79
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,200
Finally, the assailants told me

80
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,120
they were from Tai Ho Brotherhood,

81
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,450
and that the grain heist

82
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,550
was their way to teach you a lesson,

83
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,240
Mr. Huang.

84
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,120
To teach me a lesson?

85
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,090
You were in the grip
of Tai Ho Brotherhood.

86
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,780
Could they have easily
let you off the hook?

87
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,200
Let me off the hook?

88
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,260
That guy called Master Huang dragged me
to the edge of the ship,

89
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,800
threatening to throw me into the sea
to feed the fish.

90
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,460
Luckily,
Master Sanhe told him to spare my life,

91
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,590
so I could deliver

92
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,850
a message for them.

93
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,090
A message?

94
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,480
What message?

95
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,670
Well...

96
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,790
Say it.

97
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,100
Captain Huang,

98
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,260
please don't take offense.

99
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,670
Master Sanhe said

100
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,170
this grain heist

101
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,200
was just a minor lesson for you,

102
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,550
and that one day
he'd stab you multiple times

103
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,910
and present your blood
as a sacrificial offering

104
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,440
to some dead man named Fifth Master,

105
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,620
so you'd realize the consequences

106
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,050
of leaving the brotherhood for the enemy

107
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,180
and becoming a traitor to the country.

108
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,650
Here's the reply from Zhongshan:

109
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,700
Zhao Dinghua is nowhere to be found.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,240
A local search for him is underway.

111
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,760
Let's head to Zhongshan.

112
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,409
Yes.

113
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,820
Leader,

114
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,730
Gambler Rong has come back to Macau.

115
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,190
The moment he arrived at the pier,
Fearless Biao took him away.

116
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,470
Chang,

117
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,360
don't worry.

118
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,240
I've prepared a boat.

119
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,910
If an emergency comes up,

120
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,200
I'll immediately evacuate you

121
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,290
and Xian's family from Macau.

122
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,360
Master Sanhe,

123
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,950
I'm not worried about myself.

124
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,070
I'm worried about Xian.

125
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,360
Mr. Huang,

126
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,610
I really am telling the truth.

127
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,500
Alright. Let me sum up your statement.

128
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,380
You met a logjam at about 11 a.m.
in Hengmen.

129
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,790
The waterway was blocked.

130
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,409
You were stuck there for some time,

131
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,930
and finally reached Zhongshan Pier
after 3 p.m.

132
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,650
only to find the grain ships had left.

133
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,680
Is that correct?

134
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,770
According to our plan,

136
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,440
you were supposed
to set off with the ships at 5 a.m.

137
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,300
and pass through Hengmen Waterway
at a bit past 8.

138
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,909
How did that logjam get in your way at 11?

139
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,380
The departure was postponed

140
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,740
by something.

141
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,990
By what?

142
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,530
Well,

143
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:04,730
I...

144
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,430
I can't hear you. Speak up!

145
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,790
I arrived at the pier at 5 a.m. and found

146
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,360
the transit permit had gone missing.

147
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,150
Lyun Coeng insisted
that I complete the full procedure,

148
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,350
which resulted in...

149
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,170
a delay of several hours.

150
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,880
You lost the transit permit too?

151
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,670
Where did you lose it?

152
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,740
I have no idea.

153
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,240
Where did you go
after attaining the permit?

154
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,290
Nowhere!

155
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,320
I went home to sleep.

156
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,650
Did you not tell He Xian
that you wouldn't escort the ships?

157
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,850
No, I didn't say that!

158
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,370
I... received this essential task
from you.

159
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,570
How could I have bailed on it, Mr. Huang?

160
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:39,539
Then what happened?

161
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,600
Then, I tried to call Magistrate Zhao,

162
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,700
but couldn't get through.

163
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,840
I got to the county government
only to find him gone

164
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,930
with an envoy of the Special Higher Police
from Guangzhou.

165
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,220
He was nowhere to be found.

166
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,080
Mr. Huang, I rushed back to inform you

167
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
once I realized the grain
had gone missing.

168
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,630
Is it the whole story?

169
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,390
Yes.

170
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,320
Then how did your hand get injured?

171
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
An accident happened.

172
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,480
An accident?

173
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,790
Let me see it.

174
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,980
Oh, Mr. Huang.

175
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,320
Mr. Huang!

176
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,910
An entire finger was cut off
in an accident?

177
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,030
Explain

178
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,700
what kind of accident that was!

179
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,560
Don't get me started. It was just...

180
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,170
I hung a knife on the wall.

181
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,290
It fell...

182
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
and cut my finger.

183
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,050
They've been talking for some time.

184
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,740
I wonder how it's going.

185
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,000
Was Rong with the ships or...

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,830
Mr. Huang.

187
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,580
Biao,

188
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,450
go to all casinos to find out

189
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,900
if Rong was in any of them yesterday.

190
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,430
Qiu, search Rong's home.

191
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,210
You're suspicious of Rong?

192
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,290
He Xian and Rong told different stories.

193
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,490
Who should I believe?

194
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,800
He Xian's story makes sense,

195
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,410
while Rong's doesn't add up.

196
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,200
Without a thorough investigation,

197
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,670
how will I explain to Agency Chief Sawa?

198
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,270
Off you go.

199
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,320
Yes.

200
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,770
Mommy, when are we moving?

201
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,600
We'll move when Daddy comes back.

202
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,970
But when exactly will Daddy come back?

203
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,000
Be patient.

204
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,580
Daddy will be back soon.

205
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,130
Yes.

206
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,210
Very soon.

207
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,910
He'll be back very soon.

208
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,290
The Special Higher Police in Guangzhou

209
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,890
denied sending anyone here.

210
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,700
That envoy must be

211
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,630
someone from the AJGF in disguise.

212
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,650
Besides,
Zhao Dinghua's stash of money is gone.

213
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,910
It indicates that he fled with his money,

214
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,770
but unfortunately encountered the AJGF
on his way.

215
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,960
Bastards,
did anyone allow you to take photos?

216
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,650
Take the film out of their cameras now.

217
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,820
Do not let a word out
about Zhao Dinghua's murder!

218
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,480
Don't move!

219
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,200
No photos!

220
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,820
Bastards!

221
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,700
-Put your cameras away!
-Put your cameras away!

222
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,550
Lieutenant Sawa, it's too late.

223
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,790
Too late?

224
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,800
What do you mean?

225
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,460
Last night,

226
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,800
the AJGF already executed Magistrate Zhao.

227
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,550
Flyers about it have reached every corner
in Zhongshan County.

228
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,010
Everyone has got the news.

229
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,750
Reporters from multiple newspapers

230
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,440
arrived at the scene before us.

231
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,040
There's no way to conceal this matter
anymore.

232
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,570
Extra! Extra!
Give me one.

233
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:56,630
Okay.

234
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,080
Magistrate of Zhongshan County,
Zhao Dinghua, fled with funds!

235
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,840
Here you are.

236
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,130
He was shot to death by
Commander Ou of Wugui Mountain AJGF!

237
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,050
Extra! Extra!

238
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,100
Magistrate of Zhongshan County,

239
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,700
Zhao Dinghua, fled with funds!

240
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,960
He was shot to death by
Commander Ou of Wugui Mountain AJGF!

241
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,700
Extra! Extra!

242
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,620
Great!

243
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,220
Commander Ou is amazing.

244
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,650
I knew Zhao wouldn't have

245
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,680
told the Japanese on Modaomen Waterway

246
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,840
that he filled out the transit permit
wrong.

247
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,820
With Zhao Dinghua's death,

248
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,010
the only variable is gone.

249
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,010
Xian can extricate himself easily.

250
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,380
As people say,
things will always work themselves out.

[I Leng Temple]

252
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,370
[I Leng Temple]

253
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,260
An urgent message from the Buddha's Hand.

254
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,730
Please take a seat.

255
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,070
May I ask what brings you here?

256
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,020
Answer the phone first.

257
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,370
Hello.

258
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,250
This is Zhao Dinghua.

259
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,460
Wanqi,

260
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,860
it's time to add pressure
to Huang Gongjie.

261
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:49,670
Hello.

262
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,560
This is Mr. Ma.

263
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,740
It's time
the two of you made an appearance.

264
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,440
[A body was found in Shimen Town,
Zhongshan County last night]

265

[Food relief]
[Corn porridge available before the hall]

266
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,870
Zhao Dinghua is dead.

267
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,060
Now,

268
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,170
only the two of you are left
to confront each other.

269
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:13,890
Mr. Huang...

270
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:14,700
Sit down!

271
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,390
It's very obvious.

272
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,960
It was exactly He Xian

273
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,430
who took our grain in collusion
with Tai Ho Brotherhood

274
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,230
and Magistrate Zhao, Mr. Huang.

275
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,480
Why that smirk?

276
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,980
You claim I said
that I wouldn't escort the ships.

277
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,290
When did I ever say it?

278
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,510
Where did I say it?

279
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,820
I found you suspicious at the first place,

280
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,060
so I kept telling Mr. Huang

281
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,410
that you were definitely up to something.

282
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,960
See? I was right, wasn't I?

283
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,630
Tell me,

284
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,550
who else but you would've done it?

285
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,080
Captain Huang, you see Rong as a brother.

286
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,340
I'm sure you believe everything he says.

287
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,480
There's nothing I can say
to change your mind.

288
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,170
Why not just shoot me dead?

289
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,620
Did I say I'd believe him over you?

290
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,170
Just speak your mind.

291
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,560
I can judge for myself

292
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,020
who's loyal and who's not.

293
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,370
Fine.

294
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,170
Then, Rong, I'd like to ask you

295
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,170
three questions.

296
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,650
First,

297
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,670
for helping Captain Huang
cash out his deposits,

298
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,670
Tai Ho Brotherhood regards me
as a thorn in their side.

299
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,100
How would I have possibly
colluded with them?

300
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,790
How would I have possibly
teamed up with them?

301
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,250
Second,

302
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,980
I never had any dealings
with Magistrate Zhao.

303
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,670
How was it possible for me
to concoct

304
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,600
such an elaborate scheme with him?

305
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,100
Well...

306
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:35,910
Third,

307
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,010
you had that transit permit
the entire time.

308
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,750
How could I have

309
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,750
possibly given it to Tai Ho Brotherhood?

310
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,250
Huh?

311
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,880
He's asking you.

312
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,870
I don't know!

313
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,060
It must be you.

314
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,920
I'm sure you planned for all that!

315
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,600
Captain Huang will determine

316
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,370
who planned for all that.

317
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,370
Whether I've betrayed you

318
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,700
and should be killed or not—

319
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,560
Captain Huang,

320
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,910
it's your call.

321
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:17,940
Mr. Huang,

322
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,530
are you seriously suspecting me?

323
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,700
-Mr. Huang.
-Mr. Huang.

324
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,630
We got a finding.

325
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,750
Say it out loud then.

326
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,060
Rong

327
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,390
gambled at Hou Heng till midnight
the day before yesterday.

328
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,650
Did you?

329
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,700
Mr. Huang,

330
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,440
I couldn't resist

331
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,670
the urge to gamble.

332
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,530
I won't gamble anymore,

333
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,170
Mr. Huang.

334
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,060
I really am innocent
of all that happened afterwards.

335
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,930
For switching to your side,

336
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,820
Tai Ho Brotherhood has labeled me
a traitor who deserves to die.

337
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,050
By no means

338
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,380
would I have got involved with them again!

339
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,340
Qiu, don't you think so?

340
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,720
Are you really innocent, Rong?

341
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,900
Care to explain what this is?

342
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,760
Mr. Huang, we found this at his place.

[Oath by Chen Jiarong]

Mr. Huang...

345
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,170
I was wondering

346
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,700
how that transit permit

347
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,780
ended up in Huang Sanhe's hands.

348
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,570
It was all your doing,
you backstabbing hunk of junk!

349
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,170
Mr. Huang!

350
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,830
Mr. Huang,

351
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,840
I can explain this blood oath.

352
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,930
That day...

353
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,560
I lost a lot of money, Mr. Huang.

354
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,090
Huang Sanhe forced me

355
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,810
to write this damn thing,

356
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,570
or he wouldn't set me free, Mr. Huang!

357
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,830
I... I was just lying to them.

358
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,020
None of this means anything!

359
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,570
Mr. Huang, I...

360
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,180
A blood oath doesn't mean anything.

361
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,870
What can be a more solemn vow than that?

362
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:56,940
Mr. Huang!

363
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:58,520
No!

364
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,980
I really didn't betray you!

365
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,740
I would never ever betray you!

366
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,410
I really, really didn't betray you.

367
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,280
I really didn't.

368
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,700
Mr. Huang,
we got a call from Agency Chief Sawa.

369
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,260
He has arrived at Gongbei Port.

370

He'd like to see you in his office
in an hour

371
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,370
to hear the investigation results.

372
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,630
He sounded very angry.

373
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,000
Mr. Huang, take me with you.

374
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,940
I'll explain to him.

375
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,980
I'll tell him the fault is all mine,

376
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,940
and that you're innocent.

377
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,780
Mr. Huang, I'll take the blame, okay?

378
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,040
I'll take the blame.

379
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,110
After smearing my name,

380
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,780
now you're looking to smear

381
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,940
Captain Huang's name in the Imperial Army?

382
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,740
Rong,

383
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,540
all Captain Huang did
was charge higher prices

384
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,870
for the grain
without telling the Imperial Army.

385
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,260
He did give you a share of the profits.

386
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,320
How can you do this?

387
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,570
Do you have to frame your captain
so as to survive?

388
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,670
You're talking nonsense! Nonsense!

389
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,870
That's not what I mean.

390
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,200
Mr. Huang, please believe me.

391
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,720
I would never betray you.

392
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,280
Mr. Huang, he's slandering...

393
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,870
Rong...

394
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,780
may you rest in peace.

395
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,410
Mr. Huang,

396
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,680
two men downstairs

397
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,590
looking all pompous

398
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,790
are asking to see you.

399
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,170
Who are they?

400
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,540
One is surnamed Fu,

401
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,610
and the other Cui.

402
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,810
They say they're here to collect a debt.

403
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,520
Is he really sick

404
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,830
or just avoiding us?

405
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,540
Mr. Fu, don't get it wrong.

406
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,260
Captain Huang is genuinely sick.

407
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,740
Besides,
you signed that contract with He Xian.

408
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,410
You should ask him for a refund instead.

409
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,260
Enough!

410
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,610
Everyone knows

411
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,720
the grain from Zhongshan was seized
by Captain Huang.

412
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,590
He Xian is just a middleman.

413
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,370
Now, the goods haven't been delivered,

414
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,760
and He Xian has disappeared.

415
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,330
We have to talk to Captain Huang,

416
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,460
the real seller of the goods, don't we?

417
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,910
Please have some tea and calm down.

418
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,810
Anyway, go and tell Huang Gongjie

419
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,450
that he must return the money today.

420
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,660
The court will

421
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,740
definitely deem
the consignment he signed in person

422
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,930
valid.

423
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:43,480
Goodbye.

424
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
Oh, Mr. Fu!

425
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,610
Mr. Fu,

426
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,830
please don't be mad.

427
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,410
Brother Xian,

428
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,980
since you were the one who engaged

429
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,720
Fu and Cui in this deal,

430
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,020
I may have to trouble you
to clean up the mess.

431
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,040
They're demanding a refund now.

432
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,700
What can I possibly give them?

433
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,100
Can't you see what's happening?

434
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,110
Tai Ho Brotherhood stole the grain

435
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,410
for the General Chamber of Commerce.

436
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:28,930
Do you believe

437
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,740
the brotherhood and the chamber

438
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,970
aren't in cahoots?

439
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,570
Be that as it may,

440
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,940
what can I do

441
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,810
if they deny it?

442
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,570
Then I'll have to
bring everyone down with me.

443
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,170
What do you mean?

444
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,150
If this whole thing blows up,

445
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,970
I'll have some others
take the fall with me.

446
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,940
This is what I'll say—

447
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,520
this crafty plot

448
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,740
was orchestrated by Rong,

449
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:01,570
Cui, Fu, and Tai Ho Brotherhood.

450
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,940
Let's see

451
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,720
how the Japanese will deal with them.

452
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,770
We'll have to take a shot then.

453
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,210
Now, I'll go talk to Fu and Cui

454
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,610
about what's at stake

455
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,600
and try to put an end to all this.

456
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,170
However,

457
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,610
we must give that promissory note
back to them.

458
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,740
Let's consider it this way—

459
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,440
the general chamber just spent 6 million

460
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,300
on 10 million kilograms of grain.

461
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,390
It's not a bad deal.

462
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,520
Okay.

463
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,220
Besides the contract,

464
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,230
make sure
you bring the consignment I signed

465
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,020
back to me.

466
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,670
Please.

467
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,000
I understand.

468
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,640
[Hou Heng Casino]

469
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,980
How did it go?

470
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,200
I begged and begged.

471
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,400
This is finally done.

472
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,570
Hurry.

473
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,660
To the Sawa Agency.

474
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,700
Xian,

475
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,370
while we're on the way,

476
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:14,830
let me tell you two things.

477
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,030
Do memorize my words.

478
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,630
What are they?

479
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,410
First,

480
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,370
I sold the grain to you

481
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,560
at 12 avos per kilogram.

482
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,070
When you meet Lieutenant Sawa,

483
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,250
don't say it wrong.

484
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,440
Got it.

485
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,780
The second thing is even more important.

486
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,740
This whole mess

487
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,780
was simply caused
by the magistrate of Zhongshan County,

488
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,870
Zhao Dinghua, and Tai Ho Brotherhood

489
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,020
in collusion.

490
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,830
The Special Ops was not involved at all.

491
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,200
As for Rong,

492
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,330
I executed him because he lost

493
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,910
the transit permit.

494
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,930
But Gambler Rong was the one
colluding with Tai Ho Brotherhood.

495
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,610
Xian, in this matter,

496
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,630
Rong cannot be connected
to Tai Ho Brotherhood

497
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,000
in any way.

498
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,230
Captain Huang, are you saying

499
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,070
that the Special Ops was negligent,

500
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,610
but never had a mole?

501
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,040
That's right.

502
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,570
When we talk to Agency Chief Sawa later,

503
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,780
shift all the blame

504
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,330
to Zhao Dinghua.

505
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,910
Tell the chief you just did the legwork,

506
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,370
and that you know nothing.

507
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,280
I'll take care of the rest.

508
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,740
Okay. I got it.

509
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,140
Where is my consignment of grain sales?

510
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,170
Isn't it along with the contract?

511
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,780
No. Look.

512
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,070
See for yourself.

513
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,070
I remember taking it
from Mr. Fu and Mr. Cui.

514
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,680
Perhaps I accidentally left it somewhere.

515
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,240
Xian,

516
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,610
what do you mean by this?

517
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,570
Nothing.

518
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,030
Captain Huang,

519
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,650
isn't Agency Chief Sawa
still waiting for us?

520
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,040
I need to testify for you first, don't I?

521
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,310
As for the consignment,

522
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,030
I ensure you
I will carefully search for it.

523
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,130
But as you know, the more one rushes,

524
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,700
the harder it is to find an item.

525
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,780
If one stays patient,

526
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,670
maybe someday,

527
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,470
that item will pop up somewhere.

528
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,040
Impressive.

529
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,610
You're good, Brother Xian.

530
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,460
Just make sure it doesn't pop up

531
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,030
where it shouldn't be.

532
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,330
Rest assured.

533
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,060
As long as I am safe and sound,

534
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,410
the consignment

535
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,680
won't appear where it shouldn't be.

536
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,860
Do you know...

537
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,240
who on earth killed Zhao Dinghua?

538
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,340
I have no idea at all.

539
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,390
I don't know

540
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,120
what exactly happened either.

541
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,830
Chief, please believe me.

542
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,760
It never occurred to me

543
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,960
that Zhao Dinghua

544
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,130
would collude with Tai Ho Brotherhood.

545
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,180
Besides, I did only charge 12 avos

546
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,590
for each kilogram of grain.

547
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,110
This is Empresa Commercial Lyun Coeng's
fright manifest for this week.

548
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,370
And this is...

549
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,630
Chief.

550
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,570
About Gambler Rong,

551
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,570
I shot him dead with my own hands.

552
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,030
He was like a brother to me.

553
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,280
But h-he was too...

554
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:14,980
Who did it?

555
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,000
I really don't know.

556
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,770
Who did it?

557
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,370
Who did it?

558
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,310
This is...

559
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,570
the shipping receipt.

560
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,610
The cargo declaration.

561
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,480
These are...

562
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,180
Shipping receipts
from the trading company.

563
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:41,030
Here are the statements
of the persons involved...

564
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,870
for your review.

565
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,830
What's the point?

566
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,560
They're all trying to steer clear.

567
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,540
How did Zhao Dinghua die?

568
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,070
Why would the Communist Party's AJGF

569
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:58,460
in Zhongshan suddenly show up?

570
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,200
And that Gambler Rong...

571
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,370
He got executed for failing a task?

572
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,520
What exactly is Huang Gongjie hiding?

573
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:10,830
Ten million kilograms of grain
were stolen for sale.

574
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,150
And a dead man
is the one and only person to blame.

575
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,420
Could that be possible?

576
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,170
Go on with the investigation!

577
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,460
Find out the truth.
Leave no leniency for the culprit!

578
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,280
What?

579
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,910
I just sent you a telegram about the plans

580
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,760
for the grain shipped to Macau.

581
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,280
Yes, got it.

582
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,000
General...

583
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,590
Don't cause any trouble
before you're promoted to colonel.

584
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,000
Follow the instructions in the telegram.

585
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,270
Yes.

586
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,010
I will act on your guidance, General.

587
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,670
Mr. He,

588
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,530

589
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,090
Mr. He.

590
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,670
Read through this interview record.

591
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,130
Sign it if you find it correct.

592
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,370
Is it the record of my interview?

593
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,700
Why?

594
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,760
Can't you remember what you just said?

595
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,590
It's okay.

596
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,500
Let me sum it up for you.

597
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,840
As a compassionate response

598
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,260
to the hardships faced by Macau,

599
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,570
the Japanese Imperial Army

600
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,500
specially authorized you, Mr. He,
to procure grain from Zhongshan

601
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,760
on behalf of

602
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,960
the Macau General Chamber of Commerce.

603
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Mr. He,

604
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:30,130
you then successfully
brought grain to Macau,

605
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,350
and thus saved hundreds of

606
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,130
thousands of starving people.

607
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,000
Mr. He,

608
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,240
the above is your truthful statement.

609
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,240
The Imperial Army
has confirmed its authenticity.

610
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,000
Do you...

611
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,220
have any problems with it?

612
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,430
I have no problem

613
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,030
with this interview record.

614
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,130
I'll sign it now.

615
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:56,850
Good.

616
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,930

Not bad. It looks good.

time to have dinner.

-Okay.
-Yes.

Hurry up.

Alright.

636
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,740
Come on, time for dinner.

637
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,390
Mrs. He, you're such a great cook.

638
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,760
Look what a feast you've made.

639
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,370
Mrs. He, what soup is it?

640
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,740
Pork bone soup with watercress,
dried tangerine pill, and carrots.

641
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,180
It's perfect for this season,

642
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,280
as it's good for the throat and lungs.

643
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,390
I must learn to make it then.

644
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,750
Wanqi has been coughing a lot lately.

645
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,000
He needs to have more of this soup.

646
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,120
Mrs. He, teach me later, will you?

647
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,940
Sure.

648
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,060

we're not just here

666
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,020
for this housewarming party.

00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:54,540
Let me fill your cup.

671
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:04,660
Xian...

672
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,720
The banking industry

673
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,640
in Macau used to be

674
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,640
dominated by BNU.

675
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,980
Although Chinese merchants
also operated banks,

676
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,430
they all worked independently

677
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,140
and couldn't make a real difference.

678
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:15,800
Therefore,

679
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,330
after consultations,
some Chinese merchants have agreed

680
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,290
to partner with us

681
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,650
to establish Macau's

682
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,410
first joint-venture bank
founded on Chinese capital.

683
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,610
called Tai Fung Bank,

684
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,010
located on Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro,

685
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,870
next to Macau's future financial exchange.

686
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,140
Xian,

687
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:34,690
apart from

688
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,750
attending this housewarming party,

689
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,120
the shareholders

690
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,870
also gave me an important task.

691
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,920
Xian, please invest in the bank

692
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,520
and take the position of general manager.

693
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,520
Me?

694
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,870
No, no.

695
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,660
Mr. Ma,

696
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,920
how is it appropriate?

697
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:55,190
You ran banks before.

698
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,830
Given your competence,

699
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,370
how is it not an appropriate proposal?

700
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,510
Perfect. It's the perfect job for you.

701
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,870
This is terrific.

702
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,270
I'll drink to that first.

704
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,590
I also think you're most suited for it.

705
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,710
We all hope
you can be an investor of Tai Fung Bank.

706
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,560
Let's reshape
the financial landscape of Macau.

707
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,830
That's right, Xian.

708
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,050
But right now,

709
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,370
I can't offer much money,

710
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,560
and I haven't gathered enough experience.

711
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,620
I'm far from being qualified

712
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,210
for the position of general manager.

713
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:22,870
Why not

714
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,310
let me work as a regular clerk?

00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,790
I promise

718
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,190
I'll do my absolute best.

719
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,460

720
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,210

00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,020
what matters

723
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,880
is that Xian has agreed to join us.

725
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:37,290

Miss Qiao?

749
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:18,870
I have a name.

750
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,770
Just call me Yinwan.

751
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,250
Okay.

752
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,060
Then stop calling me Mr. He too.

753
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,910
From now on,

754
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,210
just call me Xian.

755
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,060
Xian.

756
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,210
Yinwan,

757
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,580
I've heard
that you're going be a music teacher

758
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,940
at Kiang Wu Elementary School.

759
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,370
Yes.

760
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,390
Previously, when I took Yu there

761
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,520
for enrollment,

762
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,930
I noticed
that the school needed a music teacher.

763
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,960
So I decided to try applying for the job.

764
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,120
That way, I can spend more time with Yu.

765
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,790
When will you start working there?

766
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,250
In the next couple of days.

767
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,750
Principal Liang has prepared
a dormitory for me.

768
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,230
I'll set out for it

769
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,430
once I finish moving.

770
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,250
Qiwen and I will come help

771
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,510
and visit Yu then.

772
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,800
Sounds great.

773
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:04,310
Let's stop here.

774
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,440
This is where I live.

775
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,290
Go in then. I'll take off.

776
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,160
Okay.

777
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:19,600
Wanqi.

778
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,890
A gentleman's here to see you.

779
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,330
Zhengping!

780
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,100
Mr. Ma.

781
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,100
Zhengping.

782
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,890
Come on.

783
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,560
Take a seat.

784
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,290
Zhengping,

785
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,160
what's there to transport this time?

786
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:36,960
How can I help?

787
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,230
It's not that.

788
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,500
I came here

789
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,910
to thank you in person

790
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,650
for lending me a helping hand.

791
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,940
Don't mention it.

792
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,250
Dr. Ke is a good friend of mine,

793
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,580
and you're his brother.

794
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,120
It was my pleasure to help.

795
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,620
Thank you.

796
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,500
I also want to express gratitude to you
on behalf of those

797
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
who have received the supplies, Mr. Ma.

798
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,030
As a token

799
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,210
of appreciation,

800
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:05,790
allow me to toast you with tea

801
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,720
instead of wine.

802
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,330
Zhengping,

803
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,050
if you're serious about this,

804
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,720
let's go for the real stuff.

805
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,440
Mr. Ma,

806
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,850
I'll drink up to show respect.

807
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:17,790
Zhengping,

808
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,410
though it's been a short time
since we met,

809
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,140
after seeing what you've done,

810
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,850
I, Ma Wanqi,
have considered you a true friend.

811
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,580
-Cheers.
-Being friends with you

812
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,180
is a true honor for me, Mr. Ma.

813
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,670
This is to you, Zhengping.

814
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,890
Any plans for the future, Zhengping?

815
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,140
I'll go back to Hong Kong

816
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,200
to run my pharmacy.

817
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,500
I know I shouldn't be nosy

818
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,970
about certain things.

819
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,370
But I do think

820
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,960
you can follow Mr. Lu Xun's example,

821
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,160
who abandoned medicine for literature.

822
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,020
You can switch from medicine to business.

823
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,830
Business?

824
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,020
I'm just an ordinary pharmacist.

825
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,610
Why should I do business?

826
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,530
Perhaps you can save more people

827
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,690
in a new role.

828
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,080
You'd love to save lives,

829
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,480
while I have connections in business.

830
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,160
Mr. Ma, you're saying...

831
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,630
That we can be partners

832
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,270
and do business openly.

833
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,350
Zhengping,

834
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,420
give some

835
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,500
serious thinking to my advice.

836
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,600
Today,

837
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,590
let's get drunk.

838
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,360
Let's get drunk.

839
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:32,890
Cheers.

840
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,350
Xian, have some tea.

841
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,500
Why the formalities?

842
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,000
Just a gesture of gratitude.

843
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,750
If it hadn't been for your reminder,

844
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,960
I would have got in serious trouble

845
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,160
during the previous shipping of grain.

846
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,790
You were safe at last
because you're meticulous

847
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,020
and adherent to the rules.

848
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,940
No one could catch you
doing anything wrong.

849
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,440
Still, it all thanks to your warnings
beforehand.

850
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,890
Otherwise,
those in Sawa Agency might hold Lyun Coeng

851
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,250
accountable for the theft of the grain

852
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,250
from Zhongshan,

853
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,850
and I wouldn't be able
to prove my innocence.

854
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,520
So,

855
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,190
I must thank you, Xian.

856
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,100
Xian,

857
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,770
I have a question,
but I'm not sure if I should ask it.

858
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,410
Ask away.

859
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,690
When the transit permit was issued,

860
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,460
you asked me

861
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,810
what would happen if it went missing.

862
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,620
It did go missing in the end—
was it a coincidence,

863
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,550
or did you just foresee the future?

864
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,830
Hongshen,

865
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,790
you once said to me

866
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,870
that though you're of mixed heritage

867
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,560
the He family regard
where your great-grandmother came from,

868
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,140
namely Bao'an, Guangdong,
as your ancestral home.

869
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,460
In other words,

870
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:42,830
the He family,

871
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,870
including you, He Hongshen,

872
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,060
are all Chinese.

873
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:51,710
Yes.

874
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:54,790
I ran off the topic.

875
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,480
Sorry.

876
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,690
What were you asking just now?

877
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:58,750
I've forgotten it.

878
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:03,980
So have I.

879
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,000
I have such a poor memory.

880
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,370
The matter was just over,

881
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:09,100
and I've already put it behind.

882
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,160
Anyway,

883
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,910
hundreds of thousands of people
in Macau have been saved.

884
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,110
That's what matters.

885
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,460
Mr. Huang, anything wrong?

886
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,080
I think I just saw

887
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,830
the foreign girl
who tipped off the British army.

888
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,520
How come she's gone so fast?

889
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:56,770
Wait.
