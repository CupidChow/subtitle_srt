00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,920
Who's there?

5
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,890
It's from the inner harbor pier.

6
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,860
Something's up. Assemble quickly!

7
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,790
Fire!

8
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,430
Get on the ship!

9
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:40,960
Let's go!

10
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,990
Follow me to the roof!

11
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:19,750
Go!

12
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,980
Mr. Huang,

13
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,540
we've captured all the crew members.

14
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,340
Lock them all in the bottom hold.

15
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,810
Tell our men to hurry up.

16
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,740
Start the engine and raise anchor!

17
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,630

18
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,800

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,710
Inspector General Gonçalves!

21
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,280
You arrived at the right time!

22
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,380
A group of bandits
just hijacked this ship.

23
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,630
I, Agency Chief Sawa, acted bravely

24
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,530
and opened fire on the perpetrators.

25
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,370
With so many police officers injured,

26
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,800
you call this fighting perpetrators?

27
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,280
Absolute nonsense!

28
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,770
Believe it or not.

29
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,950
It's getting late.

30
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,750
I've got to go.

31
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,310
Stop! Don't move!

32
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,710
Alas...

33
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,250
Inspector General Gonçalves,

34
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,690
you seem to have forgotten something.

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,030
My official position is

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,400
the military attaché
at the Japanese Consulate in Macau.

37
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,880
I have official diplomatic status

38
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,560
and diplomatic immunity.

39
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,930

None of our calls is getting through.

43
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,330
Check each body carefully

44
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,850
to confirm if there are any signs of life.

45
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,680
Once you spot any,
begin resuscitation immediately.

46
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,560
Prepare extra plasma, gauze,
and hemostats.

47
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,000
If we're short-staffed, call immediately

48
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,159
and have the hospital send more staff.

49
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,680
Remember, you must check each body.

Dr. Ke,

52
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,730
what happened?

53
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,060
You may ask them.

54
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,380
Mr. Rodrigues,

55
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,380
Mr. Lok Pak,

56
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,510
where is the Steamship Sai On?

57
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,080
So you still

58
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,430
carried out the SS Sai On Plan.

59
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,070
How can you still have an appetite
at a time like this?

60
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,270
After a night of hustle,

61
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,820
I can handle this much food.

62
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,540
Sawa!

63
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,090
Do you even know

64
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,520
how much trouble
you've stirred up tonight?

65
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,450
Armed hijacking of the ship,

66
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,100
bombing the telephone exchange,

67
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,000
and even

68
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,490
shooting Portuguese police officers
with machine guns.

69
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,900
What exactly are you trying to do?

70
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,620
What am I trying to do?

71
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,040
Obviously,

72
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,730
I want to grab the Steamship Sai On.

73
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,310
If you wanted SS Sai On,

74
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,570
you could have just handed it to the Navy.

75
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,460
Was it really necessary to resort to force

76
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,940
and create such a bloody scene?

77
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,630
Man...

78
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,400
Listen carefully.

79
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,600
If we let the Navy intercept it at sea,

80
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,800
could we have caught
those who smuggled diesel

81
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,010
or discovered the hideout

82
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,610
where the Tai Ho Brotherhood
concealed tungsten ore?

83
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,309
Tell me.

84
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,789
Could we?

85
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,570
Only through a surprise attack in Macau

86
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,460
can we prevent our rivals

87
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,860
from destroying intelligence
about the delivery location.

88
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,610
This way, we can track down
that massive tungsten ore shipment

89
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,510
and eliminate the Tai Ho Brotherhood
in one stroke.

90
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,030
Once we catch them red-handed
on both ends,

91
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,410
the Portuguese Macau government's breach
of neutrality

92
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,120
and support for anti-Japanese activities
will be irrefutable.

93
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,340
We can also use this to expose

94
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,870
the entire underground supply line
in Macau.

95
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,870
But

96
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,010
now that things have
escalated to this point,

97
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,010
if the Portuguese Macau government
starts investigating,

98
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,940
how do you plan
to get out of this trouble?

99
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,680
The ones in trouble now are not us,

100
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,340
but the Portuguese Macau government

101
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
and those anti-Japanese elements.

102
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,120
They're completely overwhelmed
by the problems right now,

103
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:35,600
panicking like ants on a hot pan.

104
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,480
How is it going?

105
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,820
We've finished checking.

106
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,440
Among all of our men
who transported diesel,

107
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,900
only a man called Water Ghost

108
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,670
went to see a doctor

109
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,070
and hasn't returned yet.

110
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,670
Dr. Ke was right.

111
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,820
There really is a mole.

112
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,120
No wonder the timing was so spot-on,

113
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,790
and the hijacking of the ship
took place so smoothly.

114
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,360
The problem now is that Mr. Liang,

115
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,000
who was responsible
for navigation, is on the ship.

116
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,970
I suspect that they've already learned
the information about our men

117
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,430
and the rendezvous point.

118
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,890
And that Water Ghost knows

119
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,120
the complete communication system

120
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,450
of the Tai Ho Brotherhood's flag signals.

121
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,910
So that means

122
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,420
if the Steamship Sai On continues
to sail for the rendezvous point,

123
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,480
Master Sanhe and his men
won't notice the danger.

124
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,790
Instead, they will lead the enemy

125
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,700
to the actual tungsten ore handover site?

126
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,370
Exactly.

127
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,940
Why did the Steamship Sai On

128
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,980
depart a full 7 hours ahead of schedule?

129
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,870
I suspect that it was

130
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,870
because the Japanese wanted enough time
to send troops aboard.

131
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,860
If I were the Japanese,

132
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,650
I'd definitely notify those in Zhongshan
to organize forces

133
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,780
and set up an ambush.

134
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,390
Xiao Feng and I searched all over Macau.

135
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,510
Every telephone and telegraph office

136
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,000
has been destroyed by the Japanese.

137
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,100
My radio contact with Captain Ou is

138
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,250
scheduled once every 3 days.

139
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,320
The next contact is the day after tomorrow
in the afternoon.

140
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:51,770
So,

141
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
in just a few hours,

142
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,030
Master Sanhe and that shipment

143
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,740
of tungsten ore
will face a complete disaster.

144
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,700
We need to quickly find a way

145
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,870
to send someone to notify Master Sanhe.

146
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,620
No need.

147
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,770
After learning
about the Steamship Sai On's incident,

148
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,120
Zhengping already left overnight

149
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,870
to find the guerrillas in Zhongshan.

150
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,400
I hope it's not too late.

151
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,050
The Portuguese Macau government
probably won't get away with this.

152
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:45,800
Yes.

153
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,610
Rodrigues, the guarantor
for the ship rental, got

154
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,740
the transit permit issued
by the Portuguese Macau government.

155
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,370
And the diesel was

156
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,350
exchanged for tungsten ore
for the rear area.

157
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,950
What do you think this means?

158
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
This is already openly

159
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,220
supporting the Allied Forces
and China's resistance against Japan.

160
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,480
If the Japanese use this as an excuse
to send troops to Macau,

161
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,640
we won't be able
to hold this position in Macau,

162
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,170
and the entire supply line
will be destroyed.

163
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,890
Now that things have come to this point,

164
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,440
I've got to take full responsibility

165
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,220
for the Steamship Sai On.

166
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,920
Mr. Rodrigues...

167
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,790
I'm the registered merchant,

168
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,030
and I signed the ship rental guarantee.

169
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,100
I can't escape the charge of smuggling

170
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,360
strategic resources anyway,

171
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,740
so there's no need to drag the government

172
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,340
and all of Macau down with me.

173
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,560
How about this?

174
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,500
Just claim that the government
knew nothing about it,

175
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500
and it was me who tricked you
into issuing the navigation permit.

176
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,910
But you're the most influential
Portuguese merchant in Macau.

177
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,500
This way, not only will you be done for,

178
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,150
but the Japanese will also not believe

179
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,940
that the government wasn't involved.

180
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,370
There's no other way.

181
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,770
The rest depends on the government's luck.

182
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,750
Rodrigues,

183
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,340
where are you going?

184
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,160
After today,

185
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,960
I'll be a major smuggling criminal
to the Japanese.

186
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,360
You should at least allow me to go home

187
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,090
to settle my business
and family affairs, right?

188
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,490
Comrade Ke Zhengping?

189
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,020
What's happening, Comrade Zhengping?

190
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,680
There's...

191
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,210
There's trouble.

192
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,790
Mr. He?

193
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,270
Mr. Lok Pak,

194
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,070
you have all the declaration documents

195
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,870
for the Steamship Sai On, right?

196
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,700
Rifang,

197
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,670
go report the situation
to Captain Ou immediately.

198
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,400
Understood.

199
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,730
Di, let's go to Willow Bay.

200
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,030
The tungsten ore is hidden there.

201
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,690
So Master Sanhe must be there.

202
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,230
Yes.

203
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,570
I'll go with you.

204
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,860
Comrade Ke Zhengping,

205
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,080
you need to rest now.

206
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,620
And your identity
must remain confidential.

207
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,860
Leave everything to me.

208
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,400
Let's go.

209
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,400
Have the Japanese
seen this guarantee letter?

210
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,100
No.

211
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,960
Guarantee letters are

212
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,320
only issued to the government

213
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,240
for renting public vessels.

214
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:35,100
When the government requests passage
from the Japanese Naval Defense,

215
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,760
there's no need to submit
these internal documents.

216
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,790
So that means

217
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,300
the Japanese don't know
who the merchant is,

218
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,930
or who guaranteed the ship rental?

219
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:44,390
That's right, they don't.

220
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,410
Mr. He,

221
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,700
what are you doing?

222
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,560
Prepare a blank guarantee letter
right away.

223
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,890
We'll fill out a new one.

224
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,510
Xian, what brings you here
to see me so urgently?

225
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,230
Good news.

226
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,170
Would you like to make a big fortune?

227
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,710
Who wouldn't want to?

228
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,890
What? Did you get
a business opportunity for me, Xian?

229
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,280
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

230
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,320
After it's done,

231
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,820
I promise you'll make a fortune.

232
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,860
What favor?

233
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,740
You should be quite familiar
with Wang Qizheng

234
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,410
from the Great Chinese Union, right?

235
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,850
His company belongs

236
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,740
to the Wang puppet government.

237
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,630
And yes, they do a lot of business
with Lyun Coeng.

238
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,430
Then if you leak some news to him,

239
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,090
he will believe you, right?

240
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,500
It depends on what kind of news.

241
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,480
Good news.

242
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,330
What did he say?

243
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,710
"Dock ahead. Load the cargo."

244
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,390
Huang Sanhe,

245
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,880
you have nowhere to escape this time.

246
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,360
Qiu, notify County Magistrate Lin

247
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:52,790
to move.

248
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,530
Got it!

249
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,140
Everyone, get ready!

250
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:01,770
Guys!

251
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,480
Time to get to work!

252
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,849
Guys! Load the tungsten ore!

253
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,750
Haishan,

254
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,240
it's the Tai Ho Brotherhood.

255
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,640
They're all surrounded. What should we do?

256
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,200
Guys,

257
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,630
move quickly!

258
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,380
Hurry up!

259
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,400
Master Sanhe!

260
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,530
It's a trap! Run!

261
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,510
Oh, no. We are exposed.

262
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,540
Attack!

263
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,290
Guys!

264
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:42,880
Charge!

265
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,990
Guys!

266
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,620
Grab your weapons!

267
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,850
That woman is a Communist.

268
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,620
She's the one who came
to our place for contact.

269
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,950
I-I've seen her before.

270
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:54,780
Master Sanhe,

271
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,550
retreat now!

272
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,960
Haishan!

273
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,500
Di!

274
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,670
Di...

275
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,460
Run!

276
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,250
I'll take you with me.

277
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:26,970
Hurry!

278
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,120
Di!

279
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,640
I'll take you away, okay?

280
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,740
I'll take you away.

281
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,290
Go after them!

282
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,820
Get off the ship and pursue!

283
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,640
Move forward!

284
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,430
Turn the cannons!

285
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,530
Let's go!

286
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,540
Check if there are any survivors!

287
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,200
Okay!

288
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,960
Understood!

289
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,640
Haishan,

290
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,990
you're wounded.

291
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,170
Let's go.

292
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:54,970
Let's go.

293
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,660
Chase them along the road!

294
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,330
Keep up!

295
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,550
General Manager,

296
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,580
you have a guest.

297
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,120
Hongshen?

298
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,640
Come on, take a seat.

299
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,200
Sorry, Xian.

300
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,170
I'm not the one who wants to see you.

301
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,010
I brought you another guest.

302
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:43,780
Mr. He,

303
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:44,600
hello.

304
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,370
Mr. Wang?

305
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,010
[Tai Fung Bank]

306
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,730
What diesel fuel?

307
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,780
I'm sorry, Mr. Wang.

308
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,220
I don't have any.

309
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,610
Well, Mr. He,

310
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,180
please stop hiding it from me.

311
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,280
Manager He has already told me everything.

312
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,090
You helped Rodrigues

313
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,400
get a big loan from Tai Fung Bank

314
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,470
to import an entire ship of diesel fuel,

315
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,000
right?

316
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,440
But unfortunately,

317
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,510
he encountered
the Portuguese-Japanese joint inspection.

318
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,330
He had no choice

319
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,180
but to dump this hot potato back on you

320
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,460
to settle the payment.

321
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,970
But you should know

322
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,450
that currently,

323
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,280
diesel is a strategic resource,

324
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,250
and it's already past
the declaration deadline.

325
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,500
Now, you can neither sell your goods

326
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,750
nor repay the loan.

327
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,890
And you're facing the charge

328
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,600
of concealing strategic resources
every day.

329
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,030
You're between a rock and a hard place.

330
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,200
Am I right?

331
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,890
He Hongshen,

332
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,780
what do you mean by this?

333
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,130
I asked to borrow money from you.
It's fine that you turned me down.

334
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,530
But why did you betray me?

335
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,180
Xian, don't get worked up.

336
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,900
Look.

337
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,660
You wanted to borrow money
from my father-in-law

338
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,090
to temporarily cover the shortfall
in Tai Fung Bank's accounts.

339
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,330
But I simply couldn't get

340
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,810
such a large sum of money for you.

341
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,250
I suggested you sell the goods
to cover the payment,

342
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,050
but you refused
because Lyun Coeng is Japanese-owned.

343
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,930
So I had to find you another buyer.

344
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,130
Mr. Wang's Great Chinese Union is
at least Chinese-owned.

345
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,930
His so-called Chinese-owned firm is
no different from Japanese-funded ones.

346
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,110
Let's put aside
whether there's a difference.

347
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,340
Mr. He, let me ask you just one thing.

348
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,750
Right now,

349
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,550
in Macau,

350
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,950
can you find any company

351
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,940
that isn't openly Japanese-owned

352
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,820
but still dares to take

353
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,630
your undeclared strategic resources?

354
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,760
Apart from my Great Chinese Union,

355
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,450
can you find another one?

356
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,790
I'm sorry, Mr. Wang.

357
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,980
You should know very well
what kind of person I am.

358
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,490
I would rather dump
all this diesel into Lingding Channel

359
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,730
than sell it to you.

360
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,440
Fine.

361
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,630
Quite a tough one.

362
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,110
Then I'd like to see

363
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,950
if you, Mr. He, really can stick it out.

364
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,300
General Manager.

365
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,010
What's wrong?

366
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,760
Mr. Fu and all the shareholders
have suddenly arrived, asking

367
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,850
to hold a shareholders' meeting
to audit the accounts.

368
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,250
They're all in the VIP room now,

369
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,650
waiting for you to reconcile the accounts.

370
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:24,680
He Hongshen,

371
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,470
how much commission
did Wang Qizheng give you

372
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,100
to have you set me up like this?

373
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,630
You've really got me wrong,

374
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,380
Xian,

375
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,900
I only told Mr. Wang

376
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,380
about your accounting shortfall.

377
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,740
I promise I did not leak any information

378
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,400
to Tai Fung Bank's directors.

379
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,050
Mr. Wang, it was you
who notified Tai Fung Bank's shareholders,

380
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:48,750
right?

381
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,830
Yes.

382
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,020
Right after you told me this information,

383
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,490
I immediately sent someone

384
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,090
to inform
all of Tai Fung Bank's shareholders.

385
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,240
I think He Xian is

386
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,060
just a general manager.

387
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,220
Without any authorization
from all shareholders,

388
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,510
he arbitrarily loaned out such a large sum

389
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,970
and cannot pay it back now.

390
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,900
I think

391
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,000
their shareholders should
have the right to know.

392
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,700
But aren't you forcing Xian
into a corner this way?

393
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,840
So what?

394
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,300
You know what kind of person he is.

395
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,830
If I don't force him into a corner,

396
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,690
would he possibly be willing
to do business with me?

397
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,200
But anyway,

398
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,070
Manager He,

399
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,900
when you sold me this information,

400
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,900
didn't you also
take a full 10% commission?

401
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,220
Well, let me tell you.

402
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,440
In business,

403
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,790
sometimes if you want to make money,

404
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,000
you have to set aside

405
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,270
your conscience.

406
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,580
General Manager He,

407
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,640
we're waiting for your report.

408
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,180
Please rest assured, directors.

409
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,180
By the end of today,

410
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,910
I will definitely sort out these accounts

411
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,710
and give you all an explanation.

412
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,880
H-How is she,

413
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,930
Comrade Zhengping?

414
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,620
The bullet is still lodged in her body.

415
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,150
She needs surgery immediately,

416
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:32,950
otherwise...

417
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:36,830
There's no other way now.

418
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,710
We must send Comrade Haishan
to Macau as soon as possible.

419
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,360
Comrade Ou Xin,

420
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,380
I understand

421
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,400
the critical situation in Zhongshan.

422
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,800
Since the enemy already found out
our contact point,

423
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,090
it proves that the Tai Ho Brotherhood

424
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,490
has a traitor among them.

425
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,210
Mr. Liang, who was responsible
for navigation,

426
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:55,240
must have fallen into our enemy's hands.

427
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,180
In other words,

428
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,160
the secret
of the entire supply line in Macau

429
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,890
could be exposed at any moment.

430
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,110
They need you here.

431
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,900
Just entrust me with the mission to escort

432
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,980
Comrade Long Haishan to Macau.

433
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,030
You've been traveling all night.

434
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,930
Don't worry, I can hang on.

435
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,630
I'm familiar with Macau.

436
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,500
Crossing the blockade,

437
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,230
fewer people

438
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,480
means a smaller target.

439
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,380
It has to be me.

440
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,290
Well then...

441
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,350
We'll entrust

442
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,500
Haishan to you.

443
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,360
Oh, right.

444
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,360
Yang Chang's radio is online
around the clock,

445
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,970
maintaining constant communication
between Macau and Zhongshan.

446
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,100
Whether we can protect the supply line

447
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,200
depends on communication
between both sides.

448
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,260
I understand that.

449
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,930
I promise I'll give it my all.

450
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,930
Okay. Let's do it.

451
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,460
Come on.

452
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,220
Haishan.

453
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,570
Comrades!

454
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,840
Grab your gear! We're pulling out!

455
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,560
Let's go!

456
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,830
Xian,

457
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,440
I really didn't leak the information

458
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,980
to your board of directors.

459
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,100
Does it matter who did it now?

460
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,400
He Hongshen,

461
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:03,920
from now on,

462
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,760
you are no longer my friend.

463
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,030
Mr. He,

464
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,440
why did you say that?

465
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,370
Manager He meant well.

466
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,120
He was only trying to help you

467
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,980
get through this difficult time.

468
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,310
Alright, fine.

469
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,420
Today,

470
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,860
let's be frank with each other.

471
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:26,930
I know

472
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,030
you look down on me, Wang Qizheng,

473
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:29,720
and think

474
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,030
I'm a traitor to the country.

475
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,290
Doing business with me

476
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,830
would tarnish your reputation.

477
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,960
But Mr. He,

478
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,380
please think about this.

479
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,470
Your current status

480
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,170
in Macau's business world

481
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,710
hasn't come easily.

482
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,550
If you can't repay

483
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,900
the money because of this matter,

484
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,170
then in Macau's business community,

485
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,900
you'll be done for,

486
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,900
probably without any chance to recover.

487
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,410
Right?

488
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,270
Fine, let's put this all aside.

489
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,400
Just that one charge

490
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,770
of concealing strategic resources.

491
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,510
You know very well how serious

492
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,710
this crime is, don't you?

493
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,110
If you're thrown

494
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,890
into a Japanese prison because of it,

495
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,350
no matter how tough you are,

496
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,460
they'll break you down to dust anyway,

497
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,090
right?

498
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,810
So what?

499
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,310
The declaration deadline
has already passed.

500
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,770
Even if I sell it to you now,

501
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,980
you could still snitch on me, right?

502
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,650
Well, if you sell the goods to me,

503
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,310
I promise you, Mr. He,

504
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,530
that you absolutely won't be charged

505
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,730
with concealing strategic resources.

506
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,960
But the declaration deadline was
2 days ago.

507
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:39,130
Then we'll backdate it by 3 days.

508
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,990
You normally sold it

509
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,770
3 days ago,
before the declaration deadline.

510
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,930
Even if it gets found out later,

511
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,810
it would be me, Wang Qizheng,
who didn't declare it.

512
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,670
It would have nothing
to do with you, Mr. He.

513
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,530
How about this?

514
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,570
Aren't you afraid

515
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,710
of being charged with these crimes?

516
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,530
Come on,

517
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,730
Mr. He.

518
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,910
You know very well

519
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,390
what connections I, Wang Qizheng, have.

520
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,900
Let me be honest with you.

521
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,140
This joint anti-smuggling thing is

522
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,310
actually just the Japanese
checking supplies.

523
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,820
And my goods just belong

524
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,420
to the Japanese anyway.

525
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,450
Why would they investigate
their own things?

526
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,330
But if this gets out...

527
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,740
Mr. He,

528
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,050
I know

529
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,660
you're worried

530
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,770
that if this gets out,

531
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,030
you, Mr. He, will end up
in an embarrassing situation in Macau.

532
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,890
How about this?

533
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,770
Let's

534
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,750
secretly sign the contract

535
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,370
and transport the goods.

536
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,370
Let's keep it only

537
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
between you and me

538
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:39,440
and not let it get out.
That will do, right?

539
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,210
You can continue to be

540
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,620
respected and upright

541
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,180
as a man of dignity in Macau.

542
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,720
Is that acceptable?

543
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,400
Mr. Liang!

544
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,600
As a master of the Brotherhood,

545
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,010
you must know everything

546
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,250
about what's behind the supply line.

547
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,780
It's come to this point now.

548
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,020
You'll have to say it sooner or later.

549
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,350
Stop being so stubborn.

550
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,940
Pah!

551
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,260
Rat.

552
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,900
You ungrateful and disloyal rat.

553
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,920
You rat!

554
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,310
This old man is

555
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,000
really tight-lipped, huh?

556
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,090
Add more punishment.

557
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,090
Go ahead, torture him more!

558
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,460
Wait.

559
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,500
Old man,

don't you?

562

Then don't blame me.

Report.

570
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:38,980
Go ahead.

571
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,860
Our people in the county
have mobilized all our informants

572
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,610
in the puppet troops
and the puppet police force.

573
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,260
The only information we've got is

574
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,880
that a master of the Tai Ho Brotherhood

575
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,780
has indeed been captured

576
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,320
and is now being interrogated
by Lin Nianci in person.

577

That's all we know at the moment.

You may go rest now.

580

Yes, sir.

581
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,350
So it must be Mr. Liang without any doubt.

583
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,040
don't worry.

584
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,380
Zhong is a real man.

585
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,670
He won't betray anyone,

586
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,620
even at the cost of his life.

587
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,310
That's right.
Mr. Liang is tougher than steel.

588
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,330
He won't let slip a single word
about our plan in Macau.

That damn bastard.

If I catch him,

I'll chop his head off as a warning!

602

This is bad.

603
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,230
What's wrong, Master Sanhe?

604
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,650
I didn't expect the traitor
to be Water Ghost.

605
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,660
This scoundrel is

606
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,710

Please explain clearly.

610
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,640
Mr. Liang's entire family was
killed by the Japanese,

Water Ghost knows every well about this.

his most precious treasure.

618

If that child

falls into the enemy's hands,

620
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,840

If you want to inspect them,

must be seriously injured.
