It's because you're afraid.

157

Everyone take a five-minute break.

398
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,030
It's a shame we couldn't bring

399
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,430
such a despicable criminal

400
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,560

We have no choice.

402

These past few years,
under pressure from the Japanese,

403
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,940
the government has had to compromise

404
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,340
and resorted to many questionable tactics.

405
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,360
Huang Gongjie knew too much,

406
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,220
so this was the only solution.

407
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,690
Fortunately, heaven's net is wide
but lets nothing through.

408

Mr. He,

409

the outcome you've arranged for him

410
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,020
was probably the most fitting.

I heard you're going back to Hong Kong.

447
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,520
When are you leaving?

448
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,380
In the next couple of days.

449
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,640
We've already bought the ferry tickets.

450
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,790
I heard you're not planning to
return to Hong Kong.

451
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,100
I've just taken over several hotels

452
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,150
and the water plant,

453
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,080
so I'll be pretty occupied.

454
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,830
Besides,

455
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,020
staying in Macau isn't so bad, is it?

among all of us who fled from Hong Kong

460

to Macau,

461
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,790
few can match you.

462
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,610
I'm sure you understand.

Macau's

465

and market prosperity

466
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,270
are just wartime phenomena.

467
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,660
Now that the war is over,

468
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,870
Hong Kong will remain as
the center of trade and finance.

469
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,700
With the reputation and power

470
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,730
you've built for yourself in Macau
these past few years,

471
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:21,980
if you return to Hong Kong,

472
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,050
you'll certainly achieve great success

473
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,690

475
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,480
Just look at what's happening in
the market these few days.

476
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,180
So many business owners are packing up,

477
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,000
preparing to leave.

478
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So many companies,

479
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,380
shops and hotels have already closed down.

480
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,210
The streets are filled with workers
and laborers looking for jobs.

481
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,930
If you hadn't taken over the water plant,

482
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,400
it would have shut down already.

483
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,390
If you ask me,

484
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,830
you should come back with me.

485
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,200
Mr. Lin, Lyu,

486
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,520
thank you for your kind intentions.

487
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,570
After the prosperity,

488
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,070
Macau inevitably has to go through
some growing pains.

489
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,980
That's why Macau

490
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:55,350
needs people to keep supporting it.

491
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,360
I still remember when I first arrived
in Macau,

492
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,200
I was just a refugee who had nothing

493
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,630
and was living day to day.

494
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,830
It was the years I spent in Macau

495
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,900
that gave me my chance,

496
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,300
and made me who I am today.

497
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,670
Now that Macau is facing difficulties,

498
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,310
if I were to simply abandon it,

499
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,240
wouldn't that be unconscionable?

500
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,550
Therefore,

501
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,880
I've decided.

502
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,530
I want to stay in Macau.

503
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,330
First, I'll take over all the hotels

504
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,400
and public services

505
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,000
that previously employed
large numbers of workers

506
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,040
but have now shut down,

507
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,730
resulting in mass unemployment.

508
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,640
At least we shouldn't let too many people

509
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,480
go hungry.

510
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,030
And I believe

511
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,790
as long as we firmly root ourselves
in Macau,

512
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,120
sharing its breath

513
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,870
and destiny,

514
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,710
Macau's future

515
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,710
will surely achieve new glory.

516
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,410
Xian,

517
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,540
you're still the same Xian,

518
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,280
always thinking first about those
less fortunate than you,

519
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,610
and those who need help.

520
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,070
Alright,

521
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,140
enough of this.

530
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,820
will be greater than before.

531

with anyone else,

536
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,830

with you, Xian.

539

What are your plans?

568
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,440
Thanks to your help,

569
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,050
over these years,

570
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,150
I started with the kerosene business

571
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:01,670
and expanded into various trades,

572
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,500
so things have gotten much busier.

573
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,030
Though it's been hard work,

574
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,480
the profits

575
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,720
have been quite good.

576
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,150
Macau

577
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,860
has opened up all business sectors.

578
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,760
I want to see

579
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,040
if I can expand into other business areas

580
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,030
so as to make life better
for the people of Macau.

583
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,780
That's a good idea.

584
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,470
I don't know if I can pull it off though.

585
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,360
When it comes to doing business,

586
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,830

587
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,050
no one is more skilled than you,
He Hongshen.

588
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,750
You're teasing me again, Xian.

589
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,000
I don't have such talent.

590
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,140
I'm not teasing you.

591
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:37,770
Hongshen,

592
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,840
the road ahead for Macau is
not going to be smooth.

593
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,110
We need talented young people like you

594
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,210

595

On what grounds?

658
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,900

to ban our celebrations?

660
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,420

[Governor of Macau,
Albano Rodrigues de Oliveira]

Of course.

But I want to ask...

678
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,570
why?

679
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,710
Macau

680
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,440
is a Portuguese territory.

has not established diplomatic relations
with the Communist government.

683
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:44,440
Macau should not take sides prematurely

684
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,010
to avoid violating

685
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,280
our government's foreign policy.

686
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:54,000
All Chinese in Macau are under
the jurisdiction of the Macau government.

Government orders

688
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:02,220
must be obeyed by all residents,

Your Excellency the Governor,

691
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm sure you understand that

692
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,230
all Chinese in Macau
have only one motherland.

693
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,150
There is no distinction between
the two governments.

694
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,420
The Chinese in Macau

695
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:19,650
have always been connected by blood
to their motherland.

696
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,570
Celebrating our country's rebirth

697
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,570
is the wish and right of
every Chinese person in Macau.

698
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,460
It has nothing to do with
when or how Portugal

699
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,840
and the Portuguese Macau government

700
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,010

701
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,420
to take sides.

702
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:32,350
Therefore,

00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:33,980

704

not intending to seek for permission.

705
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,120
On behalf of the Chinese in Macau,

706
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,050
I am officially informing you that

707
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,300
this time,

708
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,600

the establishment of New China

709

That's all I have to say.

711
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,410

A Chinese man

713
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,470
dares to defy the Governor to his face,

714
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,410
showing contempt for the government,

715
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,010
and you all remain silent?

716
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,940
Are you all deaf or mute?

717
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,010
Your Excellency the Governor,

718
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,930
perhaps you're not familiar with
the situation in Macau.

719
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,190
I can only tell you that

720
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,110
Macau

721
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,010
is different not only from
other Portuguese colonies,

722
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,650
but also from any colony

723
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,280
of Western countries
anywhere in the world.

724
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,160
Because here,

725
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,310
it's no longer a place where

726
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,000
the colonial government
have absolute control.

727
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,960
96% of Macau's population is Chinese.

728
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,790
And over these years...

729
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,030
for any government order

730
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,670
or administrative decision,

731
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,030
it would have been
virtually impossible to implement

732
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,090
if not for

733
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,130
the support of the Chinese community.

734
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,480
Is that so?
