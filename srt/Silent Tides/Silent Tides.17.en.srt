In the past week,

doesn't know
where the printing plates are.

92

Are you sure he was telling the truth?

93
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,830
This Englishman is a coward.

94
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,120
Before we even tortured him,

95
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,370
he betrayed even his own wife.

96
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,090

the only one
who knows where the printing plates are

is Qiao Renyu.

after Qiao Renyu returned
to the bank that day

104
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,420
and completed the task
of transferring the printing plates,

105

he met with Mr. Grayburn of HSBC

106
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,920
and had a conversation with him.

107
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,480
That means

108
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,060
Mr. Grayburn might also know about it.

109
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,100
Judging from this operation
to rescue Qiao Renyu,

110
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,860
the Allied Forces not only have

111
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,010
a dedicated intelligence station in Macau,

112
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:13,160

the printing plates earlier than we did,

anti-Japanese organizations.

cannot be underestimated.

Well...

224
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,550

before you called me for this meeting,

238

to resign from Lyun Coeng.

don't you?

00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,930
What about Macau?

380
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,440
That service station
was evacuated in advance.

381
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,510
The Special Operations Team

382
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,240
hasn't found any useful leads.

383
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,470
The only

384
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,860
remaining lead is Qiao Renyu.

385
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,980
Yes.

386
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,050
Continue. Intensify the torture.

387
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,770
Yes.

388
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:05,840
Yang Chang has been temporarily placed
at Flower-Stern Ferry.

389
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,500
Though the conditions are poor,

390
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,420
it's less likely
to draw the attention of agents.

391
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,480
At least it's safe.

392
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,840
How is he?

393
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,010
He was severely traumatized.

394
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,460
He's...

395
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,740
Xian,

396
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,010
how is Miss Qiao doing?

397
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,440
Yu said

398
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,710
she locked herself in the dorm
and refuses to come out.

399
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,420
Xian,

400
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,430
things have turned out badly,

401
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,000
and everyone feels terrible.

402
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,050
But you're the one holding us together.

403
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,270
You have to pull yourself together

404
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,130
and think about

405
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,550
how to remedy the situation.

406
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,350
I know.

407
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,070
In my office drawer,

408
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,350
there's a list of all HSBC employees

409
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:19,660
and their families.

410
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,180
Go now.

411
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,080
Arrest 100 people first—

412
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,940
only the elderly,

413
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,010
women, and children.

414
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,680
Bring them here,

415
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,530
and right

416
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,350
in front of him,

417
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,500
put them through every form of torture

418
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,940
that he and Mr. Grayburn endured.

419
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,280
If once isn't enough,

420
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,900
do it twice.

421
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,440
When one batch dies,

422
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,130
bring in the next.

423
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,360
When those 100 people are dead,

424
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,720
arrest another hundred.

425
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,510
Yes.

426
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,960
You monsters.

427
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,080
Monsters!

428
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,400
General.

429
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,490
What?

430
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,140
In that case,

431
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,800
I'll give Mr. Qiao

432
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,320
a...

433
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:40,950
much bigger...

434
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,340
and more surprising gift.

435
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,830
Miss Qiao.

436
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,940
We're here to see you.

437
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,060
[Library]

438
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,550
[Dorm 1]

439
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,270
Is Miss Qiao here?

440
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,310
Xian?

441
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,270
Why are you everywhere?

442
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,220
Why are you here?

443
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,940
Of course I'm here to see Miss Qiao.

444
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,310
Miss Qiao Yinwan,

445
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,850
General Yazaki
personally wrote this invitation.

446
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,830
Colonel Sawa specifically asked me
to deliver it to you.

447
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,680
Yazaki?

448
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,070
To show their sincerity, the Imperial Army

449
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,720
has arranged the meeting you requested

450
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,070
at HSBC.

451
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,980
By then,

452
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,790
Mr. Qiao Renyu

453
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,330
will also be waiting for you

454
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,530
in his former office.

455
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,510
Yinwan,

456
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,310
what are you doing?

457
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,190
All you ever do is make me wait

458
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,690
and wait and wait,

459
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,260
and tell me to take the long view.

460
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,720
But no one cares

461
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,270
how my brother is,

462
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:26,940
whether he is alive,

463
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,140
or whether he's hurt.

464
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:29,910
Indeed,

465
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,810
it proves

466
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,920
I can only rely on myself.

467
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,350
You'll get yourself in danger.

468
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,150
You cannot go.

469
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,290
Who are you to tell me what to do?

470
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,200
Please tell Mr. Yazaki

471
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,390
I will be there on time.

472
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,050
Yinwan,

473
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,870
have you really made up your mind?

474
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:03,740
I have.

475
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,040
I'm sorry.

476
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,300
I didn't have time
to discuss with you before.

477
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,040
When I went to the Sawa Agency
to request seeing my brother,

478
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,370
I wasn't very confident they would agree.

479
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,550
So I planned
to wait until things became clearer

480
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,280
before discussing it with you.

481
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,930
But by stepping into this,

482
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,650
you'll be putting yourself
in the most dangerous position.

483
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,050
This is the only way we can see my brother

484
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,490
and obtain the intelligence
about the banknote paper,

485
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:34,150
isn't it?

486
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,150
Since you've made up your mind,

487
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,320
we'll support you

488
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,550
and carry out the plan together.

489
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,250
As for the subsequent security issues,

490
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,850
we'll figure something out.

491
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,660
Mr. Qiao holds such a big secret.

492
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,140
The Japanese
would never relax their guard over him.

493
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,400
So why did they suddenly agree

494
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,850
to let Miss Qiao see him?

495
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,770
There's only one possibility:

496
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,500
Mr. Qiao still hasn't revealed

497
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,380
the secret

498
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,270
of the banknote paper,

499
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,360
so the Japanese

500
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,760
have run out of options.

501
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,720
We always assumed

502
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,790
that with their brutal methods,

503
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,400
Mr. Qiao would surely break down.

504
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,190
But we didn't expect someone
who looks so frail

505
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,920
to be this tough.

506
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,080
Since Mr. Qiao

507
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,420
endured torture and still refused to talk,

508
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,870
and Yinwan
is the person he cares about most,

509
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:35,090
would he really reveal the intelligence?

510
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,060
After all, if he talks,

511
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,710
he'd be pushing Yinwan into danger.

512
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,680
I'll find a way to convince him.

513
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,670
I believe my brother

514
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,950
will make the right choice.

515
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,420
But...

516
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,140
how can we pass such a big secret

517
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,740
right under the enemy's nose

518
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,630
without showing any flaws?

519
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,240
Even if we really manage to do it,

520
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,740
the enemy won't let Yinwan

521
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,510
walk away with it.

522
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,270
Everyone, listen to me.

523
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,510
I've already thought this through.

524
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,800
I suddenly demanded to see my brother,

525
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,350
so the Japanese
were bound to find it suspicious.

526
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,440
Even if they don't get anything definite

527
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,610
from our conversation,

528
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,470
they will certainly have doubts.

529
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,090
But just as Dr. Ke said,

530
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,450
now that they've run out of options
with my brother,

531
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,110
they can only work through me.

532
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:37,650
And that

533
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,050
is my opportunity.

534
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,010
I bet they will let me go,

535
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,230
then closely monitor me

536
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,010
to follow the trail

537
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,610
and find the banknote paper.

538
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,530
I agree with Yinwan's assessment.

539
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,020
But in the current situation,

540
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,010
surveillance will be everywhere.

541
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,440
Any conventional method

542
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,300
will be detected by the enemy.

543
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,870
We need a way

544
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,520
they can't possibly anticipate,

545
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,100
see through, or detect,

546
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,650
so that Yinwan

547
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,900
can pass the information out safely.

548
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,010
I have an idea.

549
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,090
Daddy!

550
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,830
Look at my drawing. Is it pretty?

551
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,400
It's very pretty.

552
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,250
Who did you draw?

553
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,740
My brother.

554
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,620
Why did you draw your brother?

555
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,120
Isn't his birthday

556
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,500
in 3 days?

557
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,130
This is the birthday gift
I prepared for him.

558
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,150
Zai, your birthday is coming up?

559
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:55,770
Daddy,

560
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,920
what birthday gift

561
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,240
did you prepare for my brother?

562
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,550
Daddy,

563
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,490
I don't want any presents.

564
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:06,000
I just want you to come home early

565
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,200
from work that day

566
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,969
to spend my birthday with me.

567
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,370
