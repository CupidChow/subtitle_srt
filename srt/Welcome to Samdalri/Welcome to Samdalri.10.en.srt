00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:40,958
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,294
8 YEARS AGO

3
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,173
Let's break up.

4
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,804
What? Why would you say that?

5
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,515
What's the matter?
All of a sudden?

6
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,309
It's not.
I've been thinking about it for some time.

7
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,438
I need to go study abroad too.

8
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,944
Yes, but we decided
to study abroad together.

9
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,530
We came back here
to get our parents' blessing.

10
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,121
Sam-dal, what's wrong?

11
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,123
Did something happen? What happened?

12
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,499
Let's just break up.

13
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,003
Why would you come
with me to study abroad?

14
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,758
I don't like you anymore.

15
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,011
What?

16
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,971
I don't need you anymore.

17
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,014
So let's break up.

18
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,186
Wait, hold on.
What is this? You're joking, right?

19
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,980
Why are we suddenly breaking up?

20
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,398
-Let's break up.
-Hey.

21
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,610
Cho Sam-dal!

22
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,704
Hey, Sam-dal!
Seriously, why are you doing this?

23
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,123
I told you I don't need you anymore!

24
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,166
Hey, Cho Sam-dal!

25
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,032
Why are you packing up again?

26
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,825
You just got here a few days ago.

27
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,369
Dad, I need to…

28
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,454
go somewhere for a bit.

29
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,918
And your mom's memorial rites?

30
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:51,797
Are you going to miss it?

31
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,550
What?

32
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,734
I'll leave after the memorial rites.
Let's talk it over again, okay?

33
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,486
No, I won't break up with you.

34
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,488
Sam-dal, please.

35
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,994
Stop seeing her.

36
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,874
-What?
-I want you to stop seeing her.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,127
That's enough.

38
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,090
Even if the heavens fall,

39
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,968
I'll never accept Sam-dal.

40
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,929
Dad…

41
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,306
Don't start.

42
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,766
If I left you alone,

43
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,227
I thought you two would break up.

44
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,021
But what? Study abroad?

45
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:51,732
With her?

46
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,986
And when you come back,
are you going to marry her?

47
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,028
Yes, I will.

48
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,991
I'm going to marry Sam-dal.

49
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,912
The thing is, Dad,
Sam-dal's the only one for me.

50
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:10,333
You're not even considering
your poor mother now?

51
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,918
Is that it?

52
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:16,089
Can't you see I'm trying not to burn down
the house of those scoundrels

53
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,010
even as they've burned a hole
in my heart for the past ten years?

54
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,220
Just stop it now, Dad!

55
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,016
It's been ten years now.

56
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,976
Okay?

57
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,603
Why are you still being like this?

58
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,271
Let a hundred years pass!

59
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,106
I'll never forgive that Ko Mi-ja.

60
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,452
Mom.

61
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,331
Why did you come out?

62
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:54,961
I was just going to put
the food here for the rites and go.

63
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,547
Please go back inside. Go back in.

64
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,757
I told you not to come!

65
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,718
How dare you come here?

66
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,553
Don't you know what today is?

67
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,723
Did you think you could act
like it didn't happen after time went by?

68
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,434
I told you not to come here.

69
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,187
I told you, we wanted
nothing to do with you!

70
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,482
Dad, let's go inside.

71
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,569
Don't you dare think
I'll forgive you before I die.

72
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,780
You took away my wife.

73
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,323
And for Yong-pil,

74
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,326
you took away his mother.
Have you no shame?

75
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:30,038
What, are you going to
take away my son now too?

76
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,957
Get out of my house!

77
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,792
Dad, please stop!

78
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,918
You listen up too!

79
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,964
I will never forgive her family!

80
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:43,009
If you want to see things
like this keep happening, go ahead.

81
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,194
It's okay. Leave him be.

82
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,549
Mom, what's wrong?

83
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,009
What's wrong, Mom?

84
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,885
Mom! Mom, what's wrong?

85
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,764
The Meteorological Administration's
supercomputer

86
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,850
produces 150,000 pages of data per day.

87
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,810
But from those countless scenarios,

88
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,605
it's up to us humans
to decide which one to go with.

89
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,148
Hello? Mom.

90
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,941
Hello?

91
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,568
Someone's collapsed here.

92
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,323
SAM-DAL
LET'S JUST BREAK…

93
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,074
Yong-pil.

94
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,244
Yong-pil, I can't do it.

95
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,872
I don't think I can do this, Yong-Pil.

96
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,916
Cho Yong-pil.

97
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,420
Can you please come out, Yong-pil?

98
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,965
Some days, we make decisions
that are perfectly right.

99
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:06,718
Let's just break up.

100
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,095
I don't need you anymore.

101
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:13,725
Other days, we make decisions
that are perfectly wrong.

102
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,257
Yong-pil!

103
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,179
On the day I saw Mom's heart break…

104
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,556
Yong-pil!

105
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,642
…I thought everyone would be happy

106
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,560
if I was the only one who suffered.

107
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:01,981
But…

108
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,651
I couldn't predict

109
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,779
the biggest variable.

110
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,615
He fell straight backwards!

111
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,659
Yong-pil was behind him!

112
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,661
-Behind Yong-pil!
-Yong-pil!

113
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,998
-He got dakgalbi all over his head!
-That's right!

114
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,263
SAM-DAL

115
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,122
Do you know why I didn't return to Jeju?

116
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,709
Do you know who made it
impossible to come to Jeju?

117
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,045
I tried so hard to forget you.

118
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,423
I tried so hard to erase you
from my memories.

119
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,012
Why do you keep asking if I'm okay?

120
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,640
Why do you keep worrying about me

121
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,061
and taking care of me?

122
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,354
Why do you keep…

123
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,067
making me waver?

124
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,531
What are you going to do
if I really do lean on you?

125
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,786
The variable that
you suffered as much as I did.

126
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,041
I was broken down

127
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,126
by the variable again.

128
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:54,093
EPISODE 10
THE VARIABLES WE COULDN'T PREDICT

129
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,318
GARBAGE BAG

130
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,372
Hey.

131
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,961
You should just go and die.

132
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,045
Eun-u.

133
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,046
Goodness.

134
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,756
That's a good idea.

135
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:36,302
Take him away and kill him.
I'll pay you handsomely.

136
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,720
I'll throw it out for you.

137
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:38,763
It's okay.

138
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,267
By the time I come back,
make sure he's dead.

139
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,562
And make sure nobody finds out.

140
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,900
-Good night, ma'am.
-You too.

141
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,862
Goodness.

142
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,062
What in the world?

143
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,608
Gosh, my head hurts.

144
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,575
What? Why am I here?

145
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,120
Wang Gyeong-tae.

146
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,832
What did you do yesterday?

147
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,293
What did I do?

148
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,131
I don't remember anything.

149
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,758
That's good.

150
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,676
It's good

151
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,136
that I remember nothing at all.

152
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,597
It's better this way.

153
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,651
Hey.

154
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,735
Cha Eun-u.

155
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,321
Jeez. Are you crazy?

156
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,073
You didn't go home?

157
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,201
You want your wife to cuss you out?

158
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,285
Hey, wake up.

159
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,244
Hey.

160
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,789
Did she kick you out?

161
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:28,957
What?

162
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,085
Damn it. What?

163
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,796
-Damn it.
-What are you doing here?

164
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,967
I'm here because I was kicked out.

165
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,386
You don't have a wife to kick you out.

166
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,012
You…

167
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,140
Did you run away?

168
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:48,935
Why would I run away
from home at this age?

169
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,269
I would've moved out.

170
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,021
What's the difference?

171
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,566
We're not at the age where we
could be kicked out. What's going on?

172
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,031
Gosh.

173
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,367
You don't need to know.
No, you must not know.

174
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:48,661
It won't help me at all if you find out.

175
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,705
You would just run your mouth.

176
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,041
When did I ever do that?

177
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,130
Did I run my mouth yesterday?

178
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,424
What time is it?

179
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,675
Did I run my mouth

180
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,221
about you still being in love
with Sam-dal?

181
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,726
What's wrong with me?

182
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,312
Did I tell Sam-dal?

183
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,355
What am I going to do?

184
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,941
I thought all of that was a dream.

185
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,487
You better not say things
like that to Sam-dal ever again.

186
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:28,451
If you do, I'll tell your mom how you take
300,000 won from the safe box each month.

187
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,080
You should kill me instead. Just kill me.

188
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,499
Gosh, my neck.

189
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,252
But it wasn't a totally strange thing
to say, was it?

190
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,129
It's true.

191
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,632
You do still like Sam-dal. Right?

192
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,134
Are you going to make
an excuse and deny it now?

193
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,344
I do like her. So what?

194
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,012
You do?

195
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,347
Yes, I do.

196
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,350
I've always liked her since long before.

197
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,684
So what? What about it?

198
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,853
Why are you suddenly being honest?

199
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,189
When I said you were destroying
your knees for love,

200
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,775
you denied it and laughed me off.
So what gives?

201
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:05,029
That's because you running
your mouth doesn't help me at all.

202
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:09,325
If anyone should tell Sam-dal I like her,
it should be me, not your big mouth.

203
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,660
Don't you think?

204
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,702
Am I wrong?

205
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,079
Jeez.

206
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,374
It's because I was worried.

207
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,917
-I'm worried and he's…
-Yong-pil?

208
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,794
Why are you coming from there?

209
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,003
You didn't go home?

210
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,589
Man-su, let me stay here for a while.

211
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,800
And Gyeong-tae will pay for me.

212
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,135
What?

213
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:30,638
Why did he have to scan that?
He should've just taken it.

214
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,056
Are you writing down their tabs?

215
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,516
Well… Hello, ma'am.

216
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,143
-You!
-It's for you.

217
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,773
Who was it? Was Eun-u kicked out again?

218
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,692
No, it was Yong-pil.

219
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,110
He slept there last night.

220
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,695
Yong-pil?

221
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:52,326
Why did he sleep here?
And was he here alone?

222
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,995
There were two people.

223
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,165
Two people?

224
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,667
What's wrong with you? Me and him!

225
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,628
You?

226
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,966
What about Sam-dal? Where did she go?

227
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,520
What in the world?

228
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,565
Why am I here again?

229
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,568
My stomach hurts.

230
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,736
Gosh, my head.

231
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:34,744
Yesterday,

232
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,538
with Gyeong-tae

233
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,998
and Eun-u…

234
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,708
-Who's a pervert?
-My goodness.

235
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,918
At the convenience store…

236
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,337
It's Cho Sam-dal.
Our pure-hearted Cho Yong-pil…

237
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,630
Your mom… Switzerland…

238
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,465
You're so drunk.

239
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,680
Are you okay?

240
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,892
Why did you give up
on your dreams for my mom's sake

241
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,811
and stay stuck here? Why?

242
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:04,649
Why would you do that?
You should get a hold of yourself.

243
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,317
Wait.

244
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,571
It stops there?

245
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,031
It just ends like that?

246
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,824
What in the world?

247
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,328
Gosh, my head hurts.

248
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,081
Forget it. My head hurts too much.

249
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,749
Gosh, my head.

250
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:28,214
Do you know why I didn't return to Jeju?

251
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,551
Do you know who made it
impossible to come to Jeju?

252
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,098
What on earth did I say?

253
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,809
Cho Sam-dal, what did you say?

254
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,144
Remember it. Quickly.

255
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,771
What did you say next?

256
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,898
Right now! Remember!

257
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,693
What did I say to him?

258
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:35,781
But what's gotten into you? You rebel
for the first time against your dad,

259
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,409
and you even admitted
that you liked Sam-dal.

260
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,787
Something big must've changed your mind
to do things so out of character.

261
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,123
Maybe I'm going to die soon.

262
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,333
Do you want to die?

263
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,419
What? Can't I do something
that's out of character?

264
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,255
Do I always have to suppress
my feelings and pretend I'm fine?

265
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,465
Is that my fate?

266
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,842
What are you talking about?

267
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,719
Are you all losing your minds?

268
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,137
Everyone's become weird.

269
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,015
-What's with you guys?
-Who else are you talking about?

270
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,308
Bu Sang-do, of course.

271
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,560
He gets angry at everything I say.

272
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,603
A few days ago,

273
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,148
he shouted at Eun-u and me
for making your bond with Sam-dal special

274
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,608
and then stormed out.

275
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,360
I mean, what's his…

276
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,402
Gosh…

277
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,320
Wait!

278
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,533
Last time. Here, on the balcony.

279
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,371
You and Sam-dal got mad
and said you were only friends. Right?

280
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,247
Wait. Is he…

281
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,458
Is he jealous of you two?

282
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,796
He is. He gets angry
when we mention you two. Hey.

283
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,465
Yong-pil.

284
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,469
He's jealous
because he lost Sam-dal to you.

285
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,888
This is insane! Gosh, Gyeong-tae!

286
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:44,100
And you discovered this
while hungover? Just insane.

287
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,687
You always did pull-ups
with Sang-do before Sam-dal came.

288
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,106
Why don't you do them these days?

289
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,524
Why aren't you doing them?

290
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,608
-Get out.
-Why?

291
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,567
You.

292
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,652
Go to work.

293
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,987
-Do them again starting from tomorrow.
-Get out.

294
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,239
-Do it tomorrow.
-Hey!

295
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,241
Take care of Sang-do.

296
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,784
-He's really upset.
-You little…

297
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,619
-Got it?
-Get out.

298
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,639
Does anyone know how I got home yesterday?

299
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,016
Who brought me here?

300
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,018
How would we know?

301
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:32,022
Probably either Yong-pil,
Gyeong-tae, Eun-u, or Sang-do.

302
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:32,940
Hold on.

303
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,402
Back in Seoul,
you always came home on your own.

304
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,488
But why do you
keep letting yourself go in Jeju?

305
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,242
She feels comfortable here.
She knows someone will get her home.

306
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,494
I should just… You brat!

307
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,414
I don't know. I should start using
the recorder on my phone.

308
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,252
What are you two
doing out here this early?

309
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,965
We agreed to keep an eye
on Mom to keep her from going diving.

310
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,010
-You're right.
-I can't believe you.

311
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,554
-I should really wake up.
-She's still out of it.

312
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,807
Why do I have to be watched by you?

313
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,518
Mom, why are you going that way?

314
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,436
No.

315
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,353
-Mom--
-Don't.

316
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,605
You better not dive!

317
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,356
We're serious!

318
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,401
Serious about what?

319
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,445
You crazy brats.

320
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,032
Why is my diving suit not here?

321
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:25,743
Mom!

322
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,704
Is this what you've been doing?

323
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:33,250
When Dad and Yong-pil tried to stop you,
did you recklessly do as you wanted?

324
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,252
Think about those
who are worried about you.

325
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,172
It's my job and it's my body.

326
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,716
I'll decide what to do with it.

327
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,593
You didn't listen to me and went to Seoul.

328
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,891
Well… Those two are different things.

329
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,393
Since you're being like this…

330
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,813
-Since you keep doing this--
-Be quiet!

331
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,440
Give me my diving suit now.
Where did you hide it?

332
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,693
Why would we hide it?
Are they an angel's wings or something?

333
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,987
And it's not like
you won't dive without it.

334
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,156
It's not that I won't. I can't.

335
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,076
How can you dive without a diving suit?

336
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,035
I see.

337
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,122
That's right.
You can't dive without a diving suit.

338
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,082
-You're right.
-Yeah.

339
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,458
Don't give it to her.

340
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,794
I don't know who hid it, but good job.

341
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,212
I should just…

342
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,548
Give it back now!

343
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:21,841
Where did you hide it?

344
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,008
-No idea.
-It's gone.

345
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,468
-I don't know.
-I really don't.

346
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:25,469
-No idea.
-You little…

347
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,179
-I'll kick you all out!
-We don't know!

348
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,472
I don't know!

349
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:29,640
Mom, we don't know!

350
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:42,236
So the Namdal-ri haenyeos
can't dive anymore?

351
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,612
Of course not.

352
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,575
They're turning their shore
into a walking trail for the theme park.

353
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:48,951
Goodness.

354
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,705
They'll be so bored without diving.
How will they go on?

355
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,623
Probably with the money they'll get.

356
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:58,877
They say the compensation is so high
everyone in Namdal-ri can live off of it.

357
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,131
Still, I'd rather go diving.

358
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,593
Everyone obviously knows
it'll ruin the sea.

359
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:10,806
Would you still dive if they paid you
a few hundred million won?

360
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,600
What?

361
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:13,517
Jeez.

362
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,270
Then, I'd have to quit!

363
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:18,272
When are they paying me?

364
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,190
Do they want to come over to Samdal-ri?

365
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,276
I'd quit if they paid me that much.

366
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,612
I'd do anything if they paid me.

367
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:25,529
Exactly.

368
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,325
What is it?

369
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,329
Are you thinking
about what rumors to spread?

370
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,835
Actually, I saw something amazing.

371
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,211
What?

372
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,421
What was it?

373
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:46,258
Yesterday, Yong-pil and Sam-dal--

374
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,801
Come on!

375
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,262
Stop talking about them already.

376
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,807
Ms. Ko is ill.
Do you want to upset her again?

377
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:57,436
Fine, I won't say anything.

378
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,812
I'll keep it to myself.

379
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,691
The theme park
is being built in Namdal-ri.

380
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,943
But don't count your chickens yet.

381
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,572
They might decide
to build it here instead!

382
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,240
Who knows?

383
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:13,285
Forget it. Just give Namdal-ri
all that money!

384
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,789
Let's go.

385
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,918
My goodness.

386
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,132
-Mom.
-Mom, please.

387
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,592
-We--
-Mom.

388
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,511
Come on!

389
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:32,888
We're here, sir.

390
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,848
What?

391
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,475
Right.

392
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,106
ALL RESIDENTS OF NAMDAL-RI
WELCOME THE THEME PARK

393
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,693
This is the last meeting, sir.

394
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,487
You can't leave
without signing like yesterday.

395
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,530
Secretary Ko.

396
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,949
I had my reasons yesterday.

397
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,284
I showed you. Here.

398
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,913
"Horoscope for Aquarius."

399
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:02,626
"Mercury is in a bad alignment
with the ominous Saturn."

400
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,087
Blah, blah. And here.
It specifically says,

401
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,090
"Postpone signing
any contracts or documents."

402
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,717
You saw this too.

403
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,010
Your fortune's great today,
so please sign, sir.

404
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,596
-The legal team's waiting.
-I got it.

405
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:17,850
But…

406
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:26,024
Then, after this,
am I going back to Seoul?

407
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,067
Yes, sir.

408
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,610
I booked a 6:00 p.m. flight.

409
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,695
Why?

410
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,990
Because you have nothing else
scheduled after this meeting today.

411
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,074
I mean,

412
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,869
why board a plane at dinnertime?

413
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,872
Because planes fly during dinnertime too.

414
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,458
Damn it.

415
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,127
Domestic flights don't provide meals.
I'll be so hungry.

416
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:46,879
What's with him?

417
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,508
Thank you for your cooperation.

418
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:54,219
The legal team will contact you
about the contract.

419
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,847
We're the ones who should be thanking you.

420
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,893
Thank you so much for choosing Namdal-ri.

421
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:05,230
We will continue to support
AS Group's theme park.

422
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:07,566
Thank you.

423
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,818
Are you going back to Seoul now?

424
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,571
It's been a pleasure.

425
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,073
What?

426
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,950
President Jeon, you're still young.

427
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,077
Are you interested in remarrying?

428
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,789
Well…

429
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:24,583
You are just so clueless.

430
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:29,087
He had such a rough marriage.
Why would he want to do that again?

431
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,548
I'm sure he went through a lot.

432
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:34,510
What do you mean I went though a lot?

433
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,471
Come on. We know Jin-dal well enough.

434
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,182
Everyone on Jeju Island knows her.

435
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:44,144
Even as a kid, whenever she was upset,
she would smash everything.

436
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,729
What's that? Right.

437
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,105
Punching machines.

438
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,983
Her mother had to pay
for all those wrecked punching machines.

439
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,946
Exactly. Mr. Jeon
was nice enough to put up with her.

440
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,614
Everyone in Jeju would agree.

441
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,033
That's right.

442
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,452
President Jeon is a saint.

443
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:03,413
She didn't divorce him.

444
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,207
She was dumped by him.

445
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,210
President Jeon, everyone here knows.

446
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,753
-Don't worry.
-That's right.

447
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:10,879
Serves her right!

448
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:12,965
Goodness!

449
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,050
Hey!

450
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,684
"It serves her right"?

451
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:25,811
Unbelievable.

452
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,188
What do you guys even know?

453
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:31,817
You think you know
Cho Jin-dal as well as I do?

454
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,360
-Sir--
-Let go of me.

455
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,903
The one who was dumped

456
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:39,741
was me, Jeon Dae-yeong.

457
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,159
Okay?

458
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,870
She left me!

459
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,455
You want me to show you
the divorce papers she sent me?

460
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:48,834
You don't know anything.

461
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:54,006
She went through so much by herself
and finally got a divorce.

462
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,843
And you say it serves her right
to be dumped?

463
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,429
But why are you so angry?

464
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,598
That wasn't what we meant.

465
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,517
You said you were
her hometown neighbors and friends!

466
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:12,232
How could you be worse
than the ex-husband she divorced?

467
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,362
Talking behind her back
because she's not here… Damn it.

468
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,073
-Secretary Ko!
-Yes, sir!

469
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,658
I can't do business here.

470
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:23,660
-Yes, sir.
-I refuse to work with them!

471
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,372
-Pardon?
-I won't sign this contract!

472
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,498
-But, sir…
-Do you know

473
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,084
how damn cool she is
when she hits a punching machine?

474
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,252
You have no damn clue.

475
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,130
-President Jeon!
-Goodness.

476
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,135
And what did you mean earlier?

477
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,430
What do you mean I look so old?

478
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,850
Damn it. How could you insult
someone's appearance while smiling?

479
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,018
Unbelievable.

480
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,647
Well…

481
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,023
I…

482
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:53,941
Excuse me.

483
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,651
President Jeon!

484
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,653
-Jeez.
-You…

485
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,113
It's so itchy.

486
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,156
My ear's itching.

487
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,243
"Good for arrhythmia."

488
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,582
Why is she so quiet?

489
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,627
Then again,

490
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,004
she always did listen to me.

491
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,924
Okay, let's see.

492
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,050
"Arrhythmia."

493
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:31,645
Did he go to work or not?

494
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,442
Damn it.

495
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,821
This is driving me crazy.

496
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,116
Should I call and ask him?

497
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,160
No, I should at least remember
what I said first.

498
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,126
It's obvious what I said!

499
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,420
If I said that much,
I must've said everything.

500
00:29:57,087 --> 00:30:01,466
I mean, other than him, what reason
is there for not coming back to Jeju?

501
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,052
Gosh.

502
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:27,117
Cho Sam-dal, you've seriously lost it!

503
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:31,997
What in the world?

504
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:41,423
Hello?

505
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,385
Sorry?

506
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:46,970
Me?

507
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,854
He fought with his dad?

508
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,772
Baek-ho, coffee.

509
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,815
He's too happy to have been kicked out.

510
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,108
You want a cup?

511
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,531
He looks too genuinely happy
to be pretending.

512
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:07,783
-Yeah.
-He's coming. Let's go.

513
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:09,785
Bye.

514
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,540
Why did they leave like that?

515
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,378
Let's see.

516
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,682
Cho Yong-pil.

517
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,684
The commissioner asked for you.

518
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,066
Forecaster Cho Yong-pil.

519
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,110
Yes, sir?

520
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,779
I have good news and bad news for you.

521
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,072
Which do you want first?

522
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,744
I'd only like the good news, please.

523
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,579
The commissioner…

524
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,584
called me personally to say
he'll consider giving our office

525
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,628
the authority to issue weather advisories

526
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,005
with an open mind.

527
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,006
Really?

528
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,008
So we can issue weather advisories now?

529
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:07,926
Starting when?

530
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,386
He's going to consider it.

531
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,556
-What?
-But why so suddenly, sir?

532
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,807
Why else?

533
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,936
A certain knucklehead forecaster
made 19 calls.

534
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:24,526
He made 19 complaint calls,
and it was directly to the commissioner.

535
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,778
What? Directly to the commissioner?

536
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:28,697
What lunatic would…

537
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,581
I mean, be honest and think about it.

538
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,708
If we wait until the number goes up

539
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,419
and wait some more for approval,

540
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,171
it'll be too late to prevent accidents.

541
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:49,301
Commissioner, I've been living
in Jeju for almost 40 years now.

542
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,679
I can just tell by looking
at the sea. It's obvious.

543
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,015
"Tomorrow, it's going to be very stormy."

544
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,476
"It'll rain in about ten minutes."

545
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,103
I can just tell.

546
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,522
Who else can issue
such weather advisories?

547
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,984
To be blunt, Commissioner,
can you see Jeju's sky from Seoul?

548
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,152
Hello?

549
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,445
Hello, Commissioner?

550
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,615
Commissioner, can you hear me? Hello?

551
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,742
You knucklehead.

552
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,329
I knew he was being too quiet.

553
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,830
Someone almost died.

554
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:23,293
If our request had been approved earlier,
it wouldn't have happened.

555
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,129
Thanks to your passion, Forecaster Cho,

556
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:29,966
I'm becoming very close
with the commissioner.

557
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,928
All right, now…

558
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,723
The bad news.

559
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,395
Hold on. Why…

560
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,065
Why am I being disciplined?

561
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,776
I'm being disciplined
for making a few calls?

562
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,696
Then, he shouldn't have put
his phone number on the official website.

563
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,324
He put it there
and said to call him for requests.

564
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,576
And did I say anything wrong?

565
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,662
I can't accept this, sir.

566
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,497
Hey. Shut up.

567
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,748
Read it carefully.

568
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,583
Well…

569
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,211
UNAUTHORIZED ABSENCE FROM WORK

570
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,337
"Unauthorized…"

571
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,675
They're taking her
to Halla University Hospital.

572
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,010
Hey, where…

573
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,888
Unauthorized…

574
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,099
Unauthorized absence from work.

575
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,475
It's a reprimand.

576
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,020
Starting today, stop your forecasting

577
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,231
and go to the Weather Service.

578
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,983
No, I…

579
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,660
Thank you.

580
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,247
You've been chosen
as this year's photographer

581
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,207
for the Jeju and Weather Exhibition.

582
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,042
Why did it have to be today?

583
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,754
Wait, Yong-pil is
in the Forecasting Division.

584
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,465
It must be on a different floor.

585
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,635
Then, I won't run into him.

586
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,637
I'm sure I won't run into him.

587
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,472
My goodness!

588
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,641
Gosh!

589
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,278
Why are you here?

590
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:15,739
Me?

591
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:20,327
I'm here to make some good coffee for you.

592
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,416
Right. We had a lot of skilled applicants
this time, didn't we?

593
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,542
-We did.
-And this.

594
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,879
She took it in high school.
It's out of focus, but the angle's cool.

595
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,007
Shouldn't you get back to work?

596
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,845
Right, it's already time
to get back to forecasting.

597
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,430
It's time for my meeting.

598
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,640
-I should go.
-Okay.

599
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:43,850
-Forecaster Cho Yong-pil.
-Yes?

600
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,060
Where are you going?

601
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,522
You need to change that out.

602
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:52,233
Right, the water cooler.

603
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,526
Right, I forgot.

604
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,694
I need to refill it.

605
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,696
People here drink too much water.

606
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,408
He was disciplined and transferred
to our department today.

607
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,160
-Disciplined?
-Yes.

608
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:07,290
The work you submitted
received the most votes,

609
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,001
so you've been chosen
as this year's photographer.

610
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:16,549
But I don't understand
how this one was chosen.

611
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:20,261
It's all out of focus,
and it's pretty bad.

612
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:25,141
Well, maybe it had a vintage vibe
unlike the other photos.

613
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,268
I see. I understand.

614
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:28,978
For the exhibition,

615
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:32,232
you can take any photos
of the weather or nature in Jeju.

616
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,902
I was born and raised in Jeju,
so I know the landscape quite well.

617
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:39,030
But could I get some information
about the weather?

618
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,156
Don't worry.

619
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,702
Often, the photographer isn't from Jeju,
so we pair them up with someone from here.

620
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,288
You pair them with someone?

621
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,667
Yes. They drive you around
and show you hidden spots.

622
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,919
They'll support your shooting schedule.

623
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,337
Really?

624
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,715
It would be convenient
to have someone like that.

625
00:36:58,425 --> 00:36:59,759
Forecaster Cho Yong-pil?

626
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:01,720
Yes?

627
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,348
Well…

628
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,726
Goodness.

629
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:15,733
Hey, Sam-dal.

630
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,902
Why are you hating this so much?

631
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,863
I don't hate it.

632
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,450
No one in Jeju knows good spots
for taking photos better than I do.

633
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,660
And you don't even have
a car in Jeju right now.

634
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,538
Well, I could always rent a car.

635
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,749
I'm from Jeju, too, aren't I?

636
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,417
I know all the photo spots too.

637
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,376
It's okay.

638
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,128
The places you knew 20 years ago

639
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,006
were all redeveloped
and became tourist attractions,

640
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,133
so they're full of people now.

641
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,552
By any chance…

642
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,516
Is it because of what happened yesterday?

643
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,312
Yesterday? What do you mean?

644
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,649
What about yesterday?

645
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,693
You don't remember anything?

646
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:44,197
Hey, quit asking.
I really can't recall a thing.

647
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:45,698
Is it even possible…

648
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,284
to forget that?

649
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,161
Are you sure you don't remember anything?

650
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,331
Why? Did I say something super weird?

651
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,793
I did. I bet I did.

652
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,546
Whatever it is,
just forget everything I blabbered.

653
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,214
It's all gibberish.

654
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,215
-Gibberish?
-Yeah.

655
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,592
I blurt out stuff I don't mean
when I'm drunk.

656
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,010
I think I'm going insane.

657
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,012
Nowadays, I drink with a recorder on.

658
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,724
I keep spewing nonsense
I never even thought of.

659
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,893
You seriously don't remember anything?

660
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,812
By any chance…

661
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:18,898
Doesn't anything ring a bell for you?

662
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,108
Well…

663
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,654
I drank with Gyeong-tae and Eun-u here…

664
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,239
And?

665
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,157
And then I saw you…

666
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,075
Yes?

667
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,495
But after that, it's a blank.

668
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,456
You… You saw me,

669
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,709
and then it's a blank?

670
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,836
So…

671
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:41,671
No way.

672
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,757
-But you--
-No! I don't want to hear!

673
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,259
It's gibberish.

674
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,469
It's complete nonsense. Okay?

675
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,013
Wait. Look in my eyes.

676
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,974
-What?
-Be honest. You remember, right?

677
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,102
No, I really mean it this time.

678
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,479
-I mean it.
-I think you're lying.

679
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:01,232
-You do remember.
-Hey, Sang-do!

680
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,903
-What are you two doing here?
-Just talking.

681
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:08,406
Anyways, I don't need to be paired
with anyone. I'm doing it solo.

682
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,658
-Bye.
-Hey, wait--

683
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,832
-Hey.
-Hi.

684
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,506
It did happen.

685
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:31,387
Sam-dal, you're out of your mind.

686
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,225
Should I have just asked him what I said?

687
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:39,979
No.

688
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,774
God, no.

689
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:50,198
Thanks.

690
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,706
-Do you feel bad?
-What? About what?

691
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,959
Do you feel bad for me too?

692
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,380
You said not to feel bad
about liking someone. So why do you?

693
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,757
I don't feel bad for you.

694
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:10,551
Man, I don't know.

695
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:11,719
It's awkward.

696
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:15,348
Why do I feel awkward with you?

697
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,642
Why do I feel awkward? This is strange.

698
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,644
It upsets me.

699
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,481
You said it's how I feel, so don't worry.

700
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,402
Do you get how I feel now?
It's impossible.

701
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,612
What is this?

702
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:30,738
Revenge?

703
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,365
Yeah.

704
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,332
Yong-pil.

705
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:42,792
Yeah?

706
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,586
I've never stopped liking Sam-dal either.

707
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:50,216
This time, I don't want to have regrets.

708
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,429
So I'm not going to feel bad for you

709
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,931
or worry about you.

710
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,392
I'll do whatever my heart says.

711
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,352
Sang-do…

712
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,814
You seem determined.

713
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,899
Are you declaring war now?

714
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,609
Yeah.

715
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,321
So you should do the same.

716
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,829
FLIRT BEFORE LOVE

717
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:23,624
Hey, Hae-dal. You should've
contacted us first when you got here.

718
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,543
You think she had the time for that?

719
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,754
How could they expose her family too?

720
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,005
It's ridiculous.

721
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,298
Exactly.

722
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,424
Cheers.

723
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,425
Jeez.

724
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,474
They say they feel sorry
for Ha-yul or whatever.

725
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,185
They have no idea
and run their mouths with anonymity.

726
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,520
I bet they wouldn't dare
say a thing in person.

727
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,230
Hey, don't even respond to them.

728
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:49,275
They're just throwing
their crap around here and there.

729
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,402
-It's gross.
-Come on!

730
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,570
That's so disgusting.

731
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,780
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

732
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,241
Excuse me.

733
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:02,747
My friends and I are over at that table.
Would you like to drink together?

734
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,542
-No, we don't do that.
-Sure.

735
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,377
-Okay.
-Okay. Sounds good?

736
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,713
-Just a second. I'll be back soon.
-Okay.

737
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,256
Wait.

738
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,801
My goodness. You must be insane.

739
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,887
Drinking with other guys?
I don't like that stuff.

740
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,639
Look around, my friend.

741
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:23,726
This is the most popular singles bar
on Jeju Island.

742
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,478
That's nonsense.

743
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,896
Mind if I sit here?

744
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,564
How many are you with?

745
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:30,149
It's the two of us.

746
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,484
You guys!

747
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,320
Why would you bring me
to a place like this? Jeez!

748
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:37,156
I have a child, okay? I'm leaving.

749
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,242
-Seriously.
-Come on!

750
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:42,328
You went to clubs all the time in Seoul.

751
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,164
I literally only dance in clubs.

752
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:48,709
All right, fine.
Just stay here a bit longer.

753
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,795
We won't tell them you have a child.

754
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,881
I mean, it's not like
you have a husband or boyfriend.

755
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,175
So what's the problem, Hae-dal?

756
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,969
Come on!

757
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,346
No, I hate it. I absolutely hate it.

758
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,306
-I'm out of here.
-Wait. Just an hour.

759
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,684
-You can just sit there.
-Seriously, I hate it.

760
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,643
Stop pushing me.

761
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,353
-The table's too small for us.
-Jeez!

762
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,564
-Shall we move to a bigger table?
-Yeah.

763
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,280
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

764
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:27,874
He's been holed up in Jeju for years,
so I'm here to entertain him.

765
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:29,709
What do you mean? You're here on vacation.

766
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:33,129
So you work at a big company,
and you're a fund manager?

767
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,589
Yeah.

768
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,590
It must be nice.

769
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,885
You guys are looking for jobs, too, right?
You'll get hired soon.

770
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:40,887
What about you?

771
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,513
-What do you do?
-Me?

772
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:46,017
I'm working
at the Jeju Bottlenose Dolphin Group.

773
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,184
Really?

774
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,353
But isn't that volunteer work?

775
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,147
It is!

776
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:54,275
He actually went
to a prestigious university.

777
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,068
But he got suddenly hooked on dolphins

778
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:59,238
and has been living here
protecting dolphins for nine years.

779
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,866
His job doesn't pay well either.

780
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:05,244
Everyone's trying to get
a better job and better pay.

781
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:07,413
Do something that pays, will you?

782
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:09,290
-Hey.
-Forget it.

783
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,917
What about you, Hae-dal?

784
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,919
-Me?
-Yeah.

785
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,545
-I take care of a child.
-Sorry?

786
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:18,758
You must be a kindergarten teacher.

787
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,217
I heard it's a tough job.

788
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,219
-No, my daughter--
-Her niece!

789
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,307
You see, she has a niece at home.

790
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,644
She looks after her niece.

791
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,355
-What niece?
-So you're not looking for a job?

792
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,484
I work part-time sometimes.

793
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:40,112
But we're almost in our 30s.
You should start looking for a job.

794
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,615
You can't waste precious time
looking after your niece.

795
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,450
We have to spend our time meaningfully now

796
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:48,245
to improve our lives and environment
when we're in our 30s and 40s.

797
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,581
-What do you know--
-Hey.

798
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,626
Life isn't all about money, you know?

799
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:58,381
A lot of good things in life
can't be bought, you boomer!

800
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,929
I'm sorry.

801
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,847
Him calling you a "boomer" was funny.

802
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,768
Hey. I'm too young to be a boomer.

803
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,145
It's not just old people
who act like boomers.

804
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:16,607
Someone like you,
who wants everyone to follow your opinions

805
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:20,027
and who thinks they're right
about everything. That's a boomer!

806
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,488
How about we toast again?

807
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,491
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

808
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,660
If something went wrong
with the theme park deal,

809
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,621
the chairman told you
not to even think of going back to Seoul.

810
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:34,166
That's why I didn't get
on the plane in the first place.

811
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,751
Sir!

812
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:38,713
Are you okay with it?

813
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,966
They talked behind her back

814
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,052
and spoke of her
like she was some kind of thug.

815
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:48,431
They said it served her right
to be dumped. Jeez.

816
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,434
And to me, they said I looked old.

817
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,936
They were disrespectful.

818
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,439
"It's been a pleasure."

819
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,442
What are you talking about?

820
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,527
They didn't say you looked old.

821
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,613
It meant, "It's been a pleasure"
in standard Korean.

822
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,491
What?

823
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,911
-That means "It's been a pleasure"?
-Yes.

824
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,166
Why is the language so hard?

825
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,083
Gosh.

826
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:17,960
Whatever.

827
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,629
Tell the planning team
to change the entire theme park plan.

828
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:24,967
Namdal-ri isn't the only town in Jeju.

829
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,385
Where else can we go?

830
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,929
There.

831
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:29,847
You know, there.

832
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,017
There? Where?

833
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,561
Gosh, there.

834
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:37,980
Wait…

835
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:39,023
Don't tell me…

836
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,191
Yes, there.

837
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,195
The place you're thinking of. There.

838
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,117
Here.

839
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,119
SAMDAL-RI

840
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,772
LUCKY CONVENIENCE STORE

841
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,444
Okay, let's go.

842
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:27,488
Let's go.

843
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,963
Man, she's so stubborn.

844
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,340
I said I'd pick her up.

845
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,250
What…

846
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,837
What? Hey!

847
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,051
Get out now.

848
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,554
Don't you have work today?

849
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,431
I do. This is my work.

850
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,683
Why do you keep disrupting my work?

851
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,977
Just pretend I'm not here.

852
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,312
Pretend I'm invisible.

853
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,354
Let's go.

854
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:46,358
I'll be very still.

855
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:59,496
Why is this chair so shaky and noisy?
856

856
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:12,760
Wait.

857
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:14,929
What did you buy?

858
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,431
I already bought snacks and stuff.

859
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,975
Goodness. The invisible man can speak.

860
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,395
When you were drunk--

861
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:26,232
Look, I don't want to talk about it!

862
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,318
Goodness.
You're talking to an invisible man.

863
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,406
Shall we go, ma'am?

864
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:45,334
It's been a while since I drove.
This is so refreshing!

865
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,836
There's no traffic at all.

866
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,131
If this was Seoul, it would've taken
30 minutes to drive 10 km.

867
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:53,759
Only 30 minutes? It would've taken longer.

868
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,177
Don't you remember?

869
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,471
During the 2010 World Cup,

870
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:01,058
we went to Jongno to cheer
in the streets with the Red Devils!

871
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:02,518
-I remember.
-We were stuck…

872
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,395
-I do.
-…on the bus the whole day.

873
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,604
I definitely remember.

874
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,607
We couldn't make it,
so we went back home to watch it.

875
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:12,861
Yes, we were the Red Nightmares,
not the Red Devils. That was the worst.

876
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:16,532
Yeah, it was a total nightmare.

877
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:43,600
Make sure to tell them I don't need you
to guide me starting from tomorrow.

878
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:48,605
Although I've been away for some time,
I remember all the good spots for photos.

879
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,607
I've been everywhere to take photos.

880
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:53,152
None of the places
we used to go to will work.

881
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,653
I mean,

882
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,948
do you hate going around with me

883
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:00,576
that much?

884
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,286
Well…

885
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,204
I mean…

886
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:09,251
Imagine what people would say
if we kept hanging out together.

887
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:13,172
They thought we were back together again
just because we went to Seoul once.

888
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:18,552
Anyway, when I was young,
I went to a lot of places to take photos.

889
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:22,681
If I go around, I should be able
to find at least one good spot.

890
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:43,577
Wait.

891
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:49,875
This looks like the cosmos field
in Jeonghan-ri.

892
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,085
Excuse me?

893
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,711
I'll be right there.

894
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:55,172
Here's your rice.

895
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,924
-Thank you.
-Enjoy your meal.

896
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,050
Wow.

897
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,637
This is a great shot.

898
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,055
-Doesn't it look great?
-Yes.

899
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,682
It's so nice.

900
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,395
Hello. Is the food all right?

901
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:10,729
It's delicious.

902
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:13,190
You must be photographers, right?

903
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,777
I'm sorry, but I have a question.

904
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,487
My friend took this photo.

905
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,280
Do you know where this is?

906
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,033
Can't you ask your friend who took it?

907
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:27,663
Well, the thing is,
she stopped taking photos.

908
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:31,250
If I take her there as a surprise,
she might want to start again.

909
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,002
Gosh, what a deep friendship.

910
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:35,129
Let me see.

911
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,589
Oh, this place?

912
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,758
We went here often.

913
00:53:39,842 --> 00:53:41,718
You can't take photos here now.

914
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,221
What? Why not?

915
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,524
How did they find out about this place?

916
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,484
What did I tell you?

917
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,778
All of our secret places
when we were young

918
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,364
have become tourist spots now.
Everyone knows.

919
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:05,868
How did they find out
about such a secluded area?

920
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,662
They looked it up
on the internet, of course.

921
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:12,499
But it was my secret place.

922
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,751
Just take photos of those areas like this.

923
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:15,878
That looks nice.

924
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:19,298
No matter what angle I use,
people are going to be in frame.

925
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,009
I'll pass.

926
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,677
But…

927
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,685
You know this place, right?

928
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,020
It's the same as that, right?

929
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,856
Well, it seems so.

930
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,441
Where is this place?

931
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,860
-This place is…
-Yes?

932
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,653
Mado Resort.

933
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,031
Sorry?

934
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,409
But how is this a resort?

935
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,626
What did I tell you?

936
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,961
You should listen to me.

937
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:00,964
It's been about ten years
since this resort was built.

938
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:09,389
What on earth happened here
in the past 18 years?

939
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:12,726
The island is nothing but tourists
and tourist spots.

940
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,436
The island's been totally ruined.

941
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,605
Watch what you're saying.

942
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,441
It's good to have a lot of tourists.

943
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:22,778
Does all of Jeju
have to be the a remote area?

944
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,071
Goodness.

945
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:27,699
Why did you come here, anyway?
This place seriously isn't it.

946
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:29,952
What do you mean?
I still have a place left.

947
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:33,914
This isn't a good place for a resort
or a tourist spot. Come on.

948
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,542
It's not that way.

949
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:38,085
It is. Hurry up.ar

950
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,301
People found out about this too?

951
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,601
This was going to be
my secret weapon though.

952
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:58,730
What did I tell you?

953
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:02,568
Are you upset?

954
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:06,196
Upset about what?

955
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,657
Even I've changed.

956
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,119
So it was greedy of me to want
these places to not change either.

957
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,956
Goodness, I'm sure
everything's changed now.

958
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,502
There might be something that hasn't.

959
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:29,469
Let's go now.

960
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:36,685
-Isn't that Cho Eun-hye?
-Cho Eun-hye?

961
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,103
That abuse of power photographer?

962
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,396
It is Cho Eun-hye.

963
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:44,276
What? Is she having fun in Jeju
after doing what she did?

964
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,445
Unbelievable. She must have no conscience.

965
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:48,530
Excuse me.

966
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,867
-How could you say that--
-Forget it. Let's just go.

967
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:58,957
Excuse me.

968
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:00,542
Yes?

969
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:03,670
Could you press the shutter button for us?

970
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:05,797
Me?

971
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:08,008
You see, we came here on our own.

972
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,676
Can you help us take some pictures?

973
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:14,640
Well…

974
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,516
Sure. Why not?

975
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,101
-Thank you.
-No problem.

976
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:38,956
Your faces don't look clear
because of the sunlight.

977
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,207
Could you stand over here?

978
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,291
Okay.

979
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,799
All right. I'll take it now.

980
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,222
Well…

981
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:04,147
I think it would look better
if you faced each other.

982
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:05,983
How about trying that?

983
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:08,318
And maybe smile a little too?

984
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:10,112
Try smiling brightly and laughing.

985
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,781
I'll take two different versions.

986
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,116
-Okay.
-Okay.

987
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,200
All right.

988
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:17,202
Smile.

989
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,039
Now, giggle.

990
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:23,291
-Giggle.
-Giggle.

991
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:24,418
Good.

992
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,214
Thank you.

993
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,342
Holy cow.

994
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,012
The photos look so good!

995
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:36,513
Excuse me.

996
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,017
I'm sorry,
but could you take photos of us too?

997
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,978
We came on our own too.

998
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:51,236
Sure, I'll help.

999
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:07,919
What are you doing here?

1000
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:10,505
Waiting for Gyeong-tae. Why are you here?

1001
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:11,923
To buy something.

1002
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,008
Right.

1003
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:15,886
Do you know this place?

1004
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,766
I have no idea.

1005
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:22,267
Damn it.

1006
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,437
Isn't that a photo
Sam-dal took a long time ago?

1007
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,147
Why do you have it?

1008
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,733
I wanted to take her there
so she could take photos.

1009
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:31,818
Where is this?

1010
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,113
Sang-do.

1011
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:37,449
Do you

1012
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,743
still like Sam-dal?

1013
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:46,833
Bye.

1014
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,717
-I don't know.
-Don't know what?

1015
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,513
Wait, where are you going?

1016
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,057
Come with us.

1017
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:03,558
Where are you going?

1018
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:06,228
They want to build
a power plant in town again.

1019
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,854
We're having a meeting about it.

1020
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,147
We have to stop those plans.

1021
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:11,441
A high-ranking government official
is coming.

1022
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,110
It's pretty serious this time.

1023
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:17,239
If they build something like that here,
don't they pay you compensation?

1024
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:20,325
Then, you won't need to dive.
Isn't it a good thing?

1025
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:22,035
Stop talking nonsense!

1026
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:26,248
We should at least go outnumber them,
so enough nonsense and follow us.

1027
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,999
Yes, your mom is right.

1028
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:31,878
We need as many people as we can get
if we're going to oppose them.

1029
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,509
Why do we need to go too?

1030
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:38,760
-Should we go?
-Go.

1031
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:39,845
Mom.

1032
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:41,596
Goodness.

1033
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:44,224
He should be here by now.

1034
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,019
Why is Ms. Ko not here?

1035
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,313
I don't know. This is so frustrating.

1036
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,399
Goodness, he's here!

1037
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:04,369
-Hello, sir!
-Hello, sir!

1038
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,582
You…

1039
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,631
Why are there so many cars parked here?

1040
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:24,639
Ms. Ko, you should leave.

1041
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,016
What are you talking about?

1042
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,058
Just go.

1043
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,813
What nonsense are you planning
to do to our town this time?

1044
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,527
What?

1045
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,737
Leave.

1046
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,363
What's with them?

1047
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:01,801
Darn it. I couldn't take
a single photo for myself.

1048
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:06,806
You say that,
but you don't feel bad, do you?

1049
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,559
You weren't even planning to take photos.

1050
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:11,227
You didn't bring your camera.

1051
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:13,897
Don't be ridiculous.
Why wouldn't I bring my camera?

1052
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,446
Jeju's sunset really is beautiful.

1053
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,865
-Hey, stop the car!
-Why?

1054
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,033
-Pull over.
-Why?

1055
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:27,035
-Why all of a sudden?
-Pull over there. Now.

1056
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,078
Not there. Here.

1057
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,287
You're taking a U-turn?

1058
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,511
The sky is really beautiful today.

1059
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:47,013
I haven't seen the sky
like this in a long time.

1060
01:02:49,224 --> 01:02:50,308
Right, my camera.

1061
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,561
I thought you didn't bring
your camera. You have one?

1062
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,232
-You do have a camera.
-Yeah.

1063
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:08,159
Cho Sam-dal. She used this.

1064
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,382
Hey.

1065
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:24,843
Is this the only one left?

1066
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,095
I thought they wouldn't sell.

1067
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,930
Do people still buy these cameras?

1068
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:31,099
-They're popular nowadays.
-Really?

1069
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:34,311
Ms. Ko's second daughter
and Sang-do bought some just today.

1070
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:35,603
Sang-do?

1071
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:38,231
Answer the phone, Sam-dal.

1072
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:46,549
You were right.

1073
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,094
Some things haven't changed.

1074
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,181
I meant the sky.

1075
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,517
See?

1076
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,936
Some things stay the same
even if time goes by.

1077
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:58,937
Perhaps like me?

1078
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:02,357
What are you talking about?

1079
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,985
Don't you have a lot
of good, expensive cameras?

1080
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,113
Why suddenly use a disposable one?

1081
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,742
Do you know
what my nickname was in the industry?

1082
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,663
I don't take unnecessary photos.

1083
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,165
That's what helped me
become famous at first.

1084
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,212
Then, this camera has helped you.

1085
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:25,964
That's right.

1086
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:26,923
Do you remember?

1087
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:29,926
Back in high school,
Mom wouldn't buy me a camera,

1088
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,512
so I saved up my allowance
and practiced with this.

1089
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,931
I took each photo
so carefully back then.

1090
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,892
That's when I learned
not to simply press the shutter.

1091
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:42,230
When I think back on it now,
it was a very good habit.

1092
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:46,067
It's better not to take a photo
if it's going to be deleted anyway.

1093
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,069
But…

1094
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,907
the pictures you took
by mistake and deleted

1095
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:58,538
might be meaningful
to someone else, right?

1096
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:05,795
Like your memory.

1097
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:10,800
Why do you keep mentioning…

1098
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:12,677
Okay, fine.

1099
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:14,679
Let's hear it.

1100
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,723
What did I say to you that day?

1101
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:17,974
What was it?

1102
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:21,728
You confessed.

1103
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,316
What…

1104
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,109
What?

1105
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,486
Hey.

1106
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:34,073
That was absolute nonsense!

1107
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:35,783
I said I had feelings for you?

1108
01:06:36,451 --> 01:06:39,495
Gosh, I must've been crazy!

1109
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:41,164
-That was--
-You confessed.

1110
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:44,792
You said you liked me.

1111
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,047
And I said I liked you too.

1112
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,893
Why…

1113
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:05,355
We should go. Let's go.

1114
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,172
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

1115
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:19,804
Sang-do, you made it!

1116
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:22,348
Sang-do, be careful
when you get off the bus.

1117
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:23,975
-Check if it's the right stop.
-Hurry.

1118
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,435
Or you might get lost.

1119
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:27,729
He's not a fool.
The food's getting cold, so hurry.

1120
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:28,896
-Hurry up!
-Got it?

1121
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:30,273
Okay, just you wait.

1122
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:31,524
I'm almost there.

1123
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:57,884
I like you, Sam-dal.

1124
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:14,692
What's with you?
Why do you keep holding hands?

1125
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:16,861
You'll get a heat rash.
Can you believe them?

1126
01:09:17,445 --> 01:09:19,364
I almost called the cops on them.

1127
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:21,866
If you're so annoyed,
then get a girlfriend too.

1128
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,370
The biggest variable…

1129
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:28,706
I couldn't predict…

1130
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:05,785
Hey, Cho Sam-dal! Wait.

1131
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,495
Why are you running away?

1132
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,581
Stop sneaking up silently on me like that.

1133
01:10:10,665 --> 01:10:13,501
-Where are you going?
-Why do you keep getting butterflies?

1134
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:15,378
The Jomnyeo Squad's here.

1135
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,088
The Jomnyeo Squad? But why?

1136
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:18,631
This is really bad.

1137
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,884
Why are they only doing this to me?

1138
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,636
Why is an ex worse than a stranger?

1139
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,846
We'd never forget.

1140
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,098
The reason why we broke up.

1141
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,141
Can I…

1142
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,309
make you waver a bit more?

1143
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:31,769
So just…

1144
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:33,771
You can just lean on me.

1145
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:39,694
