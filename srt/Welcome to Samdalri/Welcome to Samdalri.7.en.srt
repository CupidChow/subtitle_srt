1
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:46,922
8 YEARS AGO

3
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,491
You must be going somewhere far away
to even cancel your phone plan.

4
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,826
-Yes. Here you go.
-Thank you.

5
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,121
What about the data on your phone?

6
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,456
-Please erase it.
-Okay.

7
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,948
Can you text me the reference
that the magazine sent you?

8
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,282
I'll check it right away.

9
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,367
Bye.

10
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,554
Just when I'd thought
that I had completely let him go…

11
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,557
Perhaps

12
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,853
that was when
I was clinging onto him the most.

13
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,950
EPISODE 7
BREAKING UP, WITH LOVE

14
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,517
Ok is outside again.

15
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,938
She spent all her life
working like a dog as a haenyeo.

16
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,023
She must be sick of the sea,

17
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,234
so why is she always out there?

18
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,904
I wouldn't even look
at the sea if I were her.

19
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,572
Yeah, right.

20
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,117
You even came to work
with a cast around your broken leg.

21
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,832
That's when my husband lost
all his money investing in hot springs

22
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:35,168
and when Gyeong-tae ran off with my money.

23
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,839
She's right.

24
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:43,343
She broke her leg when she fell
while chasing after Gyeong-tae.

25
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,386
You're right.

26
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,137
Laugh it up.

27
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,272
The sea is the best place to be
when you're troubled.

28
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,317
It's peaceful,
and no one bothers you there. Right?

29
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,987
-I disagree.
-Goodness, Ms. Ko.

30
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,323
You really like the sea
despite everything you've gone through.

31
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,408
-Right.
-Right.

32
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,536
There's no such thing as an easy job.

33
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:14,624
But what's good is we neither have to
retire nor compete with others.

34
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,294
We earn as much as we work,

35
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,713
and can keep working
as long as we're healthy.

36
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,131
That's true.

37
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,217
The sea provides our children
with food and tuition.

38
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,761
-Right.
-Right.

39
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,434
Goodness, Ms. Ko.

40
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,477
Yong-pil told you to keep that on.

41
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,688
Gosh, just leave it on.

42
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,898
Yong-pil will be hurt if he sees it.

43
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,526
Why? It's too worn out.
I should take it off.

44
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,280
By the way, where is he?
I haven't seen him since yesterday.

45
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,823
Yong-pil?

46
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,700
He went to the mainland yesterday.

47
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,743
He took a half day off.

48
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,744
-What?
-He did.

49
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,413
Why would he need
to take a half day and go there?

50
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,372
Beats me.

51
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,125
Eun-u heard it at the office.
He doesn't know why either.

52
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,460
-Eun-u said that?
-Yeah.

53
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,379
I thought the Power Rangers
knew everything about each other.

54
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,298
I thought they knew nothing at all.

55
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,303
Goodness, you startled me. What is it?

56
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,221
Nothing.

57
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,890
I'll get going first.

58
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,225
Make sure to wrap up and go home.

59
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,185
What?

60
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,937
-You're leaving?
-Ms. Ko!

61
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,024
What's going on?

62
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,784
Sang-tae.

63
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,746
Goodness, why are you carrying so much?

64
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,123
Goodness. Going somewhere?

65
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,500
My daughter's place in the city.

66
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,001
-Gosh.
-And you?

67
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,754
On my way to an eye doctor
in the city. My vision's blurry.

68
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,132
Let me carry them. You can't do it alone.

69
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,176
You'll collapse on your way there.

70
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,178
Gosh, you're so kind.

71
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,888
You're always too kind.

72
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:52,973
Let's go.

73
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,023
Let's go, ma'am.

74
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,197
What's the matter?

75
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,117
I'm afraid I'll have to
catch the next bus.

76
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,745
-Can you take these to her seat?
-Sure.

77
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,541
You're not getting on? You'll have to
wait a long time for the next bus.

78
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,625
Take care.

79
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,134
Aren't we going to go?

80
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,176
Yes, sir.

81
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,219
Get your hands off her!

82
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,016
Let's go.

83
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,487
Is that you, Mom?

84
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,033
What are you doing?

85
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,206
Why do you have that?

86
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,418
Sam-dal,

87
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,047
do you still have feelings for Yong-pil?

88
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,969
That was so random.
What are you talking about?

89
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,763
Jeez.

90
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:57,680
This.

91
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,142
Did you really go to Seoul by yourself?

92
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,063
Well…

93
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,611
Grandma, I'm hungry.

94
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,695
Gosh.

95
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,447
-Me too, Mom.
-Gosh.

96
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,074
-Let's eat.
-I want food.

97
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,701
-Ha-yul, wash your hands.
-Okay.

98
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,715
Whatever.

99
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,395
What could he still be doing outside
on this tiny island?

100
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,818
I'm so bored.

101
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,738
You're still not over her, are you?

102
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,790
Are you still not over her, Yong-pil?

103
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,463
Does it seem that way?

104
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,758
Then, is it okay if I like her?

105
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,811
I've always liked her.

106
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,023
I liked her when you guys were dating.

107
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,942
I liked her even before that.

108
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,574
I wasn't going to tell you.

109
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,161
But whenever I see you,

110
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,915
it gnaws at me and I feel guilty.

111
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,424
Never mind. You don't have to answer me.

112
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,428
You must be confused
and flustered right now.

113
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,471
I'm sure you are.

114
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,556
Do I have to be?

115
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,392
Do I

116
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,812
have to feel confused

117
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,732
and flustered?

118
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,364
I said I have feelings for Sam-dal.

119
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,283
Are you okay with that?

120
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,411
Yeah.

121
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,746
What?

122
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,042
Hey, Yong-pil.

123
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,126
Yeah?

124
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,756
I used to like Sam-dal.

125
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,552
I really liked her a lot.

126
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,639
But because of you,

127
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,016
I couldn't tell her that.

128
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,770
I hate you.

129
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,691
I used to like Sam-dal.

130
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,193
No.

131
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,112
I still do.

132
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,032
But because of you…

133
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,084
You dummy.

134
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,712
You really should see a doctor.

135
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,046
This is serious.

136
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,425
I watched this documentary recently.

137
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,428
What was it called again?
Alcohol-induced blackouts?

138
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:27,181
It's the gateway to dementia.
It could really be the death of you.

139
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,476
Wait. I've told you this before?

140
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,812
Yes, about 17…

141
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,855
No, wait.

142
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,650
Including the last time you told me,
I've heard this a total of 18 times.

143
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,861
-17 times?
-I didn't want to embarrass you,

144
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,987
so I tried to forget.

145
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,198
But every time I almost forget
about it, you bring it up.

146
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,658
Jeez, you idiot.

147
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:46,784
Come to your senses.

148
00:13:49,287 --> 00:13:51,372
I really don't remember telling him.

149
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,750
Hey, Sang-do.

150
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,634
You shouldn't feel bad…

151
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,056
about liking someone, don't you think?

152
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,770
And you definitely
don't need anyone's permission to do it.

153
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,692
So don't feel guilty about it.

154
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,071
It's how you feel.

155
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,031
So do as your heart says.

156
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,909
It's not like you stole something,
so don't worry about me.

157
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:28,951
You're too kind.

158
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,082
How could I ever do that?

159
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,168
If you're still not over her,

160
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,295
then how can I like her?

161
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,716
That's why I'm asking you, Yong-pil.

162
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,638
Do you still have feelings for Sam-dal?

163
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,309
Hi, you two.

164
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,522
What are you doing out here in the rain?

165
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,066
You should at least be under some eaves.

166
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,026
You're going to catch a cold.

167
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,158
Don't touch them.

168
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,075
Why not?

169
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:56,038
Their mother will abandon her kittens
if they're touched by humans.

170
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,915
-Seriously? She'll do that?
-Yeah.

171
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,506
How long are we going to stay here?

172
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,217
It's been an hour already.
My legs are killing me.

173
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,636
If we leave, they'll get drenched.

174
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,599
I would've brought an umbrella
if you'd predicted the weather correctly.

175
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,267
But you're just a fraud.

176
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,351
Excuse me?

177
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,937
I'm still a trainee.
I'm not a forecaster yet.

178
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,647
Jeez.

179
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:25,026
And there's no point in forecasting
the weather in Jeju nowadays.

180
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,737
It's obviously going to rain
every single day.

181
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,448
-It's true.
-All right.

182
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,700
Look at how cute you are
getting all worked up.

183
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,661
I feel so bad for them.

184
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,873
They're kittens, so it's dangerous
if they catch a cold.

185
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,042
What should we do?

186
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,339
It's so refreshing!

187
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,633
Come here! You're going to go bald.

188
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,260
We're in Jeju. The rain here is clean!

189
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,013
-This is awesome!
-You'll catch a cold. Come here.

190
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,354
You can't kiss me!
The neighbors might see us!

191
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,399
-Hey.
-Let's go.

192
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,420
SHINING JEJU, TOWARDS THE FUTURE TOGETHER

193
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,798
Cho Jin-dal
from Samdal Girls' High is back?

194
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,216
The one from Rosebay Gang?

195
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:34,178
Yeah, I could never forget her.
I suffered so much because of her.

196
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,056
Yeah, because you always bullied
the kids from her school.

197
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,057
Gosh.

198
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,017
Aren't you going home?

199
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,811
-Yes, we are.
-Yes, we're leaving.

200
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,689
Why is she back though?

201
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,524
What do you mean? Didn't you hear?

202
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,693
Because of her sister Cho Eun-hye,

203
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,571
that famous photographer
who made headlines recently.

204
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,906
All three came back
because her career failed.

205
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,741
They couldn't show their faces in Seoul.

206
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:57,910
Who?

207
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,745
Who's here?

208
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,915
Right. You live in Samdal-ri.
The leader of the haenyeos…

209
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,002
Sam… Sam-dal's back?

210
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,629
To live in Jeju?

211
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,048
Gosh.

212
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,468
Almost there.

213
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,262
Damn it.

214
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,685
Isn't he a forecaster? How could he
leave his window open when it's raining?

215
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,611
Damn it!

216
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:35,656
Darn it.

217
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:47,960
What are you doing?

218
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:21,911
Are you okay--

219
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,578
I'm really fine.

220
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,456
I don't need any ointment for my elbow.

221
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,083
You know what?

222
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,460
If I get a scar here like this,

223
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,629
it'll look like…

224
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,882
Like I have a story to tell.

225
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,302
I'd look like a mysterious guy
with a cool scar on…

226
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,185
Let me see your arm.

227
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,062
Okay.

228
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:35,693
Just bear it.

229
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,794
It's your fault for startling me.

230
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,296
And what about you?

231
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:59,550
Why were you climbing my wall
and peeking into my room?

232
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,011
Well, because…

233
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,640
Are you even a forecaster?
Why leave your window open when it rains?

234
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:10,936
Don't you remember getting your mattress
all drenched the last time you did that?

235
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,271
Right, I remember.

236
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,317
My mattress became
squeaky clean because of that.

237
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,069
You call that squeaky clean?
It made you reek for months.

238
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,571
Is that so?

239
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:25,868
I get it. You were worried I'd reek,
so that's why you climbed my wall

240
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,745
and peeked inside my room.

241
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,831
Hey, I'm not a pervert.

242
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,958
The window was open!

243
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,461
All right, already. The window.

244
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,130
Fine. You wanted to close the window.

245
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,341
That's why you climbed my wall

246
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,510
-and peeked inside.
-You better watch it.

247
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,389
Jeez, how can you be still so annoying?

248
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,141
Look at you all sopping wet.

249
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,602
Don't tell anyone you're a forecaster.

250
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,562
No one will believe the forecast.

251
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:57,525
You know, there's a lot of things
about me you seem to overlook.

252
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,485
To be honest,

253
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,030
I'm actually the best forecaster
of the Jeju Office.

254
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,783
That's me.

255
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,536
It's the truth.

256
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:12,623
HQ calls me multiple times a day
because they want to recruit me.

257
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,500
It's no joke. I'm in high demand.

258
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,378
You know, I've been curious about that.

259
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,046
Others are dying to join HQ,

260
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,507
but I heard you've been refusing to go.

261
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,885
Why? Do you have some treasure
hidden on this island?

262
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:27,638
Hey.

263
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,768
It's not like I'd become
any more successful

264
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,146
if I went to suffer
in a far off place full of strangers.

265
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,774
A dragon rises from a small stream, right?

266
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,026
Be the dragon in Seoul.
I'll be the stream.

267
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,904
Small stream, my foot.

268
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,117
You're a real piece of work.

269
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,995
Hey, it stopped raining.

270
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,126
It's not raining anymore.

271
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:22,860
Hey, Yong-pil.

272
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,737
Yeah?

273
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,782
Don't tell my mom

274
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,412
that we went to Seoul together.

275
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:02,149
SEOUL TO JEJU

276
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,052
FORECAST LOG

277
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:49,947
Come on, Dad. Why are you
in my room and touching my stuff?

278
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,782
This is my house, not your room.

279
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,787
Where's your lotion? I ran out of mine.

280
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,249
Here.

281
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,584
It's brand new, so you can keep it.

282
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:05,838
Hey, Yong-pil.

283
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,173
You should join HQ.

284
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,593
Here we go again.
You've been speaking to Director Han.

285
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,513
I don't have any privacy
at work or even in town.

286
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,639
I'm an adult, you know.

287
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:18,183
You can get a promotion if you join HQ.

288
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,227
You should go while their offer stands.

289
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,688
They won't want you there when you're old.

290
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,858
You'll be monitoring the weather
in Korea and around the world too.

291
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,610
You won't have to jot things down in that.

292
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:31,530
I was just doodling. That's all.

293
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,490
Why were you snooping around my room?

294
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,367
I'm not joining HQ.

295
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,915
What? What is it?

296
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,544
Why do you keep trying
to send me to the mainland?

297
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,715
I'll leave as soon as you get remarried.

298
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,719
Then, at least come home early.

299
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,305
You've been coming home late.

300
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,815
What is it now?

301
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:11,069
You can keep it.
It doesn't suit my skin type.

302
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,197
Old folks like me need
something with more oil.

303
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,829
Dae-yeong? Goodness! Move.

304
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:21,914
It's insane, right?

305
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,709
How could she run into the president
of AS Group here in Jeju?

306
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,419
I had no idea either.

307
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,005
It was so absurd, so I looked it up.

308
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,883
He's here
for that theme park in Namdal-ri.

309
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,136
-Gosh.
-What on earth is this?

310
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:39,640
Goodness, his face.

311
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,392
-What happened?
-Poor Dae-yeong.

312
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,688
To be honest, his family was the problem.

313
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,398
He wasn't that bad.

314
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,777
Hey, Dae-yeong and his family
are inseparable.

315
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,990
By the way,

316
00:26:57,074 --> 00:27:00,786
why are you always in here
instead of our big living room? Get out.

317
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,499
Are you going somewhere?

318
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,584
Here it is.

319
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:08,752
Where are you going?

320
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,005
To find Cho Sam-dal.

321
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,383
What?

322
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,857
Hey, where you going?

323
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,316
Going hiking?

324
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,443
To Hallasan Mountain?

325
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,612
No.

326
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:40,158
I'm going to find Cho Sam-dal
instead of Cho Eun-hye.

327
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:42,953
What are you talking about?

328
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:47,332
You told me to find Cho Sam-dal. Remember?

329
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,376
Right, I did say that.

330
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,003
But…

331
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,588
Don't tell me…

332
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,675
No way.

333
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:58,468
What?

334
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,679
Don't tell me

335
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,182
you're off to find yourself

336
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:05,809
on the Jeju Olle Trail?

337
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,562
Yes, I am.

338
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,107
Where can I find myself?

339
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,444
Where?

340
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,958
FINDING MYSELF ON THE JEJU OLLE TRAIL

341
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,005
"Finding myself on the Jeju Olle Trail"?

342
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,092
Sam-dal, you're hilarious.

343
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:41,595
You're still just as silly
as you used to be.

344
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,306
You don't have to go that far to find her.

345
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,017
She's right here. This is Cho Sam-dal.

346
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,020
Is this funny to you? Is it?

347
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,688
You told me to find myself.

348
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,774
Yes, I did say that.

349
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,402
But I didn't think
you'd make a huge deal out of it.

350
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,738
You look all set to climb the Himalayas.

351
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,949
Stop teasing me and just go.

352
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,158
Do you need a ride?

353
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:04,910
No, just go.

354
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:05,953
All right.

355
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,206
Good luck!

356
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,547
What's his deal?

357
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,970
It's not going to be easy
to find Cho Sam-dal.

358
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,243
You shouldn't feel bad

359
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,287
about liking someone, don't you think?

360
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,540
That's why I'm asking you, Yong-pil.

361
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:56,294
Do you still have feelings for Sam-dal?

362
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,843
Or have you left the past behind
and just see her as a friend now?

363
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:09,433
If I told you I wasn't still over her,

364
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,894
would you stop liking her? No…

365
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,522
Would it even be possible?

366
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,318
No…

367
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,194
No.

368
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,947
I'm still going to like her.

369
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:27,951
Okay. Then, that's good.

370
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:29,953
I'll answer your question.

371
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,122
It's not that…

372
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,584
I couldn't get over her.

373
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,299
I just chose not to.

374
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,513
The thing is

375
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,141
I've…

376
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,520
never tried to get over Sam-dal.

377
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:26,862
We should go now, sir.

378
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,114
She must've seen me.

379
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:30,782
Sir?

380
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:32,367
I'm talking about Jin-dal.

381
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,287
Do you think

382
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,873
she saw me that day?

383
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,628
Do you mean Ms. Cho?

384
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,883
Judging by the angle of her turned head…

385
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,510
She saw you.

386
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,101
How was my expression? Did I look okay?

387
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,606
You looked

388
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,442
absolutely terrified, sir.

389
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,110
Damn it!

390
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,617
Human instincts are truly a mystery.

391
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,412
What's next on the agenda?

392
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,665
You'll rest at the hotel
until evening, then head to city hall--

393
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:21,708
Dae-yeong.

394
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,461
Hey.

395
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,423
I saw that you landed
in the headlines again.

396
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,509
It's an incredible nickname.
"Clumsy Dae-yeong."

397
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,678
I heard some entertainment journalists

398
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,640
are becoming business reporters
solely to cover him.

399
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,601
You should work out regularly.

400
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,354
A real man should have strong legs.

401
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,813
Oh, right. You're divorced.

402
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:46,524
I guess there's no need for them.
Sorry, little brother.

403
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,817
Could you please stop joking--

404
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:51,863
Uncle must be worried sick
about handing over the business to you.

405
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,241
Thanks to your ex-wife,

406
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,993
the entire nation cussed out
your family for abuse of power.

407
00:33:57,077 --> 00:34:01,331
We spent tens of billions of won
trying to restore our company's value!

408
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,085
Jeon Dae-yeong, come to your senses.

409
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,087
Or let us manage the company instead.

410
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,422
All you do is cause trouble.

411
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,597
Why, hello there.

412
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,809
I've been learning taekwondo these days.

413
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,273
I've trained so much
that whenever I blow my top,

414
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:28,858
I automatically throw a kick.

415
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,279
My goodness, your legs.

416
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,614
You should work them out.

417
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:37,242
A real man should…

418
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,160
Right.

419
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,497
You already use them
here and there a lot. That's right.

420
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,918
What is this, Jin-dal?
Where are your manners?

421
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,462
Manners? Oh, yes.

422
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,507
Manners are definitely important.

423
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,344
It's my motto
to mirror the person in front of me

424
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,097
and treat them the way they treat others.

425
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:05,145
And I can't teach dogs to talk, now can I?

426
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,563
-Dogs?
-Yes.

427
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,772
Yes!

428
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:09,316
What are you doing? Let's go!

429
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,610
-Dogs?
-You're embarrassing me!

430
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:16,656
Serves you right.

431
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,325
Honey…

432
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:28,918
Sir?

433
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,212
Sir?

434
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,381
Yeah?

435
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,716
Are you all right?

436
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:36,718
Yes.

437
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:44,225
I think he's become
an even bigger idiot since the divorce.

438
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,400
Secretary Ko.

439
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,653
What town did you say she lived in?

440
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:57,739
Sudal-ri?

441
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,698
Hudal-ri?

442
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,535
Three…

443
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,621
Right. Samdal-ri!

444
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,876
Hello.

445
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,048
All right, Ha-yul.

446
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,968
Put anything you want in this basket.

447
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,137
It's my treat.

448
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,889
What's the occasion?

449
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,225
You make it sound
like I don't buy you anything.

450
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,566
I heard you didn't like this town.

451
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:40,156
To be honest, I hate it too.
It's so irritating.

452
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,743
What do you do when you're irritated?
You shop. Okay?

453
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:46,121
Okay. Now go.

454
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,423
KIDS BINOCULARS

455
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,939
A ghost that feeds on alcohol
must be haunting our house.

456
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:17,444
I keep buying them,
and they keep disappearing.

457
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:21,114
There are three ghosts
that feed on alcohol at our house.

458
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,700
Are you done already?

459
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,077
What did you pick? Let me see.

460
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,330
HANGOVER TONIC
KIDS BINOCULARS

461
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:31,916
Binoculars?
462

462
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,800
I didn't pick these because I like them.

463
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:43,803
I just had nothing to buy.

464
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,097
You should hurry up too.

465
00:37:57,192 --> 00:38:00,528
AS BEER

466
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:04,949
Just how better could this beer be
compared to other brands?

467
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,952
This must've been that idiot's idea.

468
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,579
Jeez.

469
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,584
Goodness!

470
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,629
My goodness.

471
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,256
Mr. Ko.

472
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:22,717
How have you been, ma'am?

473
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,345
Well…

474
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,224
You can walk home by yourself?

475
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,518
I know this town like the back of my hand.

476
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,270
Yes. You're right.

477
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,148
Bye.

478
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,780
-Please sit down.
-Yes, ma'am.

479
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,453
I see you're still boycotting AS products.

480
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:51,996
Well…

481
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:57,961
Isn't it only natural for a divorcée
to boycott her ex-in-laws' products?

482
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,046
But you did that
when you were married too.

483
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,270
It's good to see that you're doing better.

484
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,648
I'm glad you're still working there.

485
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:21,067
No one's bothering you now, right?

486
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,318
All thanks to you, ma'am.

487
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:24,863
You taught them
all a lesson before you left.

488
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,283
When did you return to Jeju?

489
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:33,079
The way we met again after four years
was quite intense, wasn't it?

490
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,373
Right. Tell me about it.

491
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:38,167
It just had to be the day
when I looked like that.

492
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,378
I looked pathetic, right?

493
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,296
No.

494
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,009
You looked ten times cooler
than when you were married.

495
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,597
What brings you here anyway?

496
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,101
I felt bad

497
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,520
that I never called you.

498
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:04,319
Thanks to you, we're finally being treated
like decent human beings.

499
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:06,946
You're our savior.

500
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,617
Yet we didn't call you
even once out of fear.

501
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,036
We're terrible people.

502
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:16,956
What did I tell you?

503
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,334
You're not the terrible ones.

504
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,420
The terrible ones were petty enough
to forbid you from seeing me,

505
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,465
so why are you blaming yourself
for not risking your job?

506
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:30,345
You're innocent, so stop blaming
yourselves as if you were guilty.

507
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:32,972
I knew it.

508
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:34,891
You're still the same.

509
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,917
Where's Namchun?

510
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:07,173
Hi, Mom.

511
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,925
I'm at the beach right now.

512
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,765
First, contact the ship owners

513
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,810
and check when they last spotted Namchun.

514
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:22,313
The Ministry of Oceans
will find Namchun's last-known location,

515
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,606
so let's wait for them.

516
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,240
What?

517
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,325
Sir, could you drop me off here?

518
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,379
I'll continue to check the coast!

519
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,507
Come on, Namchun.

520
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,010
PLEASE INSERT 500 WON

521
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,094
Five hundred won?

522
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,150
Damn it.

523
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,159
Are you alone?

524
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,787
Then, I'll come over to where you are.

525
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,664
Okay, wait for me there.

526
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,796
What's he doing?

527
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,429
Excuse me!

528
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,725
What's the matter?

529
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,435
Do you have a 500-won coin?

530
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,358
Who was that?

531
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,072
Just some guy who's a bit dumb.

532
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,745
-Just a 500-won coin.
-Well…

533
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,706
Sure. Okay.

534
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,791
Just a minute.

535
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,673
Thank you so much!

536
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,265
She's not here.

537
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,310
Come on, where are you?

538
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,522
Come on. Let me see you.

539
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,984
Excuse me.

540
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,904
What's your name?

541
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,948
Please show yourself.

542
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,075
Where are you from? Where's your guardian?

543
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,284
Please…

544
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,746
Do you not know your name?

545
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,415
Or do you perhaps have a name tag?

546
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,753
I can't help him if I don't know his name.

547
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:53,047
Do you really not know your name?

548
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,465
Namchun!

549
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,551
There we go!

550
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,011
Namchun is over there!

551
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,638
Namchun!

552
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,682
-Jeez!
-Nam-chun?

553
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,020
Right. 500 won.

554
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:13,359
Well…

555
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,029
-I don't have any money right now, but--
-Nam-chun?

556
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,115
-Sorry?
-So that's your name!

557
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:23,452
Goodness, it's very dangerous
to be wandering around here all alone.

558
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,872
Where did you come from, Nam-chun?

559
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:27,540
Me?

560
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,876
I'm from the center.

561
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,004
Right, the center.

562
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,631
Okay. Can you tell me
the name of the center?

563
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:41,804
JEJU WELFARE CENTER

564
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,264
I see.

565
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,349
-You meant this kind of center?
-Yes.

566
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:48,644
I'm going to see if it's nearby,
so tell me the name.

567
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:52,315
JEJU BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN GROUP
PRESIDENT GONG JI-CHAN

568
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:56,110
"Dolphin Center President…"

569
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,954
Look, I'm sorry.

570
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:10,458
I mean, you were shouting
and talking to yourself so--

571
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,667
Talking to myself?

572
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,961
Didn't you see Namchun
jump out back there?

573
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:16,172
We hadn't been able to
track her since yesterday.

574
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,382
I was worried sick,
so I wasn't in my right mind.

575
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:19,842
Exactly.

576
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:22,887
I had no idea
you were so passionate about dolphins.

577
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,306
It took me six years to free Namchun.

578
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,516
It's not just passion.
She's like my child.

579
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,478
How could a parent be sane
when their child's missing?

580
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,564
I guess you're right.

581
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,191
How could it be like his child?

582
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,068
What did you just say?

583
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,072
Forget it.

584
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,907
No, wait.

585
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,533
No, look.

586
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:47,620
It's understandable
if the dolphin's like a child to you.

587
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,955
Of course.

588
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,665
Ha-yul!

589
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:53,459
That kid…

590
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,253
Goodness.

591
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,341
What's this?

592
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,678
You told me not to hang out
with weird strangers.

593
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,307
So why are you here with this dumb guy?

594
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,352
Let me get this straight, kid.

595
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:15,356
So she told you not to hang out
with me because I was dumb?

596
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:18,317
-I can explain--
-This dumb guy is leaving.

597
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:20,736
Unbelievable! Dumb?

598
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,654
Hold on.

599
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,615
I'll feel terrible
if I let you leave like this.

600
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:28,119
The 500 won. You don't need
to pay me back, okay?

601
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,453
Shall we call it even?

602
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,639
What are you doing? That was dangerous.

603
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,516
Goodness.

604
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,186
Let's go.

605
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,023
Aunt Hae-dal!

606
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,735
Let's go, Aunt Hae-dal.

607
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:04,447
What…

608
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:06,574
Ha-yul.

609
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:08,993
Ha-yul.

610
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,049
Are you still putting in requests
for your reinstatement?

611
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,844
Why do you ask?
Are you going to dissuade me?

612
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,346
Because it won't happen?

613
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,808
I know AS Group's preventing it.

614
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:37,813
But I'm going to keep trying.

615
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,610
There aren't any reasons
for me to be disqualified.

616
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,528
Why should I give up?

617
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:49,742
-Or you could ask Mr. Jeon--
-Don't.

618
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,869
Don't you dare bring up that idiot.

619
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,830
Just don't let me see him.

620
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:05,508
Mr. Jeon.

621
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:07,968
Secretary Ko.

622
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:16,393
What brings you here, sir?

623
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,521
What?

624
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,524
What… Why?

625
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:23,818
Well…

626
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,028
What was it again?

627
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,491
-I came here looking for you.
-Sir?

628
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,575
What?

629
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:33,661
Well…

630
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:39,542
I wanted to visit the Jeju Sambangsan
Carbonate Hot Springs,

631
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,210
but the car was gone.

632
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,380
You're on the clock, you know?

633
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,673
Where have you been?

634
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:47,424
Come on, Secretary Ko.

635
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,261
How did you get here then?

636
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,054
The hotel taxi.

637
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,976
Why didn't you take that
to the hot springs?

638
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,060
What?

639
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,396
Gosh, that's a great idea.

640
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,315
Why didn't I think of that?

641
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,320
Can you move aside so I can go home?

642
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,657
Right. Sure. Go ahead.

643
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,576
That's not my house.

644
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,956
So it's not this one. Then…

645
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:20,958
I see.

646
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,376
So…

647
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,627
Is it that red roof?

648
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,921
This one has a blue roof. It's not…

649
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:27,298
It's not this one.

650
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,924
Honey! I mean…

651
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:29,842
"Honey"?

652
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,468
What should I call her?

653
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:32,720
Excuse me!

654
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,142
What is it?

655
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:40,728
Well…

656
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:42,396
So…

657
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:44,440
I just…

658
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:48,485
Have you been well?

659
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,220
Listen.

660
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,891
If your brother
sees you here, he'll kill you.

661
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,353
There's a lot of eyes here.

662
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,785
Secretary Ko, hurry.

663
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,041
Hurry up.

664
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,400
You're off early today, Mr. Cho.

665
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,317
I am.

666
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,195
Maybe it's because all three
of your daughters are back,

667
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,948
but you look very happy.

668
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,075
Your house must be full of cheer.

669
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:22,538
Not at all. They only make us upset.
It was peaceful when it was just us two.

670
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,622
Goodness.

671
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,625
Goodness, what'll you do now?

672
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:30,462
They'll all settle down here
since Sam-dal can't go back to Seoul.

673
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:34,091
I guess you won't have the chance
to be lovey-dovey with your wife.

674
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,676
-What?
-What?

675
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,512
-Sam-dal can't return to the mainland?
-Of course not.

676
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,805
How can she?

677
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,641
It's not that she can't.
She's choosing not to.

678
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,311
She's innocent, so there's no reason
she can't go back.

679
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,606
-I see.
-She even went to Seoul two days ago.

680
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,234
Did she?

681
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:53,402
Yes.

682
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:55,571
Two days ago?

683
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:59,450
Didn't Yong-pil go to the mainland
two days ago as well?

684
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,534
-Yes.
-He did.

685
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,661
Yong-pil went to Seoul two days ago too.

686
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:05,998
He did?

687
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,251
Hello.

688
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:14,673
Hold on.

689
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,093
CAPTURING JEJU'S WEATHER
PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION AND CONTEST

690
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:32,358
Hey, you've only been interested
in forecasting the weather.

691
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:34,026
So why are you interested in this?

692
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:38,155
As an employee of the Korea
Meteorological Administration,

693
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,699
I should be aware
of events my workplace holds.

694
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:42,201
This is perfect for Sam-dal.

695
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:45,329
Really?

696
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:49,541
My mom saw Sam-dal headed somewhere
in hiking gear this morning.

697
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:50,793
Did she go somewhere?

698
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:55,339
-Probably.
-Where? Hallasan Mountain?

699
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:57,633
I don't know.

700
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,010
She wanted to find herself or something.

701
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,220
What does that mean?

702
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,764
What's the one trip in Jeju
you take to find yourself?

703
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,933
Finding myself…

704
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,352
The Jeju Olle Trail?

705
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,853
Yeah, the Jeju Olle Trail.

706
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,063
That's where she went?

707
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:52,271
What problems would
a young lady have to come here alone?

708
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,314
She's not that young.
Maybe in her forties?

709
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,649
Are you still single?

710
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,567
Yes.

711
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,569
Are you divorced? What about your husband?

712
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,739
Shouldn't you get a grip
before trying to finding yourself?

713
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:06,368
Just how many people
signed up for this program?

714
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:25,637
She'll have to find herself
in that crowd first.

715
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:26,930
Why didn't you stop her?

716
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,059
Gosh, that Jeju Olle Trail.

717
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:32,936
Why would I ever stop her?

718
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,188
What's wrong with you?

719
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,023
Have you finally gone crazy?

720
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,525
Hey, I heard you went to Seoul.

721
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:39,735
Goodness.

722
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:41,612
What for?

723
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,071
You don't need to know.

724
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,703
Why do you keep trying to find out?

725
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,288
You must've gone with Sam-dal.

726
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:56,126
Hey, I heard Yong-pil and Sam-dal
went to Seoul together!

727
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:05,010
You went there with Sam-dal…

728
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,068
My goodness!

729
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,821
The sky is so beautiful
that I don't want to go home.

730
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:30,953
Let's go, people.

731
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,121
-The sun is setting.
-Let's go.

732
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:34,998
-Let's go!
-Come on, let's go.

733
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:37,584
-Let's go.
-Okay.

734
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:44,383
Goodness.

735
00:55:45,384 --> 00:55:46,468
That's what happened.

736
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:49,846
Does this mean those two are dating again?

737
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,932
Isn't that obvious?

738
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,726
Why else would they go
to the mainland together?

739
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,230
Yong-pil's such a pure-hearted guy.

740
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,194
Hello, Ms. Ko.

741
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,071
Why are you so late?

742
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:09,533
Goodness. Maybe it's
because the days have become longer,

743
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,201
but I'm sleepy all the time.

744
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:15,622
I wonder what Ms. Ko ate
when she was pregnant

745
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:18,625
to have given birth
to a girl with such devilish charm.

746
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:21,878
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

747
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,547
It's about Sam-dal.

748
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,382
Maybe she's playing dumb.

749
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:28,468
Do you really not know?

750
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:31,930
Sam-dal and Yong-pil are back together.

751
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,057
What?

752
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,144
Who told you that nonsense?

753
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,230
You don't have to yell at us.

754
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:44,192
-They went to the mainland together--
-So what if they did?

755
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,278
Does that make them a couple?

756
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,488
Those two aren't dating!

757
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:50,616
Don't be ridiculous.

758
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,536
You better not say
such absurd things ever again.

759
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:56,955
Damn it!

760
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,002
Goodness.

761
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,421
-Why is she so worked up?
-She's upset.

762
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,006
Did something happen?

763
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,549
Jeez.

764
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,266
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

765
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:18,560
Cheers!

766
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:34,284
Dad!

767
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,078
Please talk to her for me!

768
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,705
You should talk to your mom.
This is not about me.

769
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,624
She won't even see me.

770
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,126
You don't even spend
your money here in the country.

771
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:45,837
So please talk to her
and tell her help me out!

772
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,881
-Take this!
-Okay.

773
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,926
I checked your ledger.
You made a bunch of money last month.

774
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,511
We're barely making a profit.

775
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:55,597
You gave him the restaurant!
What about your other sons?

776
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:58,892
-You should give us money then.
-Our parents are still alive, you know!

777
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,103
Shut your mouth, Sang-do.

778
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,854
We're making bunch of money?

779
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,816
It took us eight years
to pay back the money you took.

780
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,610
And it took four years
to pay back what our brother took.

781
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:12,406
Mom and Dad worked like dogs
for 12 years just to pay off your debts.

782
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,866
I told you to shut up, you bastard.

783
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,037
-Don't you have any shame?
-You little bastard.

784
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:20,247
You come with me.

785
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:26,211
-All right.
-Let go! Let go of me!

786
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,090
I was too soft on you
since you were the youngest.

787
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,008
You punk!

788
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:35,345
Hey! Get out!

789
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,472
You brat!

790
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:40,017
Will you give me the money or not?

791
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,852
-Yes or no?
-No!

792
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,770
Come on!

793
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:44,938
I'm sorry.

794
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:47,023
I'm sorry, everyone.

795
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,776
-What was that about?
-Goodness.

796
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:08,462
Are you okay?

797
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:11,757
No.

798
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:15,010
Right. Of course not.

799
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:19,431
Yeong-do really knows
how to throw a punch, doesn't he?

800
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:21,850
That's not why.

801
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,895
It's because I'm embarrassed.

802
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:29,357
You don't have to be embarrassed
about this in front of me.

803
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,820
Having a ton of money

804
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,365
can't always be such a good thing.

805
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,624
Why do I always end up
looking pathetic in front of you?

806
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:23,662
Hey. Starting today,
I need you to drink my milk for me.

807
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:26,706
Why?

808
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,708
I only like chocolate milk.

809
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:32,796
What do you mean? You're perfectly fine.

810
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,715
I was always so proud of you.

811
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:38,426
I also heard it was you
who helped your restaurant grow.

812
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,304
You used to be so poor,
and I always took care of you.

813
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:44,766
But you drive a supercar now.
You're successful. I'm so proud of you.

814
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:46,476
So what's the problem?

815
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,562
That's exactly what the problem is.

816
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,110
I don't want you to be proud of me.

817
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,657
I don't want you to comfort me.

818
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,620
I want to comfort you instead.

819
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,752
It feels like I got trampled
by an elephant.

820
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,841
That damn Jeju Olle Trail.

821
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,899
This is killing me.

822
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,025
Everything hurts.

823
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,207
Goodness, ma'am.

824
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,294
Your legs must be bothering you a lot.

825
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:21,298
I'm worried you'll be crawling
on all fours the next time I see you.

826
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:23,883
You knew about that Olle Trail Program,
didn't you?

827
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:26,136
Where are you going?

828
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:29,222
-To buy medicine for my sore muscles.
-Here, I already bought some.

829
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:35,311
Don't laugh!

830
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,772
Let's go.

831
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:40,859
Take this too.

832
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:54,372
Right.

833
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,250
I wanted to give this to you.

834
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:58,752
-Here.
-What?

835
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:01,629
What's this?

836
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:02,881
Check it out.

837
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,969
The KMA is hosting
a Jeju photo exhibition.

838
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:09,220
You should enter.

839
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:15,143
You told me to find Cho Sam-dal.

840
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,730
I put my camera away
when I got rid of Cho Eun-hye.

841
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,732
Then, enter as Cho Sam-dal.

842
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:22,817
Did you forget?

843
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:25,445
Sam-dal loved taking photos too.

844
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:31,409
I left Jeju 18 years ago.
I don't know it that well anymore.

845
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:34,871
You don't have to. The person in charge
will guide you through it all.

846
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:39,751
Forget it.

847
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:43,296
I put my camera deep inside the closet,
so it's a hassle to take out.

848
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,757
How deep inside could it be?

849
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,551
That hurts.

850
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,304
Are you all right?

851
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,181
Does it hurt a lot?

852
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,685
It's pretty steep. Want me to help?

853
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,188
Forget it. It's not like I'm hurt.

854
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,106
I'll hold you up.

855
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:03,066
I said I was fine.

856
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,609
-I'm fine--
-I'll help you.

857
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,945
What? You were on the mainland too?

858
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:08,738
The three of you?

859
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:10,615
Yeah.

860
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,242
What? Yong-pil never mentioned you.

861
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,953
Why did you three go and not invite us?

862
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:18,873
Right? There wouldn't be any rumors
if people knew you went too.

863
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,208
What rumors?

864
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,710
What else? Rumors of Sam-dal
and Yong-pil dating again.

865
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,672
Hey, why didn't Yong-pil mention him?

866
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,966
Does it hurt that bad? Does it?

867
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,300
You find this funny?

868
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:31,928
Of course not. You're in so much pain.

869
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,179
My friend's hurt.

870
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,766
I think I feel slightly better
after taking the medicine.

871
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:37,934
We're almost home.

872
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,282
No, Mr. Cho.

873
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:55,285
No, I don't want to. I can't do that.

874
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,494
Sam-dal.

875
01:05:57,579 --> 01:05:58,580
I can't…

876
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:01,833
I can't do it either.

877
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:06,045
How could I possibly bear
to see you, Sam-dal?

878
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:12,093
How could I bear to see you
with this grudge I have in my heart?

879
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,222
I can't live without Yong-pil.

880
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:20,059
I can't live without him.

881
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,645
I can't live without Yong-pil. Please--

882
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:25,648
I can't live without my son either.

883
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,110
Mr. Cho, please!

884
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:31,404
I can't live without him, Mr. Cho.

885
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,824
I can't live without Yong-pil!

886
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:29,379
I don't need you anymore.

887
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:30,672
So let's break up.

888
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,218
Wait, hold on.
What is this? You're joking, right?

889
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,011
Why are we suddenly breaking up?

890
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,471
-Let's break up.
-Hey.

891
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:42,559
Cho Sam-dal!

892
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,730
Are you two

893
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,066
back together?

894
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,454
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

895
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:13,798
8 YEARS AGO

896
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,039
"Let me pour you a drink."

897
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:48,916
The iron plate was so hot
he fell straight backwards!

898
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:23,743
For me,

899
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:26,454
it was harder letting you go

900
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:29,540
than holding onto you

901
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:31,417
causing you pain.

902
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:07,286
By the way, Dad…

903
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:08,413
Do you still

904
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:09,789
resent her?

905
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:11,416
Sam-dal ran into

906
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:13,918
Yong-pil's dad earlier.

907
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:14,961
What's wrong with you?

908
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:18,089
I kept feeling happy,
so it made me want to see you again.

909
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:20,800
-Did you see it?
-You did your homework, kid.

910
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,260
Hello.

911
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:23,720
What's wrong?

912
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:24,679
Are you in pain?

913
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:27,682
Goodness, your buoy
is all covered in flowers again.

914
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,308
Where did Ms. Ko go?

915
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:30,685
Request for the coast guard!

916
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,061
-Ms. Ko!
-A Samdal-ri haenyeo

917
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,479
went missing while diving.

918
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:35,148
Yong-pil, are you talking about

919
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,441
my mom?

920
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:42,739
