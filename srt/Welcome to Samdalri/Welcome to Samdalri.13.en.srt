00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,877
You're all done now.

3
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,838
-What is this? 
-Take a look.

4
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,637
Hey, Yong-pil! 
I think I like you. What should I do?

5
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,268
That floral pattern buoy. 
I think it belonged to the haenyeo leader.

6
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,145
On the day of her accident,

7
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:06,066
he ran out in the middle of work, 
so he was disciplined for that.

8
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,944
He went to the Weather Service division, 
and he's busy helping a photographer.

9
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,404
Gosh, that fool.

10
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:16,201
Why would he get himself 
into trouble like that? Gosh.

11
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:20,163
I heard the photographer who was chosen is 
also the daughter of the haenyeo leader.

12
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,802
Dad, what are you doing here?

13
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:42,977
You…

14
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,147
I begged and pleaded.

15
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:52,695
I told you I couldn't live without my son.

16
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,490
I begged you eight years ago.

17
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,784
So why did you come back?

18
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,953
Why did you come back?

19
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,707
Sir, I--

20
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,961
Dad, what are you talking about?

21
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,088
You promised me.

22
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,134
Why come back and cause 
another rift between me and my son?

23
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,093
Why?

24
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,389
Hold on.

25
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,016
Dad, what are you talking about?

26
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,852
Please just leave.

27
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,521
Go back to the mainland!

28
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,730
Dad!

29
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,485
Does he need to lose his father as well

30
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,321
for you and your family to be happy?

31
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:42,704
Will you only be satisfied 
once you take my son away from me too?

32
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,456
Hold on, Dad.

33
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,669
Dad, eight years ago…

34
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,048
did you beg Sam-dal to break up with me?

35
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,384
Is that true?

36
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,762
Hey. Is that why we broke up?

37
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,682
Not because he gave your mom a hard time,

38
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,476
but because he begged you to? 
Is this true?

39
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,440
That's right.

40
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,317
It was me.

41
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,361
I begged and pleaded.

42
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,782
Why did you come back

43
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:24,245
and mess with his feelings again? Why?

44
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,581
Sam-dal.

45
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,377
Don't you feel sorry for him?

46
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,590
His mother died because of yours.

47
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,010
And yet, he still likes you.

48
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,387
Doesn't he seem pitiful to you

49
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,766
as he blindly cares 
for the woman who killed his mother?

50
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,602
Why am I pitiful, Dad?

51
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,813
Why am I pitiful?

52
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:56,319
It's not Sam-dal or her mom 
who's making me seem pitiful. It's you!

53
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,128
Will I have to cut ties with my son

54
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,131
for you to finally stop?

55
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,678
Dad, please.

56
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,097
-Don't do this. 
-I'm sorry, sir.

57
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:27,183
-I'm sorry. 
-Why are you apologizing?

58
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,396
You didn't do anything wrong, 
so why are you crying?

59
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,855
Come with me.

60
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,108
-No. 
-Come on!

61
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,524
Sam-dal, why…

62
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,820
Why didn't you tell me about this?

63
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:25,366
Why didn't you tell me my dad 
had said something like that to you?

64
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,411
You should've at least told me.

65
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,538
Why did you keep it to yourself?

66
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,706
How could I…

67
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,001
possibly tell you that?

68
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,128
Because it's about us.

69
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,340
And he's my dad.

70
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,842
Exactly, he's your dad.

71
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,554
Your one and only dad.

72
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:52,518
I couldn't bear 
to take your dad from you as well.

73
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,979
How could I do that?

74
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,054
Dad! No!

75
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,014
Dad!

76
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,599
Dad, what are you doing?

77
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,684
Come to your senses!

78
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,605
My head.

79
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,774
Goodness.

80
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,610
Dad…

81
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,240
Don't do this, Dad. 
I can't live without you!

82
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:56,874
-Dad… 
-God, I'm such a fool!

83
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,295
I am so foolish!

84
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:07,301
I knew full well you 
and your father only have each other.

85
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,888
How could I tell you that 
just for my sake?

86
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,267
You know I couldn't keep you by my side.

87
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,565
Still, why is this something 
you have to deal with?

88
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,443
Isn't this what I have to deal with?

89
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,944
This is my problem.

90
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,904
This is about my dad and me.

91
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,884
Yong-pil…

92
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,890
I like you a lot.

93
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,350
I really do.

94
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,982
I went out with all kinds 
of guys just to get over you.

95
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,860
But I never lasted long with them.

96
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,820
Do you know why?

97
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,949
Because they weren't you.

98
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,164
We'd walk or eat together,

99
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,335
but all I could think was…

100
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,215
"Why is the person in front of me…

101
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,093
not Yong-pil?"

102
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,181
"What am I doing here?"

103
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,146
Ever since I was born,

104
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,483
I've only leaned on you,

105
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,530
and my heart's only raced for you.

106
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:55,451
That 23-year-old Cho Sam-dal 
is someone I can be only in front of you,

107
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,956
so how could I possibly like anyone else?

108
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,337
-Sam-dal, let's just-- 
-So I've decided.

109
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,386
I'm going to like only you.

110
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,721
Yeah.

111
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,684
But that's all.

112
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,978
For me, it'll just be…

113
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,983
a one-sided love.

114
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,653
How can you when I like you too?

115
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,573
I realized it again 
after seeing your dad today.

116
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,244
I can never overcome him.

117
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:46,043
I have my mom, my dad, and my sisters.

118
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,800
But he's all you've got, Yong-pil.

119
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,845
I can't do it. I'm not that shameless.

120
00:09:55,928 --> 00:10:00,016
So I'll just love you from afar.

121
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,476
Even if it means I'll be single forever,

122
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,980
I'd rather do that.

123
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,481
That's what I'll do.

124
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,568
Sam-dal.

125
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,324
I don't want that.

126
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,328
I don't want a one-sided love.

127
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,666
I did it for eight years. 
I can't do it anymore.

128
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,669
I won't ask you

129
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,588
to overcome my dad either.

130
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:16,008
I know you and your mom aren't able to,

131
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,761
so leave that to me.

132
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,638
So,

133
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,599
please just wait where you are.

134
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:28,396
Don't think about anything, 
and stop feeling guilty.

135
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,691
I won't make the same mistake 
I made eight years ago.

136
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,860
So don't think about

137
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,780
being in a one-sided love either.

138
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,367
I'm not going to go through it again.

139
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,328
That damn one-sided love.

140
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,347
EPISODE 13 
THAT DAMN ONE-SIDED LOVE

141
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,685
Hey.

142
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,562
Did you eat something?

143
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,147
Yes.

144
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,613
What's wrong with her?

145
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,199
Is that you, Sam-dal?

146
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,868
Wait.

147
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,953
She looked exhausted.

148
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,538
What is it?

149
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,834
I told you. I'm going to 
deal with myself first.

150
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,975
What is it?

151
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,148
What's wrong?

152
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,983
Did something happen?

153
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,069
No, nothing happened.

154
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:08,996
Do you still

155
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,583
like Yong-pil that much?

156
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,921
What?

157
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,507
You asked if you could like him.

158
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,095
You can.

159
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,390
Like him all you want.

160
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,394
Just follow your heart.

161
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,106
Don't let what his dad 
or I think stop you.

162
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,151
You two can do whatever you want.

163
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,822
We've kept you apart for eight years,

164
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,826
but if you still like each other, 
what else can you do?

165
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,497
Why hold yourselves back 
when you're innocent?

166
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,125
You two didn't do anything wrong. 
I'm the guilty one.

167
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,507
So just follow your heart.

168
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,346
What if I end up liking him too much?

169
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,477
I don't think I'd be able to 
break up with him again.

170
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,648
What if we need to separate again? 
What should I do then, Mom?

171
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,985
If that happens…

172
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,155
I don't know what 
I'll do with myself, Mom.

173
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:47,446
I'm still a kid so I can't protect you!

174
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,199
Ha-yul…

175
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,244
You don't have to worry about such things.

176
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,164
So she's your daughter, not your niece.

177
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,749
It finally makes sense now.

178
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,045
I actually checked out 
your social media since it seemed odd.

179
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,631
I didn't mean to deceive you.

180
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,925
It just kind of ended up that way.

181
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,345
I'd always thought 
Ha-yul was mature for her age.

182
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,975
But I realized today she's definitely 
just a kid who wants to protect her mom.

183
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,935
Right.

184
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,813
You must be fascinated and curious.

185
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,776
It's not common for a 29-year-old 
to have a 9-year-old daughter.

186
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,779
It's not common for a 29-year-old 
to be a dolphin's dad either.

187
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,823
Right. That's true.

188
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,909
Come to think of it,

189
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,746
we were the same age 
when you met Namchun and I had Ha-yul.

190
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,124
I was 21 too.

191
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,959
Right, since she's nine.

192
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,085
Yeah.

193
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,715
I moved to the mainland to pursue 
my dreams right when I turned 20.

194
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,926
But my dreams changed when I was there.

195
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,345
She's my new dream.

196
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,725
What was your original goal 
when you first moved?

197
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,478
To be a professional swimmer.

198
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,272
Seriously?

199
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,734
You must be good at it 
since you're from Jeju.

200
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,486
Not all Jeju natives are good at swimming.

201
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,574
I may not look it, but I was accepted 
to the Korea National Training Center.

202
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,076
-I was handpicked by my university too. 
-Wow.

203
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,205
You gave up on a huge dream. 
Doesn't that mean you were really good?

204
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,291
I didn't give up my dream. It changed.

205
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,720
You have more questions, right?

206
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,431
Well, I do.

207
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:40,309
But you don't have to answer 
just because of my curiosity.

208
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,896
I'm a widow.

209
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,522
What?

210
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:47,691
Really?

211
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,444
I see.

212
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,447
You sound really silly right now.

213
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,865
What do you mean?

214
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:58,827
It's okay to be surprised. 
It's weirder if you're not.

215
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:00,996
Right.

216
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,344
Thanks. You made the trip home 
easier on us.

217
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,471
It wasn't a long trip anyway.

218
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,641
You should visit 
our center with Ha-yul often.

219
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:24,561
We have many kid-friendly programs. 
She'll have fun since she likes dolphins.

220
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,063
I bet.

221
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,191
But I have no idea 
why she's suddenly so into dolphins.

222
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,943
Anyway, thanks. Bye.

223
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:33,946
Wait.

224
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,952
I felt this 
after seeing you all day today.

225
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:44,039
Actually, I think I felt this 
the first time we met.

226
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,835
You two make a great pair.

227
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,212
What?

228
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,965
At times, you're like friends or sisters.

229
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,717
And if you look, like mother and daughter.

230
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,637
Anyway, I always thought that 
about you two.

231
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,850
I never thought 
it was fascinating or uncommon.

232
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,645
Go on in. I'll see you later.

233
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,068
Good morning, Man-su.

234
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,737
Yong-pil's still asleep, right?

235
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,655
Come on, Gyeong-tae.

236
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,573
What?

237
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,367
You shouldn't barge in there this early.

238
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,036
You should respect his privacy.

239
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,579
Not if he's staying here.

240
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,789
-Come on, now. 
-What?

241
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,294
Sam-dal might be sleeping in there too.

242
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,629
-Last time-- 
-Sam-dal?

243
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,796
Sam-dal…

244
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,798
-I said they needed our permission. 
-Stop…

245
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,841
Hey, Yong-pil.

246
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,385
What? Where is he?

247
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,764
What?

248
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,726
Where did he go?

249
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,370
You're seasoning top shells?

250
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,581
But why are there two batches?

251
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,041
What?

252
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,712
That one doesn't have any cucumber.

253
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,926
Is this for Sang-tae again?

254
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,511
Don't give him any.

255
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,304
He'll throw it away like always.

256
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,140
Give it back.

257
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,187
Even if he does, 
I'll keep giving him food.

258
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:18,902
I'll continue to do that, 
so he takes all his anger out on me.

259
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,655
He's done that for the past 20 years 
and he's still angry.

260
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,865
It'll never end.

261
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,638
-Give that to me. I'll take it in. 
-No, let's go together.

262
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,349
Just give it to me. I'll take it in.

263
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,145
I don't think 
you should see my dad right now.

264
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:57,399
Did he run into Sam-dal 
yesterday by any chance?

265
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,608
Did something happen?

266
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,701
By the way, Mom.

267
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,746
I'm not going to run anymore.

268
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,623
So don't forget to take your medication,

269
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,126
and make sure 
to get that checkup tomorrow.

270
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,255
You never listened no matter 
how much I nagged you to stop diving.

271
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,925
But you stopped immediately 
when your daughters told you to.

272
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,469
I'm a bit hurt.

273
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:30,515
It's not that. I can't dive 
because they keep hiding my suit.

274
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,184
I should've thought of that.

275
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,394
By the way, Yong-pil…

276
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,857
I'm no longer afraid of your father

277
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,735
taking his anger out on me.

278
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:45,989
You're not alone.

279
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,369
I wonder what's suddenly gotten into you.

280
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:56,833
Don't worry about me, 
and just hold on tight to Sam-dal.

281
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:01,880
Okay.

282
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,042
Just how much did he drink?

283
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,080
Why are you here?

284
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,042
To cut ties with your father?

285
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,545
No.

286
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,131
Then,

287
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,468
did you cut ties with Sam-dal?

288
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,554
No.

289
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,184
Then, why are you here?

290
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:40,812
Get out.

291
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,320
Damn it.

292
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,704
Give it to me. I don't need…

293
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:04,878
Did you come here just to upset me?

294
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,631
Yes, that's right. I'm here to upset you.

295
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,675
I'm going to keep upsetting you.

296
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,261
Until we drift apart?

297
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,932
I'm going to keep upsetting you

298
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:22,270
so that I can take care of you.

299
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,942
I'm also going to take care of Sam-dal,

300
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,569
and Ms. Ko,

301
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,405
and myself.

302
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,908
What did you say?

303
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,701
You know what?

304
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,372
I thought if I was the only one 
who suffered, everyone would be okay.

305
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:45,377
I thought you, Sam-dal, 
Ms. Ko, and I would all be okay.

306
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,088
But no one's okay right now.

307
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,800
So from this moment on,

308
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,844
I'm going to tell you all of my pain.

309
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:59,766
I'll tell you how much pain I'm in, 
how much I've endured,

310
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,476
and how much I love Sam-dal.

311
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,690
I'm going to tell you everything.

312
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,067
You think…

313
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,987
that's going to help me?

314
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,322
Yes.

315
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,743
Dad, I know

316
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,955
ever since the day Mom died,

317
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,167
you've never been able to move on.

318
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,215
Your one and only son

319
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:37,220
and Ms. Ko, 
who worries about you every day.

320
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,474
You need to know how much we're suffering

321
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,770
so that you can move on too.

322
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,522
Right?

323
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:04,622
Sam-dal,

324
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,250
it's not the end of the world.

325
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,804
JEJU ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA

326
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,357
Hey, Eun-bi. Let's go to work.

327
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:36,112
When is Ms. Ko going to start 
diving again? We gave her a new suit.

328
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:39,032
She said that one disappeared too.

329
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,325
-What? 
-Again?

330
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:45,830
Goodness. Her daughters 
must be dead set on not letting her dive.

331
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:49,376
Hiding her diving suit is nothing.

332
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:53,296
If she finds out that Jin-dal 
is involved in the theme park project,

333
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,924
she'll kill her on the spot.

334
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,217
I see.

335
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,720
By the way, what was 
the result of the votes on that?

336
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,597
Did anyone vote "Yes"?

337
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,683
Are you crazy? 
I'm sure everyone voted "No."

338
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,852
No one from this town would support that.

339
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,771
-Right. 
-Right.

340
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,731
There could be some who did.

341
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,359
-What? 
-Don't you think so?

342
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,236
Did you vote "Yes" or "No"?

343
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,320
I voted "No"!

344
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,864
-You voted "Yes," right? 
-Damn it. You're so annoying!

345
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,032
You did, didn't you?

346
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,836
AS OUT! NO THEME PARK! 
FROM RESIDENTS OF SAMDAL-RI

347
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,296
PROTECT THE BLUE SEA 
SAY NO

348
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,215
AS OUT! NO THEME PARK!

349
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,636
THE THEME PARK WILL SAVE 
THE LOCAL ECONOMY!

350
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,847
ALL RESIDENTS OF SAMDAL-RI 
WELCOME THE THEME PARK

351
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,515
What is this?

352
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,809
This is bad!

353
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,520
We're in big trouble!

354
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,438
What is it?

355
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,357
The voting results are out.

356
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,484
What's the result?

357
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,279
"Yes" won by five votes.

358
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,781
What did you say?

359
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,243
What are you talking about?

360
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:11,166
You see, Ms. Ko, 66 people voted "Yes."

361
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,459
They voted "Yes"?

362
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:16,671
So by five votes, 
the majority really voted for "Yes"?

363
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,756
That's right.

364
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,886
What about you? Did you vote "Yes"?

365
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:25,555
-No! 
-Gosh, we voted "No"!

366
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,056
No one here would vote "Yes."

367
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,101
Goodness, we all listened 
to you and voted "No."

368
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,186
-Right. 
-Right.

369
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,520
However…

370
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,691
apparently you voted "Yes."

371
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,111
-What? 
-What?

372
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,864
What are you talking about?

373
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,491
I never voted "Yes"!

374
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,578
You, your husband, and Jin-dal.

375
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:52,832
In any case, six people 
from your family voted "Yes."

376
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,585
-My goodness. 
-Oh, dear.

377
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,340
That's 57, 58, 59, 60.

378
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,674
And six from you.

379
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,092
That's 66 votes for "Yes."

380
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,428
Are you sure about this?

381
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:09,390
Mom will be livid if she finds out 
that you were behind this.

382
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:13,394
She'd beat us to a pulp 
if she saw us just sitting here.

383
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,397
This isn't anonymous, 
so she'll soon find out about this.

384
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,901
I don't get why this was an open ballot. 
It should've been anonymous.

385
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,695
Mom is abusing her authority.

386
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,656
It's to catch people like you.

387
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,742
Hey, whose side are you on?

388
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:29,869
Aunt Jin-dal?

389
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,207
If they build the theme park, 
Grandma really won't have to dive, right?

390
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,084
Yeah, that's what they said.

391
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,961
But you promised not to worry about that.

392
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,963
Don't get ahead of yourself, Mom.

393
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,632
I'm just concerned about Grandma.

394
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,886
Fine, but you should leave it at that.

395
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,349
What's going on?

396
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:52,934
You don't need to know.

397
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:58,815
Did Dae-yeong really bring this project 
to our village because of Mom?

398
00:30:58,898 --> 00:30:59,899
But why?

399
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,201
Don't tell me it's love.

400
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,789
If he still loves you after what you did 
to him, he must be a bit--

401
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,667
Hey, watch what you say.

402
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,378
He used to be family. 
He's older than you too.

403
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:24,549
Don't you dare call him an idiot.

404
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,593
I never said he was an idiot.

405
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,515
You didn't?

406
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,104
Cho Jin-dal!

407
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,523
That little…

408
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,489
-You crazy brat! 
-Mom.

409
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,450
-Mom. 
-You've gone insane.

410
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,619
Are you trying to ruin your hometown?

411
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,704
-Mom, let's talk. 
-Why are you sitting here?

412
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,164
-Calm down! 
-Stop hitting me!

413
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,123
Please calm down!

414
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,666
Hear me out, Mom.

415
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,418
Move, will you?

416
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,669
Get over here, Jin-dal.

417
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,921
-Let's talk it out. 
-Move!

418
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,297
Mother, please!

419
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,506
It…

420
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,884
It hurts, Mother!

421
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,761
It hurts!

422
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,067
Look, don't just blindly be against it.

423
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,068
Mom, hear me out.

424
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,779
The majority of the people voted "Yes."

425
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:31,032
I may have lied and voted "Yes" 
under your name and Dad's name.

426
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,534
But even if I hadn't, 
there'd still be more "Yes" votes.

427
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:34,994
She's right.

428
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,038
We didn't know so many would vote "Yes."

429
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,458
-We really didn't. 
-They all just didn't tell you…

430
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,542
they would.

431
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,460
Right.

432
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,920
What did you say?

433
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,089
I don't care what other people did.

434
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,549
But how could you vote "Yes"?

435
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,094
AS Group?

436
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:55,139
Everyone here knows 
about your history with them.

437
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,474
Are you out of your mind?

438
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,853
Then, stop diving!

439
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,606
Your heart…

440
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:09,612
They said you shouldn't dive. 
Do you think I…

441
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,743
AS Group… 
I'm the one who hates them the most!

442
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,038
Just the thought of them 
sends chills down my spine!

443
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,542
But if I didn't do this, 
you'd continue to dive.

444
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,170
And that's what I hate even more!

445
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,676
She's right. You really need to stop.

446
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,885
Don't do it.

447
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,599
What about you then?

448
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,604
Did you ever ask for my permission 
to do things in your lives?

449
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,692
You. Did you receive 
my permission to get divorced?

450
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,318
And you…

451
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:58,870
So don't tell me 
what I should or shouldn't do.

452
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,914
I've been diving for decades.

453
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,125
I've done fine with medication.

454
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,628
So don't suddenly start worrying about me.

455
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,840
The only way that theme park 
will be built in our village is

456
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,759
if it's over my dead body. Got that?

457
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,524
Yes, my child?

458
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,694
I'm scared, Grandma.

459
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,198
Goodness.

460
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,701
I'm sorry for raising my voice.

461
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,079
It's not that.

462
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:44,916
Just like it took your old friend,

463
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:49,462
I'm scared the sea will take you away too.

464
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:25,581
A photo exhibition for an office 
of meteorology wouldn't be your specialty.

465
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,375
I have no specialty.

466
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,378
And I'll be using my real name, 
Cho Sam-dal, not Cho Eun-hye.

467
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:34,966
Even though the office of meteorology 
is hosting it, I still need a theme.

468
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,802
Can you find and send me 
material on exhibition themes

469
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:41,931
and on-site photos taken 
from my previous exhibitions?

470
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,349
Okay, will do.

471
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,060
We'll fly down as soon as we send them.

472
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,228
We'll be there soon!

473
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,071
CHO EUN-HYE'S EXHIBITION MATERIAL 
3MOON

474
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,588
Ms. Cho used to only do 
large-scale exhibitions like these.

475
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,672
It doesn't matter.

476
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,258
At least she's still taking photos.

477
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,011
Do you know how worried I was

478
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,555
that she'd quit forever?

479
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,809
Let's send these over quick 
and go help her.

480
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:27,727
Okay.

481
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,692
Wait, aren't these messages 
from her visitors?

482
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,360
They're from that message tree.

483
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,945
Yeah, you're right.

484
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,947
Should we send these over too?

485
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,659
We even have the guest book too.

486
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,871
Why don't we pick out the good ones 
from these and send them to her?

487
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,497
Okay, sure.

488
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,303
I heard you lied 
about what happened to you.

489
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,347
I heard you denied it yourself!

490
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,894
Why won't you tell me?

491
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:13,606
Why did you try to jump into the river 
if it wasn't because of Eun-hye?

492
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:16,901
You too?

493
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:21,155
I'm so irritated and my pride is hurt. 
I'm about to go insane.

494
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,156
So stop it.

495
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,700
How could you lie about that? 
She's completely--

496
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,328
Like you're any better?

497
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,707
You betrayed her first 
and came to me. We're accomplices.

498
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,877
Don't try to change the subject. 
Why did you try to kill yourself?

499
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:38,005
I just did it 
because I wanted to die! Happy?

500
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,534
Hey, Sam-dal!

501
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,079
What? What brings you here?

502
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:13,666
By the way, 
I heard you're dating Yong-pil again.

503
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,836
What? Who told you that?

504
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,379
Who do you think?

505
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,841
Man-su said he saw you two together.

506
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,426
-At our hideout. 
-Man-su…

507
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,469
Did you think it through 
before deciding this?

508
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,931
We'd have to cut ties again 
if you two break up.

509
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,558
Gyeong-tae, please…

510
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:37,398
I don't have to but really want to 
cut ties because of that mouth of yours.

511
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:38,816
Why?

512
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,609
Gyeong-tae, you're so…

513
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,778
clueless.

514
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,904
Me?

515
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,407
You have no manners either.

516
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,536
Was that déjà vu?

517
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,707
Did you do this 
to Yong-pil for eight years?

518
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,083
While cluelessly mentioning me?

519
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,172
Is she psychic? How did she know that?

520
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,508
Hey, you better not break up 
this time around.

521
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,885
You two better stay together!

522
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,728
FORECASTER CHO YONG-PIL 
WEATHER SERVICE

523
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,775
You should've come in the afternoon 
when Mr. Cho would be here.

524
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,402
That's why I told you 
he took the morning off.

525
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,029
That's okay.

526
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,908
Here. I've yet to decide 
on the interior theme.

527
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,744
But after looking through 
the locations and photos,

528
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,330
I think I'll have 
a rough idea of the theme soon.

529
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,375
Okay. It doesn't take long 
to decorate the exhibition hall.

530
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:41,379
So take your time to decide 
on the theme and let us know.

531
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:46,133
You might naturally decide on it 
as you take and select the photos.

532
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,095
This is nice.

533
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,309
-Forecaster Cho! 
-Yes?

534
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,528
If you look here, right now…

535
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,116
Cho Sam-dal stopped by just now.

536
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,493
I told her you'd be late, 
but she came early.

537
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,869
So just us two had the meeting.

538
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,871
-Just now? 
-Yes.

539
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,206
Really? I see.

540
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,304
-Mr. Cho. 
-Yes?

541
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,182
Are you okay?

542
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,130
HEY, YONG-PIL! 
I THINK I LIKE YOU. WHAT SHOULD I DO?

543
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,945
Hey, Sang-do!

544
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,123
We're closed today, 
so this is all we have for snacks.

545
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,167
You can't drink when you're full anyway.

546
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,502
This is good.

547
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,509
This is perfect.

548
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:34,552
Try some.

549
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,303
Then, I'll eat it.

550
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,224
It makes me crave alcohol.

551
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,482
Why are you staring at me?

552
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,445
Fix your hair. You look exactly 
like a crazy person right now.

553
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,034
You know those times

554
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:03,289
when you want to open up 
your head and remove your brain?

555
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,457
So you can get rid of 
thoughts filling it up.

556
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:10,170
In those times, you feel better 
once you get some fresh air.

557
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,135
Who do you want to get rid of?

558
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,053
Who's filling up your head?

559
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,265
No one specifically.

560
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,142
Yong-pil?

561
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,479
Hey, why are you suddenly bringing him up?

562
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,569
By the way, are you guys 
still not getting along these days?

563
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,447
Let's not talk about him.

564
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,824
Is it that bad?

565
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,451
No, it's just…

566
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,037
Let's not talk about Yong-pil.

567
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,290
Can you hear me out instead?

568
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,712
Sure, let's hear it. What is it?

569
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,301
There is

570
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,346
someone I've liked

571
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,849
for a very long time now.

572
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,809
Seriously? Who is she?

573
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,271
Hold on. If it's been that long…

574
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,316
No way.

575
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,736
Do I know her? Have you told her yet? 
Want me to help?

576
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,157
Look, I'm old enough to need your help.

577
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:24,036
And you of all people 
can't help me with this.

578
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:28,165
Come on. You don't have to be that cold.

579
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,502
But the thing is

580
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,589
she likes someone else.

581
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,478
Did you tell her you like her?

582
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,525
I've just thought,

583
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,779
"I'm sure I'll have my chance someday."

584
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,573
I waited for that day.

585
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:02,616
And I'm still waiting.

586
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,330
But you know what?

587
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,544
I think my chance might have come.

588
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,923
But I also think it might never come.

589
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:20,926
I don't really know.

590
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:27,391
If you think now's your chance, 
then you should at least tell her.

591
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:36,150
What if it feels 
like that chance will never come?

592
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:45,784
Then…

593
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:52,749
You should give up.

594
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,548
Give up… Is that so?

595
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,636
Then, should I just give up?

596
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,389
Yeah.

597
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,059
If it will never happen,

598
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,062
just give up, Sang-do.

599
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,190
That's one-sided love.

600
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,193
What about you?

601
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,072
Do you also give up if it can't happen?

602
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:32,539
No.

603
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:38,170
I'd rather have unrequited love.

604
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,590
But you shouldn't do that.

605
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,092
I'm speaking from experience.

606
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,552
Don't do it, Sang-do.

607
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:49,306
If you keep loving someone 
even when there's no hope,

608
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,059
it's too painful.

609
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,811
So I hope you won't do that.

610
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,176
Damn it.

611
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:40,983
What?

612
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,359
What in the…

613
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,112
Don't throw that picture away, Dad.

614
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,199
If you keep throwing it away, 
I'll keep bringing it back.

615
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,451
Okay?

616
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,640
Dad, I know ever since the day Mom died,

617
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,602
you've never been able to move on.

618
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:21,690
Mr. Cho.

619
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,485
We got a call about a crack 
in a building. You should go see.

620
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,486
Is that so?

621
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,113
Where is it?

622
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,239
Samdal-ri Gallery.

623
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,243
What's the matter?

624
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,786
What? It's nothing.

625
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,749
Am I the only one available right now?

626
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:41,084
Yes, everyone else is dealing 
with other complaints.

627
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,502
-Really? 
-Yes.

628
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:51,845
SAMDAL-RI GALLERY

629
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,727
-Hello, Mr. Cho. 
-Hey.

630
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,187
Where's the crack?

631
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,147
It's inside. You can go in.

632
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,273
Okay.

633
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,731
Where are you going? 
There's a crack in the wall.

634
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:46,817
You're not going to check?

635
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,114
Where is it?

636
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:55,242
Over there. Can't you see it?

637
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,348
You saw them, right?

638
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,146
Mom and Ms. Ko back then.

639
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:29,443
I was still in her womb, 
but you must've seen them.

640
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,672
What are you doing?

641
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,884
Can't you see? I'm trying to upset you.

642
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:57,095
What difference will this make?

643
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,556
Don't waste your time.

644
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,768
I know you loved Mom very much.

645
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:03,852
But…

646
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,690
she was my mom too.

647
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:13,028
She was also Ms. Ko's best friend.

648
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,113
And to Grandma and Grandpa,

649
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:17,783
she was their daughter.

650
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:20,702
So?

651
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,788
What are you trying to say?

652
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:23,914
I'm just saying…

653
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,752
that we were all in pain.

654
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:36,968
Is that why

655
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,388
you've all forgotten about her now?

656
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:43,099
I'm the only one…

657
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,646
I'm the only one who still remembers her.

658
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:50,732
You

659
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:52,901
and Ko Mi-ja

660
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,112
have both forgotten

661
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,407
about that day and that accident.

662
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,160
-Dad… 
-That's why

663
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,913
at least I should remember.

664
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,126
If no one remembered her,

665
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,255
think how pitiful your mother would be.

666
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:30,605
JEJU HOSPITAL

667
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:36,236
I think everything will be fine 
as long as I take my medication.

668
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,154
I've been doing fine all this time.

669
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:41,408
Mom, you think the accident happened 
because you didn't take your meds?

670
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,287
You'll be okay for now 
since we upped your dosage,

671
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,455
but it could change 
if you develop a tolerance.

672
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,750
And we don't know 
when we'll have to up the dosage next.

673
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,210
Here.

674
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,881
This is her medical chart 
starting from eight years ago.

675
00:52:55,964 --> 00:53:00,010
We upped her dosage 
but not at regular intervals.

676
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:03,471
From when she first came here

677
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:06,641
to when we upped her dosage, 
it was a period of one year.

678
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,102
Then, it was after two years.

679
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,229
Then, five months.

680
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,148
Inconsistent, isn't it?

681
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:27,037
I'm not a child. 
I could've gone there by myself.

682
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,915
I don't get why your dad sent you as well.

683
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:33,627
Mom,

684
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,631
I saw the first time you visited 
the hospital eight years ago

685
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,008
was on May 28th.

686
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:46,556
Was that when you collapsed the first time 
and Yong-pil took you to the hospital?

687
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,351
You saw that?

688
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:51,978
Yes, it was.

689
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:56,942
Really?

690
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,406
It's exactly…

691
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:06,785
what you think it is.

692
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:08,745
Get out of my house!

693
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,789
Dad, please stop!

694
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:11,790
You listen up too!

695
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:15,752
I will never forgive her family!

696
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:19,798
If you want to see things like this 
keep happening, go ahead.

697
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,574
Mom, what's wrong?

698
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,034
What's wrong, Mom?

699
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,953
Mom! Mom, what's wrong?

700
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,957
Mom, what's… Hold on!

701
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:58,878
Yong-pil didn't break up with you 
because of his father's disapproval.

702
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,841
He broke up with you

703
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,093
because he saw that I was sick.

00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,127
Forecaster Cho.

707
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:43,173
Ms. Cho went to take photos today. 
You didn't go with her?

708
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,257
No.

709
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,926
You two were always joined at the hip.

710
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,511
Where did she go today?

711
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,556
I think she said 
she was going to Sagyemul.

712
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,350
I don't know 
how she even found out about that place.

713
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,393
Sagyemul? Today?

714
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:56,478
Yes.

715
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,064
But it's high tide.

716
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,066
I'll be back.

717
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,499
Let's get to work.

718
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,001
Let's go.

719
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:30,595
OFF LIMITS DURING HIGH TIDE 
DROWNING HAZARD DUE TO HIGH SURF

720
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:33,807
Forecaster Kang, you know 
the highest tides start today, right?

721
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,850
The sea levels are the highest today.

722
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,686
Check flood-prone areas in advance.

723
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:43,066
Get ready to send out advisories 
for strong winds and high waves.

724
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,859
The wave period is ten seconds.

725
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,654
These waves are so strong 
they could flood the coast.

726
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,696
Really?

727
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,823
Yes. Look at this.

728
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:59,415
Goodness, a Weather Service member 
can't just barge in here.

729
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,834
I just need to check something.

730
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,635
CHO SAM-DAL

731
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,392
Why isn't she picking up?

732
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:19,602
Baek-ho.

733
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,022
What are the numbers 
for Sagyemul's wave buoy?

734
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,275
Hey, your punishment isn't over yet.

735
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,235
Okay, I'll get them for you.

736
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,278
Okay, thanks.

737
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:45,837
What?

738
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:58,850
Mi-ja!

739
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,730
Mi-ja?

740
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:05,773
Hey…

741
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,653
Hey, Geum-ok.

742
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:15,742
Oh, no.

743
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,495
Hey.

744
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,622
Geum-ok!

745
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,458
Geum-ok!

746
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:29,130
You saw how it ruined that other village, 
and you still voted "Yes"?

747
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,674
Still, it's free money.

748
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,303
We won't be able to dive or farm anymore.

749
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:37,931
Isn't it hard to both dive 
and run the business?

750
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,935
Do you even know 
what you want to do with that money?

751
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,104
I have over 100 business ideas--

752
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,481
Oh, dear.

753
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,444
-Hey, isn't that Yong-pil's grandfather? 
-What?

754
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,362
Hey.

755
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:53,947
-Mr. Bu. 
-Mr. Bu.

756
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,115
-What's wrong? 
-Geum-ok's disappeared!

757
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,367
-What? 
-What?

758
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,618
Geum-ok!

759
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,662
Goodness, Ok went missing again?

760
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:03,122
-Where could she be? 
-Let's go!

761
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,291
Mr. Bu, wait for us!

762
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,834
Mother!

763
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:16,511
Mother.

764
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,933
Mother!

765
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:23,810
Ms. Yang!

766
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,603
Ms. Yang!

767
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,105
Ms. Yang!

768
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,982
Geum-ok!

769
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,733
Gosh, where could she be?

770
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:34,571
-Ms. Yang! 
-Ms. Yang!

771
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:35,488
Ms. Yang!

772
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,949
-Did you check their house? 
-She's not there.

773
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,617
-Ms. Yang! 
-Ms. Yang!

774
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,078
-Ms. Yang! 
-Goodness, Ms. Ko!

775
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,246
What's the matter?

776
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:46,666
Goodness, Ms. Yang has gone missing again.

777
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:51,296
She'd been doing well for a while, 
so why did this happen again?

778
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,506
The rest area.

779
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,799
Did you check there?

780
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,135
Of course, we looked everywhere.

781
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,225
-Ms. Yang! 
-Ms. Yang!

782
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:22,994
Ms. Yang!

783
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,627
Ms. Yang!

784
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,586
Oh, God.

785
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,212
Ms. Yang!

786
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,131
Ms. Yang!

787
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:36,674
Goodness!

788
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:39,677
Gosh, what are you doing here?

789
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:41,888
Let's go.

790
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,515
Tell me. Are you hurt?

791
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:46,809
Mi-ja?

792
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:50,229
Where have you been, my sweet daughter?

793
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,781
You're the one who killed my daughter.

794
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,909
You're the bitch who killed my daughter!

795
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:06,329
You evil bitch!

796
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:09,082
You vile bitch! You deserve to die!

797
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,708
Die! You should die!

798
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,710
Why did my daughter have to die?

799
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,420
Die!

800
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:17,006
You deserve to die!

801
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,094
Why did my daughter have to die? 
You should die!

802
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,763
You're the one who deserves to die!

803
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:27,767
Die! Why did my daughter have to die?

804
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,519
-Gosh, Ms. Yang! 
-Ms. Yang!

805
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:30,770
-Ms. Yang! 
-Ms. Yang!

806
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,271
Ms. Yang!

807
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,443
Goodness!

808
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,739
-Goodness! 
-Goodness, ma'am!

809
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:54,794
Sang-tae.

810
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:01,718
Just me…

811
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:07,140
Just direct your hate only towards me.

812
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,481
I'll take all of it.

813
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,653
I'll take it until you let 
all of your anger out.

814
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,948
I'll do it even if your anger 
never goes away.

815
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,201
I'll still take it.

816
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,080
So…

817
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:35,084
couldn't you give…

818
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:41,424
your blessing to Yong-pil and Sam-dal?

819
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,764
Just hate me instead.

820
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,188
If Mi-ja

821
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:58,816
knew Yong-pil was suffering,

822
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:03,821
wouldn't she be heartbroken?

823
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:29,514
Ko Mi-ja!

824
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:33,100
How…

825
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,563
How dare you utter her name?

826
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:39,357
How dare you?

827
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,818
How dare you say it?

828
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:46,489
How dare you? Get off me!

829
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,573
How dare you?

830
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,076
How dare you?

831
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,078
Mr. Cho!

832
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,080
How dare you!

833
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,706
You're not the only one.

834
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,461
You think you're the only one in pain

835
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,172
and the only one who's grieving her?

836
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:06,425
What did you say?

837
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,222
I'm in just as much pain as you are.

838
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:15,810
And I miss her just as much as you do.

839
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:17,186
I do too!

840
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,897
I miss Mi-ja too!

841
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:24,569
You're not the only one who's grieving.

842
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,612
I miss her too…

843
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,249
I lost a friend too.

844
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:43,129
You're not the only one who's in pain!

845
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,486
Mi-ja!

846
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,613
Ko Mi-ja!

847
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:11,949
I also…

848
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:15,077
I also miss my friend.

849
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:19,081
I miss my dear Mi-ja too!

CHO YONG-PIL 18 MISSED CALLS

853
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:43,249
Ms. Cho, here are the on-site photos 
of the exhibition you asked for.

854
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:46,252
We covered all the exhibitions 
starting from six years ago.

855
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:52,842
This sure is a lot.

856
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,929
It was indeed Cho's exhibition. 
It was full of grace.

857
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,931
It was a very memorable exhibition.

858
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:02,143
It was the best exhibition 
I've been to in a while.

859
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,395
I applaud her perfect composition.

860
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:07,189
Please do this more often. 
I'll be waiting.

861
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,941
LOVE BUT DO IT IN SILENCE

862
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,828
LOVE BUT DO IT IN SILENCE

863
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:25,875
I'm so sick of this.

864
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,127
Are you having fun?

865
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,963
Why are you reading 
that poetry book with so much focus?

866
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,339
What's the story about?

867
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:34,800
There's no story to a poem.

868
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,511
There are only emotions.

869
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:41,932
What are you talking about?

870
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:45,227
All right. Tell me about these emotions.

871
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:47,563
-So it's like this. 
-Okay.

872
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,274
Love that develops after a breakup.

873
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:53,235
They had no choice 
but to break up with their love.

874
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,654
-Okay. 
-And this is how they feel.

875
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,198
-They hurt. 
-Okay.

876
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:59,200
-Their heart is torn to pieces. 
-Okay.

877
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:00,284
-They cry. 
-Okay.

878
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:01,535
All they can do is cry.

879
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,412
They wrote this poem with their tears.

880
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:05,539
What? That's just unrequited love.

881
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:10,127
Why would they break up 
if they love each other? It's ridiculous.

882
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:11,837
Are they Romeo and Juliet or something?

883
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,215
How can you lack such emotion? 
It's Christmas.

884
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:18,719
You're supposed to read poetry 
with your heart and emotions. Okay?

885
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:22,389
Just go and read your textbook.

886
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:25,351
I'm so bored though. 
Just read me something.

887
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:28,062
-You're just going to fall asleep. 
-No, I won't.

888
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:30,147
-You always do. 
-I won't.

889
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:33,484
I won't fall asleep. 
I'll try to open my heart and listen.

890
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:34,985
-You won't fall asleep? 
-No.

891
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,446
"Love

892
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,366
But Do It In Silence."

2016 FIRST EXHIBITION OF CHO EUN-HYE

894
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:55,005
Hello, Ms. Cho.

895
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:59,301
"Afraid that even the shortest encounter 
would be a disturbance to you…"

896
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:04,098
"After leaving, how far apart are we now?"

897
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,858
"However far away, wherever you may be,

898
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,404
I know it hurts, 
but without anyone knowing,

899
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:21,407
love in silence."

900
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:24,869
LOVE BUT DO IT IN SILENCE

901
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:31,125
"Just like a sharp blade 
that becomes dull over time,

902
01:09:32,418 --> 01:09:34,128
just until that pain

903
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,213
starts to dull,

904
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,966
let me love alone."

905
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:41,093
PARIS MAGAZINE WORLD TOUR

906
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,304
LOVE BUT DO IT IN SILENCE

907
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,935
Someone wrote this in the guest book 
for the Paris Magazine Gallery.

908
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,815
CHO YONG-PIL

909
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:01,864
Cho Sam-dal!

910
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,377
Cho Sam-dal!

911
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,258
Let's get out of here right now.

912
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:56,520
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

913
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,964
Yong-pil… 
I don't want a one-sided love.

914
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:26,383
Let's just be in love, okay?

915
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,260
I don't have even the slightest opening

916
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,303
to get in between them.

917
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:31,305
What more do you want?

918
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:35,309
Every night for ten years, 
my wife cried by herself under a blanket!

919
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:37,978
I said how against it I was…

920
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:40,022
do you have to keep seeing her?

921
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,524
Bu Mi-ja is the woman 
you'll forever love and remember.

922
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,443
And for me, that's Sam-dal.

923
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:47,154
Even if your dad 
never gives us his blessing,

924
01:12:47,237 --> 01:12:49,615
let's always hold onto 
each other even if it hurts.

925
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:55,746
