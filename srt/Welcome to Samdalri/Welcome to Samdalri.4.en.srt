00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,593
Sir!

3
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:56,306
About 50,000 volunteers headed to Taean,
South Chungcheong to clean an oil spill…

4
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,933
-Hello.
-Hey, there.

5
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,520
They've joined the nationwide campaign
to protect the sea.

6
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,897
Despite the cold weather,
people throughout…

7
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,482
-Sir!
-What is it?

8
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,317
Your face. My goodness.

9
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,277
My face?

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,362
Is there something on my face?

11
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,656
-Yes.
-Really? Where?

12
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,951
-This side?
-Yes, that side.

13
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,538
Hello.

14
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,790
Where? What is it?

15
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,083
-Right there.
-Okay.

16
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,626
-I can see it.
-Here?

17
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,211
Your handsomeness.

18
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:27,879
My handsomeness?

19
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,466
Yes. Handsomeness.

20
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,635
Handsomeness?

21
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,928
Excuse me.

22
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:48,650
Hey, Sam-dal. Stop being so late.
I'm running out of excuses to stall him.

23
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:53,655
But I'd be even more grateful
if you called me "Eun-hye" instead. Okay?

24
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:12,382
The temperature and humidity
hidden within the clouds

25
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,511
change forms without our knowing,
from fog to clouds and then to rain.

26
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,348
Babe, my hands are freezing.

27
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,437
You're pretty.

28
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,613
Gosh, it's so cold!

29
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,989
What are you doing?

30
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,123
How much pocket money do you have?

31
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,504
Let me borrow this.

32
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,048
My allowance ran out.
I'm cold and starving.

33
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,385
What are you doing?
I won't have any money left for myself.

34
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,638
-If I let you…
-I'll pay you back next month. Okay?

35
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,558
-Let go of my arm. What's with you?
-Please? It's been so hard lately.

36
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:07,687
And likewise, before I even realized it,

37
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:11,149
my feelings suddenly changed forms
from friendship to love.

38
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,111
-Did you know?
-What?

39
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,322
They say if you catch
a falling cherry blossom petal,

40
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,492
your first love will come true.

41
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,995
Jeez, that's so cheesy.

42
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,915
Are you from the Joseon Dynasty?
What an ancient myth.

43
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,751
How are you ever going to
find a date like that?

44
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,755
You're so unromantic
even when it's spring.

45
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,174
What are you saying? Worry about yourself.

46
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:26,767
Darn it.

47
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,269
Yes! This is mine!

48
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,440
It's mine!

49
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,859
I guess my first love
will come true, Yong-pil.

50
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,863
How do I look, Yong-pil? Pretty, right?

51
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,623
The one I fell in love with back then.

52
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,878
My crazy fool.

53
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:08,934
EPISODE 4
THE ROTTEN APPLE OF MY EYE

54
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,326
Jeez.

55
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,039
MENTEE LEE YEON-JI

56
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,545
Hey, did I get in?

57
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,757
I didn't?

58
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,429
What's the reason this time?

59
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,974
They said it was
because of the issue with your sister.

60
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,852
All the flight attendants know
AS Group's stopping your reinstatement.

61
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,563
It's absurd.

62
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,857
They'll use your sister
as an excuse for some time.

63
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,527
-Are the rumors true?
-No, of course not.

64
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,906
Anyway, I understand. Thanks.

65
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,894
SHE'LL RESENT HER PARENTS.
AT WHAT AGE DID SHE GET PREGNANT.

66
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,491
Why don't you go? She listens to you.

67
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,242
Are you crazy? You should go.

68
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,828
Your big mouth caused
all of this, so you go.

69
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,538
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Okay.

70
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,415
I won though! Hey, Sam-dal.

71
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,793
-What are you doing?
-What the… Hey!

72
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,253
-Okay, all right!
-Keep drinking then.

73
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,631
Why would you throw this? Come on.

74
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,924
-Okay, go drink.
-Hey.

75
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,092
Fine. Just drink.

76
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,135
Guys, how do we handle her tantrum?

77
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,763
What do we do?

78
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,685
You're happy
that I came back as a failure?

79
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:02,023
Hey! Why don't you
throw a party or something?

80
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,109
How about I get
a whole pig for a barbecue?

81
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,902
Sam-dal, it's a misunderstanding.

82
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,988
You misunderstood me. What I meant was--

83
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,531
-Hey.
-She can't hear you!

84
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,492
She can't hear you.
Go there and say it politely.

85
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,161
Why don't you go?
She threw a full can at us.

86
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,455
She still has
the same rotten habits when drunk.

87
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,251
No.

88
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,088
It's my fault for crawling back
to this good-for-nothing town.

89
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,717
I should just drink myself to death. Yeah.

90
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,970
Hurry and clean up the mess you made.
You know how it'll end.

91
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,306
-God, I just remembered.
-We have to stop her before it happens.

92
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,142
-This feels ominous.
-What'll we do?

93
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,521
-Hold on.
-What?

94
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,064
I hate this town.

95
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,316
Hey, don't do that!

96
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,693
Hey, Sam-dal.

97
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,737
-That's not the toilet.
-What is she doing?

98
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,113
Hey, that's…

99
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,157
-Let's go, Tae-hee.
-Why are you taking her?

100
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,659
-Why are you taking that?
-Why is she taking that?

101
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,494
Hey, Sam-dal.

102
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,954
-Hey, that's not a photo.
-Hey.

103
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,122
-Wait.
-It's a cut-out…

104
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,874
-All right.
-Hey.

105
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,918
Don't follow me, you jerks.

106
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,504
-No. Hey! Don't.
-Go away!

107
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,173
You're going to hurt yourself.

108
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,508
Let's go.

109
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,053
Let's go drink some more in my room.

110
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,929
Let's just follow her.

111
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,849
-Where is she going?
-Hey.

112
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,852
-Why did she drink so much?
-Did she really drink all that?

113
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,646
-Jeez.
-Why did she put so much soju in the beer?

114
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,360
Jeez.

115
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,528
What is it?

116
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,657
-What? Come on, now.
-Stay there and tell us.

117
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,166
-What's with that stare?
-Hold on.

118
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,667
-Don't tell me…
-Sam-dal.

119
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,088
Are you okay?

120
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,882
Cho Sam-dal! Get it together!

121
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,551
Hey, open your eyes properly.

122
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,472
Guys, I don't think she's okay.

123
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,352
Who are you?

124
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,603
"Who are you?"

125
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,482
-Hey!
-Hey!

126
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,363
I told you not to give her
soju and beer. Hold on.

127
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,490
-Didn't we drink the same thing?
-One, two…

128
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:18,827
Who are you?

129
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,328
She asked the question.

130
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,746
It can't be.

131
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,040
-No, don't.
-It's happening again.

132
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,835
-What? It can't be.
-It's happening.

133
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,752
Catch her!

134
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,048
-Hey!
-Hey!

135
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,554
I scraped my knee.

136
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,722
She comes back
and first thing she does is this.

137
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,600
I'm almost 40,
and I can't believe I'm doing this again.

138
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:43,685
People don't change.

139
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,562
Goodness.

140
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,521
Get her up.

141
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,648
One, two, three!

142
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,192
-No.
-No. It hurts.

143
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,798
What in the world?

144
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,844
Why am I here?

145
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,264
What is this?

146
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,024
How did I get home last night?

147
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,779
My homing instinct.

148
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,034
My homing instinct is excellent.
That's right.

149
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,422
What's the matter?
You're going running again?

150
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,342
It's still cold outside, honey.

151
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,177
I said it's cold…

152
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,721
Stop running.

153
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,431
Move.

154
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,891
I didn't do it.

155
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:09,938
What?

156
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,691
I never bullied that girl.

157
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,818
Your daughter

158
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,237
has never done anything shameful

159
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,448
in her entire life.

160
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,535
So stop running.

161
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,041
Is that really true?

162
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,962
So none of those articles are right?

163
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,256
You didn't do it, right?

164
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,428
That's right.

165
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,807
See? I told you.

166
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,730
If you didn't do it,
why did you run away and come here?

167
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,565
You should go and deny the allegations.

168
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,696
I'm coming with you to the mainland.

169
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,322
We need to fix all of this.

170
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,574
Let's go right now.

171
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:04,909
They won't listen to me.

172
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,120
What?

173
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,164
They won't listen even if I explain.

174
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,376
No matter how much I deny it…

175
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,339
no one will hear me out, so what can I do?

176
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,260
Please, be patient. And everything…

177
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,470
Sir?

178
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,347
Wait!

179
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,850
Do you admit
that you've been abusing Bang?

180
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,394
No, I never did that.

181
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,812
Why did you do it?

182
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,189
Eun-ju, this isn't right.

183
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,983
You can't do this, Eun-ju!

184
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,694
Let's talk about this. Okay?

185
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,281
I really am innocent,

186
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,534
but no one is willing to believe me.

187
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,412
That's why I came here.

188
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,710
You were so confident when you first left.

189
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:57,754
What have you been doing

190
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,923
for the past 18 years?

191
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:06,971
Working.

192
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,057
What?

193
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,227
I've worked. What else?

194
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,064
All I did was work like a dog.

195
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,025
Was that so wrong?

196
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,635
Don't run!

197
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,182
Mom!

198
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,195
-I'm off to work, Dad.
-What about breakfast?

199
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,572
I'll eat later… I said this wasn't trash.

200
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,449
Bye.

201
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,372
Goodness, where is Ms. Ko headed?

202
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,707
If she keeps running
like that, she'll fall ill.

203
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,838
What a lovely day for a jog.

204
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,342
I know I shouldn't say this,

205
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,304
but every time your daughters
do something to make you run,

206
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,515
it makes me so happy.

207
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,101
-What are you talking about?
-What?

208
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,980
Every time they cause trouble
and upset you,

209
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,816
it's good for me
since I get a jogging buddy.

210
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,194
I've been so lonely
jogging alone these days.

211
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,201
You're catching seaweed tomorrow, right?

212
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,078
Don't overdo it though.

213
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,914
Yours is always the heaviest,
so it's hard to carry.

214
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,208
Why do you keep coming to help out?

215
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,752
Don't come tomorrow.

216
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:02,962
Why not?

217
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,382
I'm a haenyeo's son.
Of course, I should come to help out.

218
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,051
Don't go wandering around town so much.

219
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,137
Why not?

220
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,313
Sam-dal is here.

221
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,064
Okay, so what?

222
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,236
She'll be here for a while,
so try not to run into her.

223
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,782
That's impossible to do.
Our neighborhood is so tiny.

224
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:34,327
If you see each other,
what good will come of it?

225
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,620
It'll only upset you.

226
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:38,748
By the way,

227
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,085
are you worried about Sam-dal or me?

228
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,964
Which one is it? Sam-dal or me?

229
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,425
Both.

230
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,428
That's not true.

231
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,224
I think you worry
about her more these days.

232
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,436
It's so sad not to have a mom.

233
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,772
What kind of nonsense is that?

234
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,360
-What's wrong with your leg? Are you hurt?
-No.

235
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,444
What's the matter?

236
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,240
I just fell down
while drinking last night.

237
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,244
For goodness' sake. You and your drinking.

238
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,704
You're old enough to know better.

239
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,666
Look who's talking!
You're jogging in your long johns

240
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,334
in the morning… Put this on.

241
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:25,920
I have to go to work now.

242
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,171
Bye, Mom.

243
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,134
Hurry and go home!

244
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,852
-Hello.
-Hey.

245
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,439
-What's wrong with your leg?
-I hurt it.

246
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,566
-Doing what?
-Being loving.

247
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,776
Hello.

248
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,486
It's true though.

249
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,531
You showed so much love
your knee took the brunt of it.

250
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,242
Hold on.

251
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,370
I'm so exhausted.

252
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,621
Let's rest for a bit.

253
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,415
Why did she drink so much?

254
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,625
Hold on.

255
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:05,876
Wait. Hey.

256
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,044
Hey, Sam-dal.

257
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,671
Wake up. Open your eyes.

258
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,591
This won't work.

259
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,842
This won't do.

260
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,302
Let's get up and go.

261
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,805
Gyeong-tae and Sang-do,
grab her legs. We'll grab her arms.

262
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:18,764
Hold on.

263
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,851
I'll just carry her on my back.

264
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,311
What?

265
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,563
She lives next door. I'll carry her home.

266
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,772
Put her on my back.

267
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:27,732
-Really?
-Yeah.

268
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:28,649
Okay.

269
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,859
Hold on.

270
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,070
-Okay.
-She's heavy. Be careful.

271
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,613
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. See you.

272
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,576
-What's going on?
-Hold on.

273
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:39,827
-Hey!
-What are you doing?

274
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,953
-What is this?
-Hey!

275
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,628
What?

276
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,840
-God…
-What's wrong with him?

277
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:53,924
What did you say?

278
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,636
What the…

279
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,928
Bang Eun-ju.

280
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,183
Cheon Chung-gi… You're both dead meat.

281
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,267
Bang what?

282
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,353
-What…
-Hey.

283
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:06,729
-What's wrong with him?
-My knee.

284
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,105
Are you all right?

285
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,232
Don't ever fall in love again.

286
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,318
Or you'll destroy your knees.

287
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,236
Listen to me.

288
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,948
If you still love her after getting
dumped like that, you're an idiot.

289
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,287
Right. Hey.

290
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,999
I know Bang Eun-ju is her assistant,
but who's Cheon Chung-gi?

291
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,876
She kept mentioning their names.

292
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,127
How should I know, you fool?

293
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:31,837
You're right.

294
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,131
Despite what your knees do,
you're just an ex, so--

295
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,884
Just leave. Get out.

296
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,762
Hey, I bet that's her boyfriend.

297
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,556
Have a nice day.

298
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,154
Well, it's completely fine
to have a boyfriend.

299
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,573
We've broken up.

300
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,994
I wouldn't know
how she treats her assistants.

301
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,000
I have a meeting right now. I got to go.

302
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,377
Okay. Bye.

303
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,715
How did these damn reporters
find out about me?

304
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,082
PLAYGROUND

305
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,841
No way.

306
00:20:58,924 --> 00:20:59,884
Look who it is.

307
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,511
How dare you show your face here?

308
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,721
Eun-bi!

309
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,806
That's no way to talk
to your senior colleague.

310
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,558
It's not like I want to be here.

311
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,977
I just came to pack up my stuff.

312
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,648
You still want respect
after what you did to her?

313
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,692
Don't you know how Ms. Cho treated you?

314
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,776
Of course, I do.

315
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:22,072
She held me back and destroyed
my self-esteem, saying I wasn't ready.

316
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,451
A project came in
as soon as I quit this place.

317
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,745
From Magazine X, no less.

318
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,413
Did you know that?

319
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,625
Did Chung-gi help you?

320
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:37,421
Is this your way of taking revenge
after being humiliated for cheating?

321
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,381
You must be so happy to get that project.

322
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:43,219
You're going to do what took Ms. Cho
months to do? With those lame skills?

323
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,429
Ms. Cho overshadowed me,
so you may not know…

324
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,474
but I'm pretty good.

325
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,395
Let me ask you something then.

326
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,605
Why did you lie?

327
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,862
Ms. Cho bullied you in secret?

328
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,281
We were with you two day in and day out.

329
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:05,449
It's absurd.

330
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,035
This isn't about Ms. Cho, is it?

331
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,538
This must be
about something else. What is it?

332
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,373
What's she talking about?

333
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,624
-Bang Eun-ju.
-Eun-bi.

334
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,501
-Let go of me!
-Eun-bi, don't!

335
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,752
-Eun-ju!
-Eun-bi!

336
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,923
Hey. Did you get everything?

337
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,424
Yeah. Let's get out of here.

338
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,592
Get in.

339
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,729
By the way,

340
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,691
did Eun-hye really bully you?

341
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,737
She may be blunt with her words,
but she's not the type to bully anyone--

342
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,239
Are you saying I'm lying?

343
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,784
Just drive!

344
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,495
All right.

345
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,667
Where are we…

346
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,169
I'll just figure it out.

347
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,937
Ms. Ko!

348
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:20,733
You can skip work today
if you're not feeling well.

349
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:24,069
We're breeding sea cucumbers.
The head haenyeo can't be absent for that.

350
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,197
And I'm fine.

351
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,325
Is that so?

352
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,953
It's already happened.

353
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:36,707
I heard people write
official apologies these days.

354
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,376
If she apologizes sincerely
and shows remorse,

355
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,421
I'm sure she'll get another chance.

356
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,757
Without any makeup on either.

357
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,093
I heard you can just apologize
while looking haggard.

358
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,928
-Right.
-That'll convince everyone.

359
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:54,725
What?

360
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,605
-Ms. Ko!
-Ms. Ko!

361
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,899
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

362
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,277
Oh, no. Did we say something to upset her?

363
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,868
Where did my phone go?

364
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,453
Is it here?

365
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,082
Jeez, this is driving me insane.

366
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,627
What? Why are you back?

367
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,213
What? Where are we going?

368
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,513
Why would you say
such nonsense and upset her?

369
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,224
I only said it
because she seemed to be feeling okay.

370
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,351
Sam-dal's bound to be coming back soon.

371
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,019
Of course, she's not okay.

372
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:42,106
We have to get this done now.
Is she really not coming?

373
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,192
There she is!

374
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:48,946
But…

375
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,489
who's that with her?

376
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:52,783
Isn't that Sam-dal?

377
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,702
-Sam-dal?
-Sam-dal's here?

378
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:55,786
She's here?

379
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,415
Oh, my gosh. I guess she's back after all.

380
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,543
Ms. Ko must be so upset.

381
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,472
-Hi, Sam-dal.
-When did you get here?

382
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,850
-How long are you here for?
-Good to see you.

383
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:20,394
Tell them yourself.

384
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,105
What? What are you doing, Mom?

385
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,441
Tell them it's not true.

386
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,067
Tell them you're innocent!

387
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,156
When she was a child,

388
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:36,034
she'd invite all the kids
who didn't have any friends to our house.

389
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,455
She ate with all the kids
who had to eat alone

390
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,290
because their parents weren't home.

391
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,833
Have you all forgotten that?

392
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,752
-Gosh.
-Of course not.

393
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,838
But you really think she'd bully someone?

394
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,799
Mom, come on. Don't do this.

395
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:51,925
Apologize?

396
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,053
Why does she have to when she's innocent?

397
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,723
You gossiped after reading those articles.

398
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:01,268
You're so quick to judge
without hearing her side of the story.

399
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,021
She said she didn't do it.
She said it never happened!

400
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,399
Have you ever known her to lie?

401
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,735
-Of course not. Never.
-No.

402
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,487
Mom.

403
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,864
That girl named Bang Eun-ju

404
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:18,160
and Sam-dal's boyfriend
had an affair, so they had a fight!

405
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:19,745
-What?
-What?

406
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,456
Mom!

407
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,129
Jeez.

408
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,924
What? Sam-dal's back?

409
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,384
So she also failed and came back?

410
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:37,012
But that's not what's important.

411
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,015
-Cheated?
-Her boyfriend cheated on her?

412
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,809
With the mentee who tried to kill herself?

413
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,101
Are you serious?

414
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:46,522
-Poor Sam-dal.
-I feel so bad for her.

415
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,942
-Poor thing.
-I feel so terrible for her.

416
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,862
Why pity her? Have you forgotten
how she treated Yong-pil?

417
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,656
Right. Sam-dal's being punished.

418
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,824
What about Yong-pil?

419
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,575
They'll run into each other.

420
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,869
She lets this happen
after dumping him like that?

421
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,079
-Jeez.
-Jeez.

422
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,789
Drink up.

423
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:04,873
Exactly.

424
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,124
Seriously.

425
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,668
Poor thing.

426
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:12,965
I feel terrible for our dear Yong-pil!
Poor Yong-pil!

427
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,049
Darn it.

428
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,056
Baek-ho, it'll rain in two days.

429
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,766
No, it won't.

430
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,227
Wind's blowing from the southeast.

431
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,981
Only the wind from a typhoon
can blow the rain clouds away.

432
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,649
I'm telling you it'll rain.

433
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,318
-Which figures are you basing this on?
-Figures?

434
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,071
Well…

435
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,490
Based on our cleaning lady's knees.

436
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,576
Her knees are aching a lot.

437
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,580
I'm joking. Take a look
at the Local Data System.

438
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,039
Just take a look.

439
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,417
Rain clouds will form when the wind

440
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,836
goes behind Hallasan Mountain
and gathers moisture.

441
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,006
I can guarantee it.
It's going to rain, so change the report.

442
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,384
I'd like to change you instead,
you blockhead.

443
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,094
Damn it.

444
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,222
It'll rain. Hurry and change it.

445
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,266
You should get that.

446
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:09,855
It's not mine.

447
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:14,902
What's this?

448
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:19,656
What?

449
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,327
But who's Cheon Chung-gi?
I bet that's her boyfriend.

450
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,245
I bet that's her boyfriend.

451
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,131
Darn it.

452
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,722
Pick up your phone faster!

453
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,767
Where are you? What am I to do
if you disappear like this?

454
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,520
The reporters somehow found out
about us and won't stop calling me.

455
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:51,647
Come back and fix this.

456
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,440
It's driving me crazy!

457
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,819
Eun-hye, you should apologize
in this situation.

458
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,988
Avoiding it like this won't work.

459
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,699
Hello?

460
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,535
-Are you there?
-Excuse me.

461
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:06,620
What the…

462
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,081
Why should she apologize?

463
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,207
Who is this?

464
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,293
Who are you to answer her phone?

465
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:20,008
Did Eun-hye get a new boyfriend already?
In that short period?

466
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,262
Who are you? How long has it been?

467
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,513
Did she cheat on me?

468
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,976
What a crazy bastard.

469
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,688
Why would she date someone like him?

470
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,275
Damn it.

471
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,914
How would I know about the delay?
They told me to get off, so I did.

472
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,792
I'm leaving now. I won't be late.

473
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:59,756
Stop rushing me. It hasn't even begun yet.
I'll send you the photos later. Okay.

474
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,974
AS, A COMPANY THAT OPENS UP THE FUTURE

475
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,477
It's trendy, isn't it?

476
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,313
Right.

477
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,773
Yes. This way, sir.

478
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,860
Okay. Hey, let's take a photo.

479
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,072
One, two, three.

480
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,666
Open what up?

481
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,669
Are you seriously out of your mind?

482
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:41,340
What? Open up the future?
Why did you stick your face on that?

483
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:46,595
Father, the trend nowadays
is to be comical and retro, so--

484
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,721
Comical?

485
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:52,559
This is exactly why people say
you became stupid after your ex-wife left.

486
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,227
I'm sorry.

487
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,731
If you don't complete the deal
for the theme park in Jeju,

488
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,441
don't even think of coming back!

489
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,400
Yes, I'll--

490
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:18,168
What?

491
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,088
Secretary Ko. What's it called

492
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,883
when you feel like you've seen
something from your dreams?

493
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,761
Déjà wa. Right?

494
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,222
I think I've seen this in my dreams.

495
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:32,974
It's called déjà vu, sir.

496
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,434
Right, that's what I meant.

497
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:37,604
And you didn't see it in your dreams.
You've been here before.

498
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,440
I have? Here?

499
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:41,525
Yes, sir.

500
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,860
Your ex-wife's family lives here.

501
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,032
Right.

502
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,201
You're right.

503
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,370
I remember it now.

504
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,499
Their house was somewhere around there.

505
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,501
Yes, the one with the blue roof.

506
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,003
It's the neighboring village,
and it's a red roof.

507
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:08,760
BEER

508
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,946
The new AS Beer
is much better than this one.

509
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,494
I heard they put poison in it.

510
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:35,495
Sorry?

511
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:36,955
Poison.

512
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,665
Poison?

513
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:41,835
Po?

514
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,422
Have a nice day!

515
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,425
You too.

516
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,345
Are you out of AS Beer? I can't find any.

517
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,263
What?

518
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,683
They should be there.
I restocked a bunch this morning.

519
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,767
They're all gone.

520
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,063
What? That's strange.

521
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,483
There were a ton of them.

522
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,053
This is nice.

523
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,981
It's true that there's
complex precipitation at the moment.

524
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,524
But based on the data,

525
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,277
it's unlikely Jeju will be affected by it.

526
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,362
One minute, please.

527
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:52,781
Could you look at the radar?

528
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:57,661
You can see that the wind
has died down considerably.

529
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,998
So you shouldn't completely exclude Jeju.

530
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,255
Why aren't you picking up?

531
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,423
Who in the world has my phone?

532
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,759
Maybe you dropped it
on the ground somewhere.

533
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:16,263
Aunt Sam-dal's phone perished
because of her nasty drinking habit.

534
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,227
I looked everywhere,
but I couldn't find it.

535
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,229
One of the guys must have it.

536
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:28,650
Come on! Can you please pick up?

537
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,361
By the way, are you okay
with seeing Yong-pil?

538
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,029
Are you really fine?

539
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,908
It's been eight years already.

540
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,910
Should I have butterflies? Or cry?

541
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,331
Darn it. I wonder who has my phone.

542
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,334
What's wrong with your head?

543
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,920
-Something's sticking out.
-That hurts!

544
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:53,091
There's a bump on my head. Don't touch it.

545
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,551
It hurts.

546
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,972
-It hurts!
-You really might die on the streets.

547
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,817
Gosh, that's cold! What was that?

548
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,737
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

549
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,406
Are you serious?
Do you know how expensive this is?

550
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,074
-I'm sorry.
-Look, mister.

551
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:19,534
You should be more careful.

552
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,578
I'm sorry, sir.

553
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:24,497
It got all over you.

554
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,837
The supercar's still here.

555
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,048
Maybe a celebrity's eating here.

556
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,468
-Should I take a photo next to it?
-Yeah, do it.

557
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,306
-You look so handsome.
-Pretty charming, right?

558
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,397
Would you like a photo together?

559
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,232
No.

560
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,817
-That's okay.
-I'm sorry.

561
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:06,164
SAMDAL PHARMACY

562
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,935
Gosh, how did you
hit your head on the ground?

563
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,604
There's only one reason
why your head would hit the ground.

564
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,107
She fell. Really hard.

565
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,024
Who did?

566
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,194
What? Someone I know.
Could you put it in a bag for me?

567
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,033
-Gosh.
-What's wrong with your leg?

568
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,162
-I fell as well.
-Goodness.

569
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:48,415
It'll leave a scar if it's a wound.

570
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,959
-Do you want some ointment?
-No, that's okay.

571
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,628
It'll be all better
once I get a good night's sleep.

572
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,004
See you.

573
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,798
Bye.

574
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,306
Goodness.

575
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,310
-Hello--
-Do you have a death wish? Who are you?

576
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,439
You should've picked up sooner
if you had my phone.

577
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,899
It's not like I wanted to hold on to it.

578
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,653
Yong-pil?

579
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,655
Yes, it's me. So what?

580
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,042
Give it to me.

581
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:40,383
Is that really the first thing
you're going to say to me?

582
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,220
Do you remember what happened last night?

583
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,932
No, I don't.

584
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,560
-You don't?
-Give me back my phone now.

585
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,063
Seriously? What's the last thing
you remember?

586
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,860
Hey, Sam-dal.
It's just a misunderstanding.

587
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,029
You're curious about how I've been doing?

588
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,865
You know dozens of news articles
about me pop up each day.

589
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,201
So you're seriously curious
about how I've been?

590
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,747
What do you think?
Does it look like I'm doing well?

591
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:14,000
It's not true.

592
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:17,128
I'm really innocent!

593
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:20,423
-I don't remember anything.
-None of it? Really?

594
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,217
None.

595
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,179
How could you not remember that?

596
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,807
That's strange.
You remember meeting the boys?

597
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,267
No, I don't.

598
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:34,979
How could you not remember?
You weren't even drunk then. Stop lying.

599
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,274
Well, it's…
It's because I really don't remember.

600
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,151
Just give me back my phone already.

601
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,947
-Did you just laugh at me?
-No, I didn't.

602
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,741
-You just laughed at me!
-I said I didn't laugh at you.

603
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,202
You get so riled up over everything. Jeez.

604
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,079
That's right. I am riled up.

605
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,666
Wouldn't you be too
if you were in my situation?

606
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,501
I came here to avoid the reporters.

607
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,087
You expect me to be all stoic
and say it was my fault?

608
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,464
You remember it all, right?

609
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,425
Damn it.

610
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,221
I'm glad though.

611
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:10,515
Why?

612
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,100
I'm just glad

613
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,270
that the old Sam-dal is back.

614
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,566
It's not like you to pretend to be okay.
That's what you do at work.

615
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,110
What are you saying?

616
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:23,987
Just give me my phone.

617
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,905
Fine, I will.

618
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,282
It's not like I stole it.

619
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,327
By the way, can I ask you something?

620
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:32,996
What is it?

621
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,498
Are you…

622
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,878
By any chance, are you seeing…

623
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:47,093
Never mind.

624
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:02,942
So Sam-dal's boyfriend
had an affair with that Bang Eun-ju girl.

625
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:05,987
And that's why she fought with that girl?

626
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,866
Yes, and she recorded that and acted
like she was bullied to end Sam-dal.

627
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,910
Is she crazy?

628
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,912
Why is Sam-dal doing nothing about it?

629
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,750
Is Bang Eun-ju here or something?
Why are you so worked up?

630
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,335
-I mean…
-Calm down.

631
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,754
I doubt anyone
would listen to her right now.

632
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:28,676
Hold on.

633
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,261
In that case,

634
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,139
the guy who cheated on her
must be Cheon Chung-gi.

635
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,475
It's that guy she mentioned
when she was drunk.

636
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,185
You're right. It's that bastard.

637
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,023
Cheon Chung-gi, that son of a…

638
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,540
Thanks.

639
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,626
Hey.

640
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,503
Yeah?

641
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,342
Is he your boyfriend?

642
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,678
What?

643
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,974
I mean, the picture on your phone.
Is he your boyfriend?

644
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,267
Right…

645
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,270
Yes.

646
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:23,481
He is?

647
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,610
I see.

648
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,072
Is he good to you?

649
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,951
Of course.

650
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,205
I see. Is that so?

651
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,583
That's a relief, then.

652
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,795
If your boyfriend treats you well,

653
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,632
maybe you could tell him
to get me some ointment for my knee?

654
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:54,887
I may not show it,
but my knee's killing me right now.

655
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,305
You didn't know, did you?

656
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,766
I fell because of you last night.

657
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,269
-Do you want me to show you?
-No, that's okay.

658
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,812
I'm going home. Bye.

659
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:07,066
Hold on. My knee seriously hurts.
It needs some very expensive ointment.

660
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,861
Fine, I'll buy it for you tomorrow. Bye.

661
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,571
But when exactly?

662
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,588
Goodness.

663
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,964
Have you lost your mind?

664
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,885
God, I almost had a heart attack.

665
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,803
Jeez.

666
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,433
You said that cheating bastard
was your boyfriend?

667
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,726
And he treats you well?

668
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,478
You must be out of your mind!

669
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,730
You should've said you didn't know him.

670
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:50,485
He saw our picture on my phone,
so it was obvious he was my boyfriend.

671
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,863
But you want me to say
he's my cheating ex-boyfriend?

672
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,782
To Yong-pil, of all people?

673
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:56,908
I absolutely can't.

674
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,535
Hey, keep it down.

675
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,747
Yeah, I can understand.

676
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,209
Yong-pil kicked her to the curb.
So she'd look even more pitiful.

677
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,836
You should've deleted Chung-gi's number.

678
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:14,717
Even the neighborhood dog
knows Chung-gi cheated on you.

679
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,428
It's only a matter of time
before Yong-pil finds out.

680
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,013
What will you do then?

681
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:21,057
I don't know.

682
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,600
I have no idea.

683
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:23,976
What should I do?

684
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,562
What am I going to do?

685
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,523
Oh, no.

686
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,774
What do I do?

687
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,365
What's the deal with this Cheon Chung-gi?

688
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,200
Damn it.

689
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,873
Then again, it's none of my business.

690
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:52,922
It was clear as day
that he was an immature brat.

691
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,260
Why would she date a guy like that?

692
00:43:58,803 --> 00:43:59,804
Why?

693
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,574
MEDICINE

694
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,713
This is a public announcement.

695
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,757
We'll be catching seaweed today.

696
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:40,344
All haenyeos are required to gather
at the rest area by 8:00 a.m.

697
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:45,099
Those who wish to help out afterwards
should be there by 11:00 a.m.

698
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,143
I don't want to help out, Mom.

699
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,477
Are you crazy?

700
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,229
-Come on!
-I don't want to!

701
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,607
-I won't go!
-I won't do it. It's not right.

702
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,734
Jeez, Mom.

703
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:56,485
Don't make me tell you again.

704
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,238
You'd better be there
before the elders arrive.

705
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,575
Mom, let's be honest.
I shouldn't be there.

706
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:05,786
The people in our town
talk about me all the time.

707
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,289
I'll become a laughingstock
if I'm seen there.

708
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,790
-I agree.
-Me too.

709
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,376
Then, are you going
to stay in hiding forever?

710
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,588
Why would you hide when you're innocent?

711
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:19,050
Everyone knows my daughters
are doing nothing at home.

712
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,178
-So how could you not come?
-Fine, we'll work then.

713
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:25,139
We'll do anything you want
except for meeting people.

714
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,682
Anything. Seriously!

715
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,144
-She really startled me.
-Seriously.

716
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,687
Hurry up and get ready!

717
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:35,524
But still, Mom.
Isn't Yong-pil going to be there too?

718
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:39,111
Then, Sam-dal shouldn't go.
Everyone will gossip even more.

719
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,529
-Right.
-She's right.

720
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,868
He's not coming.

721
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,162
I told him not to.

722
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,165
You'd better be on time.

723
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,085
Mom, listen. Wait.

724
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,086
Mom, look.

725
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,253
Come on, Mom!

726
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,148
Good work.

727
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,154
Damn it. What's going on?

728
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:23,906
For crying out loud, Mom.

729
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,575
She said he wouldn't be here.

730
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,495
-But what are they talking about?
-What?

731
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,082
Are they telling him
your boyfriend cheated on you?

732
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,336
-You should just go home.
-Yeah, go home. Hurry.

733
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,546
Why would I go home?

734
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,258
Let's go.

735
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:45,428
Come on.

736
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,554
-I mean--
-It's okay.

737
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,097
Here. Take this.

738
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:52,268
You should ask if Yong-pil knows
that Chung-gi cheated on you.

739
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,436
What if he doesn't?

740
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,689
Then, just stay by his side
until this is all over.

741
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,607
-Stay by his side?
-Yeah.

742
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:01,736
The neighbors won't tell him
about you if you're with him.

743
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:03,279
Right.

744
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,198
But what if he already knows everything?

745
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,075
Then in that case, you have no choice

746
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:09,827
but to run.

747
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,996
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

748
00:47:58,876 --> 00:47:59,710
Hey.

749
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:04,173
Are you happy
your boyfriend is good to you?

750
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,010
How well does he treat you?

751
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,138
What kind of question is that?

752
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,389
He just treats me well.

753
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:14,767
Come on. Explain how he treats you well.

754
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,646
Well, he protects me a lot.

755
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,566
The reporters somehow found out
about us and won't stop calling me.

756
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,777
Come back and fix this.
It's driving me crazy!

757
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,445
He seemed pretty self-centered.

758
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,572
-What?
-What?

759
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:30,658
Nothing.

760
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,409
And what else does he do?

761
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,453
How does he treat you well?

762
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:38,541
Well, he trusts me no matter what.

763
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,877
You should apologize in this situation.
Avoiding it like this won't work.

764
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:43,796
Yeah, right.

765
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,549
He's a gentleman.

766
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,800
And not a loser?

767
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,053
Are you joking right now? What's with you?

768
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:53,931
Goodness.

769
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:55,474
I put too much in.

770
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:56,559
Hey.

771
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:00,521
Goodness.

772
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,107
Does she know or is she clueless?

773
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,775
What's up with him?

774
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,238
I'm so tired.

775
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:22,334
-Hey, come here.
-Why? God, what is it?

776
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,211
Just go home.

777
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:28,132
It breaks our hearts to see you
and Sam-dal together like this.

778
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:32,303
You don't still have
feelings for her, right?

779
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,846
What are you talking about?

780
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,264
-Come on.
-Jeez.

781
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:39,435
Why would you say that when you know
Sam-dal dumped him so heartlessly?

782
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,645
-I dumped him?
-That's exactly my point.

783
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:45,232
He was practically a zombie
when she dumped him to study abroad.

784
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:46,942
Enough. It's all in the past.

785
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,777
Stop it already!

786
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,821
-Go home.
-We won't stop. Come here.

787
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:52,198
I'm not leaving.

788
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,911
I dumped him?

789
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:01,290
Let's just break up.
I don't need you anymore.

790
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,708
Yong-pil.

791
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,878
I can't do this, Yong-pil.

792
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,297
Please come out, Yong-pil.

793
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,341
Yong-pil…

794
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,593
Yong-pil!

795
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,725
-Just go home.
-Why should I?

796
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,686
-I said I'm not going. Let go!
-That's cold.

797
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:33,822
Are you okay? Sorry…

798
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,915
What's the matter with you?

799
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,708
What?

800
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:45,793
I mean…

801
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,462
It honestly wasn't intentional…

802
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,758
-You think it's funny?
-What?

803
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,220
No, it's just…

804
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,014
There's seaweed

805
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:01,558
on your face.

806
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:17,992
Are you okay?

807
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:22,746
Do you want this?

808
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:24,456
You want to wipe your face?

809
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,250
No?

810
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:30,796
What was that for?

811
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:33,007
Hey.

812
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,258
Look.

813
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,468
-What?
-What are you doing?

814
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:39,680
What's wrong with you?

815
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,765
Hey. Stop it.

816
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,183
Seriously.

817
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:45,019
I said stop.

818
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,538
Hey!

819
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,713
This has turned into a mess.

820
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,138
Hey!

821
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,309
I have nothing to do with this.

822
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:41,718
I dumped you eight years ago?

823
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:43,303
You're the one who dumped me.

824
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:44,972
It doesn't matter.

825
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,223
It does matter.

826
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:51,270
Everyone thinks I'm a heartless bitch
who abandoned you to make it in Seoul.

827
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,438
But the thing is

828
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,690
it's true that you dumped me then…

829
00:53:57,151 --> 00:54:00,070
Never mind. Sure.
Let's just say I dumped you.

830
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:03,740
What do you mean
"Let's just say"? You dumped me!

831
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:08,078
Fine. I'll walk around town tomorrow
and announce to everyone

832
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:10,664
that I dumped you eight years ago, okay?

833
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:14,042
Yes, you should do that.

834
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,588
Hold on.

835
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,757
Goodness, her ex-boyfriend cheated on her.

836
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,134
-Gosh!
-Gosh!

837
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,511
Her boyfriend before that dumped her too.

838
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,472
-Goodness!
-Poor thing!

839
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:28,974
-Goodness!
-Poor girl!

840
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:29,892
My goodness.

841
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,727
-That means…
-What?

842
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,147
there must be something wrong with her.

843
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:36,732
Damn it.

844
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,904
Damn it.

845
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,074
Hey, Sam-dal.

846
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,410
What?

847
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:52,456
You asked why I wasn't curious
after reading all those articles.

848
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:54,750
Well…

849
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,795
You asked why I wasn't curious
about whether you'd bullied her or not.

850
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:00,714
Well, that's…

851
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:04,134
I was so worked up last night
I said stuff I didn't mean.

852
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:05,427
I knew it wasn't true.

853
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,558
I know you would never do that.

854
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,770
So why would I be curious?

855
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,322
But your boyfriend
didn't seem to know that.

856
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,885
Does he know something?

857
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:52,224
No, there's no way he'd know Chung-gi.

858
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,856
MEDICINE

859
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,785
BRUISE RELIEF

860
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:31,179
Eun-hye, did you find someone new already?

861
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,849
Who's the punk who answered your phone?

862
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,814
Hey. Who did you talk to? Tell me now.

863
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,318
Hello, sir.

864
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,114
-They're inside, right?
-Yes.

865
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,534
-I'm taking two beers.
-Okay.

866
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:57,372
They stopped in the middle of work
so Ms. Ko wouldn't get more upset.

867
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,707
Gosh.

868
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,666
Why are you here?

869
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,295
Hey. Can you at least take this off?

870
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,088
Yong-pil, are you okay?

871
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:09,009
Everyone's talking nonstop
about you and Sam-dal.

872
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:12,679
You hurt your knee for her one day
and then fight with her the next?

873
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:15,432
-This love really is crazy.
-That's enough.

874
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:19,686
Both her ex-boyfriends
are going to be the death of her.

875
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,814
-Hey, what did you just say?
-What?

876
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:26,526
You just said, "Both her ex-boyfriends."
What are you talking about?

877
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,655
What do you think? Thanks to her two exes,
Cheon Chung-gi and you,

878
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:31,406
Sam-dal's having a tough time.

879
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,866
Cheon Chung-gi is her ex…

880
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:34,576
They broke up?

881
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,244
-What?
-Wait a minute.

882
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:37,496
You haven't heard?

883
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:41,833
It turns out the mentee who screwed over
Sam-dal had an affair with her boyfriend.

884
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,632
Is he your boyfriend?

885
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,634
Yes.

886
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:51,968
Is he good to you?

887
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:53,845
Of course.

888
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,223
Man, you're so clueless.

889
00:57:56,765 --> 00:58:00,268
Anyway, that bastard Cheon Chung-gi
deserves a good beating.

890
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,029
Cho Sam-dal.

891
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,909
Hey, Yong-pil. Where are you?

892
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,424
What's your problem?

893
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,844
Why did you take my phone
and answer a call for me?

894
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,681
Didn't it seem obvious
you shouldn't answer it?

895
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:41,560
It did look obvious
that he was your boyfriend.

896
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,396
So why would you pick it up?

897
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,858
I don't know. I regret it too.

898
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,194
But…

899
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,325
Why is he even your boyfriend?

900
00:58:58,827 --> 00:58:59,661
What?

901
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,997
That bastard even cheated on you, so why?

902
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,334
Hey…

903
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,046
Who told you that?

904
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:13,258
Now that you live in Seoul,
have you become this forgiving?

905
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:16,052
Why would you still go out
with a cheating bastard?

906
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:18,013
You deserve better than that.

907
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,057
You like him that much?

908
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:22,142
You're wrong.

909
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,019
He's not my boyfriend.

910
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,857
Yes, I lied. So what?

911
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:31,818
Why did you lie to me?

912
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,530
Because I was embarrassed. Why else?

913
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,285
I was embarrassed, okay?

914
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:44,289
I should've met a guy
who was much better than you.

915
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,710
But I met a loser and ended up back here.

916
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,545
So I lied.

917
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:58,845
Happy? Does that make you feel better?

918
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,936
Hey, Sam-dal. Wait.

919
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:22,160
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

920
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:26,248
SOJU, BAR, KARAOKE

921
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:28,542
Sam-dal.

922
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:32,712
Do you…

923
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,133
want to be my girlfriend?

924
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:43,014
I know we've been friends forever,
but my feelings for you…

925
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,308
Damn it.

926
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,478
Do I like you?

927
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:49,813
No, I mean…

928
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:51,982
Do you like me?

929
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,775
Go out with me. Starting today.

930
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:56,403
Sam-dal. I love… I think I like you.

931
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:09,624
Sam-dal…

932
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:13,962
Let's…

933
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,340
I like… No.

934
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,388
Go out with me.

935
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,477
Be my girlfriend.

936
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:48,330
Who are you?

937
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:49,998
What?

938
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,167
Hey!

939
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,335
Hey.

940
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,253
What? Are you drunk?

941
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:57,255
How is she drunk?

942
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,551
What? Why did she finish
so many bottles on her own?

943
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:12,812
Sam-dal.

944
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:14,731
Wake up.

945
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,442
Why did you drink so much?

946
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:19,527
Hold on.

947
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:20,445
Gosh.

948
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,490
Hey, hold on.

949
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,367
-No, wait!
-What? Move.

950
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,786
-I'm going to fall. Hey!
-Move.

951
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:31,748
That hurts!

952
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,796
Sam-dal, are you okay?

953
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:38,713
Hey.

954
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:40,799
Why did you do that?

955
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:51,768
What's this?

956
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:14,291
Hey, Yong-pil.
I think I like you. What should I do?

957
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,010
Hey!

958
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:26,886
Gosh, it worked!

959
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,888
I did it!

960
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,474
Yes!

961
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:32,892
It worked!

962
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:45,447
The one I fell in love with back then.

963
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:53,163
My crazy fool.

964
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:35,121
You shouldn't have lied
in the first place.

965
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,123
-Do you still like Yong-pil?
-Are you crazy?

966
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,250
A reporter who's like a sly rat
is on the loose.

967
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:40,168
This is Eun-hye.

968
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,378
-That's right!
-Oh, no.

969
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:44,047
-We're Eun-hye's friends!
-They must be crazy.

970
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:47,383
Stop right there!
Stop right there, you bastard!

971
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:50,095
Buy a ton of alcohol.
I need to be drunk for a few days.

972
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:53,181
I heard your restaurant was a success.
This is insane, Sang-do!

973
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,725
-Aren't you uncomfortable to see her?
-Should I be?

974
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,727
Yong-pil, do you know me?

975
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,021
Do you think you know everything about me?

976
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:01,272
Who are you to care?

977
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:02,774
I'm your ex!

978
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,697
