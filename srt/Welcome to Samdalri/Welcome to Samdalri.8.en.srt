00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,142
There's an uninvited guest
that visits Jeju every April.

3
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,820
As if it's jealous of the upcoming spring,

4
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,615
the bracken rain falls.

5
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,999
This uninvited guest visits us
every spring without fail.

6
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,087
And it never comes alone.

7
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,313
EPISODE 8
THE BRACKEN RAIN OF JEJU

8
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:50,986
Hello.

9
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,821
Are you guys

10
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,740
back together?

11
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,493
Come on, Dad.

12
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,872
Why would you ask such a thing?

13
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,207
It's not like that, sir.

14
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,751
I'm sorry… I mean…

15
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,210
Have a nice day.

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,677
Where have you been all…

17
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:45,957
What?

18
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,000
What is it?

19
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,047
-Did you just--
-Mom.

20
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,175
Was the Jeju Olle Trail always this hard?

21
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,594
I thought walking
would relieve the soreness,

22
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,471
but it just didn't work.

23
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,223
My body hurts so much.

24
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,141
Maybe I'll just take a nap.

25
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:14,861
Want some food?

26
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,447
No, I'm good.

27
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,289
Why are you drinking
with just pickled seafood? It's so salty.

28
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,167
Are you showing off how you're a widower?

29
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,171
And turn on the lights
when you drink. It's so dark in here.

30
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,767
The top shells are seasoned well.
They're great when steamed.

31
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,685
They're not salty either.

32
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,438
They're perfect with alcohol. Have some.

33
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,028
Here.

34
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,409
It has cucumbers.

35
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,746
You know I don't eat cucumbers.

36
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,372
Did you have to put them in?

37
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,833
You can't make this dish
without cucumbers.

38
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,793
Just pick them out then.

39
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,213
You don't like ginger,
so I leave it out when I cook.

40
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,131
You don't like ginger either.

41
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,592
Right.

42
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,053
All right, just go.

43
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,848
I wanted to drink alone,
but you've ruined the mood.

44
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,437
Forget it.

45
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,940
I'll mix it with some rice
and eat it myself.

46
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,577
By the way, Dad…

47
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,209
Do you still

48
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,294
resent her?

49
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,510
Yes.

50
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,809
EIGHT YEARS AGO

51
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,935
Dad!

52
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,646
Please don't do this!

53
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,107
Dad!

54
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,486
Open the door, Dad!

55
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:10,912
Dad…

56
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,874
Dad!

57
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,503
Open the door!

58
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,213
Please…

59
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,925
Please, don't do this!

60
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,799
Is Mom sick?

61
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,344
You startled me.

62
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,805
Why are you so jumpy?

63
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,182
What is it?

64
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,683
What do you want?

65
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,185
Is Mom sick?

66
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,395
Your mom?

67
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,398
Why would she be sick?

68
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:25,153
I mean, you were taking
water to her in her room.

69
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,529
She could get it herself.

70
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,909
I can't even get your mom some water?

71
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,377
Here you go.

72
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,385
They almost found out.

73
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,679
I said "almost."

74
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,057
I think we should tell them.

75
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,726
They have the right to know.

76
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,689
Gosh, save it.

77
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,484
They're only going to make
a big fuss about it.

78
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,695
It's not a life-or-death situation.

79
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,239
What are you talking about?

80
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,783
It is a life-or-death situation!

81
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,161
Here. This. Your heart.

82
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,247
They said it could be a ticking bomb.

83
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,291
Don't you make the situation worse either.

84
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:22,919
If I die, I die.

85
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,713
It doesn't scare me.

86
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:25,880
-Ko Mi-ja!
-Goodness.

87
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,261
How could you say such a thing?

88
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,138
For goodness' sake.

89
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,265
Damn it.

90
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,391
Gosh.

91
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:44,274
Sam-dal ran into Yong-pil's dad earlier.

92
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,358
What?

93
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,861
What happened?

94
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,196
Did he say something to her?

95
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,783
No, it's not like our kids
are dating anymore.

96
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,496
Did he yell at her about the two of them
going to the mainland together?

97
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,039
Is Sam-dal in her room?

98
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,416
No, don't.

99
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,127
I don't think she'll talk about it.

100
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,380
I feared this would happen.

101
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,803
We should've just moved

102
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,432
had we known Sam-dal would return.

103
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,727
That's what I suggested back then.

104
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,480
Why are you still worried about Sang-tae?

105
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,409
Here's our next story.

106
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,037
AS Group's market value has fallen

107
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,456
out of the top 20
for the first time in four years.

108
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,752
In 2019, the conglomerate family
was accused of abuse of power.

109
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,921
CEO Jeon Gwang-ok's wife and eldest son

110
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,340
were also accused
of providing illegal political funds.

111
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,425
Since then, they've been in plummeting…

112
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,302
Well…

113
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,681
Have you been well?

114
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,059
They've reported
continuous losses in profits.

115
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,770
And now, they're experiencing
their worst crisis yet.

116
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,605
The market--

117
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,442
Damn it.

118
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,870
-Ha-yul.
-Yes?

119
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,165
Yesterday…

120
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,584
Well…

121
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,336
So…

122
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,005
About yesterday…

123
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,674
What about yesterday?

124
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,009
I mean…

125
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,388
Why did you call me "Aunt"?

126
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,559
-No reason.
-That doesn't make any sense.

127
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,144
Did you…

128
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,397
not like it when that strange man
helped me?

129
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,940
Is that why?

130
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,316
No.

131
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,777
Then, why did you do it?

132
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:56,781
I just wished that you were
my aunt at that moment.

133
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,702
That makes no sense.

134
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,828
I don't like it.

135
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,581
Why did you want me
to be your aunt? I'm your mom.

136
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,291
She's your aunt.

137
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,879
Mom, does it really matter?

138
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,506
Can't you see that I'm reading?

139
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,387
I know, but…

140
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,606
What was that about?

141
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,572
What?

142
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,282
For crying out loud!

143
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,618
Be careful, will you?

144
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,745
She even knows what
the curse of the nines is.

145
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,665
It's not like I was on a date with him.
He just saved me from falling.

146
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,209
-What does he do for a living?
-How should I know?

147
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,838
Wait. I do know.

148
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,090
Well…

149
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,718
Something about dolphins…

150
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,220
I don't know.
He said he's a dolphin's dad.

151
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,430
A dolphin's dad?

152
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,556
Yeah.

153
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,724
What does that mean?

154
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,648
Ha-yul might feign ignorance,
but she remembers everything.

155
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,775
Don't you remember?

156
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,652
I think you were ten.

157
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,280
Dad once invited his old classmate
over to our house.

158
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,784
You started crying as soon as you saw her.

159
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,204
You kept asking who she was,
so she couldn't set foot in our house.

160
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,413
She had to leave.

161
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:31,501
I only did that because Dad
brought home a strange woman.

162
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,502
I was just a kid.

163
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,544
Exactly.

164
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,631
Ha-yul may seem mature,

165
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,758
but she's still just a kid.

166
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,842
Jeez.

167
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:41,886
Be careful.

168
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,726
I'm in no position to lecture others.

169
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:06,828
"A newborn dolphin
breathes for the first time above water.

170
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,831
The mother dolphin lifts the baby up."

171
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,794
Ha-yul.

172
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,171
Are you going to bed?

173
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,756
Yes, I am.

174
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,057
Then, I'm going to bed too.

175
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,769
Here you go.

176
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,387
Ha-yul.

177
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,731
Get me some hangover tonic.

178
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,902
Oh, God.

179
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,324
You're unbelievable!
Did you drink alone again last night?

180
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,077
Show some respect to your older sister.

181
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,328
Ha-yul.

182
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,413
I'm really nauseous.

183
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,333
Get me some hangover tonic.

184
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,835
God, what a drunk lunatic. Jeez!

185
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,963
I really might vomit.

186
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,011
I'm dying here.

187
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,555
You know what?

188
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,183
Seeing how Yong-pil and Sam-dal

189
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,937
got back together
as soon as they reunited,

190
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,565
they must've pined
for each other so much while apart.

191
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:05,696
I mean, Yong-pil hasn't dated anyone
since he broke up with Sam-dal, right?

192
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:12,078
So he never went on those blind dates
his father set up for him

193
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,871
because of Sam-dal.

194
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,457
Goodness, I feel so bad for him.

195
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,545
Gosh, that's enough. Ms. Ko
will give you an earful if she hears you.

196
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,504
She's right.

197
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,840
Ms. Ko said they weren't dating.

198
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,675
That's not true.

199
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:29,220
They went to the mainland together,
so it's a done deal.

200
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,056
It's not like they're going to
be friends again.

201
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,015
I went too.

202
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,186
To the mainland.

203
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,730
So the three of you went together?

204
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,483
-Yes.
-Jeez. I told you.

205
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,068
The three just went on a trip.

206
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,778
What…

207
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,822
Sang-do.

208
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,576
Why would you tag along with them?

209
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,162
You should've given them privacy.

210
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,289
You're unbelievable.

211
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,583
You're so dense.

212
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,545
Yong-pil hasn't been able
to get over Sam-dal.

213
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,297
You should've given them some space.

214
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,174
Don't you know anything about romance?

215
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,134
Why are you getting upset?

216
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,249
Mom, why were you zoning out?
You'll get into an accident.

217
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,959
Where are you going?

218
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:42,960
Me?

219
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,420
To give you this.

220
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,132
Forget it. I said I didn't want it.

221
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,431
Mom, I ate those top shells you gave me.

222
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,643
I added some cucumbers and onions
and ate them with rice too.

223
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,560
You did?

224
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:04,232
Of course. I know you caught them
just for me, so I ate them all.

225
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,862
What about your dad? Did he have some too?

226
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,409
I thought they were for me.

227
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,745
So I ate all of them myself.

228
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,956
All of them? I gave you so much.

229
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,624
Yes, every single one of them.

230
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,711
All right. Good.

231
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,092
Sam-dal is here.

232
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:34,637
She'll be here for a while,
so try not to run into her.

233
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,681
Don't tell my mom

234
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:41,060
that we went to Seoul together.

235
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:44,522
Mom.

236
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,818
Are you mad at me?

237
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,490
Did I do something wrong?

238
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,088
No.

239
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,300
You didn't do anything wrong.

240
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,305
All right, then.

241
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,892
I'll see you there.

242
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,254
Grandma! Grandpa!

243
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,172
Hey.

244
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,765
Speak of the devil. Yong-pil's here.

245
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,808
Hey.

246
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,602
-Hello!
-Hey!

247
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,896
You're all here before Ms. Ko today.

248
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,439
-Yes.
-Of course.

249
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,357
Hey.

250
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:11,817
Hey.

251
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,362
Did you guys fight or something?

252
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,822
Why was that greeting so awkward?

253
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,282
-We didn't fight.
-What's wrong?

254
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,201
We're too old to fight.

255
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,121
-Is that for Ms. Ko's buoy?
-Yes.

256
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,333
No one cares about her
more than you do. You're like her son.

257
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,586
What? Don't be her son, Yong-pil.

258
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,712
Be her son-in-law.

259
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,964
Jeez, there you go again.

260
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,801
-Ms. Ko is here!
-Goodness.

261
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:38,969
Hello, Ms. Ko!

262
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,054
Mom!

263
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,305
Ms. Ko!

264
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,099
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

265
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,023
What's gotten into Sang-do?

266
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,817
-What's with him?
-No idea.

267
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:07,540
My son has never carried my buoy,
but there he goes, carrying Ms. Ko's.

268
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,126
Sang-do is a true businessman now.

269
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,212
He knows exactly who he needs
to curry favor with.

270
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,715
You're right.

271
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:19,260
Ms. Ko might give him
a free octopus if he treats her well.

272
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,303
-And the Fisheries won't complain.
-Right.

273
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,986
Goodness, your buoy
is all covered in flowers again.

274
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,989
There's a reason
why Yong-pil is so persistent about this.

275
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:40,990
What?

276
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:45,286
He wants everything to come up roses
even when she's diving.

277
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,248
Cut the nonsense.

278
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,001
The area where we're diving today
is full of reefs,

279
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,586
so watch out for the current.

280
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,087
-Okay.
-Okay.

281
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,046
Let's go!

282
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,299
Okay, ladies.

283
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,551
Don't be greedy.

284
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,928
Only go as long
as your breath allows, okay?

285
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,013
You too, Mom!

286
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,515
Only go as long as your breath allows!

287
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,519
Good luck today, everyone!

288
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,229
Be safe!

289
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,567
-Be careful down there!
-Okay!

290
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,826
Hello, Director Han.

291
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,078
Gosh, your arm must be tired.

292
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,580
What are you doing there?

293
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,956
What? Were you watching me?

294
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,917
Mr. Han!

295
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,379
Hurry back here, you brat.

296
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,509
COAST OF SAMDAL-RI

297
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,426
What?

298
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,928
That little…

299
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,972
That knucklehead.

300
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,351
He doesn't want to go, so what can I do?

301
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,353
I've tried to persuade him for years now.

302
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,773
Come on. Try harder, will you?

303
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:59,193
By the way, why are you suddenly
interested in sending him to HQ?

304
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,320
You've always stayed out
of your son's affairs.

305
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,321
What?

306
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,200
You said HQ kept offering him a post.

307
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,453
As a government employee,
he should follow orders.

308
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,788
I see.

309
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,706
I'll keep trying to persuade him.

310
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,085
Hey, Forecaster Kang.

311
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,087
Bring me Yong-pil's appointment notice.

312
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:19,880
Again?

313
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,091
You should give up. He doesn't want to go.

314
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,051
He seems to love it here in Jeju.

315
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,594
Don't make me laugh.

316
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,722
When he first joined,
his goal was to go to Geneva, Switzerland.

317
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,643
The World Meteorological Organization?

318
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:33,602
That place…

319
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,690
only accepts one employee
from each country.

320
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,441
He had high aspirations.

321
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,153
Then, why doesn't he want to join HQ now?

322
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,489
Beats me. How should I know?

323
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:10,681
What's that?

324
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:23,068
To Cho Sam-dal,
who yearns to find herself.

325
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,070
A gift from her ex-boyfriend.

326
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,334
Hey, Sang-do!

327
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,172
Where are you headed?

328
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,882
-Do you want another bottle?
-What?

329
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,051
-You didn't waste a single drop.
-Right.

330
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,012
-Where are you headed?
-Well…

331
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,347
I was taking a walk.

332
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,640
-A walk?
-Yeah.

333
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,434
Then, I saw a young lady
chugging an entire bottle.

334
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,518
So I had to stop.

335
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,354
What? "Young lady"?

336
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,856
Let me join you on the walk.

337
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,026
I'm still sobering up, and I wanted
to walk to get some fresh air.

338
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,612
-I just need to change. Wait just a bit.
-Okay.

339
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,113
Hey, close the window!

340
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,865
Right. I'll be back soon.

341
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,062
Hey, let's go. Here.

342
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,482
It's just a walk around the neighborhood.
Why the water bottle?

343
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,317
We'll get thirsty later.

344
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,361
Let's go.

345
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,700
You've been showing up
near my house often.

346
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,159
What?

347
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,454
You were here when your dashcam
recorded that reporter last time.

348
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,081
Right.

349
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,916
-The street's wider--
-Let's go this way.

350
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,000
Sure.

351
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,879
Let's go past that tree
and walk along the sea.

352
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,799
Then, we can go around Namdal-ri
on our way back. Okay?

353
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,300
Sure.

354
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,721
It's just a walk though.
Why do you have it all planned out?

355
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,347
We can go wherever the road takes us.

356
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,600
You still have to decide on the route.

357
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,603
We might take the wrong route
while walking and talking.

358
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,772
Come on. We won't get lost here.

359
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,400
You're totally a mainland person now.

360
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,653
Hey, this has nothing to do with that.

361
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:30,654
Jeez.

362
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,365
You know what?

363
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,535
I'm fascinated by mainland tourists
who visit our restaurant.

364
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:41,123
They wait in line for two hours
but don't eat the food right away.

365
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,833
They take tons of photos first.

366
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,336
Then, they meticulously plan out
their schedules while eating.

367
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,591
I wonder if they even
really appreciate the food.

368
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:54,219
I feel bad that they might not
fully enjoy their trip.

369
00:25:55,763 --> 00:26:00,934
They're just planning,
because time is precious to them.

370
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:04,354
You don't have to pity them for that.

371
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:08,734
It just means that they're trying
to spend their time wisely. Jeez.

372
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,694
What? Do you do that too?

373
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,031
Yes, I do. I'm all about planning.

374
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:17,284
So I'm saying you should let relax a bit.

375
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,495
You're not here on a trip.

376
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,663
Relax and go wherever your feet take you.

377
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,541
Eat what you want. Wear what you want.

378
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:28,128
You blended right in
with the other hikers yesterday.

379
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,631
-I thought you were an expert.
-Come on.

380
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,342
This is your hometown.

381
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,887
No one cares if you
do things halfway or wear whatever.

382
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,474
It's hard for me to do things halfway.

383
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:42,893
That's not true.

384
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,896
The Cho Sam-dal I know
used to be called "Halfway Cho."

385
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,606
Stop annoying me.

386
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,441
-What do you know?
-All right.

387
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,859
You're so ridiculous.

388
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,402
But it's true.

389
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,392
What's the matter?

390
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,980
PERSONNEL APPOINTMENT PROPOSAL

391
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:14,151
Jeez, stop doing this. I'm not going.

392
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,153
I'd given up on you too,

393
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,115
but your father asked me to persuade you.

394
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,033
My dad?

395
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,410
Deep down, I know you want to go.

396
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,914
I'm near retirement, and even I'd want
to go and do real work too.

397
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:30,208
You're so passionate about your job,
so not going makes no sense.

398
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,712
I heard you've been analyzing
the weather in Korea and around the world.

399
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,088
That's just…

400
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:38,008
I just do that when I'm bored.
It's a hobby…

401
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,384
Hobby, my foot.

402
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,512
Yong-pil, don't just turn it down.

403
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:46,141
You should think about in various ways
and look at the big picture.

404
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:51,021
Think about all the opportunities
for analysis you'll have at HQ.

405
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:54,191
You've always wanted
to go to Geneva, Switzerland.

406
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,259
Are you okay?

407
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:24,805
What were you so distracted by
to end up near these reefs?

408
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,213
You seem more relaxed
after returning from Seoul.

409
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,466
And you're not fixated
on telling people "I didn't fail!"

410
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,593
Don't tease me.

411
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,221
I'm not relaxed.

412
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,475
Finding myself and inner peace
isn't easy to do.

413
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,854
I start to think about focusing
on just finding myself.

414
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,441
But suddenly, I feel my anger rising.
And then, it goes away.

415
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:21,028
Everything feels so unfair, so I feel
like going back and make a scene.

416
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,404
Then, I calm myself down.

417
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,656
It's an emotional rollercoaster each day.

418
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,492
I'm relieved.

419
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,454
Why? Because of how differently I act?

420
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,371
Yes.

421
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,874
That just means you have healthy emotions.

422
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,335
If you gave up on everything
and said you forgave everyone,

423
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,129
I would've taken you to a shrink.

424
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,509
What's gotten into you?

425
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:49,681
You're so good at this.
You're on a roll today!

426
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,266
Good at what?

427
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,809
Comforting me.

428
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,061
Come on.

429
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,023
I used to take care of you
when we were kids.

430
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,860
When did you grow up
and learn how to comfort me so well?

431
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,570
Don't tease me.

432
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,740
Hey, they must be done diving.
Let's go. Come on.

433
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,373
Goodness. Are you okay, Ms. Ko?

434
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,376
I'm fine. Don't overreact.

435
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,211
You even hurt your hand.

436
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:24,424
You've always been cautious,
so why were you so distracted today?

437
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,176
Sam-dal!

438
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,053
Hello, ma'am!

439
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,139
You better stop
giving your mother trouble.

440
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,850
They say even monkeys
fall from trees sometimes.

441
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,602
Your mom almost had a big accident.

442
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,686
What?

443
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,064
Did you hurt yourself, Mom?

444
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,650
How did this happen? Oh, no!

445
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,651
I'm fine.

446
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:46,321
-Oh, no!
-Eun-u's mom raced in to save her.

447
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,781
Thank you, ma'am.

448
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,992
I know it's hard to believe,
but she's agile underwater.

449
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,747
What was that? Were you teasing me?

450
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,333
Cut it out. Let's go.

451
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,169
Let me carry this, Mom.

452
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,716
-Move.
-Okay.

453
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,094
It's very heavy.

454
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,305
Mom, I can…

455
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,558
-We'll get going.
-Bye.

456
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,642
Mom…

457
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,528
Hold on tight,

458
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,363
or you'll fall off.

459
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,281
Okay.

460
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,870
Mom, do you enjoy diving?

461
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,581
No one enjoys working.

462
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,166
We do it to make ends meet.

463
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,336
Then, don't work.
I said I'd send you money.

464
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,630
Goodness.

465
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:46,965
No, thanks.

466
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,134
Why would I take money from my kids?

467
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:54,931
I'm going to earn my own money
until the day I die.

468
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,184
Jeez.

469
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,565
I haven't done anything
to deserve your money.

470
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,070
Jeez.

471
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,531
What do you mean?
You've done a lot for me.

472
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,961
Going fast on the bike was refreshing.

473
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,506
What?

474
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,758
What's wrong?

475
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,012
Are you in pain? Are you okay?

476
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,222
Does your chest hurt?

477
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,141
It's the coffee.

478
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,520
I had a cup in the afternoon,

479
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,064
and it's making my heart race.

480
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,609
You had instant coffee, didn't you?

481
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,071
I told you to have
only one cup a day. Jeez.

482
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,823
Don't touch that.
Just go inside. It smells.

483
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,244
-It's okay. Your hand is--
-Don't fuss over me.

484
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:59,037
Go on, now.

485
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,455
I need to dry my buoy too.

486
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,540
Really?

487
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,376
All right, then.

488
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,559
I think you need another tub…

489
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,439
Where is she going?

490
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,496
Once the theme park is built here,

491
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,333
this neighborhood will be prosperous.

492
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,711
Sir, this is the rest area
for the Namdal-ri haenyeos

493
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,546
before they go diving.

494
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:37,385
This area is shallow,
so we can build a children's pool here.

495
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,262
It'll be a perfectly safe depth.

496
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,430
-All right, then.
-Okay.

497
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,140
-Should we go over there?
-Sure.

498
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,475
Watch your step.

499
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,601
Look--

500
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,144
-This way, please.
-Let's go.

501
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,358
So the theme park…

502
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:56,780
So…

503
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:58,782
Yes, sir?

504
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:01,201
What is it, sir?

505
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,119
Hurry and say what's on your mind, sir.

506
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:06,664
Well…

507
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,709
So you'd been in touch
with her all this time?

508
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,046
And you didn't tell me?

509
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,590
Did she ask you not to?

510
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,258
I don't know.

511
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,387
Come on, now.

512
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,807
Why is she in Jeju?
Is she working at the airport here?

513
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:26,851
Once again, I don't know, sir.

514
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:29,854
Come on.

515
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,107
Why are you playing dumb?

516
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,026
What did you guys talk about?

517
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,945
Sir,

518
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,824
she asked me to keep you out of her sight.

519
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,951
What? Me?

520
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:43,952
Yes.

521
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,453
Well…

522
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,081
I see. Is that right?

523
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,796
The ice cream is going to melt.

524
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,756
Let's go home already.

525
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,301
Your grandpa's watermelon ice cream
is turning into juice.

526
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,511
Did you hear me?

527
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,224
Darn it. I don't see them today either.

528
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,018
Are you coming down?

529
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:11,438
Be careful.

530
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,567
Why dolphins all of a sudden?
You were never interested.

531
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,651
No reason.

532
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,947
We're in Jeju,
so it's nice to appreciate them.

533
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,703
Yes, we are in Jeju.

534
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,121
Wait up.

535
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,459
AS THEME PARK CREATES 10,000 JOBS

536
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,877
Ten thousand jobs.

537
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:39,591
Then, all the villagers could make
a living working at this theme park.

538
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,594
No wonder they were so cooperative, right?

539
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,138
By the way,

540
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,683
why did you insist
on driving past Samdal-ri?

541
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,935
So that she'd notice?

542
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:55,690
I want to see what's around the theme park
and the nearby villages, okay?

543
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,068
It's our job to look around.

544
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,489
Isn't it your job too?

545
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:03,907
Is it only my job?

546
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,291
This place is nice too.

547
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:18,254
I'm happy every time I see you

548
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,595
Where are you going, Ha-yul?

549
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,392
Hi, we meet again.

550
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,853
Darn it.

551
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:35,688
Did you see it?

552
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:36,773
See what?

553
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:40,860
The dolphins?

554
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:46,366
Did you see Namchun
lifting Oryong up for his first breath?

555
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:48,618
What?

556
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:55,667
Of course. I even saw
Namchun give birth to Oryong.

557
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,255
You did your homework, kid.

558
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,259
Hello.

559
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,389
What's going on?
Why are you standing there?

560
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,182
Who is he?

561
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,560
Stop, Secretary Ko. Stop.

562
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:14,519
Stop!

563
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,645
It's Ha-yul, right?

564
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,106
If you want to learn more about dolphins,

565
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,358
come visit our dolphin center
with your aunt.

566
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,027
I'm not her aunt, I'm her--

567
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,822
Mom!

568
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,616
"Mom"?

569
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:30,910
What?

570
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,630
TAMRA LINER

571
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,515
JEJU HOSPITAL
REGULAR CHECKUP 3:00 P.M.

572
00:39:56,436 --> 00:40:00,732
FOODS GOOD FOR THE HEART

573
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:10,366
Goodness.

574
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,620
-Dad.
-Yes?

575
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:14,704
Are you sick?

576
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,582
Of course not. I'm perfectly fine.

577
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:22,003
Then, why would you get
regular checkups at a hospital?

578
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,129
What?

579
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,547
That's…

580
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,342
Why are you looking at that?

581
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:32,055
I'm taking care of Mal-suk,
the old lady next door.

582
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,308
I make her doctor's appointments for her.

583
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,685
Dad…

584
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:41,773
What's wrong?

585
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:44,859
Are you in pain?

586
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:45,943
It's the coffee.

587
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,322
I had a cup in the afternoon,

588
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,824
and it's making my heart race.

589
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,791
THE PRIDE OF SAMDAL-RI!
CHO YONG-PIL'S HERE!

590
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,806
CAPTURING JEJU'S WEATHER
PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION

591
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:47,839
My goodness!

592
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,050
Excuse me, Ms. Sam-dal.

593
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:54,262
Is peeking into my room your hobby?

594
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,223
Why were you in the van?

595
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,726
Because I just got back from work.

596
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:01,436
I see. Right.

597
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,897
But why were you sitting in the van
instead of going inside?

598
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,650
I was folding a paper airplane.

599
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,570
I was making this in the van,

600
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,740
but since you came outside,
it won't get to fly.

601
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,116
And it'll just land on you.

602
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:23,458
I told you I'm not going to enter,
so stop wasting paper. Take it back.

603
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,086
A waste? I have tons of flyers.
I'm going to fold all of them into planes.

604
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,464
So just make up your mind.

605
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,136
Do you have nothing better to do?

606
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,596
No, nothing at all.

607
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:40,767
Look…

608
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:43,436
Forget about the contest.

609
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,353
I…

610
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,647
I have something to ask you.

611
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,733
Are you free right now?

612
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,362
What is it?

613
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,324
Do you know if something
is wrong with my mom?

614
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,201
What do you mean?

615
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,121
I mean, you know
practically everything about her.

616
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:05,333
My sisters and I
have been away for so long.

617
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:08,211
Do you really not know anything?

618
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,839
Has she been sick
and going to the hospital?

619
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,674
Or has she been looking ill?

620
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:17,220
I think something's up,

621
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,597
but my dad is being tight-lipped too.

622
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:24,727
I'm not sure.

623
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,648
What? You don't know either?

624
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,150
Maybe I'm wrong.

625
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,361
If you think something's up,

626
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,908
then you could be right
since you know her best.

627
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,871
Just take her to the hospital
if you're that worried.

628
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,498
Given how stubborn she is,

629
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,750
it might be difficult to do though.

630
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:54,257
Hey!

631
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,093
What are you two doing there?

632
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,577
Hey. What are you doing?

633
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,663
Are you planning to follow me inside?

634
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:29,667
My parents are going to grab
a harpoon the moment they see you.

635
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,128
A harpoon?

636
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,214
Well, you don't want to know.

637
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,308
So if the child

638
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,477
is about this tall,
she must be around four?

639
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,356
That means you had her four years ago.

640
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:53,441
She's not your kid.

641
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:58,613
And what kind
of four-year-old is this tall?

642
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,326
She's nine.

643
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,410
Nine…

644
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,537
Nine?

645
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,539
Then…

646
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,417
Nine years ago would've been--

647
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,668
She's my niece!

648
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:14,170
Okay?

649
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,382
Grab the hijiki from outside.

650
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:32,772
Goodness, people probably think
this family is full of alcoholics.

651
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,113
Your niece. I see.

652
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,282
So she's your niece.

653
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,955
It makes sense now. Yes.

654
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,961
-Look, Jeon Dae-yeong.
-Yes?

655
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:58,172
I guess you didn't get
what I said last time.

656
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:02,551
Go focus on reviving your company
instead of wasting your time here.

657
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,096
Instead of being here with me…

658
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,976
What's wrong with you?

659
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,352
I was just…

660
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:16,148
happy to see you.

661
00:46:17,066 --> 00:46:18,818
I kept feeling happy,

662
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,779
so it made me want to see you again.

663
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:28,619
And even if I work hard
on the company's problems,

664
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:31,706
you know they won't be solved.

665
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:32,790
Yeah.

666
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:35,501
I'm fine with it.

667
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,715
I'm the one

668
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,509
who caused those problems.

669
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,304
It's not your fault--

670
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,599
Father…

671
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,309
Who…

672
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:55,896
Who is that?

673
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,398
Damn it.

674
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,239
Just go. Get lost. Right now.

675
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,200
Dad.

676
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:09,910
Where are you going?

677
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:12,163
-I was sorting the trash.
-I see.

678
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,664
-Who was that?
-Directions.

679
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,250
Someone who asked for directions.

680
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,961
Just keep going straight on that road!

681
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,881
I'll take it. Let me throw it out.

682
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,176
But if he goes straight,
that's a dead end.

683
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,594
Go back inside, Dad.

684
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,824
I didn't know when I was little,
but this is a great spot.

685
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,411
Didn't you see this
when you came here last time?

686
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:54,080
I did?

687
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,499
She was in no condition
to look around then.

688
00:47:56,582 --> 00:48:00,836
She was drunk and bawling. Gosh.

689
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,046
What?

690
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:04,924
What is it?

691
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,300
-What?
-You little…

692
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,094
What are you going to do?

693
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,596
Hey, by the way,

694
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,641
it's been ages since all five of us
were together like this.

695
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,018
I thought this moment would never come.

696
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:18,562
This is nice.

697
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,065
Enjoy it all you want.

698
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,025
Hey,

699
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,027
you two.

700
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,113
What's going on?

701
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,073
-What?
-What?

702
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,366
It's so late at night.

703
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:35,371
-So what?
-Why were you two out here alone?

704
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,290
What is it this time? What is it?

705
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,959
Are you two back together--

706
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,752
Gyeong-tae, have a drink!

707
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,006
What about you guys?

708
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,175
What were you three doing here so late?

709
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,218
We're friends.

710
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,137
So are they!

711
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:05,860
If they're not friends,
then what else would they be?

712
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,445
Right?

713
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:09,488
Right.

714
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,615
You're right.

715
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,702
My dear friend Gyeong-tae,
who's awfully kind but clueless.

716
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,997
"Yes, we reminisced
about the beautiful time we shared

717
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,291
as we walked together late at night."

718
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,334
Is this the answer you wanted to hear?

719
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,544
What?

720
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,254
What "beautiful time"?

721
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,172
Jeez.

722
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:28,757
Everyone here knows about our past.

723
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,552
They're not quiet about it
because they don't know.

724
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,512
They're just being considerate, okay?

725
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,264
Being considerate! Okay?

726
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,809
But of course,
I understand that must be hard

727
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,937
for someone like you
who's been single all his life.

728
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,357
That's why, right?
Because you didn't know?

729
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:48,152
-I--
-Of course. How would he know?

730
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:51,614
Jeez. I knew she'd get you.
You're no match for Sam-dal.

731
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,781
What did I do?

732
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:54,950
You said something was fishy too.

733
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,702
-When did I say that?
-You did.

734
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:58,954
What is this?
735

735
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,100
What?

736
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,377
Isn't that the exhibition
our work is holding?

737
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:07,087
Are you entering?

738
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,173
Hey, this isn't bad.

739
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,174
Give it a try.

740
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,759
How did you know about this?

741
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,720
Only a handful of people
know about this exhibition.

742
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:18,015
What are you talking about?
I told her about it.

743
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,393
Hey, I'm a trend-setting
fashion photographer.

744
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,145
I don't do landscape photography.

745
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,647
You used to do it often.

746
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,982
I have a lot of your photos.

747
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:28,984
What?

748
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:42,706
Are you sure I took these?
They're all out of focus.

749
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:44,833
Yeah, they're yours.

750
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,046
SPRING AT DODUBONG PEAK

751
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:49,964
Spring?

752
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,341
Was this really during spring?

753
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:55,344
Wow, I've never seen Dodubong Peak
look so dreary before.

754
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,303
Darn it.

755
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:00,683
Hey, why do you have my work?

756
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,892
Your work?

757
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:05,104
They're no different
from the photos that I take.

758
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,939
Cho Eun-hye would be ashamed of this.

759
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,108
That little…

760
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,904
Let's see.
I have more embarrassing things here.

761
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,034
You're going to let them make fun of you
for these embarrassing photos?

762
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,869
That darn Gyeong-tae…

763
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:24,498
Even I don't have these photos.
Is he some obsessed fan or what?

764
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,378
By the way, isn't it better to take photos
than go on the Jeju Olle Trail?

765
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,462
You…

766
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,007
One thing about me is

767
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,801
once I say no, it'll always be a no.

768
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,177
-Bye.
-Okay.

769
00:51:37,261 --> 00:51:38,137
Bye.

770
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,434
If you change your mind,
be outside by 7:00 a.m.

771
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:47,313
-I'll go with you to submit your form.
-I said forget it.

772
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:50,733
Seriously, at 7:00 a.m.!

773
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,235
I'll wait five minutes.

774
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,656
They're all out of focus.

775
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,951
These are ridiculous.

776
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,541
Damn it.

777
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:32,483
CAPTURING JEJU'S WEATHER
PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION

778
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,386
APPLY

779
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:03,972
ONLINE APPLICATION ENDED

780
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,849
He recommended what's already over?

781
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:12,356
ON-SITE APPLICATIONS OPEN UNTIL MAY

782
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:17,611
There's a type of rain exclusive to Jeju
that falls as if it's jealous of spring.

783
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:20,447
The bracken rain has begun.

784
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:25,744
Due to the drizzling rain and dark clouds
hanging over their heads,

785
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:28,831
many people feel depressed
around this time of year.

786
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:34,211
Some people also get lost
in the mountains while picking bracken.

787
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:38,924
The bracken rain is here once again,
and we hope you all remain safe.

788
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:20,466
Once a no, always a no, right?

789
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,217
But look who's here.

790
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:24,678
What? You're the one who told me to enter.

791
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:52,956
Honey.

792
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,459
Are you going diving today?

793
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,961
The weather isn't that great.

794
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:03,300
We agreed not to, but I'm going
to check how things are just in case.

795
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,178
Don't overdo it.

796
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,638
You know…

797
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:12,309
You know your doctor's appointment
is tomorrow, right?

798
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,396
You should ask them
to change your medicine this time.

799
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,483
You've been out of breath a lot lately.

800
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:21,944
All right.

801
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,195
I'll see you later.

802
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,907
Breakfast's on the table! Get up and eat!

803
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,035
Gosh.

804
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:50,764
Thank you.

805
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,271
Here's the application form.

806
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,231
Fill it in and submit it.

807
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,567
And submit your work before the deadline.

808
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,235
Okay.

809
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:07,698
What?

810
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:17,541
You better not have
a change of heart and back out.

811
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,626
-Okay, I won't.
-Okay.

812
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:23,547
Aren't you leaving?

813
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,300
What? Yeah, I'm leaving.

814
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:31,013
And since Jeju's weather
is so unpredictable, I think--

815
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,431
Just go.

816
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,266
-Go?
-Just go. Now.

817
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,642
You want me to leave?

818
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:36,893
-Should I go?
-Yes.

819
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:37,978
Good luck.

820
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,953
What are you smiling about?

821
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:56,955
Has the gloomy weather
messed with your head?

822
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,124
Hurry up and go so I can work.

823
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,417
All right.

824
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:06,923
Damn it.

825
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,301
Gyeong-tae.

826
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,218
Yeah?

827
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,387
Did your mom go to work today?

828
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:14,306
I don't know. I slept at our hideout.

829
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:18,769
I doubt she did though. Ms. Ko told them
not to because of the wind.

830
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,062
Really?

831
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:23,315
Ms. Ko's instincts are far better
than any supercomputer.

832
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,775
She knows what's best.

833
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:26,652
Have a good day.

834
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,445
MS. KO MI-JA

835
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,122
-Baek-ho.
-Yes?

836
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:41,792
Can you put up
the eastern coastal wave buoy data?

837
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,043
Sure.

838
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:52,928
COASTAL WAVE BUOY - 1610038
TIME, WAVE HEIGHT

839
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,331
There's no wind, Ms. Ko.

840
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:23,333
And the current seems to be okay.

841
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:26,461
Then, I think we can go in.

842
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:28,922
Pack it in.

843
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,217
The weather's a bit strange.

844
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:34,261
Let's just rest today.

845
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,989
WHY DID YOU BECOME A WEATHER FORECASTER?

846
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:00,662
I became a forecaster
to protect my loved ones.

847
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:08,420
Sam-dal?

848
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:11,923
Hey, Eun-u.

849
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,800
What are you doing here?

850
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,845
Aren't you in the Observation Division?

851
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,514
I just planted a tree
for weather prediction.

852
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:20,974
I see.

853
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:25,604
You made the right decision!
I want to see you keep taking photos.

854
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,483
Let me give you a tour
of the Forecasting Division.

855
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,026
No, it's okay.

856
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,403
Are civilians allowed to tour around here?

857
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,280
Come on. You won't be alone.

858
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,157
I'll be with you, okay?

859
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,617
Follow me.

860
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,951
You're right.

861
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:41,787
Look at your authority!

862
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:42,788
This is who I am.

863
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,373
Let me see data from the west too.

864
00:59:45,457 --> 00:59:46,416
Sure.

865
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,837
Yong-pil, why do you keep checking
the east and west?

866
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:53,090
Because the wind waves keep changing.

867
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:55,383
I kept telling you something was off.

868
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,569
-Buoy data from the far east too.
-All right.

869
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:26,581
The east is going to face
some seriously bad weather.

870
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,291
Prepare a weather advisory now.

871
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,334
Yes, sir.

872
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,794
You little punk.

873
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,588
You're good.

874
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:40,470
COAST OF SAMDAL-RI

875
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,822
-Go to shore!
-Go to shore!

876
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,031
-Go to shore!
-Go to shore!

877
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:01,074
Go to shore!

878
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,617
-Go to shore!
-Go to shore!

879
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:03,702
Go to shore!

880
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:04,995
Go to shore!

881
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,332
Ms. Ko!

882
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:54,961
-Where did Ms. Ko go?
-Ms. Ko!

883
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,421
-Ms. Ko!
-Ms. Ko!

884
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,881
-Ms. Ko!
-Ms. Ko!

885
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:00,175
-Ms. Ko!
-Ms. Ko!

886
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,761
-Ms. Ko!
-Ms. Ko!

887
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:03,720
Ms. Ko!

888
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,222
Ms. Ko!

889
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:10,477
Hello, this is Jeju Meteorological Center.

890
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,480
It's a request for the coast guard!

891
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,899
A Samdal-ri haenyeo
went missing while diving.

892
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,400
-They're searching for her.
-What?

893
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:19,235
Okay.

894
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:27,327
What?

895
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:30,830
What…

896
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:34,834
Eun-u, isn't that our town?

897
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,506
No… Mom.

898
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,716
Sir, Mom is missing.

899
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:46,888
Put up the coastal long wave monitoring
and buoy data!

900
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:47,973
Yes, sir!

901
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,603
Hello, this is Forecaster Cho Yong-pil.

902
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,522
I checked where she went missing.

903
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,190
There's a strong southeastern wind

904
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,567
and high waves of 1 to 3 meters.

905
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:04,864
Please do a thorough search
both underwater and on the surface

906
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:07,158
of the 600-square-meter area
from her last location.

907
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:08,827
And a floral pattern.

908
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:09,953
Yes.

909
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,080
The missing haenyeo's buoy

910
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,582
has flowers on it.

911
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,380
No, I'm not sure about that.

912
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,342
Please start the search
of that area as fast as you can.

913
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,345
-And her heart--
-Yong-pil.

914
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:32,267
Are you talking about my mom?

915
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,104
Is it my mom?

916
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,355
The missing haenyeo…

917
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:41,151
suffers from a heart condition.

918
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:45,947
Please check her pulse
and heart rate as soon as you find her.

919
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,658
Check her heart first, please.

920
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:53,788
Sam-dal.

921
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:56,458
Go to your mom right now.

922
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:58,918
Eun-u.

923
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,211
-Yeah?
-Hurry.

924
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:01,880
-Take her to her mom.
-Okay.

925
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,673
-Sam-dal, let's go.
-Okay.

926
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,592
All right.

927
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:06,843
Okay.

928
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,354
-Baek-ho.
-Yes?

929
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:21,274
Put up all data from floating
and coastal wave buoys out at sea.

930
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:22,609
All right.

931
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:30,700
The probability of Mom
drifting out to sea…

932
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:36,372
The probability of her
drifting out to sea…

933
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,418
The probability of her
drifting out to sea…

934
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:18,998
I'm so thirsty.

935
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:20,333
Get me some water.

936
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:22,669
Damn it.

937
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:26,089
-Hey.
-Jin-dal!

938
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,382
Is someone calling me?

939
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:30,343
-Jin-dal!
-I think so.

940
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,596
What am I going to do?

941
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,057
Jin-dal! My goodness!

942
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:38,685
Goodness, Jin-dal!

943
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,479
Jin-dal!

944
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:42,397
Your mom…

945
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,314
Your mom…

946
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:47,610
My goodness, your mom!

947
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,197
Hurry!

948
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,629
Ms. Ko!

949
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:11,384
No…

950
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:29,527
-They're over there!
-Okay!

951
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:35,617
Honey!

952
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,118
What in the world happened?

953
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:38,036
Are you okay?

954
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:39,954
What about Ms. Ko?

955
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:48,838
Ms. Ko!

956
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:05,521
Hurry up!

957
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:06,564
-Hey!
-Hurry up!

958
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:08,608
-Hurry up!
-Hurry up!

959
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,193
-Hey.
-Hurry up!

960
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,694
Mom!

961
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:13,321
-Mom!
-Mom!

962
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,532
Mom!

963
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:33,716
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

964
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:40,932
Yong-pil!

965
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,309
Cho Yong-pil!

966
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,312
Yong-pil!

967
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:49,065
The uninvited guest visits
every April without fail.

968
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:50,942
The bracken rain.

969
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:52,819
Mom!

970
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:56,823
Mom!

971
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:01,744
Mom!

972
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:04,122
-No, don't!
-Mom!

973
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,165
Cho Yong-pil!

974
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:10,545
No!

975
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,213
Cho Yong-pil!

976
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,301
Don't go in there!

977
01:08:16,384 --> 01:08:17,302
Yong-pil!

978
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:21,723
Oh, my god!

979
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,224
No!

980
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,982
Mi-ja!

981
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:17,487
Mi-ja…

982
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:21,741
Mi-ja…

983
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,801
Mom!

984
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:41,469
Mom…

985
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:47,225
You can't die, Mi-ja!

986
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,685
No…

987
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,155
Mom!

988
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:05,159
Mom…

989
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:13,960
Mi-ja…

990
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:16,504
Mi-ja…

991
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:58,671
What if that sea takes away
my grandmother?

992
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:01,799
Sam-dal, Mom will be fine.
Nothing will happen.

993
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:04,093
Did the sea take someone away again?

994
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:06,012
I am also cramming in everything here.

995
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,389
I'm holding it in.
It pops out a dozen times a day.

996
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,600
You should hate her too.

997
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,935
Your mom.
Why did your mom die?

998
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:14,896
Aren't you scared of the sea?

999
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,439
How can it not be scary?

1000
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:19,317
The sea is the scariest thing
in the world for me.

1001
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:22,987
It took away my old friend as well.

1002
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,989
Hey! Ko Mi-ja!

1003
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,783
I'm very scared of it.

1004
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:32,747
