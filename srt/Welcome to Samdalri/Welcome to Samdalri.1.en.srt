WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,340
Korea…

3
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,510
-Sings!
-Sings!

4
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:55,430
KOREA SINGS

00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:05,065

00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:14,283
THE PRIDE OF SAMDAL-RI!
CHO YONG-PIL IS HERE!

7
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,664
KOREA SINGS
JEJU ISLAND

8
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,335
To all our viewers across the country,

9
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,963
to the residents of Jeju
who are here today,

10
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,841
and to the tourists
who have come to visit,

11
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,426
thank you very much.

12
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,178
I'm Sunday's Man, Song Hae,

13
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:38,056
greeting you from Jeju,
the island gift from nature.

14
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,475
Hello, everyone!

15
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,645
-Hello!
-Hello!

16
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,735
I've been to Seoul
Daejeon, Daegu, and Busan

17
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,280
I've been to Seoul
Daejeon, Daegu, and Busan

18
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,451
Where is my love?
Is he in Seoul?

19
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,994
Is he in Daejeon?

20
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,663
CHO SAM-DAL, CHO YONG-PIL,
9 YEARS OLD IN 1994

21
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,875
Or is he in Busan?

22
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:09,671
After he left me alone
Where did he go?

23
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,798
-Are you still nervous?
-Yeah.

24
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,091
Why?

25
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,593
Why do you think?

26
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,428
Because there's a ton of people.

27
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,598
Right, but why are you the nervous one?

28
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:24,770
The next contestant is known
as "The pride of Jeju."

29
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,271
Please welcome Cho Yong-pil!

30
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,150
THE PRIDE OF SAMDAL-RI!
CHO YONG-PIL IS HERE!

31
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,154
Let's go.

32
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,788
Oh, dear. I believe
there's only one contestant.

33
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:44,873
Which one of you is it?

34
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,251
The pride of Jeju!

35
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,253
Samdal-ri's Cho Yong-pil is here!

36
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,422
I'm Cho Yong-pil, and I'm nine. Hello!

37
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,094
So he's Cho Yong-pil.

38
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,472
Then who are you, young lady?

39
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,557
Me?

40
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,726
I'm his manager.

41
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,022
She's Cho Sam-dal. She came
on stage with me in case I became nervous.

42
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,486
Goodness. I've never seen a manager
come on stage for moral support

43
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,364
and end up looking
more nervous than the singer.

44
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,246
So what do the Samdal-ri natives,

45
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,832
Ms. Cho Sam-dal and Mr. Cho Yong-pil,

46
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,458
want to become when they grow up?

47
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,753
-Me?
-Yes.

48
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,006
I'm going to become a dragon
that rises from a small stream.

49
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,136
A dragon?

50
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,931
Yes. I heard dragons rise
from small streams.

51
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,184
I'll go to the mainland
to find a magic pearl when I grow up.

52
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,940
-That's impressive!
-So let's summarize.

53
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,818
Jeju is the small stream,

54
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,029
and your dream is to go to Seoul
and find success when you grow up?

55
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,364
Yes.

56
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:08,123
All right. Then, what does Yong-pil
want to become when he grows up?

57
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,625
A dragon that rises from a small stream?

58
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,336
No.

59
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,714
I like the small stream.

60
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,299
Can't I just live here?

61
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,513
All right, then.

62
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,142
Please give them a round of applause
for the song they'll perform.

63
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,727
Let's hear it!

64
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:40,363
There was a girl who once gave me
A bouquet of flowers

65
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:49,372
I wonder why I miss her so much today

66
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:59,341
Her short hair was neatly combed
Like grass wet from the rain

67
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,764
Back when we still had
that silliness of children,

68
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:11,728
the girl dreamed of soaring out
from her small stream to become a dragon.

69
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,108
The boy dreamed of becoming
the girl's small stream.

70
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,612
I think of that day

71
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:26,284
When I start missing that day

72
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,704
I wander through my dreams…

73
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,877
But when that silliness disappears

74
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:18,878
from the boy and girl,

75
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,881
will they realize it?

76
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,846
Perhaps a dream is most beautiful

77
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,349
when it remains a dream.

78
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,816
EPISODE 1
TEARS OF THE DRAGON

79
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,929
You didn't have
the spicy braised crabs there?

80
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,765
-Are they good?
-You seriously didn't?

81
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,602
They're served with radish water kimchi.
I love it so much.

82
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,938
First, take a bite of the braised crab.

83
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,940
Then, order a bowl of rice,

84
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,444
put some sauce,
dried seaweed flakes, and sesame oil.

85
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,572
Then, mix everything together.

86
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,616
Then, take a big bite--

87
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,544
Ms. Cho…

88
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:46,216
-What is this?
-You know. It's my mom's kohlrabi kimchi.

89
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,759
You love this too.

90
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,511
What in the world are you talking about?

91
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,013
I'm sorry, but could you excuse us?

92
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,307
-I need to speak with him.
-Sure.

93
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,642
Thank you.

94
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:02,899
It must be nice to have
so many things you love.

95
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,110
You love my mom's water kimchi.

96
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,861
You love spicy braised crabs.

97
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,155
Have you gone insane? What are you doing?

98
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,782
You love me…

99
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,910
and you love other girls.

100
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,330
Well…

101
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,834
-Ms. Cho--
-No.

102
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,461
I'd shut it.
Then you'll be known as a loser

103
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,880
who was dumped by his ex
and drenched with kimchi.

104
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,302
It's better than a being scumbag
who was caught cheating, right?

105
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,307
Eat up.

106
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,436
It's so ripe that it's gone bad.

107
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,567
Hello, long time no see.

108
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,609
Hello.

109
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:01,958
FIFTEEN HOURS AGO

110
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,587
I just finished.
Want to meet up for a second?

111
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,677
You finished early.

112
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:16,014
I told them I'd work overtime today
since you said you'd be late.

113
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,684
Okay. I'll just head home then.

114
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,772
Should I just leave too?

115
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,190
I'd probably get fired, right?

116
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,983
It can't be helped then.

117
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,152
I miss you.

118
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,321
CHEON CHUNG-GI

119
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,092
That little…

120
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:22,163
Should I beat the crap
out of that scumbag?

121
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,207
You're cheating on me?

122
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,876
How dare you?

123
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,714
You're dead meat, you asshole!

124
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,845
You dare to cheat on me?

125
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,222
Unbelievable!

126
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,058
I'm so dumbfounded right now.

127
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,603
You're dead meat, you bastard.

128
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,856
Those rotten little…

129
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,532
No.

130
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,242
I should just kill them.

131
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,411
I should kill Cheon Chung-gi…

132
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,513
-Hello--
-Cho Sam-dal!

133
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,639
My goodness!

134
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,100
Jeez.

135
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,060
I'm not deaf, you know?

136
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,855
Lower your voice.
Or just call me Cho Eun-hye.

137
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,191
Eun-hye, my foot.
Did you take Mom's kohlrabi kimchi?

138
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,402
-Yeah.
-It's gone bad.

139
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,571
I took it out to throw it away.

140
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,530
Did you eat it?

141
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,823
No, I threw it out.

142
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,491
Where?

143
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,703
Where do you think? The trash can.

144
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,874
Hey, Sam-dal. Hey!

145
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,253
Why did she take it
with her to throw it out?

146
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,005
And you're Cho Sam-dal.

147
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,215
You never officially changed your name.

148
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,597
Aunt Sam-dal
gave the kimchi to her boyfriend.

149
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,765
But it went bad.

150
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,769
I know.
She asked me how she could kill him,

151
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,480
so I told her to feed him that
since it had mold.

152
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,235
Mom.

153
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,367
Get up already.

154
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,913
-It's already noon.
-Give me ten more minutes.

155
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,957
What time did you come home last night?

156
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:30,792
Tell me the truth.

157
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,714
I'll get up. I'm done sleeping.

158
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,805
Answer my question!

159
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,099
Yesterday?

160
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:51,813
Last night, I came home at around 11…

161
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,523
It was 11:10 p.m.

162
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,400
I went to bed at 11:30 p.m.

163
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,319
I mean 11:45 p.m. That's when I came home.

164
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,198
I don't care if you drink or go clubbing

165
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,994
since you're still young,
but come home before midnight--

166
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,286
-Want a planet gummy?
-Yes.

167
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,751
-Mom!
-Cha Ha-yul, please.

168
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:17,088
All right. I promise
not to stay out overnight.

169
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,424
I'm nine, and you're 29.

170
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,677
We're under the curse of the nines,
so we need to be careful this year.

171
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,012
I told you already.

172
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,223
Yes, you did. We're both under
the curse of the nines.

173
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,600
I'll be careful,
so please stop glaring at me.

174
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,235
My niece sure is smart.

175
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,988
She's only nine
but knows about that superstition.

176
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,992
It's obvious where she learned it.
Likely from the Samdal-ri haenyeo leader.

177
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,619
Why would Mom
teach a kid something like that?

178
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,538
Right.

179
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,751
I think Cho Sam-dal
broke up with her boyfriend.

180
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,669
Again?

181
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,338
She must be destined
to just work until she dies.

182
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,591
She's never been in a decent relationship.

183
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,675
That's not true.

184
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,469
There was that one time.

185
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,137
-Jin-dal!
-Gosh.

186
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,972
That was ages ago.

187
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,317
Fine, I admit I cheated.
I committed a grave sin.

188
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,028
-But isn't this too harsh?
-"Too harsh"?

189
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,323
Let me ask you one last question.

190
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,784
What? What is it?

191
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,410
Do you want my forgiveness?

192
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,081
Beg all you want.
I'd be insane to forgive.

193
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,625
How did you find out?

194
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,920
Damn it.

195
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,254
Is that important?

196
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,635
Shouldn't you at least apologize first?

197
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,186
Let's listen to the next song.

198
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,396
It's "Short Hair" by Cho Yong-pil.

199
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:06,739
There was a girl who once gave me
A bouquet--

200
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:16,374
I wonder why I miss her so much today

201
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:25,550
Her short hair was neatly combed
Like grass wet from the rain

202
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:34,142
I recall her radiant eyes in my mind

203
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:42,442
Whenever I feel lonely

204
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:45,778
I think of that day

205
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:51,242
When I start missing that day…

206
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,415
THE PRIDE OF SAMDAL-RI!

207
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,628
Hey, Gyeong-tae.

208
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,757
Gyeong-tae.

209
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,011
Gyeong-tae!

210
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,765
Yes? Who was that?

211
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,934
You fool. Is that your bedroom?

212
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,520
-Why is he already here?
-You might as well get a bed.

213
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,688
Jeez.

214
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,232
I shouldn't have gotten you this job.

215
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,984
-Open up!
-Okay.

216
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,201
Hey, Yong-pil!

217
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,827
You just got here, didn't you?

218
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,290
Hey.

219
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,666
Hey, take that.

220
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,959
Stay awake, will you?

221
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,294
You…

222
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,296
Okay. You can go for now.

223
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,469
Hello?

224
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,929
Yes, he just went in.

225
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,056
He's coming up now.

226
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,141
-Already?
-Yes, he just passed the gate.

227
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:02,438
We'll now begin discussion
our short-term forecasts.

228
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,690
As you know, the commissioner will join us

229
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,609
-this week as well.
-Lock the door!

230
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,902
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

231
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,779
-Hey, Sang-hun.
-Good morning.

232
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,659
JEJU METEOROLOGICAL CENTER
FORECASTING DIVISION

233
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,827
What? Why is this locked?

234
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,579
For crying out loud.

235
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,542
What? They locked me out on purpose.

236
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,585
Director Han!

237
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,587
Sir!

238
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,717
This is unfair. It's not right.

239
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,135
Director Han.

240
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,720
Forecaster Kang.

241
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,389
Baek-ho!

242
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,268
Can you just open up for a second?

243
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,686
I mean…

244
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,604
Hold on.

245
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,108
The meeting's begun, hasn't it? It has.

246
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,444
Headquarters!

247
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,862
It's pretty noisy.

248
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,656
That bastard.

249
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,910
Why the hell did he come early
when he's on the night shift?

250
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,706
I'll bust this door down!
I'll count to three and break it down.

251
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,833
-We just replaced that door.
-One…

252
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,460
-Two…
-Should I just open it?

253
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,004
-Are you crazy?
-Two and a half!

254
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,007
The commissioner's here.
Who knows what he'll do this time?

255
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,175
Have you forgotten already?

256
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,510
What do you mean?

257
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,053
It's not sleet.

258
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,680
It's snow!

259
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,098
As northwest winds head south,

260
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,809
snow clouds formed
over the Yellow Sea will flow in.

261
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,561
Do you know what'll happen next?

262
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,397
The surface temperature
will go down to at least 1°C.

263
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,484
There will definitely be snow, not sleet!

264
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:34,989
A difference of just one or two degrees
will determine snow, so it's tricky.

265
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,409
Keeping all possibilities open
and going with sleet is the right call.

266
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,452
Let's do that.

267
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,495
Sleet and snow aren't the same!

268
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,456
What are you doing?
We're on the same side.

269
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,959
Seriously, sleet and snow aren't the same.
Please mark it as snow.

270
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,586
Just this once. Please?

271
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,129
I swear that it'll snow.

272
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,674
It's rain! Not just raindrops!

273
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,469
Hallasan Mountain has
more cold troughs in the upper layer.

274
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,262
They'll flow in with the rain!

275
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,097
Gosh, this is so frustrating!

276
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,808
Even if the upper
and lower layers were unstable,

277
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,645
it's not enough
to rain over the northern area.

278
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:09,357
Do you know how much the village head
of Dongbok cussed me out last time?

279
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,693
The rain washed away all the pesticides.
He demanded compensation!

280
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,570
He tormented me for three years!

281
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,822
You also didn't listen
to me two years ago!

282
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,616
We had an sports day

283
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:22,370
but were stuck all day
in the indoor gym playing basketball!

284
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,038
I wanted to play soccer!

285
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,457
Hold on. It's a typhoon.

286
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,293
-Wait! it's a typhoon!
-Okay, next is Busan.

287
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,045
-Yes, this is Busan.
-Why did he move on?

288
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,090
Jeju!

289
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,257
Director Han.

290
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,635
Can you please open up?

291
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,054
It's going to rain this weekend.

292
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,472
The scenario you see here…

293
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,599
Headquarters called
with a special request.

294
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:48,187
They said to lock up that knucklehead
when the commissioner was present.

295
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:49,939
I see.

296
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,857
Why won't anyone believe me? Come on!

297
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:52,858
That little…

298
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,527
You bastard!

299
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,364
HQ in Seoul already analyzed the data,
so why do you always try to mess it up?

300
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:01,158
They don't know anything about Jeju.

301
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,077
I've lived in Jeju for 38 years.

302
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,580
I know more about its topography
and wind speed than they do!

303
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:11,252
They even have to search online
to find good restaurants in Jeju!

304
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,129
My analysis has never been wrong!

305
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,463
You're right.

306
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,757
And that's why HQ wants you to join them.

307
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,093
Stop complaining about their analysis.

308
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:22,012
Just go there
and do the analysis yourself.

309
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,806
Why would I go there?

310
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,808
I don't want to!

311
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,519
I hate Seoul!

312
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,437
Me too.

313
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,605
Sir…

314
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,566
Director Han.

315
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,608
Baek-ho!

316
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,403
You look so pretty.

317
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:38,863
I love it.

318
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,453
That's good.

319
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,163
-Nice.
-Yes.

320
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,874
Good. Just like that.

Not bad.

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,807
They're all perfect.
It's too hard to pick out the best one.

347
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:52,561
They're all good ones. She doesn't take
photos that aren't worth keeping.

348
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,021
Come on. That's not possible.

349
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,899
Why not? She's Cho Eun-hye.

350
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,401
She got these high-quality photos
in just 15 minutes.

351
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,487
No wonder global stars praise her.

352
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,822
And that's why Paris Magazine
recognized her work.

353
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,032
Exactly.

354
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:09,286
You're right. Holding their exhibition
in Korea is in itself incredible.

355
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,830
It's the first stop on their tour.

356
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,498
She's such a patriot.

357
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,333
Hey.

358
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,086
What are you doing?

359
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,630
Sorry? Well…

360
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,841
I'm setting up Ms. Cho's chair.

361
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,344
Then, what about me?

362
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,054
Where's my chair?

363
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,430
Sorry?

364
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,145
I'll prepare yours as well.

365
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:48,409
Does she think she's the director?
Why does an assistant need her own chair?

366
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,869
And we're Ms. Cho's assistants, not hers.

367
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:55,666
She's just dying
to copy everything that Ms. Cho does.

368
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,545
Tell me about it. She bought
those sneakers too because Ms. Cho did.

369
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,841
Her family isn't that wealthy either.
How does an assistant have so much money?

370
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,427
Bang Eun-ju,
you'll never be like Cho Eun-hye.

371
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,344
Never.

372
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,181
-Set this up properly.
-I'm sorry.

373
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,397
No wonder why they say not to go
out of your way to help someone.

374
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,151
Jeez, I have only myself
to blame. It's all my fault.

375
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,987
I helped you get a job
when you had nothing to do,

376
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,406
but you repay my kindness by betraying me?

377
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,700
You ungrateful bastard.

378
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,035
Hey.

379
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:34,163
You got me this job,
but you're not the one paying me.

380
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,873
Selling you out was hard on me too.

381
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:36,999
Speaking of which,

382
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,585
can't you just quit?

383
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,671
-Do you think I would?
-Listen.

384
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:46,467
If you're that good, just go to HQ
in Seoul. They want you to come.

385
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,427
Everyone's dying to work in HQ.

386
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,096
So why stay in Jeju
and cause all this mess?

387
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,931
I'd go there in a heartbeat.

388
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,725
Seoul is…

389
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,226
It's…

390
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,775
Hey, Gyeong-tae.

391
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,776
What?

392
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,738
Do you know Tarzan?

393
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,531
Tarzan's wearing ten-won underwear

394
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,532
-Of course.
-Right.

395
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:14,119
Do you know why he wears
such cheap underwear?

396
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,372
What are you talking about?
He's probably broke.

397
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,793
No. It's because it's hot.

398
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,128
If you gave him an expensive fur coat,

399
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,463
do you think he'd wear it?

400
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,590
I would even if it's hot. It's expensive.

401
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:27,675
Jeez.

402
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,259
Whatever. Anyway…

403
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,638
That's what Jeju means to me.

404
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,598
It's like Tarzan's ten-won underwear.

405
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:38,268
Even if I'm given an expensive fur coat
that everyone loves,

406
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,728
it wouldn't look good on me.

407
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,481
It's just be a financial burden.
I'll get heat stroke.

408
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,858
That's how I feel about Seoul.

409
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,611
And you think
I've never lived there before?

410
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,196
Of course, I have.

411
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,406
But you see…

412
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:51,907
It's a bit…

413
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,910
All in all,

414
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,620
Seoul's not for me.

415
00:24:56,704 --> 00:25:00,749
It's not because Seoul's not for you.
It's probably because Sam-dal is there.

416
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,752
You're afraid you might run into her
if you go to Seoul.

417
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,337
Tarzan's underwear, my foot.

418
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,257
But isn't it about time you got over her?

419
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,094
You guys broke up years ago.
I just don't get it.

420
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:14,722
No.

421
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,223
No!

422
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,227
It was doomed from the start
since you were friends.

423
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,396
Yes. That's when it went wrong.

424
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:27,359
There was no time for me to stop you.
One day, you two were suddenly in love.

425
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,361
There was nothing I could do.

426
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:30,487
So I--

427
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,864
For crying out loud.

428
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,574
Gyeong-tae, you talk too much

429
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,535
for your own good.

430
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,412
You know?

431
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,331
My Adam's apple.

432
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:01,435
-This one stands out.
-It's much better.

433
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,980
Then, we'll use this one.

434
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,774
Should we go with this as the best one?

435
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:07,691
I'll take a look.

436
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,279
It'd be better to tidy up here a little…

437
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,295
Ms. Cho, can you take
just this one project for me? Please?

438
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,006
My schedule is already packed
for this year.

439
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,174
You know that.

440
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,551
If I take it, it'll affect
my other projects.

441
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,386
I'm very much aware of that.

442
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,847
But this company
only wants to work with you.

443
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,309
I can't do it.
Tell them I'll take a rain check.

444
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,228
Ms. Cho, come on.

445
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,604
Hold on.

446
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,442
Then, how about you
just decide on the concept,

447
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,488
and your assistant here takes the photos?

448
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,449
What's it called? A creative director.

449
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,833
Come on, I can't do that.
She's still learning.

450
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,209
Come on, Ms. Cho.

451
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,419
Come on. Do you want some dessert?

452
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,839
Let's have something good. It's my treat.

453
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:21,682
What's this?

454
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,475
I guess this will do.

455
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,606
Ma'am, what's this scarf?
It wasn't included during our meeting.

456
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,441
Well…

457
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,611
Right. You see, it's…

458
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:35,904
I added it.

459
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:37,865
You did? Why?

460
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,199
I thought it was pretty.

461
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,662
-What?
-I added it because it was pretty.

462
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,339
Sure, that's understandable.

463
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,176
But I wasn't the only one
in the meeting. We all agreed.

464
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,345
Take this out. Her neck needs to be bare.

465
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,991
The model is ready.
We will begin the next shoot.

466
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,993
Jeong-a, you look nice. Good.

467
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,206
What's that?

468
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,336
I told you to remove that!

469
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,641
This is a summer cover shoot.

470
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,436
So I chose a strapless top
and hired a model with a pretty neck.

471
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,148
We know that scarf is pretty,
but it doesn't go with our concept.

472
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:57,236
How could you refuse to notice that
as an assistant of four years?

473
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,912
What's the matter with you?
Are you in a bad mood?

474
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,790
Still, separate personal
and professional issues.

475
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,169
You must be in a good mood today.

476
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:17,839
What?

477
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,843
I have no reason not to be.

478
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,893
-Bang Eun-ju, what's up with you?
-I'll remove it.

479
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,939
I should follow your orders.
I don't have any say.

480
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,482
I'm just learning, after all.

481
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,868
Darn it.

482
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,185
Ms. Ko, where are you going?

483
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,230
Ms. Ko!

484
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,950
Ms. Ko!

485
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,485
Hello, Ms. Ko!

486
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,527
-Hello.
-Hello.

487
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,113
I had to add compost
to my groves, so I'm late.

488
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,198
Sorry.

489
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,076
Ms. Ko, you should remove that cloth.

490
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:10,327
It's all worn out.

491
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,413
Gosh. I'll remove it then.

492
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,915
-Says who?
-Goodness.

493
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,374
Says who?

494
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,251
You brat. My heart almost stopped.

495
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,546
You better not remove that, Mom.

496
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:24,382
Or I'll cover it again
with new cloth tomorrow.

497
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,717
Just let it be.

498
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,845
Forget it. It'll just make me stand out.

499
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:31,264
Jeez, you really don't know anything.

500
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,849
Hear me out.

501
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,644
Among General Yi Sun-sin's 12 ships,

502
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,648
only the ship that he was on
had a flag on it. Why?

503
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,109
It wasn't for decoration.
It stood for dignity.

504
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,821
It stands for your dignity.
We're like General Yi's ships!

505
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:49,616
Ms. Ko's buoy needs
to be easily spotted even from afar

506
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,577
to protect our haenyeos' dignity.

507
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,246
That's what I'm saying.

508
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,623
Showing dignity with floral print?

509
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,337
Stop bothering me
when I'm busy. That's enough.

510
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,258
Yong-pil, I understood you completely.

511
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,427
I knew you'd get it, ma'am.
You're the best.

512
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,556
Yong-pil, why do you
call me "ma'am" and call her "mom"?

513
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,184
People might think she really is your mom.

514
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,352
He's like her son!

515
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,980
Fine. I only have three daughters.

516
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,316
You're all so noisy.
Let's hurry on into the water.

517
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,693
-All right.
-All right.

518
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,611
The haenyeos in the next town are mad

519
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,196
since they can't find horned turbans.

520
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,239
-What?
-What?

521
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,533
So stay in our part of the water.

522
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,785
Or they'll throw a fit. Understood?

523
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:34,828
-Okay.
-Okay.

524
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,246
Let's throw a fit too!

525
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,166
Let's fight!

526
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,420
Be safe, Mom!

527
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,339
Good luck today!

528
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,383
-Let's do this!
-We can do it!

529
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:54,055
MY PERSON

530
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,194
You're changing it again?

531
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,198
You've changed it several times.

532
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,491
Have someone else do it.

533
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,535
They might report me
to the Department of Labor if I do.

534
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,956
It looked better on that side yesterday,
but it looks better here now.

535
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,542
I bet you'll move it back tomorrow.

536
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,294
Yes, I might.

537
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,798
If you look at all these stars
who participated,

538
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,842
your connections are impressive.

539
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,888
I know, right?

540
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,391
I guess I've had a decent life after all.

541
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,562
You've worked really hard in life.

542
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,397
Look at you now.

543
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,858
You've been moving
this photo for two months.

544
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,777
Good positioning is crucial.

545
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,904
Goodness, look at the time!

546
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,948
I have an after-party to go to.
Can you wrap up?

547
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,115
Sure, go ahead.

548
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,451
Also, we expect tons
of congratulatory wreaths,

549
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,161
so we emptied the hall.

550
00:33:58,245 --> 00:33:59,746
Thank you.

551
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,206
Thank you. Good night.

552
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,920
-Chears!
-Chears!

553
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,047
-Great job
-Great job!

554
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,217
Sorry I'm late!

555
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,552
-Ms. Cho!
-What took you so long?

556
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,263
You're all here early.

557
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,598
You sure love the studio.

558
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,518
I expected the summer shoot
to be at the beach in Jeju.

559
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,311
Ms. Cho doesn't go to Jeju.

560
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,146
Why not? She's from there.

561
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,525
I've lived in Seoul for 18 years.
Can't I be a Seoulite?

562
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,986
Only tourists enjoy going to Jeju.

563
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,572
I worked like a dog not to go back there.

564
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:37,242
And you can thank all that hard work
for finally becoming a dragon.

565
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,702
PARIS MAGAZINE TABS CHO EUN-HYE

566
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:49,671
Thank you very much. I love you all.

567
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:54,467
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

568
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,512
By the way,

569
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,806
-are you okay?
-What do you mean?

570
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:03,893
I heard Cheon Chung-gi cheated on you.

571
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:07,230
People at Magazine X were talking
about the water kimchi attack.

572
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,566
Wait. Your boyfriend cheated on you?

573
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,111
Cheating on someone this successful?
He must be crazy.

574
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,321
What's this attack about?

575
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,324
What do you think it is?

576
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:20,452
My mom's water kimchi
had a lot of pretty mold on it.

577
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,537
So I poured it over his head.

578
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,248
Seriously? You went to his workplace?

579
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,959
You bet. I did it in the lobby
in front of everyone.

580
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,295
I poured the entire thing over him.

581
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,256
You're incredible.

582
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,051
I'm too busy with work
to be hurt by that kind of stuff.

583
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,761
Do you know who the woman was?

584
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,888
You should've grabbed her hair.

585
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,558
Forget it. He's the one who cheated.
I couldn't care less about her.

586
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,602
She's probably no different from him.

587
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,937
She sure is laidback.

588
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,648
-She is.
-Enough about him.

589
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:52,150
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

590
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,110
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

591
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,236
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

592
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:02,869
Isn't she your assistant?

593
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,205
She was glaring at you the whole time.

594
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,832
You should be watch out for her.

595
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,920
They're all like that at that stage.
They have a lot on their minds.

596
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,130
Right. They think they know everything.

597
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,675
She must be desperate to debut.

598
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:21,262
I don't feel uncomfortable
dealing with clients or superiors.

599
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,765
I know I can prove
my worth through my skills.

600
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,602
But mentees are something else.

601
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,104
-It's so difficult.
-What?

602
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,857
That's rich coming from someone
who had it tough as an assistant.

603
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,068
You worked for Seo Hui-ju for eight years.

604
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,114
That's unbelievable.
How did you hold on for so long?

605
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,323
How do you think?

606
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,700
I gritted my teeth
so I could stay in Seoul.

607
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,327
You were extremely desperate.

608
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,582
Anyway, good work today. Cheers again.

609
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:53,169
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

610
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,968
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

611
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,554
Thank you.

612
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,680
Eun-bi.

613
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,684
Where's Eun-ju?
You should take better care of her.

614
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,352
Let her be. She's not a kid.

615
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,688
She's probably cooling off somewhere.

616
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,899
Ko Eun-bi, she's still
your senior colleague.

617
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,695
-Who taught you to bad-mouth colleagues?
-Eun-ju did.

618
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,781
Really? So she bad-mouths me too?

619
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,246
-You're even tattling on her now?
-She keeps bad-mouthing you.

620
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,375
There she is.

621
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,066
Why did you send me that?

622
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,569
Because I wanted you to know.

623
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,739
-Know what? That Chung-gi cheated on me?
-No.

624
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,451
That I seduced your boyfriend.

625
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,079
You seemed completely fine with it.

626
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,584
Did you expect me to crumble
just because I was cheated on?

627
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,587
Okay, let's say you two fell in love.

628
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,631
Then, you should be apologizing to me.

629
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,966
I felt guilty at first.

630
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,511
But you acted like it wasn't a big deal.

631
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:11,432
You weren't curious about me either,
so my self-esteem kept plummeting.

632
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,142
Even though I'm still just learning.

633
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,356
Wow, seriously.

634
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,483
You're such a loser.

635
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,777
Don't blame me for your low self-esteem.

636
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,240
Why do you think
I can't do what you can do?

637
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,869
I can seduce your man
and take good photos like you too.

638
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,538
But you never gave me a chance.

639
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,374
Not just that.
You took the opportunity from me.

640
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,669
Then, how about you
just decide on the concept,

641
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:44,883
and your assistant here takes the photos?

642
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,635
Come on, I can't do that.
She's still learning.

643
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,060
You seemed to be confused.

644
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:58,271
That wasn't an opportunity for you.

645
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,983
It's only an opportunity
if you're ready. Otherwise, it's a risk.

646
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:03,693
You're not good enough yet.

647
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,695
Who are you to judge that?

648
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,322
And you think you can?

649
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,162
Go out and open
your own studio if you want.

650
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,582
I won't help an unprepared mentee
just because they throw a fit.

651
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,002
And you can keep that bastard.

652
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,464
My boyfriend cheated,

653
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:27,550
but if you were mad since I seemed fine,
then you won this time.

654
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,761
It shocked me that it was you.

655
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:34,098
An ex-boyfriend cheating
doesn't affect my work.

656
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,310
But you do.

657
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:43,316
Do your job for the exhibition.
Then we'll talk about if you'll stay.

658
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,862
You want me to work in this situation?

659
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,617
Have you ever stepped in dung before?
You feel pissed when you realize it.

660
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:56,371
But you can't let it ruin your day.
Wipe it off and move on.

661
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,874
That's what you two are to me. Dung.

662
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,095
I'm certain that she broke up again.

663
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:16,891
You don't give someone you love
water kimchi that's gone bad.

664
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,644
You should just give up, Grandma.

665
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,105
Based on what I saw on TV,

666
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:25,608
it's not too bad
for women to live alone these days.

667
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,862
Grandma, I think Aunt Jin-dal's here.

668
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,406
I'll call you again soon.

669
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,616
All right, my baby.

670
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,452
Call me if anything else happens.

671
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,206
Jeez.

672
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,710
How come she can't find one decent man?

673
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,811
Alcohol!

674
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,605
Please bring me another bottle!

675
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,279
How interesting.

676
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,573
How amusing.

677
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,495
It's totally a comedy!

678
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,915
Cheon Chung-gi and Bang Eun-ju?

679
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,167
Those two…

680
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:28,838
Seriously. How amusing.

681
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,635
But why doesn't she feel guilty?

682
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,429
Oh, dear.

683
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,098
Recording yourself
in case you won't remember this?

684
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,184
I'd just go home if I were you.

685
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:43,102
Sir, hear me out.

686
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:46,189
This is so hilarious.

687
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,190
Okay? Sit down.

688
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,358
Stop having so much fun and just go home.

689
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:52,570
Why do you always drink by yourself?
Where are your friends?

690
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,492
You're an interesting one too.

691
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,409
I'm…

692
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:03,831
I'm not trying to entertain you
because I don't have any friends.

693
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,834
Goodness. You know what?

694
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,878
This is a huge misunderstanding.

695
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:13,466
Sir, this place will fall into chaos
if I bring my friends here.

696
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,260
Actors Song Joong-ki, Gianna Jun,
and Kim Tae-hee.

697
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:17,428
You know them, right?

698
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:19,806
They're all my friends.

699
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,641
Is that so?

700
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,893
Then, call them over.

701
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,479
So I can put their autographs on the wall.

702
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,398
You don't believe me.

703
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,444
Okay. I'll call them.

704
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:37,657
I won't take responsibility
for the chaos they'll bring.

705
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,950
Okay, I'll call them.

706
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,077
They'll definitely come.

707
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,956
Here's Gianna.

708
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:46,874
But she's busy.

709
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,379
She's extremely busy.
She's in every single TV commercial.

710
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,672
Here's Tae-hee.

711
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,216
She's asleep.

712
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,554
She did that mattress commercial.
She's probably all snuggled up and asleep.

713
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:00,888
Right?

714
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,643
It's not that I can't call them.

715
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,812
I chose not to in case they're busy.

716
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,480
Sure.

717
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:11,732
I'm serious.

718
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,904
Cheers.

719
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,532
Don't cry. You could do
much better than him.

720
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,743
I'll set you up with a better guy.
I'm glad you broke up.

721
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,745
-Just drink.
-We never liked him, right?

722
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,707
-Yes, I disliked him from the start.
-Yes, he was awful.

723
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,459
I'm glad you broke up.

724
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:35,673
Forget it.

725
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,843
I don't need to drink with a friend
over something so trivial.

726
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:42,388
I'm not the only one
whose boyfriend cheated with her mentee!

727
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,056
There are tons of women like me.

728
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,821
Gyeong-tae! What's wrong? What happened?

729
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,740
What is it? Hey, Eun-u.

730
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,241
What's wrong?

731
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,826
What happened? Tell me.

732
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,620
What is it?

733
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:08,080
His second child…

734
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:11,417
What's wrong? Is your child sick or hurt?

735
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:12,960
-His child…
-Yes?

736
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:16,756
-His child finally spoke.
-Okay. And?

737
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,091
The first word was "Mom."

738
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,012
The first word was "Mom."

739
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,974
Their first word was "Mom."

740
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,684
Not "Dad."

741
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,064
I see.

742
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:36,359
So that's why you called me?

743
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,528
Hey, listen. I was okay
when it happened with our first kid

744
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,405
since my wife did most of the work.

745
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,449
But it's not cool with our second kid!

746
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,327
I changed their diapers
ten times more than she did.

747
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,121
That's awful.
Why couldn't they say "Dad" first?

748
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:50,748
It's so much easier to say.

749
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,667
-It's easier to pronounce.
-You damn idiots.

750
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,670
I rushed over here mid-shower
because you called me!

751
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,213
God!

752
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,507
Hey.

753
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:05,429
If you've run out of excuses
to drink, then just drink.

754
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:09,350
Do you seriously think
this was a valid reason? Jeez.

755
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,936
How could you say that? You don't know.

756
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,730
When your baby says their first word,

757
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,233
it's heartbreaking when it's not "Dad."

758
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,361
-Do you know?
-You're a sociopath. You lack empathy.

759
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,321
-Hey, Cha Eun-u. Hang in there.
-Yeah?

760
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:26,826
Let's stop calling him by his full name.
I feel uncomfortable hearing that.

761
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,704
Hey! I was born before he was!

762
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,455
I'm the real Cha Eun-u!

763
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,542
-And we don't look too different.
-Are you serious?

764
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,002
Do you think his child

765
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,212
will say "Dad" first?

766
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:42,633
-Let him get married first.
-What are you lunatics talking about?

767
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,510
You damn nutjobs.

768
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,971
Stop calling us that.
You're the biggest nutjob.

769
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,514
Jeju Meteorological Center's nutjob.

770
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,016
Drink this, you nutjob.

771
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,476
Jeez.

772
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,146
I'm speechless. You think it's funny?

773
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,065
-You hear how good my rap was?
-That wasn't funny at all.

774
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,038
Cheers!

775
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,619
My head is killing me.

776
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,085
You startled me.

777
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,087
What is it?

778
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:02,963
Pick one.

779
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:04,340
What?

780
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,841
WAKE UP
HANGOVER DRINK

781
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,351
The one on the right.

782
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:20,189
Cha Ha-yul, you…

783
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,442
You could've killed me with this.

784
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:27,238
You won't die that way. Don't worry.

785
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,322
What?

786
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,242
Why would you say that?

787
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,535
Aunt Jin-dal said so.

788
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,788
She said you'd die
on the streets while drunk.

789
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,414
So you wouldn't die like this.

790
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,291
Hey, you…

791
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:45,589
I bet it hurts.
Aunt Jin-dal beat you up last night.

792
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:47,550
She hit me?

793
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,678
With what?

794
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,429
-With alcohol.
-What?

795
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,808
Alcohol.

796
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:59,728
I want more alcohol!

797
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:02,690
Give me more alcohol!

798
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,860
I want more alcohol.

799
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,903
Okay? Alcohol!

800
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,698
Give me more alcohol.

801
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,408
Alcohol.

802
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:15,870
I'm going to drink myself
to death tonight.

803
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,705
Okay, let's do this!

804
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,709
Soju.

805
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,794
Where are you, soju?

806
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,713
What? We don't have any?

807
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:29,008
What? We're out of alcohol?

808
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:33,345
Soju!

809
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:40,853
Why don't we have any alcohol?

810
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,775
Why is everyone giving me a hard time?

811
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,033
I mean…

812
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,785
Why aren't they sorry?

813
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,370
Why aren't they?

814
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,248
They should be sorry.

815
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,876
They should apologize.

816
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,836
I mean…

817
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:10,090
It's okay to not feel bad if I look fine?

818
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:11,884
Then, what?

819
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,762
Do they want me
to bawl my eyes out or something?

820
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,222
I'm also…

821
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,393
I'm also upset.

822
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,773
It hurts my pride.

823
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,567
And it makes me angry.

824
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:33,113
It makes me mad!

825
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:40,329
I treated them so well.

826
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:46,585
I haven't seen her
act this way in a long time.

827
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,463
She was doing fine for a while.

828
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:53,550
Why?

829
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,427
Hey.

830
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,472
Go buy some more alcohol.

831
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,435
Why? Are you going to drink with her?

832
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,354
No.

833
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,148
I'll make her drink herself to death.

834
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:12,111
Damn it!

835
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,012
Cho Sam-dal?

836
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,388
Yes? What is it?

837
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,933
You know you're a lightweight.
Don't drink so much next time.

838
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,728
Or I'll send you back to Jeju.

839
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,396
-I'm not a kid.
-You little…

840
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:49,565
All right.

841
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,400
Aunt Sam-dal, did you step in dung?

842
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,776
What? Seriously?

843
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,902
Where?

844
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:57,906
What is this?

845
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,951
-These were really expensive! Come on!
-Seriously…

846
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:02,453
-Come on!
-Hey, Sam-dal.

847
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,912
Isn't that your studio?

848
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:04,830
What?

849
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:08,959
An assistant director in her thirties
working for a renown Korean photographer,

850
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:12,546
attempted to jump off
Yeongpo Bridge but was rescued.

851
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:18,260
Fortunately, the police arrived
and rescued her after being alerted,

852
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:20,679
and she was taken to a nearby hospital.

853
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,766
She is currently in stable condition

854
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,309
and will require rest…

855
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,393
What is this?

856
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,520
Is she an AD of yours? Really?

857
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,440
I think so.

858
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,941
But why would she do that?

859
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:35,611
Hold on.

860
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,154
-I need to head out.
-She claims

861
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,282
after suffering the photographer's
abuse of power and verbal abuse,

862
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:42,826
she attempted to take her own life.

863
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:47,915
The police are investigating to see
if workplace bullying caused this attempt.

864
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,883
As abuse of power and verbal abuse
at work have become social issues,

865
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,677
they have also occurred
in the culture and art worlds,

866
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,179
leaving many in disbelief.

867
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:06,225
Renown photographer Cho
has worked with many top stars,

868
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,851
and her assistant Bang

869
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:11,188
has revealed she suffered
from Cho's abuse of power several times.

870
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:15,734
Cho was also accused
of verbally abusing Bang…

871
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:17,236
Hello?

872
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,530
No, it's not true.

873
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,826
You know Ms. Cho well. It's not true.

874
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,286
PHOTOGRAPHER CHO EUN-HYE ACCUSED
OF ABUSE OF POWER

875
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,287
Yes.

876
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:32,251
Come on. Why would I ever
mistreat my employees?

877
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:35,629
There was just
a misunderstanding that day.

878
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,926
Sir, why would you pull out
when the photos are ready?

879
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,470
Please, be patient. And everything…

880
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,474
Pay a penalty?

881
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,938
What are you talking about?

882
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,400
Sir?

883
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:59,903
Ms. Cho! The advertising agency
wants to cancel our contract.

884
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:03,157
Magazine X and Bobble
have both canceled the cover shoots.

885
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,409
No matter how much I said it wasn't true,

886
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:09,204
they're all backing out
because of public outrage.

887
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:11,707
Have you tried calling Eun-ju?

888
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,542
She won't pick up our calls.

889
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,003
Me neither.

890
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:19,840
This isn't right. We were always there.

891
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:23,677
We know how much you cared about her.

892
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,805
What should we do now?

893
00:54:26,889 --> 00:54:28,515
The reporters are still outside.

894
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,225
I can't believe this.

895
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,272
Did something happen last night?

896
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,526
What projects haven't been canceled?

897
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,863
They're all canceled.

898
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:47,201
What if the photo exhibition
gets canceled too?

899
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,702
Hey.

900
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,330
Paris Magazine wouldn't do that
without asking us.

901
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,208
After all, it's a global photo exhibition.

902
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,753
But no one is willing to hear us out.

903
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,343
MODEL JEONG-A'S MANAGER

904
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:12,100
Ma'am, wait! Just a minute.

905
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,521
Let me talk with Jeong-a right now.

906
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,773
I'm sure it's her agency's decision.

907
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,816
You know how close we are.

908
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:21,902
One minute, please.

909
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,779
Jeong-a, it's me.

910
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,240
Ms. Cho, this is Jeong-a's manager.

911
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,492
I see. Where's Jeong-a?

912
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,702
She can't come to the phone right now.

913
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:33,664
If this is about the photo
she took for the exhibition,

914
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,165
then could you take it down?

915
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:38,252
I…

916
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,421
This is because of the news, right?

917
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:44,591
I'm going to do an interview,
and it's not true.

918
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,761
I'm sure Jeong-a knows.
We've worked together for years.

919
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:49,388
You see…

920
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:53,141
I completely understand
that her agency is concerned.

921
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:56,436
I'm sorry, but this is what Jeong-a wants.

922
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,230
Sorry?

923
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,107
We know you're innocent.

924
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,734
But we can't predict
what the public will think.

925
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,278
Please take down her photo.

926
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,362
I'm sorry.

927
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:26,550
I'm sorry, Ms. Cho,

928
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,510
but could you not use my photo?

CHO EUN-HYE'S PAST 15 YEARS
MY PERSON

934
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,487
Hello?

935
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:18,870
"MY PERSON" IS AN EXHIBITION DEPICTING
THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S PAST 15 YEARS

936
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,517
Back in my hometown of Jeju…

937
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:49,151
there's something haenyeos
always emphasize when training.

938
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,992
"Don't be greedy."

939
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:04,166
"Remain underwater
for only as long as your breath allows."

940
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:13,884
"The ocean may seem peaceful,
but it's full of danger."

941
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,810
"So only stay down
as long as your breath allows."

942
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,798
"And when you can't hold out any longer…

943
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,108
come back to surface where you started…

944
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,246
to catch your breath."

945
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:01,157
What did you see and hear?

946
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,578
Life goes round and round

947
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:11,835
The wind blows against me

948
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,406
Goodness.

949
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:45,452
Ms. Na! Come on over!

950
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,204
Hurry up!

951
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:48,788
Ms. Na, come on!

952
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:51,291
-Hurry up!
-So we can do it together!

953
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:56,171
She's so excited.

954
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:58,882
We'll go get changed.

955
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:01,509
Go on and get changed!

956
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:08,391
Goodness. Here comes Mr. Cho.

957
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:09,768
Hello, everyone.

958
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,561
Hello.

959
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:13,021
Welcome, sir.

960
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,440
Is this very heavy?

961
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:17,525
Goodness.

962
01:02:19,611 --> 01:02:20,570
You fooled me.

963
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:22,572
Bye.

964
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:29,871
Gosh, Ms. Ko's truly blessed.

965
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:33,792
Your husband visits every day,
and you're blessed with great children.

966
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,503
Gosh, I'm so jealous!

967
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:37,504
I'm jealous!

968
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,465
What's there to be jealous of?

969
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,384
I'm not blessed with great children.

970
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:46,596
All of your girls
are living successful lives in Seoul.

971
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,100
Your first and second daughters
both appear in the newspaper, right?

972
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,979
It's not easy to succeed
as a Jeju native on the mainland.

973
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:56,564
-The others failed and came back.
-That's right.

974
01:02:56,648 --> 01:03:02,320
In Samdal-ri, your girls are the only ones
who have succeeded in Seoul.

975
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:03,238
True.

976
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,658
There's not much difference
whether you live in Seoul or Jeju.

977
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,493
I'm head out first.

978
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:09,786
Okay.

979
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:10,829
Bye.

980
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,207
Blessed with great children, my foot.

981
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,042
One's a divorcée.

982
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:18,378
One's an old maid.

983
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,130
And the last one is a widow.

984
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,300
This must be karma
catching up from my past life.

985
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:27,470
At least they're all kindhearted.

986
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:30,015
No one's children are as kind as ours.

987
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,478
Maybe it's karma
from your past life, not mine.

988
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:38,440
Do you really have to talk that way?

989
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,942
I know you worry
about them more than I do.

990
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,652
Don't you remember?

991
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:47,866
You cried a river when Jin-dal
and Sam-dal first left for Seoul.

992
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,325
I did not!

993
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:53,413
I was relieved to know
I didn't need to cook for them anymore.

994
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:59,502
Why would I cry for them
when they don't even care to check on me?

995
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:02,630
So that's why you're sulking.

996
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:07,260
What will you do if they suddenly
return home to live with us?

997
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,470
Are you crazy?

998
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,431
Do you expect me
to cook for them at this age?

999
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,391
Enough with that nonsense!

1000
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,360
I'm all done.

1001
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:26,780
The ace of Jeju Meteorological Center,
Forecaster Cho.

1002
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,657
HQ sent you another offer.
They want you there.

1003
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:32,744
How many times must I tell you
that I'm not going?

1004
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,871
Come on. This isn't your first rodeo.

1005
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,540
Please discard it yourself
since it was sent to you.

1006
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,167
I'm running a bit late, so…

1007
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,336
But why are you saying no?

1008
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:44,923
Why won't you go to headquarters
when others are so desperate to go?

1009
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,467
Headquarters isn't the problem.

1010
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,802
It's Seoul.

1011
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:54,099
There's someone there
that he doesn't want to run into.

1012
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,059
You can never predict the future.

1013
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,478
Cut it out. Don't say such things.

1014
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:07,612
Hi.

1015
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:12,492
Hi, Mom.

1016
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:22,794
Grandma!

1017
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:38,768
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

1018
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:46,276
CHO YONG-PIL, CHO SAM-DAL,
17 YEARS OLD

1019
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,368
Twenty-eight.

1020
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:03,543
Why are you always counting the planes?

1021
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,005
Twenty-eight planes flew out
in the past two hours.

1022
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:09,507
There are so many planes leaving Jeju,

1023
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:14,804
so why am I not on one of them?

1024
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:18,600
That's because your mom
never allowed you to get on one.

1025
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,773
I'm going to fly out one day.

1026
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:28,151
And I'll go to Seoul. Just you watch.

1027
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:31,571
Why are you so desperate to go there?

1028
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:35,033
Don't you know all of our neighbors
failed there and returned home?

1029
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,159
Every single one.

1030
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,535
-My neighbor still--
-Hey!

1031
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,662
-What?
-I'm different.

1032
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:42,957
I'm going to succeed and never come back.

1033
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,125
Just watch.

1034
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,547
Listen to this. Right now.

1035
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:50,965
It's really good.

1036
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:51,925
Right?

1037
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,095
What's this on your hand?

1038
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,556
Is this dung?

1039
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:19,160
I WORKED HARD SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO
RETURN TO THE SMALL STREAM

1040
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:50,692
Attention, passengers.

1041
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:54,779
We will soon be landing
at Jeju International Airport.

1042
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:12,880
WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE LATE SONG HAE
AND HIS FAMILY FOR HIS APPEARANCE

1043
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,340
WE'D LIKE TO THANK KOH HEEYOUNG,
THE AUTHOR OF MOM IS A HAENYEO

1044
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,868
Did she really do this?
You know something, right?

1045
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,661
Call Sam-dal if you're worried about her.

1046
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:45,163
Don't worry about me.

1047
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,373
-Mom!
-Cho Yong-pil?

1048
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,626
-What's he doing here?
-I'm coming in.

1049
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:51,085
Ms. Ko!

1050
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:52,628
What?!

1051
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:53,755
Got it.

1052
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:54,672
Hurry up!

1053
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:56,299
Why would they come here?

1054
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,593
They'll run into each other at least once.

1055
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:01,721
It's so hard to meet up with Sang-do.

1056
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,014
A supercar in the countryside?
