1
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:45,337
Of course.

3
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,256
Hey.

4
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,757
Over here, Jin-dal.

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,883
Hey, guys!

6
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,302
Hey, your clothes…

7
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,680
I told you to dress up.

8
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,974
I did dress up. It's in my style.

9
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,185
Forget it. This is Jin-dal's charm.

10
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,270
Of course.

11
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,732
I don't know how a girl like her
was able to live with that rich family.

12
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,277
Hey, I've missed you. How have you been?

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,654
Thank you. Enjoy.

14
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,576
You hired such a great employee.

15
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,745
She's always smiling, so it puts me
in a good mood when I'm here.

16
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,331
-See you.
-Have a nice day.

17
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,500
-Goodbye.
-Hello!

18
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,546
Congratulations!

19
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,967
That's my, Ms. Cho.
She gets everything she wants!

20
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,593
That's very true.

21
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,346
Work or love, you are capable
of having it if you want.

22
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,431
I bet you never fail.

23
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,182
That's not true!

24
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,226
Thank you!

25
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,561
Cheers!

26
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,979
They say, "A shadow is cast

27
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,814
behind a shining person."

28
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,233
Behind the splendor

29
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:50,777
and bright smiles,

30
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,656
there is a hidden darkness
that's… difficult to notice.

31
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,701
Your mother-in-law said to throw them out.

32
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,871
Goodness, and it seems she sent
only the select abalones too.

33
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,706
Gosh, leave them.

34
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,207
I'll just eat them myself.

35
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,590
How disgusting.

36
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:56,093
EPISODE 11
WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER

37
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,678
Okay, fine.

38
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,722
Let's hear it.

39
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,682
What did I say to you that day?

40
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:03,892
What was it?

41
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:07,646
You confessed.

42
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,275
What…

43
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,237
What? Hey.

44
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,656
That was absolute nonsense!

45
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,241
I said I had feelings for you?

46
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,827
Gosh, I must've been crazy!

47
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,913
-That was--
-You confessed.

48
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,542
You said you liked me.

49
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,796
And I said I liked you too.

50
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,976
We should go. Let's go.

51
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,096
Sam-dal!

52
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,681
Cho Sam-dal!

53
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,145
Sam-dal! Wait!

54
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,901
Sam-dal!

55
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:42,115
Jeez, only in the countryside.
Who asks a convenience store to deliver?

56
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,077
It's Sam-dal. Sam-dal, are you busy?

57
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,038
Sam-dal! I'm sorry about that day--

58
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,831
-Hey.
-What now?

59
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,333
There's a red car up the road.

60
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,459
What red car?

61
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,713
Cho Sam-dal!

62
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,550
Sam-dal, wait.

63
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,219
Hey, wait up!

64
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,138
What's going on?

65
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,306
They're working out.

66
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,099
Goodness.

67
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,894
Don't your sides hurt
if you run right after a meal?

68
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,646
They're not working out.

69
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,065
Looks like a date to me.

70
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,111
I know something you don't.

71
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:23,114
Maybe you should forget
about whatever that is.

72
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,200
Sam-dal!

73
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,454
Hey, wait.

74
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,086
Cho Sam-dal.

75
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,381
What's wrong with you?

76
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,467
Come on. Let's talk.

77
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:43,885
Hey.

78
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,846
Why are you running away?

79
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,684
Seriously.

80
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,186
Why are you acting this way?

81
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,694
Sam-dal, what's wrong?

82
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,612
Was it because you were surprised?

83
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,365
Open the door. Let's talk.

84
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,450
-I'm coming in.
-Stop.

85
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,744
Just leave me alone.

86
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,413
Are you okay?

87
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:16,001
You should've just left me alone.
Why did you chase me all the way here?

88
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,419
Hey. I chased you,

89
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,129
because you suddenly ran away.

90
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,924
But are you really okay?
Is there something else wrong?

91
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,676
No.

92
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,844
Are you sure?

93
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,054
Yes.

94
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,687
How could you run away
after I said that? You startled me.

95
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,357
Forgetting what you did
after getting drunk is normal for you,

96
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,734
so I understand.

97
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,028
But if you run away after hearing that,

98
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,322
honestly,

99
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,490
it hurts.

100
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,911
What… After hearing what?

101
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,542
I said you confessed
your feelings for me, and you ran away!

102
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,296
Hey! How was that
a confession of my feelings?

103
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,632
Who confesses with a kiss…

104
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,595
Hey.

105
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,682
You remembered, didn't you?

106
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,684
Right?

107
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,479
Sam-dal. You actually remember, don't you?

108
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:22,275
-Right? Open the door.
-Yes, I remembered what happened!

109
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,655
I need to collect my thoughts.

110
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,283
So leave me alone.

111
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,009
They're dating.

112
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,219
It's true.

113
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,930
It's obvious that they're dating again.

114
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,974
Okay? I saw them clearly
with my own two eyes.

115
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,855
They're definitely dating.

116
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,528
So that means they've had feelings
for each other this whole time?

117
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,779
That's right.

118
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,490
Why did they break up then?

119
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,995
Good question.

120
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,290
Why did they break up
if they've liked each other?

121
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,709
-What?
-What?

122
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,169
What are you talking about?

123
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,296
Jeez.

124
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,882
You always know only half of the story.

125
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,759
Jeez.

126
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,303
If I knew everything,
then why would I be here?

127
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,779
You had Gyeong-tae,

128
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,656
Eun-u,

129
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,408
and Sang-do.

130
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,535
You had all of them, right?

131
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,539
I was always alone.
132

132
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,672
in case they suddenly played
Cho Yong-pil songs.

133
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,718
And if that happened…

134
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,637
then,

135
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,224
my heart would sink in an instant.

136
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,540
SAMDAL FISHING VILLAGE HALL

137
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,625
We believe

138
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,920
this area is more suitable than Namdal-ri.

139
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,171
Hold on.

140
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,130
But…

141
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:54,260
you do know which town this is, right?

142
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,888
I do. It's Samdal-ri.

143
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,061
Ms. Ko, you should leave.

144
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,562
What are you talking about?

145
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,688
Just go.

146
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,234
What nonsense are you planning
to do to our town this time?

147
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:13,988
You.

148
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,034
What are you doing here?

149
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,619
Are you insane?

150
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,456
How dare you come here?

151
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,500
You never even showed up four years ago.

152
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,877
How have you been, Father?

153
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,420
Father?

154
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,256
-I'm going to kill you.
-Dad.

155
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,466
-Dad!
-Dad!

156
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,801
-Dad!
-Father!

157
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,054
I told you not to come to this town.
I said to stay out of sight!

158
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,639
Stop it!

159
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,391
You.

160
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,642
Shut your mouth.

161
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,435
And put that thing down, dear.

162
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,772
He's not your child.
You can't decide whether he lives or dies.

163
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,503
Do you still get the hiccups
when you're startled?

164
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:13,715
I apologize.

165
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:19,012
I doubt you came knowing
I was the head of the haenyeos here.

166
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,680
Why did you come here?

167
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,474
Because of the theme park.

168
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,935
That's right.

169
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,938
For the theme park.

170
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,648
-That's in Namdal-ri.
-Quiet.

171
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,611
Do you need our town's help

172
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,447
for the theme park in Namdal-ri?

173
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,866
If so, don't worry about it.

174
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,870
We won't let our personal feelings
get in the way of your business.

175
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,707
It's not in Namdal-ri.

176
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,504
You should read that carefully.

177
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,639
"The start of a new theme park."

178
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,475
IN SAMDAL-RI

179
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,353
In Samdal-ri?

180
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,524
Instead of building
AS Group's theme park in Namdal-ri,

181
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,276
we'd like to build it in Samdal-ri.

182
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,654
Jeon Dae-yeong! Are you insane?

183
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,910
The AS theme park in Samdal-ri?

184
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,078
Yes.

185
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,790
Who came up with that idea?

186
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,629
President Jeon did, ma'am.

187
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,177
-My goodness!
-Mom!

188
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,512
-No, Mom!
-Mother!

189
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,639
Wait, Mother!

190
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,766
Listen, Mom.

191
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,936
-Mom.
-Mom, this is terrible for your health.

192
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,646
He never even showed up once,

193
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,232
and after four years,
that's what he came to say?

194
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,316
Wait, Mom.

195
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,489
Hae-dal, you go home with Dad.

196
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,865
-Okay.
-And Dae-yeong.

197
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:03,866
Yes?

198
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,951
Follow me.

199
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,494
Why?

200
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,955
Why would you talk to him?

201
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,373
I'll deal with him.

202
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,792
What would you need
to talk with him about?

203
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,835
What about you?

204
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:17,839
What do you two have to talk about?
You two are strangers now.

205
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:19,882
Go on home.

206
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,802
You,
follow me.

207
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,721
Pardon? Yes, sir.

208
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,559
Enjoy your drinks.

209
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,033
What? You don't want to drink
because it's not imported liquor?

210
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,953
You sure drank up
when you begged to marry Jin-dal.

211
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,956
Thank you, Father.

212
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,458
Stop calling me that!

213
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,752
I'm not your father-in-law anymore.

214
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,503
Right.

215
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,714
Then, from what position

216
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,633
should I continue this conversation?

217
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:05,011
I mean, as your ex-son-in-law

218
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:09,182
or as the president of the theme park?

219
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,940
He's going to be in a big trouble

220
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,151
if Namdal-ri theme park doesn't work out.

221
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,403
He suddenly changed his word.

222
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,530
Suddenly?

223
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,657
Out of blue?

224
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,078
There was a small incident…

225
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,038
at Namdal-ri.

226
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,790
We know Jin-dal well enough.

227
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,585
Even as a kid, whenever she was upset,
she would smash everything.

228
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,087
Her mother had to pay for all those

229
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,380
wrecked punching machines.

230
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,632
-That's right.
-Serves her right!

231
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,051
Hey!

232
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,888
I won't sign this contract!

233
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,098
What?

234
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,682
Don't be too upset.

235
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,352
They just thought
taking President Jeon's side

236
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,354
-would please him--
-No. I mean,

237
00:14:56,437 --> 00:15:00,191
how could he upend the deal
in Namdal-ri for a reason like that?

238
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,192
Oh, that.

239
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:06,072
Well, you know he gets triggered
when people speak ill of you.

240
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:06,989
Exactly.

241
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,869
After all that,
he still hasn't come to his senses.

242
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,085
Do you remember
what you promised me at this very table?

243
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,045
Do you?

244
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:28,177
I told you I couldn't let my daughter
marry into the family of AS Group.

245
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,595
I clearly told you

246
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,432
that my daughter would be unhappy.

247
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,017
And what did you tell me back then?

248
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,813
You said you'd protect her
even if you were disowned by your family.

249
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:44,527
You knelt down right here
and promised me that.

250
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,113
Did you or did you not?

251
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,198
I did, sir.

252
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,242
You said you'd protect her,

253
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,038
but then you send her home alone
with divorce papers?

254
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,167
After AS Group's family
was exposed for abuse of power

255
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,710
by one of their daughters-in-law,

256
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,296
the investigation will expand
to the entire conglomerate.

257
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,923
During their investigation,
the prosecution found

258
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:09,218
evidence of Bang Sang-mi,
the wife of the CEO,

259
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:13,055
and Jeon Dae-sik, the eldest son,
providing illegal political funds,

260
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,224
and they've begun a search and seizure.

261
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,019
The search and seizure was conducted
at AS Group's headquarters…

262
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,395
Did Jin-dal say anything?

263
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,398
It's exactly as the news says.

264
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,566
That's all she said.

265
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,277
She couldn't stand her mother-in-law

266
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,156
and Dae-yeong's older brother mistreating
the people working in that house,

267
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,326
so she exposed them and got a divorce.

268
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,329
They plan to track down
the flow of the illegal funds.

269
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,123
Is Dae-yeong
still not answering the phone?

270
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:43,294
The prosecution will seek
an arrest warrant for Jeon Dae-sik

271
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:47,632
and summon Vice President Jeon Dae-yeong
as a witness for questioning.

272
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,679
I have a right to know.

273
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,850
Although you're not family anymore,

274
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,269
for a short while,

275
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,980
you were my still son-in-law.

276
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,860
So I should know
whether you were okay or not.

277
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,874
I also wanted

278
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,380
to be disowned by my family.

279
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,969
I didn't care at all
about AS Group and wanted to leave

280
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,846
with Jin-dal,

281
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,225
so I even went
to the local district office.

282
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,727
I went, but…

283
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,694
But the hoju family register system
had been abolished.

284
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:54,156
Since the hoju family register system
was abolished,

285
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,536
so I couldn't disown myself.

286
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:04,625
That's right.
It was abolished back in 2008.

287
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,043
Idiot.

288
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,045
I also…

289
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:17,471
wanted to keep my promise.

290
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,266
But…

291
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,438
Jin-dal, that bitch…

292
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,315
You punk.

293
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,900
You're way too drunk.

294
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:40,620
I was more than willing
to give them all up.

295
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,371
But…

296
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,248
But?

297
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:50,713
She said that I couldn't live
without money.

298
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,466
Jin-dal said that.

299
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,385
And then,

300
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:01,557
she left me!

301
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,893
I can

302
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:10,566
live without money too!

303
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,494
This.

304
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,163
And this.

305
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,125
Father, you can have all of these.

306
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,630
I don't need any of these things!

307
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,926
Father, take them all.

308
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,179
Why do you keep calling me Father?

309
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,767
Let me see.

310
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,562
Let me try this on…

311
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,565
Well, look at that.

312
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,943
It fits perfectly.

313
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,866
Aunt Jin-dal, can't you please sit down?

314
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,828
-You're making me dizzy.
-It's driving me nuts.

315
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,788
She's right. Take a seat.

316
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,499
Dad's probably catching up
with his ex-son-in-law.

317
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,836
Catching up,
like, "Why did you divorce my daughter?"

318
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:17,550
Why would he upend everything over that
and bring over Namdal-ri's deal?

319
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,385
-Darn it!
-My goodness.

320
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,680
He upended the deal with Namdal-ri
and brought it here? Why?

321
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,392
It's a really childish reason.

322
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,187
Jin-dal.

323
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,149
Yes, Mom?

324
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,151
What is it, Mom?

325
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,820
How long have you been
in touch with Dae-yeong for?

326
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,448
Ever since the divorce?

327
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,742
No. Of course not!

328
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,412
After I came back to Jeju,
I only met him once,

329
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,497
and it was in the street by coincidence.

330
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,584
What was the thing Mom made me do?

331
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,626
The traffic baton.

332
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,088
On the day I was doing that,
I ran him on the road.

333
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,507
If you see him again, tell him.

334
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,720
Not even an inch of that theme park
will be allowed in Samdal-ri.

335
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,055
Of course. That would be insane.

336
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,350
Mom, I even get headaches
whenever I see AS Group's name anywhere.

337
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,567
Good night.

338
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:22,865
By the way, Jin-dal,

339
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,160
are you sure nothing happened
to you while you were married?

340
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:31,624
I mean, they did so many mean things
to their housekeepers and drivers.

341
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,375
And they opposed your marriage.

342
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,212
They must've treated you horribly too.

343
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,925
Did you forget I'm Cho Jin-dal?

344
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,428
If they did that to me, I would've exposed
everything and left in a month,

345
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:45,471
not five years.

346
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,641
-That's true.
-Yeah.

347
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,644
Anyways, where is Sam-dal?

348
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,729
-She's been gone the whole day.
-I know.

349
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,913
It's cold. Let's go home now.

350
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,042
Sam-dal.

351
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,965
If you don't want to talk,

352
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,301
then just listen.

353
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,847
Can I…

354
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,520
make you waver a bit more?

355
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,442
Taking care of you and worrying about you…

356
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,697
are things I've always done,
so they're natural for me.

357
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:51,453
But if you're wavering
because of these things…

358
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,625
then let me do a bit more.

359
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,672
Why do you keep asking if I'm okay?

360
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,341
Why do you keep worrying about me

361
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,595
and taking care of me?

362
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,847
Why do you keep…

363
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,767
making me waver?

364
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:20,107
What are you going to do
if I really do lean on you?

365
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,861
I'm going to make you waver a lot more.

366
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,364
So just…

367
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,703
You can just lean on me.

368
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,047
If I lean on you…

369
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,676
are you confident you can handle it?

370
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,762
Yes.

371
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,806
I'm confident.

372
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:20,686
Are you two…

373
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:23,897
back together?

374
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,547
Sam-dal,

375
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,425
do you still have feelings for Yong-pil?

376
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,198
Why won't it turn off?

377
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,533
This thing still doesn't work.

378
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:18,994
What is it?

379
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:19,953
Please turn off.

380
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,040
I mean,

381
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,460
I can't believe they'd do this
in a morning soap opera!

382
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,711
My goodness!

383
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:29,463
Are you looking down on this show?

384
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,756
This is about romance too.

385
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,673
I mean,

386
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,135
how could they air this in the morning?

387
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:38,430
Children might be watching at this hour.

388
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,891
What's with all the fuss?
It's so old-fashioned.

389
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,977
Call Jin-dal and Hae-dal in for breakfast.

390
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:45,395
Okay.

391
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,818
I'm not old-fashioned.

392
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:52,528
Am I?

393
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:57,115
Something like that being aired
at this hour is what's strange.

394
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,576
They should show
children's shows, not kissing…

395
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:05,791
What's wrong with me?

396
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:07,709
I must be crazy.

397
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,549
Jin-dal, Hae-dal. Wake up!

398
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,967
Oh, my God!

399
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,095
What in the world?

400
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,182
Dad?

401
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,559
Who's this?

402
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,187
What is it?

403
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,230
Our brother-in-law.

404
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,565
Brother-in-law?

405
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:31,608
Jeon Dae-yeong?

406
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,362
Damn it, why are you
so noisy this early in the morning?

407
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,323
-What's with this heap?
-No…

408
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,122
Why…

409
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,415
Why is he here?

410
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:48,417
-No idea.
-We don't know.

411
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:49,835
Come on!

412
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,337
Dad.

413
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,463
Wake up.

414
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,257
-Dad, wake up.
-Wake up.

415
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,341
Wake up.

416
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,427
-Dad, wake up.
-Hey!

417
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,845
-Get away from him.
-Dad.

418
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:00,929
Hey!

419
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,015
-Get away from him!
-Dad, wake up!

420
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,850
-Damn it, get off!
-Dad, wake up!

421
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,228
Goodness.

422
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,063
Dad, why did you bring him with you?

423
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:12,608
He should be kicked out of town.

424
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,902
And why are you feeding him, Mom?

425
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:16,278
Be quiet.

426
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,532
How can we kick someone out of our house
at breakfast without feeding them?

427
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,452
You can leave after you eat,

428
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,621
and never come back.

429
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:29,207
So do you want him to eat or not?

430
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,793
Just relax and eat your food.

431
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,713
Yes, sir.

432
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,175
Dae-yeong.

433
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,094
I mean, Mr. Jeon.

434
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,430
Was it two years ago?

435
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:47,768
AS Group banned me
from shooting advertisements.

436
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:48,894
You know that, right?

437
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,230
Come on, Sam-dal.

438
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,815
Let him eat.

439
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,400
-Right.
-Please eat.

440
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,820
I lost my part-time job
at the AS-affiliated coffee shop.

441
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,405
Right.

442
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,241
-Jin-dal hasn't been reinstated--
-Hae-dal!

443
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,203
You little brats.

444
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,623
Ignore them and eat.

445
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,308
How come only you get to eat this?

446
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,732
Yuck! It tastes like poop.

447
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,278
How disgusting.

448
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,459
Hey.

449
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:57,045
-Stop eating. Come on.
-Why?

450
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,880
-Why?
-I said let's go.

451
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,467
LUCKY CONVENIENCE STORE

452
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,438
Uncle Sang-tae.

453
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:16,481
Are you here to buy something?

454
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,066
No.

455
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,609
Then, are you here for Yong-pil?

456
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,113
He went to work.

457
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,157
Is that so?

458
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:44,134
THE PRIDE OF SAMDAL-RI!
CHO YONG-PIL IS HERE!

459
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,323
ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA

460
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,784
From what I saw yesterday,

461
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,620
it didn't look like she was running
in embarrassment.

462
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,915
Sam-dal ran away
because you said you liked her, right?

463
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,044
Did she run away
in embarrassment or in anger?

464
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,879
I'm sure you can't answer me.

465
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,714
Light pillars.

466
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,424
Do you even know what they are?

467
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,259
I've been here for three years.

468
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,970
I may not know a lot,
but I know at least that much.

469
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,890
-So did you confess or not?
-Jeez. Come on, just stop.

470
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,478
Why are you so interested
in other people's love lives?

471
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,938
"Other people's"?

472
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,523
Because of other people's love lives,

473
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:42,192
I lost touch with my old friend
for eight years.

474
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:45,112
You need our permission
to get back together again.

475
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,238
Fine, I got it.

476
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,656
I'll cut you out this time.

477
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,618
First, the Forecasting Division,
and now here? You're so clingy.

478
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:52,994
Speak for yourself.

479
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:57,374
How bad was the fight with your dad
to make him demand for your transfer?

480
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:58,917
What are you talking about?

481
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,253
Your dad's talking
with Director Han right now.

482
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,880
He wants you
to be transferred to a rural area.

483
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,298
A rural area?

484
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,259
What's a more rural area than this?

485
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,385
Dokdo Island?

486
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,054
We don't have an office on Dokdo.

487
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:12,889
I'm off.

488
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,519
We have our next schedule.

489
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,479
I see. Sorry.

490
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,064
-Thanks for your hard work.
-Thanks.

491
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,274
Thank you.

492
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,276
Have a nice day.

493
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,662
As if they all started out great.
Why are they only doing this to me?

494
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,165
Sue all of them.

495
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,208
Who leaves in the middle
of a shoot like this?

496
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,669
You made them work
four hours of overtime. You…

497
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,130
I mean, we.

498
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,924
Just use the autofocus.
Don't focus manually.

499
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,342
That's why the photos are blurry.

500
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:51,595
When were my photos ever out of focus?

501
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:53,513
Ms. Bang,

502
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:56,433
whenever you complained
about the lighting or the models,

503
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,603
it was actually your photos
that were out of focus. Everyone saw it.

504
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:03,607
Didn't Eun-hye teach you how to focus?
She always taught her assistants that.

505
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,859
-You didn't pay attention, did you?
-Hey!

506
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,820
It's because I'm nervous.

507
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:13,700
I was nervous to finally pick up
a camera after being an AD for so long!

508
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:19,789
Right, then you should take
some time to think about it.

509
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,340
Everyone now knows how bad she is.

510
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,509
She doesn't even know
how to get the focus right,

511
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:33,929
but she was doing it in manual mode
to copy you.

512
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,014
Everybody knew
it was the focus that was out,

513
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,809
but she kept complaining
about the model and the lighting.

514
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,771
She takes others in the industry
for fools.

515
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,481
So did they do the shooting?

516
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,941
No, she couldn't.

517
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,277
All the models and staff
got pissed off and left.

518
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:54,199
It served her right for being
the "best photographer in the world."

519
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,787
You're so funny, Eun-bi.

520
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,625
Did they kick her off

521
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,753
-the Magazine X project, then?
-Of course.

522
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,965
I wanted to see how far she'd go
with the concept she swiped,

523
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,633
but she's fired.

524
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:13,677
But she somehow got

525
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,889
Cheon Chung-gi to land her another deal.

526
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,601
Ms. Cho…

527
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,020
There's something really odd.

528
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:25,272
Odd?

529
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,274
Do you remember

530
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:30,318
the scarf that Bang Eun-ju insisted
against your will?

531
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:31,903
The scarf?

532
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,450
Ma'am, what's this scarf?
It wasn't included during our meeting.

533
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,035
Well…

534
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,870
Right. You see,

535
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,373
-it's…
-I added it.

536
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:47,794
What's that?

537
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,923
I told you to remove that!

538
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,883
Oh, yeah.

539
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,010
I remember it.

540
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,847
She had some issues with the wardrobe
because she insisted on using it.

541
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,724
Isn't it a bit weird?

542
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,976
I don't give a damn.

543
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,812
I'm very busy here.
I have no time to think about that.

544
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:06,813
What?

545
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,273
What do you mean?

546
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,484
Are you working on some secret project
behind our backs?

547
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,321
We feel really sorry for getting paid

548
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,072
for doing nothing here.

549
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,492
If there's anything, let us know.
We'll be there in no time.

550
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,119
All right.

551
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,204
Okay.

552
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,914
Bye.

553
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,254
A scarf.

554
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,759
Whatever.

555
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,553
CHO YONG-PIL

556
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,936
What's there I can't handle?
I'm confident.

557
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,023
I'm sure about my feelings,
and so are your--

558
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,107
What about mine?

559
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,568
How do you know how I feel?

560
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:58,239
Yes, I couldn't forget you
for a long time.

561
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:02,202
We've known each other
for 30 years. Of course, it was hard.

562
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,497
But that was all in the past.

563
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,042
If you felt that way back then,
what about now?

564
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,878
And why did you do that the other day?

565
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:15,673
Why did you get drunk
and do that to me? Why did you kiss me?

566
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,927
Do you always do that
when you're drunk? To just anyone?

567
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,553
Hey!

568
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,597
I don't do that
to just anyone when I'm drunk!

569
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,516
Damn it.

570
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,476
Don't you follow me.

571
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,853
Hey.

572
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,732
I clearly told you I'd make you waver.
You agreed to it!

573
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,275
What are you talking about?

574
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,403
I'm going to make you waver from now on!

575
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:39,072
You know those tube men
that flail around like this?

576
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,116
I'm going to turn you into that!

577
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,704
I must be crazy.

578
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:54,045
You're out of your mind, Cho Sam-dal.

579
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:01,803
What are you doing?

580
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,061
Go away!

581
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:15,608
And stop sneaking up
silently on me like that.

582
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,026
What do you mean…

583
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,238
What, you want me to go around yelling?

584
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,574
Just make some kind
of noise when you come.

585
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,286
Why do you keep appearing silently?
You always startle me.

586
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,662
I was so scared.

587
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,122
Seriously, what's wrong?

588
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,583
Where are you going?

589
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,751
One stew for table four.

590
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:34,961
-Okay.
-I got it.

591
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:42,093
So Yong-pil wasn't dumped?

592
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:45,555
They broke up even though they had
feelings for each other.

593
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,349
Goodness, I only looked out for Yong-pil.

594
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,019
But Sam-dal must've had a hard time too.

595
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,314
-Exactly.
-So are they seeing each other again?

596
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:58,026
Yes, Gyeong-tae's mom saw them together.

597
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,737
No, they're not dating.

598
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,738
What?

599
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,532
She said they definitely were.
They're not?

600
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,909
No, they're not.

601
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,912
Sang-do would know best.
He's friends with them.

602
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:12,707
Sang-do, then you should help them
get back together.

603
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:15,710
-You're right, he can just do that.
-Yeah.

604
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:17,670
Why should I?

605
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,715
Yong-pil is head over heels for her.

606
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,091
You should just--

607
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,135
Why do I have to help if he likes her?

608
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,183
I'm getting closer.

609
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:34,062
What? You told me to keep making noise.

610
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,569
Don't you have any work to do?
Why are you following me around?

611
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,696
What do you mean? I'm working right now.

612
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,449
Get your camera.
We have to go take pictures later tonight.

613
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,497
Forget it. Just send me the coordinates.
I'll go there myself.

614
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,499
What are you talking about?

615
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,000
Excuse me, Miss Photographer.

616
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,879
We need to put our feelings aside
and be professional about this.

617
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,090
We have work to do.

618
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:06,427
What are you talking about?
There are no personal feelings here.

619
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,722
They're right there. Those were
your personal feelings just now.

620
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,849
You can't look me in the eyes.

621
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,768
You shoo me away. You get nervous.

622
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:14,978
I bet your palms are sweaty.

623
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,731
What… You keep talking nonsense.

624
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,650
When was I ever nervous?

625
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:24,320
You look so nervous right now.
I've felt the same for a few days now.

626
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:26,489
Honestly, don't we feel the same way?

627
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,913
-Yong-pil.
-Yeah?

628
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:38,793
Remember when I said,
"An ex is worse than a stranger"?

629
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:40,920
Do you know why?

630
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,339
Why is an ex worse than a stranger?

631
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,510
It's much harder to get back together
with someone you broke up with

632
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:51,014
than to get to know and date a stranger.

633
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:52,974
Why is it much harder?

634
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,059
Because we'd never forget.

635
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:56,769
Forget what?

636
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,274
The reason why we broke up.

637
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,529
Because we'd never forget why we broke up.

638
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,369
Why should I?

639
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:16,164
Am I a matchmaker? Why should I do that?

640
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,791
If you don't want
to help them, then don't.

641
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,669
There's no need to get mad at me.

642
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:25,381
They've been in love with each other
all these years despite breaking up.

643
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,176
-Don't you feel bad for them?
-No, not at all.

644
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,386
What's wrong with you today?

645
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,847
Did you have a fight with them?

646
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,932
Come on, don't be like that.

647
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:38,353
Yong-pil has been so nice to you.

648
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:42,774
He always let you have his things
since you were kids, didn't he?

649
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,827
Sang-do! Bu Sang-do!

650
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,287
What about me then?

651
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,998
I always let him take a lot more.

652
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,793
I always let Yong-pil
take what was mine like an idiot!

653
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,044
Always!

654
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,047
Why do I always have to
give up what I want?

655
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,389
Goodness, don't mind him.

656
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:24,941
What's with you guys?

657
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,818
Did you have a fight?

658
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,403
No, we didn't.

659
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:33,449
Yes, you did. Why?
What did you fight about?

660
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,035
Sang-do, what is it?

661
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,539
Sam-dal. I'm sorry,
but could you excuse us?

662
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,750
What?

663
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,337
Well…

664
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,506
Okay.

665
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,688
What's going on?

666
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,691
I wonder what they fought about.

667
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,236
I've never seen them be like this before.

668
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:26,044
These are Yong-pil's.

669
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,547
Why are his bags here?

670
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,550
Look, I know you said
you wouldn't care about how I felt,

671
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,595
but don't you think
you're taking it a bit far?

672
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,638
I mean, I didn't say anything wrong.

673
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,641
You always took what was mine.

674
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,770
What do you mean?
What did I take from you?

675
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,522
You think you didn't?

676
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:50,109
Those two never fight.
What's going on with them?

677
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,613
Oh, no. What if they have a fist fight?

678
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,239
I got better grades than you.

679
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:59,243
But I always let you be class president,
and I was vice president.

680
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:00,828
What do you mean you "let me"?

681
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,998
That was an election.
More people voted for me.

682
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,710
I sang better than you too.

683
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:10,922
But because you were on Korea Sings once,
I always let you sing.

684
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,924
I wanted to sing too, you know.

685
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,258
Please!

686
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,302
I was always a better singer than you.

687
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,678
-Korea Sings?
-That's a lie.

688
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:19,388
Don't you remember the festival?

689
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:22,475
-This is how well I sang!
-That's not the right note.

690
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,559
-Hey!
-That song--

691
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:27,522
What are you guys doing?
You're bickering like little kids!

692
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,024
Hold on, Sam-dal. You stay out of this.

693
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,275
Let's be honest.

694
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,987
Only I could hit that high falsetto note.
Don't you remember?

695
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:38,074
Also, I always switched seats
with you on field trips.

696
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:41,035
I was your partner, but I always
gave up my seat for him. Right?

697
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,122
That is right. Yes.

698
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:48,376
Fine, if she says it's true,
I'll admit that.

699
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,964
So this time,
it's your turn to concede. Please.

700
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,967
Why should I concede this time?

701
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,176
Don't you remember?

702
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,763
Whenever I played that plane game
at the arcade and set a new record,

703
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,223
whose name did I put there?

704
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,933
Your name. I conceded for you.

705
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,477
-That was--
-BSD. I put your initials, Bu Sang-do.

706
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,146
-That's--
-That was a big one.

707
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,397
I never asked for it!

708
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,649
So it's actually your turn
to concede this time.

709
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,693
I'm begging you. Please.

710
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,321
This is so childish.
I can't listen to this anymore.

711
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,573
What is this about?

712
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,783
Concede what? Did you find
money on the ground?

713
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,369
-It's between me and him.
-You don't need to know.

714
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,205
Unbelievable. Whatever!

715
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,541
One of you give up. I don't care who!

716
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,334
Just do it now.

717
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,461
Who's going to give in? Do it now!

718
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:33,671
We can't give in!

719
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,756
We can't be caught like sitting ducks!

720
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:39,719
How dare they come in and snatch
our theme park away from us?

721
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,137
It's time for a good old fight!

722
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,973
Let's go!

723
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,685
ALL RESIDENTS OF NAMDAL-RI
WELCOME THE THEME PARK

724
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,278
Are you bored?

725
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,156
Why do you keep hovering around me?

726
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:03,034
I'm just here

727
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,077
on business.

728
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:07,121
Right, the AS theme park.

729
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,040
Have you gone insane?

730
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:15,546
You think I'd let AS Group
come into my hometown?

731
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,800
You want my parents to look at it
and be forever distressed by it?

732
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:20,843
No.

733
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,803
That's not it.

734
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,099
I wasn't planning on it either.

735
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,310
But it just happened.

736
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:30,770
And…

737
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,481
it just so happened…

738
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,692
Why would you do this
for such a stupid reason?

739
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:38,194
Why over such a petty thing?

740
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:41,364
Even after what I did to you,

741
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,533
you can't stand people badmouthing me?

742
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,662
Why is that a petty reason?

743
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,664
It is a good reason.

744
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,542
And you didn't do anything to me.

745
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:56,754
You did it, because you had to.

746
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,133
And if you hadn't,
I would've done it myself.

747
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:07,807
Anyway,

748
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,685
a theme park in Samdal-ri
will never happen.

749
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:14,313
Look, don't be like that and…

750
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,406
They're here! It's the Jomnyeo Squad!

751
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,323
What?

752
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,409
You…

753
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,368
Damn it!

754
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,787
What…

755
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,789
So…

756
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,766
This is bad.

757
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,312
-Why are you fighting?
-Hold on.

758
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:56,272
Hurry!

759
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,857
-When we were young…
-Hey!

760
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,608
-And when we played marbles--
-Hey!

761
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,485
-Come with us now.
-What do you two want?

762
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,154
The Jomnyeo Squad's here.

763
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,488
-What?
-The Jomnyeo Squad?

764
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,327
Let's go!

765
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,038
Let's go!

766
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,459
The Jomnyeo Squad? But why?

767
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,836
No idea. It's the first time in ten years.

768
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,547
-Come on out.
-Wait. It happened ten years ago too?

769
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,633
-You weren't here.
-Mom went to Namdal-ri for horned turbans.

770
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:27,845
-She was the reason 20 years ago too.
-My mom's off limits. Let's go!

771
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,513
-Hey, hurry.
-What? Okay.

772
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,474
What's going on?

773
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,228
Hey, you two cut it out
and hurry up! My goodness!

774
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,115
Take a good look

775
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,868
at what you've done.

776
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:04,882
They're here.

777
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,843
What… What's going on?

778
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,430
This is really bad.

779
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:16,268
Excuse me. Shouldn't we call the cops?

780
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,437
They're not gangsters. Why call the cops…

781
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,356
Hey!

782
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,068
I mean, what?

783
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,779
Sam-dal, don't get involved
in the fight. Okay?

784
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,406
I think I know what it's about.

785
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,825
The theme park.

786
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,243
But that's in Namdal-ri.

787
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,161
-Is it coming to Samdal-ri?
-I'm for it.

788
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,956
Are you okay with it?

789
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,666
-Gyeong-tae.
-Yes?

790
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,918
You want a few years off your life?

791
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,336
No, I think I'm fine.

792
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,380
Aren't haenyeos about community?

793
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,591
They are. That's the Samdal-ri community
and the Namdal-ri community.

794
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:15,327
What do you want to fight about this time?

795
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,788
It seems you're doing this
more and more often.

796
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:23,836
Didn't you consider that you do
something stupid more and more often?

797
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,213
Is this about the theme park?

798
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,258
We don't need it. Just take it.

799
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:33,846
You always say one thing,
but do something else behind our backs!

800
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,473
Your daughter didn't receive any alimony,

801
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:39,518
so are you trying steal some money
from AS with the theme park?

802
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:42,855
Or are you trying to set up a store
for Sam-dal after her career failed?

803
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,273
What did you say?

804
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:49,028
How dare you utter my daughter's name
with that filthy mouth, you witch?

805
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,571
What did you call me?

806
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,823
A witch?

807
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,283
That's right, a witch!

808
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,328
-Hey!
-Hey!

809
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,537
Mom!

810
00:49:58,621 --> 00:49:59,747
-Hey, hurry.
-Mom!

811
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,109
Stop!

812
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,281
Stop!

813
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,200
Please stop!

814
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:19,159
Stop!

815
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:22,871
At this rate, we're all going to die!

816
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,574
-Hey.
-Yes?

817
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,327
You saw what happened.
You still want to go through with it?

818
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,580
Go to Namdal-ri and apologize right now.

819
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,123
Build your theme park there.

820
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:11,962
I'm doing this to stop Mother from diving.

821
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:19,928
What?

822
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,891
It's dangerous for someone
with arrhythmia to go diving.

823
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,352
If a theme park is built here,

824
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,729
she won't have to dive anymore.

825
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,692
How do you know about that?

826
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,447
It's atrial fibrillation.

827
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:40,491
Arrhythmia.

828
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,746
It won't affect her much
if she takes medication regularly,

829
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:49,124
but it's very dangerous
because she keeps diving.

830
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:53,087
It's like an underwater time-bomb.

831
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,964
If the theme park is built here,

832
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,717
she won't have to dive for work.

833
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:02,513
The waters will become a tourist area,
so she'll be prevented from diving.

834
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:03,806
And the compensation

835
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,976
will be as good as a pension.

836
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:14,024
So you brought the theme park project
over here for my mom?

837
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:21,698
You paid for her hospital bill too?

838
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,453
Why would you…

839
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:29,748
What are you doing?

840
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,626
We're not family anymore.
Why would you care about my mom?

841
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:35,170
I'm sorry, Jeon Dae-yeong,

842
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,756
but you seem to keep forgetting something.

843
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,678
Have you forgotten
about your brother and mother?

844
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,763
Just doing this will get you in trouble!

845
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,058
I don't care anymore.

846
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,310
Stop being so immature.

847
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,146
You're on your own.

848
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:57,484
I don't want anything from you!

849
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,571
Just accept my intentions.

850
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:05,784
This is the only way
to stop your mother from diving.

851
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,705
I'll help you.

852
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:22,217
-Right.
-Goodness.

853
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:24,094
-Those Namdal-ri scoundrels.
-Jeez.

854
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:27,264
They pulled all my hair out.

855
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,265
Goodness.

856
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,601
Theme park, my foot.

857
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,769
-Even if trucks came, I won't let them in.
-Gosh,

858
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:36,231
Goodness. Are you okay, Ms. Ko?

859
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:40,777
You just got out of the hospital.
I can't believe this is happening.

860
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:41,904
Exactly.

861
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:47,743
But if a theme park is built here,
won't things get easier for us?

862
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,746
I mean, the compensation is huge

863
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,540
so isn't that why those scoundrels
are fighting for it?

864
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:54,750
Are you crazy?

865
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,045
You want to live comfortably
with that money after selling off the sea?

866
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,129
Goodness.

867
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,799
I mean, Ms. Ko is ill.

868
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:05,928
Everyone's telling her to stop diving.

869
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,389
Well, I do think about that too.

870
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,520
I stay up all night worrying
you'll have another accident.

871
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:15,729
Right?

872
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,773
I'm worried about that too.

873
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,316
That's enough.

874
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,778
I'll never allow it.

875
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:26,156
It's up to us to protect the sea.

876
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,535
If we allow such changes,
what will become of this land?

877
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,872
If I die, I'd rather die in the sea.

878
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,876
I'm the sea, and the sea is me.

879
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:41,880
So don't worry about me.

880
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:09,992
Why…

881
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,579
Why am I getting butterflies?

882
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,543
Why do you
keep getting butterflies, Sam-dal?

883
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,378
Why do you keep…

884
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,637
What are you going to do?

885
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,099
He gives you butterflies,

886
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:36,768
so what are you going to do?

887
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,901
Sam-dal, are you done showering?

888
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,613
Why are you taking so long?

889
00:56:57,873 --> 00:56:59,875
What are you doing here?

890
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,003
Me? I was waiting for you.
Are you done showering?

891
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:04,671
What?

892
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,089
Are you trying to come in? Why?

893
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,342
No, I'm not coming in.

894
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,259
Hurry on out.

895
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:12,387
We're supposed to
take pictures in the evening.

896
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:15,474
Honestly, I'm just doing my job right now.

897
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,683
Hurry up. We're late.

898
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,352
Right.

899
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:22,564
Can we just go another day?

900
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,524
Another day, okay? Bye.

901
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:25,943
-Wait.
-What is it?

902
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,945
It can't wait. It's today or never.

903
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:33,492
Please, just leave me alone.

904
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,161
Please, I'm begging you.

905
00:57:39,081 --> 00:57:40,290
Let's go.

906
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:53,470
Sam-dal, how long are you
going to be cold like that?

907
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,598
You'll know when we get there
why it has to be today.

908
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,185
You don't listen to a word I say.

909
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,187
You don't even care.

910
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,731
Because you don't look me
in the eyes when you speak.

911
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:12,614
By the way, I saw your bags
in the hideout.

912
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:13,699
Why are they there?

913
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:14,783
Well…

914
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:16,702
I moved out.

915
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:19,079
What?

916
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:23,125
It just happened. I've moved out for now.

917
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,501
But…

918
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,586
Why would you move out?

919
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,422
Is it because of me…

920
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,301
Because of you what?

921
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:35,762
Nothing.

922
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:48,608
My daughter is pretty today as always.
My baby, my love.

923
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:00,162
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY WEEK WITH FRIENDS

924
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,459
THIS PLACE IS LIKE HEAVEN

925
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:11,882
HAPPY IN PARIS

926
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,853
Life isn't all about money, you know?

927
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:30,192
A lot of good things in life
can't be bought, you boomer!

928
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,410
Goodness.

929
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:45,540
What is this doing here?

930
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:03,517
Ha-yul, what are you doing?

931
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,061
I'm looking at the stars.

932
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,022
I'm bored. Play with me.

933
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:12,067
You should look too.

934
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:13,985
The stars?

935
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:15,821
Fine, I'll look at the stars.

936
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:17,447
Let's see.

937
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,204
-Mom.
-Yeah?

938
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,500
What does the Big Dipper look like?

939
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,294
The Big Dipper?

940
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:33,255
I don't know.

941
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,677
You didn't pay attention
in school, did you?

942
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,514
I didn't. Just you wait.

943
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,559
I'll find the Big Dipper for you. Hold on.

944
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,686
Big Dipper…

945
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,146
-This?
-Yeah.

946
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:51,898
Let's see.

947
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:54,985
It looks like that one.

948
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,363
Wait. Isn't it the one next to it?

949
01:00:59,948 --> 01:01:01,783
-The ladle-shaped one.
-This one?

950
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:03,118
Yeah.

951
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:06,997
No, that one looks too much
like a question mark.

952
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,542
I think that's the correct one.

953
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,668
Are you sure?

954
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,379
Or maybe not?

955
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,048
I don't know.

956
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,267
Ha-yul.

957
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:28,852
Yes?

958
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:32,564
Did you hide Grandma's diving suit?

959
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,317
Yes.

960
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,863
Why?

961
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:43,867
Were you worried about her going diving?

962
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,788
Because she might have another accident?

963
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:50,999
Yeah.

964
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:58,089
You really like Grandma a lot.

965
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,134
How adorable!

966
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:03,720
Who told you to be so adorable?

967
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,891
Mom, I can't breathe.

968
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:13,063
-Ha-yul.
-Yes?

969
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,941
Should we go see
the dolphins you like tomorrow?

970
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:19,653
Namchun doesn't come by these days.

971
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,529
No, not that.

972
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,698
You can see them in the aquarium.

973
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,117
Really?

974
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:27,702
Of course.

975
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:33,083
How about we go see the dolphins
and then eat tteokbokki tomorrow?

976
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:35,669
You can have the tteokbokki yourself

977
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:37,253
Why?

978
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,172
Let's eat together.

979
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:40,966
I don't want to.

980
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:51,393
JEJU DOLPHIN CENTER

981
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:06,950
My daughter is pretty today as always.
My baby, my love.

982
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:25,552
I was more than willing
to give them all up.

983
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,887
Jin-dal said that.

984
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:30,098
And then,

985
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,811
she left me!

986
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,273
I can

987
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:44,654
live without money too!

988
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,643
Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.

989
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:18,188
A Samdal-ri theme park presentation
for residents.

990
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,648
I'll wait in front
of the convenience store.

991
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:22,734
Let's work together.

992
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,490
Jeez, it's cold.

993
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:39,250
So why did you move out?

994
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,171
Drink this.

995
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,259
You brought coffee?

996
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:49,761
Yes.

997
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,304
Don't you remember?

998
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,933
We used to always drink coffee
while looking at the stars.

999
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,198
It's good.

1000
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,451
It tastes better
in a nice place like this, right?

1001
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:18,039
Am I supposed to take photos of the stars?

1002
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:20,250
No.

1003
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,751
The squid boats then?

1004
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,962
Squid boats are so common in Jeju.

1005
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,340
No. Just be patient.

1006
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:31,427
I don't know when it might appear,
so keep your eyes wide open and wait.

1007
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:37,100
Let's see.

1008
01:06:16,014 --> 01:06:17,182
Sam-dal.

1009
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:21,060
Yeah?

1010
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,397
Why did you think I moved out…

1011
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,818
because of you?

1012
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,238
What?

1013
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:34,282
You asked me if it was because of you.

1014
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,244
Well, it's just because…

1015
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:44,042
What do you think was the reason…

1016
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,296
why we broke up?

1017
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:50,798
What?

1018
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,927
Why did we break up back then?

1019
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,665
Why bring up the past after all this time?

1020
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,085
You told me

1021
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:30,296
that an ex is worse than a stranger,

1022
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:34,759
because even if time passed,
you'd never forget why you broke up.

1023
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:40,473
Right.

1024
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,434
But even if we can't forget the reason,

1025
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:48,106
but we could still overcome it.

1026
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:52,235
What do you mean?

1027
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,238
The memories of our love…

1028
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,286
are stronger
than the reason for our breakup.

1029
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:01,804
I know

1030
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:05,683
that whatever the reason
for our breakup was…

1031
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:09,145
I can overcome all of it.

1032
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:01,239
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

1033
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:30,518
We just fell asleep. By accident.

1034
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,270
You're going to eat
ramyeon again today?

1035
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:33,688
No, I'm not.

1036
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:36,023
Didn't we agree to speak
casually at that bar?

1037
01:10:36,107 --> 01:10:37,734
When did I agree to that?

1038
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:40,736
Mom, she's…

1039
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,656
I won't tolerate anyone
who mistreats our daughters anymore.

1040
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,241
-Did you upload this?
-Yeah

1041
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:48,202
I just stomped on her to make sure
she'd never get up again.

1042
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:51,164
-They're here.
-How dare you set foot here?

1043
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,624
Yong-pil is serving his punishment.

1044
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:54,751
For what?

1045
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,253
Would you return to Seoul?

1046
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:02,758
