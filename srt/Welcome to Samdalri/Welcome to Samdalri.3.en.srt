00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:40,999
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

2
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,461
JEJU INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
2005

3
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,004
Thank you.

4
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:47,047
-Thank you.
-Here.

5
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,965
Thanks.

6
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,509
-Aren't you too old to use a student ID?
-What?

7
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:54,137
I've been reminding you
to bring your ID card for the past month.

8
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,807
This is my ID card. What's wrong with it?

9
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,519
I was a student up until a month ago.
That's why I brought it.

10
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,687
Jeez.

11
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:03,272
Hold on.

12
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,150
Hi, Mom.

13
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,945
We just got our tickets.

14
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,863
Yong-pil? He's with me. Don't worry.

15
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,074
Mom, I won't let her out of my sight!

16
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,242
Don't you worry!

17
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,662
I still don't get it. I'm the one
who wants to make it in Seoul,

18
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,123
so why does he need to come with me?

19
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,374
Hello? Mom?

20
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,334
She hung up on me.

21
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,504
You better treat me well
if you want to live in Seoul a while.

22
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,841
Treat me bad,
and I'll return to Jeju right away.

23
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,093
Then, you'll also have to come back home--

24
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,261
You little…

25
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,887
-Darn it.
-Hey, Cho Sam-dal.

26
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:39,308
Didn't I tell you to call me
Cho Eun-hye, not Cho Sam-dal?

27
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,519
Hey, Cho Sam-dal.

28
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,396
You need a motion sickness patch.

29
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,939
I don't have motion sickness.

30
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:46,898
-Hey.
-What?

31
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,401
I'm changing my name
to Eun-hye, so be careful.

32
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,652
Why change it?

33
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,529
"Cho Sam-dal" sounds perfect.

34
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,240
Why would you change it? All done.

35
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,283
I need one--

36
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:57,743
What was that?

37
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,787
-What? Our tickets!
-Hey!

38
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,248
-Darn it!
-Hey!

39
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,501
Grab him! I got you, you scumbag!

40
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:10,297
-Did you know it was me?
-What on earth?

41
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,509
-Did you have to do that?
-Jeez, what are you doing?

42
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:17,137
-Darn it.
-Darn it. What's wrong with you?

43
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,848
What's your problem? I can't believe you!

44
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,559
-Jeez.
-Why are you doing this?

45
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,810
Give our tickets back.

46
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,687
-Give them back.
-Give them.

47
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,523
What are you doing here?
Are you seeing us off?

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,361
-Are you insane? Of course not.
-He's crazy.

49
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:34,029
Hey, we're also…

50
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,946
-going.
-Going.

51
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,409
-You could've just said that.
-You run so fast.

52
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,577
-All right.
-Unbelievable.

53
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,167
-You think they're from Seoul?
-Gangnam?

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,085
Gangnam?

55
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,379
Gyeong-tae, what are you doing?

56
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,464
Your mom paid for two years
of your cram school.

57
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,548
Exactly.

58
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,968
I mean, what kind of mom does that?

59
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:01,014
She thinks I won't pass next year.
There's no trust in our family.

60
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,307
I'll just go to Seoul

61
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,060
and open up my own shop.

62
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,438
And how will you do that?
You need money to open one.

63
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,481
I have money.

64
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,608
No, you don't.

65
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,818
Don't tell anyone.

66
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,737
I found it in my mom's wardrobe.

67
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,907
-What? You crazy bastard!
-You crazy bastard!

68
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,409
-Hey!
-You're a crazy bastard!

69
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,078
How could you steal
your mom's hard-earned money?

70
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,079
Get off the plane.

71
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,163
-Get off.
-Get off!

72
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:29,042
It's too dangerous to get off now.
And I didn't steal it. I'm borrowing it.

73
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,129
-She just doesn't know that.
-That's stealing, you lunatic.

74
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,173
-Didn't you get into Tamra University?
-What?

75
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,218
I'll never become
a cartoonist if I go to college.

76
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,513
Everyone makes their debut
after a few years in Seoul.

77
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,599
Enough. You know we're inseparable
like the Power Rangers.

78
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,185
We should make it together,
not just you two.

79
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,354
That Power Rangers stuff was ages ago.

80
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,065
One of us isn't here anyway.

81
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,526
Right. Well, leave Sang-do out of this.

82
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,988
He can't fly out.
He doesn't have money for a ticket.

83
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,490
What kind of family
can't afford a plane ticket?

84
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,091
Whatever. We can take care of him
once we're successful.

85
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:22,137
Let's go to Seoul,
enjoy the night view from Namsan Mountain,

86
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,639
and live our best lives. Let's go!

87
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,562
All right.

88
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,815
Let's do it!

89
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,400
Let's go!

90
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,444
Let's go, Captain!

91
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:43,033
Like migratory birds setting out in winter
on a long journey to find warmth,

92
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,203
protected by our youth
as our armor, we ventured out

93
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,121
in pursuit of our dreams.

94
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,332
We need to book train tickets in advance.

95
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,249
It's free.

96
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,084
You idiot. It's not free.

97
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,462
Nothing's free in Seoul.

98
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,468
HANKOOK UNIVERSITY

99
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:02,469
Excuse me.

100
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,431
Excuse me.

101
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,391
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

102
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,109
Wait. Hold on!

103
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,407
-Two steaks for table seven.
-Okay.

104
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,077
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

105
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,870
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

106
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,288
Are you ready to order?

107
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,207
Two carbonaras, please.

108
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,124
All right.

109
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,676
This isn't your house. Get up right now.

110
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,720
-How much did you drink?
-I feel sick.

111
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,099
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

112
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,642
Take care, ma'am.

113
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,936
Your mom is here to pick you up.

114
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,354
I have to go to round three.

115
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,814
No.

116
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,359
Hey.

117
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,279
I have to go to the next spot.

118
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,369
It's alive.

119
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,129
JEJU MACKEREL

120
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,897
Happy birthday, son!

121
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,025
Have some of your favorite, mackerel.

122
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,576
Don't worry. I'm having some right now.

123
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,878
JEJU INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
2011

124
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,670
The migratory birds pursued
their youthful dreams,

125
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,381
but they eventually flew back…

126
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,261
to Jeju, their home.

127
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:59,437
EPISODE 3 - LIKE WILD BIRDS,
SOARING, DREAMING, DESCENDING

128
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,581
I pity you, Eun-hye.

129
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,085
No one asked how you're doing.

130
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,975
Why would you search
every nook and cranny?

131
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,685
I barely have any time to sleep.

132
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,437
If we do it, we should do it right.

133
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,273
-I'm sick and tired of this.
-I'm exhausted.

134
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:48,653
By the way,

135
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,032
Sam-dal wouldn't do
anything stupid, right?

136
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,242
Like what?

137
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,412
I mean, everyone's criticizing her now.

138
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,873
-What if she goes to the Han River and--
-Hey!

139
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,166
Hey!

140
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,292
Don't be ridiculous.

141
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,003
How could you say that?

142
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,463
She wouldn't do that.

143
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,840
Of course not.

144
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,303
Hold on. What is she doing?

145
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,269
What? No, wait.

146
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,257
Cho Yong-pil!

147
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,419
Yong-pil, are you okay?

148
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,506
Are you all right?

149
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,385
Wake up. Are you okay?

150
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,636
Hey, are you all right?

151
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,430
Why would you jump in there
when you can't even swim?

152
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,558
-Darn it.
-Are you okay?

153
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,101
Get up.

154
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,352
-Get up.
-No.

155
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,063
What's wrong?

156
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,064
-Go.
-What's this?

157
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,149
Go.

158
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,276
Are you hurt?

159
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,735
Hey, let me see.

160
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,028
-No, I--
-Open your eyes.

161
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,990
No, you should go. Go home.

162
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,159
How could I leave you here like this?

163
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,077
Are you sure you're okay?

164
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,831
Come on, look at me.
At least open your eyes, will you?

165
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,915
No, I--

166
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,543
I can't open my eyes.

167
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,044
Your eyes won't open?

168
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,005
Oh, no. I should call 911.

169
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,090
No, don't call them.

170
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,383
-Don't call them.
-Then?

171
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,051
-It's not that…
-Yeah?

172
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,387
-my eyes won't open.
-Okay.

173
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,097
I can't open them.

174
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,473
Why not?

175
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,020
What did you say?

176
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,773
What are… What?

177
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,443
Because I'm mortified right now!

178
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,696
I'm so embarrassed! Damn it!

179
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,115
It's mortifying. Just go home.

180
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,867
This is mortifying.

181
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,869
I don't want to meet anyone right now.

182
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,287
This is so embarrassing.

183
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,586
-You're right…
-Yeah.

184
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,924
It can be embarrassing. I understand.

185
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,260
Sorry.

186
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,013
Just go.

187
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,692
Are you sure

188
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,695
you're really okay?

189
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:18,613
Go.

190
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,783
Okay. I'll get going first.

191
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,911
Get up and take care
of yourself, okay? I'll go then.

192
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,829
Okay. I'm leaving.

193
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,456
Bye.

194
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,137
Darn it.

195
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,014
Damn it, I'm so embarrassed.

196
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,642
How humiliating!

197
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,188
All because I leaned a bit
and lost my balance.

198
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,068
I almost died today.

199
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,445
Jeez, you startled me.

200
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,656
What? Why are you still here?

201
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,993
Sorry, I just had to give
something back to you.

202
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,619
What is it?

203
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,884
Don't do that!

204
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,970
This is what you did.

205
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,849
I can't believe it!

206
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,642
What was this supposed to be?

207
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,190
It's so hilarious.

208
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,664
-So when did you arrive?
-It's only temporary.

209
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,044
-I'm going back soon. I'm not staying.
-Right.

210
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:57,962
I see.

211
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,550
I mean, I thought you'd be curious
about why I was here.

212
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,180
I mean, you're visiting your family.

213
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,641
-I think that's a good enough reason.
-What?

214
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,437
Yeah. Right.

215
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,065
I'm just visiting my family, right?

216
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,196
-When are you going back?
-I'm not here because I failed.

217
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,659
I mean, just in case
you get the wrong idea.

218
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,036
It's not that at all.

219
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,957
So just don't tell the others I'm here.

220
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,834
I know.

221
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:40,713
You're not someone who'd run away
and come back home because you failed.

222
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:44,342
Of course not.
I would never run away. No way.

223
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,720
That's what my sisters would do though.

224
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,180
Right.

225
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:53,726
By the way,

226
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,355
I guess your sisters are back too.

227
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,899
-What?
-What?

228
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,360
Over there.

229
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,537
-Nice landing.
-Nice.

230
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,999
Why did they hide the beer outside?

231
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,669
They're here temporarily too, right?

232
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,088
Right.

233
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,382
Of course. We're going back soon.

234
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,550
It's only temporary.

235
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,676
Good night, then.

236
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,097
Hey, Sam-dal.

237
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,433
What does he want now?

238
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,686
Yeah? What's up?

239
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,693
Are you okay?

240
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,504
Sir, why would you pull out
when the photos are ready?

241
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,339
Please, be patient. And everything…

242
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,924
Ma'am, wait! Just a minute.

243
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,307

245
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,220
What do you mean?

246
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,682
Right. You must've seen
the articles about me.

247
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,393
Yes, I'm pretty popular these days.

248
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,604
But I'm fine. It's not a big deal.

249
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,688
Bye.

250
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,149
I'm freezing!

251
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,242
Gosh, it's so cold.

252
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,744
Sam-dal apparently
abused her power over her mentee,

253
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,663
and it has caused a great commotion.

254
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,385
Can you please get out?

255
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,805
Get out!

256
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,764
But…

257
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,480
Why did she just kick us out?

258
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:27,523
Well,

259
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,818
something annoying probably happened.

260
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,528
It's not "happened."

261
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,323
It's still happening to Aunt Sam-dal.

262
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,159
-You're right.
-Right.

263
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,163
Ha-yul, you're so smart.

264
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,372
Let's call it a night.

265
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,457
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

266
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,701
SAMDAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

267
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,078
Hey, it's Sam-dal!

268
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,499
Hey, Sam-dal.

269
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,709
Are you okay?

270
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,131
Why did you have to go
and provoke Jin-dal again?

271
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,885
Whatever. This is so annoying.

272
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,347
Are you okay?

273
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,185
-What's wrong?
-What?

274
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,105
Are you okay?

275
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,982
Are you okay?

276
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,195
Here.

277
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,697
Drink it.

278
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,423
Not again.

279
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,139
Not again.

280
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,641
Ms. Ko's at it again.

281
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,480
-The long johns marathon.
-Honey!

282
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,690
I'm sorry.

283
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,692
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

284
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,778
I just didn't want you to get hurt again.

285
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,532
Please put something on, at least.

286
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,746
Honey!

287
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,627
Si-yun.

288
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,921
Can I see the adiabatic curve
from three hours ago?

289
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,005
-Okay.
-Thanks.

290
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,014
PARIS MAGAZINE WORLD TOUR
IN KOREA HAS BEEN CANCELED

291
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,558
DUE TO CHO EUN-HYE'S
ABUSE OF POWER ALLEGATIONS

292
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,394
PEOPLE ONLINE
HAVE BEEN OUTRAGED BY HER ACTIONS

293
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,606
HER ABUSE OF POWER IS A DISGRACE
JUST DIE

294
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,193
I can't believe what people say
just because they're anonymous.

295
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,988
It looks like none of this
has been proven to be true either.

296
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,574
SHE SHOULD KILL HERSELF

297
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,341
It couldn't have been. No way.

298
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,267
Why are you here so early?

299
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,729
I gave the short-term forecast
to Forecaster Kang. It's for the meeting.

300
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,481
Hey.

301
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,067
You're going, right?

302
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,486
-Of course, I'm going home. I'm off today.
-Not that.

303
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,572
I mean headquarters.

304
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,993
Right. Goodness, headquarters.

305
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,452
By the way,

306
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,288
why haven't you thrown this away yet?

307
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,623
Are you planning to reuse it?

308
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,376
Gosh, you're thrifty.
I'm sure you'll be rich.

309
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,211
-You're the best.
-That little… Hey!

310
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,255
You said you wanted to go!

311
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,506
Were you mocking me?

312
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,717
Damn it.

313
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,844
CHO EUN-HYE'S PAST 15 YEARS
MY PERSON

314
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,151
I passed by Ms. Cho's house.
There still were a lot of reporters there.

315
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,112
They're relentless.

316
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:30,701
It was wise of her to go to Jeju.
I mean, it's not even close to dying down.

317
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,244
Tell me about it.

318
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,038
Gosh, these photos…

319
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,207
She worked like a dog
for years to prepare this.

320
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,500
CHO YONG-PIL

321
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,419
Eun-ju hasn't called you either, right?

322
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,505
No, she won't even pick up.

323
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,385
I'm dying to hear her side of the story.

324
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:52,014
Should we request an interview
with the reporters and defend Ms. Cho?

325
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,933
She explained it herself,
but it didn't get any attention.

326
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,560
They probably won't hear us out.

327
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,690
That guy is back.

328
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,496
We kept telling him
you never abused your power,

329
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,081
but he kept questioning us.

330
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,832
Maybe you just didn't realize it.

331
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,334
You're wrong.

332
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,336
Ms. Cho may be a bit intimidating,

333
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,421
but she genuinely cares about us.

334
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,131
I see.

335
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,841
So she's intimidating?

336
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,843
When is she like that?

337
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,429
Does she go around and yell at people?

338
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,181
I'm sure you've been scolded too.

339
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,641
When is she intimidating?

340
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,394
When we do something wrong.

341
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,356
Only a lunatic would scold
someone who's innocent.

342
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,737
He wasn't interested
in finding out who you really are.

343
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,865
It felt like he just came to hear
what he wanted to hear.

344
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,909
This is so unfair, Ms. Cho!

345
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,328
She's right! This is so unfair!

346
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,038
It's okay. Don't be upset.

347
00:24:58,664 --> 00:24:59,665
I'm all right.

348
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,836
Thank you for cleaning everything up.

349
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:09,174
For now, don't come in to work,
and let's see how this pans out.

350
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,926
Okay.

351
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,471
Make sure you don't skip your meals.

352
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,098
I won't. Bye.

353
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,072
BANG EUN-JU

354
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:34,283
Maybe.

355
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:47,254
The phone you called is turned off.
You'll be directed to voicemail.

356
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,217
Sam-dal!

357
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,096
-What was that?
-Hey, Sam-dal!

358
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,184
-Is that Yong-pil?
-Sam-dal!

359
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,560
Is he serious right now?

360
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,480
I told him not to let
people know I was here!

361
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,982
-Sam-dal!
-He's looking for Sam-dal, right?

362
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:11,028
Sam-dal!

363
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,241
What's going on?

364
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,037
Wasn't that Yong-pil's voice?

365
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,080
It couldn't have been.

366
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,250
Seriously?

367
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,726
Honey.

368
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,147
I can't believe you two.

369
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,358
What are you doing out here?

370
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,526
Goodness.

371
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:51,944
Honey!

372
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,990
-What was that about?
-Lie down.

373
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,452
Gosh, this is nice.

374
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,620
This is wonderful.

375
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,955
Goodness.

376
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,707
Sam-dal!

377
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,501
Sam-dal!

378
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,046
Darn it! That hurts! Why did you hit me?

379
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,464
What are you doing?

380
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:16,468
Are you letting everyone know I'm here?
I told you to keep it a secret!

381
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,178
I am keeping it a secret.

382
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,430
Is that what you call it?

383
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,224
What else do you think I'm doing?

384
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:23,642
How is this…

385
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,519
You're letting everyone know!

386
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,814
What the hell are you talking about?
Gosh, that hurts.

387
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:29,940
Hey, Sam-dal!

388
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,943
Hey!

389
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:34,778
Sam-dal!

390
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:35,988
Come here.

391
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,615
Where did you run off to
without your leash?

392
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,700
You little mutt.

393
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,661
You went to see Kkakkung
in Namdal-ri, didn't you?

394
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,623
Goodness, Sam-dal.

395
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,296
What kind of name is that for a dog?

396
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,508
It's raised here, so we named it Sam-dal.
What's wrong with that?

397
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,136
But that's my name.
Why did you give it the same name?

398
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,555
In that case, I have the same name
as that singer too.

399
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,599
But he's not a dog.

400
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,558
Change its name now.

401
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,560
I can't do that.

402
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,729
All the villagers raise it together.

403
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:12,357
Besides, even if I did change its name,
it wouldn't understand.

404
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:16,069
And you have different surnames.
You're "Cho," and that's "Dog."

405
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,487
Dog…

406
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,826
I should seriously change my name soon.

407
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,703
You still haven't changed it?

408
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,081
Doesn't it just happen
right away when you apply?

409
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,250
I don't know. They still won't let me.

410
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,419
Anyway, don't tell--

411
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,714
Fine. I won't tell anyone, so don't worry.

412
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:37,591
Hey, Yong-pil!

413
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,302
Sam-dal, what should we…

414
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,553
Where did she go?

415
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,773
-Is Sam-dal here?
-What?

416
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,818
There she is!

417
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,321
Goodness.

418
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,031
You little mutt.

419
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,491
Why is your face swollen?

420
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,743
Did you visit Kkakkung again?

421
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,912
Goodness, Sam-dal.

422
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,373
You can't resist those male dogs, can you?

423
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:10,958
That little…

424
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:11,917
-Hey.
-What?

425
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,669
You see that new article about Sam-dal?

426
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,171
-What?
-Apparently,

427
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:19,716
another article came out saying
her mentees were intimidated by her.

428
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,302
And everyone's busy writing hate comments.

429
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,888
Jeez. The garbage they write…

430
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:29,101
Gosh. I'm surprised
she hasn't returned to Jeju by now.

431
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,311
Hey.

432
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,522
-What?
-Where are you going?

433
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,149
Want to do this for me?

434
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,362
Sure, I'll throw them away.
Why do this all by yourself?

435
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,030
What's with you?

436
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,409
What?

437
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:53,667
Or maybe Sam-dal is already
hiding somewhere in Jeju.

438
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,502
Oh, my God! What's that?

439
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,215
What…

440
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:01,883
Hey.

441
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,553
-Excuse me.
-Come here.

442
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:09,433
-Hey, Gyeong-tae.
-What?

443
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,518
Long time no see. How have you been?

444
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:13,687
Hey, Sam-dal.

445
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,274
But why are you crouching
in a pile of trash?

446
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,316
Are you back?

447
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,736
No, I'm not. I was just passing by.

448
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,863
I popped by and then…

449
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,031
You popped by Jeju?

450
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,116
What I mean is, I'm only visiting.

451
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,534
See you around. Bye.

452
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,165
-Hey.
-What?

453
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,374
She's back, isn't she?

454
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,418
I guess she is.

455
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,128
-Hey, Sam-dal--
-Hey.

456
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,089
Where are you going?
She's gone. Why follow her?

457
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,384
What do you mean? That's Sam-dal.
Aren't you happy to see her?

458
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,054
Oh, right.
You might not be happy to see her.

459
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,138
Hold on.

460
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,099
Why aren't you surprised to see her?

461
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,851
What? I am surprised.

462
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,144
Did you already know?

463
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:57,230
No, I just found out.

464
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:01,026
-What? You're acting strange.
-What do you mean?

465
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,694
Are you two dating again--

466
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:04,905
Listen, you should just…

467
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,996
Just you wait and see.
I'll get you one day.

468
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:15,999
Man.

469
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:20,879
Hello? Hey, Sam-dal is here.

470
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,547
Not Sam-dal the dog. Cho Sam-dal.

471
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,717
What? Cho Sam-dal?

472
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,470
Cho Sam-dal is back?

473
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:37,646
The entire neighborhood will know
now that Gyeong-tae's found out.

474
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,232
Darn it.

475
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,155
Hey, Mom found out why we're here.

476
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,241
Hae-dal and I ran away to hide for now.

477
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,326
Come on.

478
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:04,214
I WANTED TO GIVE UP ON MY DREAM
BECAUSE OF CHO EUN-HYE'S ABUSE OF POWER

479
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:25,485
Cha Ha-yul, you shouldn't have taught
Grandma how to read the news online.

480
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:28,238
Mom, she deserves to know.

481
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:32,159
Why is everyone in this neighborhood
so eager to gossip about others?

482
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,910
Tell me about it.

483
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:38,081
By the way, Dad, why does Mom
run around in just her long johns?

484
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,792
You don't know? Even I know.

485
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,502
It's menopause.

486
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:45,172
They say it makes you
feel like your body's on fire.

487
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:48,341
That's not why, Aunt Jin-dal.

488
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,552
It's because she's fuming.

489
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,262
Who told you that?

490
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,180
Grandma did.

491
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,931
Once because of you,

492
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,058
and once because of you.

493
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,644
And this time, because of Aunt Sam-dal.

494
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:05,609
Why did all of you have to
come together and upset her?

495
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,403
It was teeming with reporters
outside our house, Dad.

496
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,238
They exposed our identities too.

497
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,824
They said Jin-dal was
the ex-wife of AS Group's CEO

498
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:15,160
and I was an unmarried mom.
They're bad-mouthing us.

499
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,161
An unmarried mom?

500
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,246
That's not true.

501
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,875
And so what if Jin-dal had married
into a rich businessman's family?

502
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:22,876
What's the problem?

503
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,795
They said Jin-dal exposed
how the rich abused their power

504
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,547
while her sister abused hers.

505
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,108
AS, A COMPANY THAT OPENS UP THE FUTURE

506
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,714
Is there anything else I could get you?

507
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,051
A glass of water, please.

508
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,844
Sure, sir.

509
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,689
Bring me my alcohol!

510
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,648
Please calm down.

511
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,108
-Should I break this?
-Calm down.

512
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,360
-Please calm down.
-Then, bring it to me now!

513
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:33,280
-What kind of first class is this?
-Please sit down.

514
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,116
-Please calm down.
-Bring it to me! Now!

515
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,326
-Bring it to me.
-Please sit down!

516
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,579
Damn it.

517
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,872
Who do you think you are?

518
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:43,957
Oh, no!

519
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,254
I'm restraining you
for breaching the Aviation Security Act.

520
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,672
Bring me the rope.

521
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,174
That hurts! Let me go!

522
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,643
Sir.

523
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,146
Sir?

524
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,357
Right.

525
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,359
Here's your water.

526
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,986
Okay. Thank you.

527
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,343
What should I tell her?

528
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:41,389
Why am I even worried?
I can just tell her it's not true.

529
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,851
I'm the victim here.

530
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:24,808
Mom.

531
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,770
Look, I just…

532
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,772
Let me explain what happened.

533
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,856
Hang these.

534
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,484
-What?
-Hang them out to dry.

535
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,654
Okay.

536
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,073
By the way, Mom--

537
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,826
Where does everyone disappear to
when I need their help?

538
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,153
Holy…

539
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:23,366
Jeez, I knew it.

540
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,410
Gyeong-tae, that son of a…

541
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,540
Are you sure she's back?
542

542
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,100
I'm positive.

543
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,127
We even said hi.

544
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,630
Didn't that door just open a bit?
I think it was Sam-dal.

545
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,508
Maybe she doesn't want to see us.

546
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:44,554
Don't be absurd! She was ecstatic
to see me. She said, "See you around."

547
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:49,100
That's your definition
of "ecstatic"? "See you around"?

548
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,687
Where is she?

549
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:56,316
I do want to see her since she's here.
It's been eight years.

550
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,610
This is all
because of that punk, Yong-pil.

551
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:02,363
Why did he have to date
and break up with his childhood friend?

552
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,115
She even cut ties with us too.

553
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:06,701
Yong-pil didn't break up
because he wanted to.

554
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,496
What would you know anyway?
You've never dated anyone.

555
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:10,872
Let's wait.

556
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,918
She said, "See you around."
So that means she wanted to see me again.

557
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:16,920
Does it?

558
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:29,516
Gosh. How is Gyeong-tae
still just as clueless?

559
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:36,397
I said I'd see him around.
So why did he follow me home?

560
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,691
Forget it. Let's just go.

561
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:41,820
Ms. Ko's started her long johns marathon.
It's not a good time.

562
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,739
You're the one who was eager to see her.

563
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,658
Of course, I want to see her.

564
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,160
But given the situation,

565
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,455
even I'd want to be left alone. Let's go.

566
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,415
But…

567
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,335
-Are you really leaving?
-Let's just have some beer.

568
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,631
Is she not home?

569
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,678
-It felt like she was about to come out.
-Forget it.

570
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,058
Hey, Sang-do!

571
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,686
Hey, Sam-dal is here!

572
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,321
Who's here?

573
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,364
Cho Sam-dal.

574
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,710
He's definitely not normal.

575
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,339
-No!
-Don't do it.

576
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,424
Jeez.

577
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:48,177
Sang-do!

578
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,682
-Did you just see my son?
-Did something just pass by?

579
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,641
Time?

580
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:56,769
Give me a gae!

581
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,688
-You got a gae!
-You got a gae!

582
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,481
-I actually got it.
-You got a gae!

583
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,948
I shouldn't have come to Jeju.

584
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,160
Gosh, this blanket is cold.

585
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,038
Come on.

586
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:15,955
Jeez.

587
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:17,749
Darn it.

588
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,629
Are they still out there?

589
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,264
They're gone.

590
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,017
Can I please

591
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,728
have some peace until I leave?

592
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,318
I have a feeling Gyeong-tae will be back.

593
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,402
Darn it.

594
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,863
This is all because of Yong-pil.

595
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,828
Darn it!

596
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:10,343
Oh, my gosh!

597
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,136
Who are you?

598
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,597
Oh, my gosh! Who are you?

599
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:19,977
Is that you,

600
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:21,979
Sam-dal?

601
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:28,945
Bu…

602
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:30,947
Sang-do?

603
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,510
Hey!

604
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,234
You're really back.

605
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,415
You startled me!

606
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,469
You heard it too.
She said, "See you around."

607
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,429
It means she wants to see us again.

608
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,433
Hey, will you ever grow up?

609
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,559
What do you…

610
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,519
Hey, Sang-do! Come here.

611
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:45,730
You went to visit Sam-dal, right?
Did you see her?

612
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,775
-Yeah.
-What? You really did?

613
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:49,817
Yeah.

614
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,444
I told you we should've waited!

615
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,279
We're the only ones who didn't see her!

616
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,656
-Jeez.
-Did you meet her too, Yong-pil?

617
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:58,409
Yeah, we just ran into each other.

618
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,077
I see.

619
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,915
Are you okay?

620
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,256
What?

621
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,802
What? Of course, I'm okay.

622
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,888
I really am. Stop overreacting.

623
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,431
He's right.

624
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,975
It's been eight years.
It'd be weird if he wasn't.

625
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,228
-Are you leaving?
-Yeah.

626
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,729
Okay. Let's go.

627
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,606
-Where are you going?
-To see Sam-dal.

628
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,149
-Come on.
-You weirdo!

629
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,151
-Hey.
-Give it a rest!

630
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,737
The whole town is
already talking about her.

631
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:37,365
Why do you want to go
and make it harder on her?

632
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,408
-He's right.
-What did I do?

633
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,787
It's because I know she's struggling.
Imagine how she must feel.

634
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,124
I should go and bother her
so she won't think about it.

635
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,208
-What?
-Okay?

636
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,835
You all went through it too.

637
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,419
Each time one of us came back,

638
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:53,631
everyone would gossip
about how we were failures.

639
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,049
It must be worse for her.

640
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,551
So stop yelling at me.

641
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:01,722
He left by himself.

642
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,099
-Sit back down.
-Come here.

643
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,268
Let's just drink. Tell him to come back.

644
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,439
Jeez, where in the world
does all that beer go?

645
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,400
Gosh, they drink so much.

646
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,295
Is Ms. Ko not coming today?

647
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,254
-What?
-Goodness.

648
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,465
She's in no state to come out here.
Her long johns marathon is on.

649
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,676
-Goodness.
-You're right.

650
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,678
So is that article true?

651
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,596
-What?
-What?

652
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,808
Did Sam-dal really abuse her powers?

653
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:46,767
I don't know.

654
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,769
It's not like we can ask.

655
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:51,439
Sam-dal's not the type to do that though.

656
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,357
-Right.
-Right.

657
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,778
Even if you can figure out the deep sea,

658
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,531
they say you can't know
how person really is.

659
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,494
If it's true,
then my heart will break for Ms. Ko.

660
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:07,121
To imagine Eun-u being guilty

661
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,249
of doing something like that
to someone else…

662
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:11,167
-Gosh.
-Goodness!

663
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,084
Oh, dear.

664
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:14,045
Anyway, if Sam-dal returns too,

665
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:17,131
it means all the kids who went
to Seoul failed and came back.

666
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,674
-You're right.
-You're right.

667
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:19,842
-You're right.
-Yeah.

668
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,730
What if Sam-dal ends up returning too?

669
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:36,442
If she does, Ms. Ko
will be extremely devastated.

670
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,903
After what happened
to Jin-dal and Hae-dal,

671
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:40,863
Sam-dal was all she could rely on.

672
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,239
So if she returns too,

673
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:45,242
Ms. Ko would be too ashamed
to show her face around town.

674
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,577
Could it be true?

675
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,747
That Sam-dal bullied her mentee
and drove her to suicide?

676
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,083
It was an attempted suicide! Attempted!

677
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:53,834
Suicide--

678
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:59,757
Seeing how there's so much fuss about it,
there must be some truth to it.

679
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,014
Goodness.

680
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:09,934
Never mind.

681
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,329
This darn neighborhood.

682
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,290
Who said I'm a failure?
683

683
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,938
CHEON CHUNG-GI

684
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,863
Why are you ignoring my calls?

685
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,782
Is it true?
Did you really abuse your power?

686
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:07,700
Tell me!

687
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,785
Why are you so curious about it?

688
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,705
If only you had put this effort
into being productive.

689
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,055
SAMDAL-RI'S MASCOT
SAM-DAL'S HOUSE

690
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,892
What are you looking at?

691
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,478
You think it's funny I failed?

692
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,562
Go away.

693
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,148
Stop staring at me. Just go.

694
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,691
Don't look at me. Go.

695
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:44,862
What are you doing?

696
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,491
You startled me.

697
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,910
Why are you taking it out on poor Sam-dal?

698
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:51,827
Why?

699
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,247
What? I didn't take it out on her.

700
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:58,125
And why are you
all covered up like this? Take this off.

701
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:02,046
You'll stand out more
if you do that in our neighborhood.

702
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,340
Mind your own business and leave me alone.

703
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,886
This town won't give me any time
to be alone with my thoughts.

704
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:13,808
Hey. Look…

705
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,895
Being alone with your thoughts

706
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:22,024
won't give you an answer
if it's not there in the first place.

707
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,362
You'll only think of doing
something foolish.

708
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,322
Hey, Sam-dal.

709
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:31,325
We all go through
our own hardships in life.

710
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:35,496
If you think of doing something foolish
every time that happens…

711
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,541
What do you mean by
"think of doing something foolish"?

712
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,088
Last night at the water,

713
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,299
I knew you were going to jump.

714
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,262
Hey! Have you gone insane?

715
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,930
I'm not crazy.

716
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,974
It's not what you think it was.

717
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,392
What? You weren't?

718
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,353
Weren't you trying to jump in yesterday?

719
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,731
No! I was just stumbling
because I was drunk.

720
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:06,652
How could I drown in that shallow water?
You know I'm a good swimmer.

721
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:10,197
Hey, I know. I know fully well. Okay?

722
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:12,324
I know you would never do that.

723
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:13,909
Of course, I do.

724
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:17,913
But given your current situation,
I just thought I'd talk about it.

725
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:22,042
So why did you drink alone by the water
when you know it's dangerous?

726
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,086
-What's it to you?
-Get up. Let's go.

727
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,629
Go where?

728
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:28,465
The guys are drinking beer.
Let's go and join them.

729
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,261
No one's supposed to know I'm here.

730
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,556
Even this dog knows that you're here.

731
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,272
You said you didn't fail.

732
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,524
Of course, I didn't.

733
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,027
So let's go then.

734
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,822
Come on, you can tell them yourself.

735
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:53,824
Come on.

736
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,451
I'm going now.

737
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,672
Does it hurt your pride

738
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,717
to see your friends again?

739
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:17,389
It doesn't matter why you came back.

740
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:20,935
We're just happy to see our friend again.

741
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,978
I told you I'm not back for good.

742
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,063
You know what?

743
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:26,357
I'm glad.

744
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:32,488
I'm glad to see you.

745
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,371
I was curious

746
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,706
about how you'd been doing.

747
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,126
How have you been?

748
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:56,929
Given our history,

749
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,099
we can't be that happy to see each other

750
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:03,477
or wonder how we're doing.

751
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,231
Well, that's true.

752
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:08,983
Right.

753
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,203
What else do you want to know?

754
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,667
Is there anything else you want to ask me?

755
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,089
No.

756
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,262
I see. It's fine if there isn't.

757
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:55,863
You know how Sam-dal is.
She has a strong sense of pride.

758
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,949
-She probably doesn't want to see us.
-I know that.

759
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:03,829
But I thought
maybe we could be of help to her.

760
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,540
Let's be frank.
We've all been failures before.

761
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,544
-Maybe not as bad as Sam-dal, but still.
-Jeez.

762
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,004
But you know what?

763
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:16,091
A part of me is honestly glad
she failed and came back.

764
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:17,676
-Don't you agree?
-Hey!

765
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,763
Sam-dal.

766
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,390
Cho Sam-dal.

767
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,434
-What Gyeong-tae meant--
-It must be nice.

768
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,438
I'm so relieved to know
you're happy that I failed.

769
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,482
-Sam-dal--
-What he meant was--

770
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,109
You must've wanted to see me fail
and come back so badly.

771
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,446
That's not what I meant.

772
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:38,697
But unfortunately for you,

773
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,910
I'm seriously only here for a moment.

774
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,538
I didn't fail.

775
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,582
I'm not a failure.

776
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:54,213
I'm so sick and tired of this town.

777
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,090
-Hey, wait…
-Wait, Sam-dal!

778
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:00,803
Damn it.

779
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,349
Hey, Sam-dal.

780
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,809
Sam-dal, wait.

781
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,726
Let's talk…

782
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:14,400
Hey, Gyeong-tae.

783
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,030
You're happy she failed
and came back? Are you serious?

784
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:23,033
I didn't mean I was happy that she failed.

785
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:25,619
I just meant I've missed her so much,

786
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,163
and I was just happy to see her back here.

787
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:30,874
I just meant I was happy
to see her. That's all.

788
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,751
Then, you should've said that…

789
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:33,836
Gosh.

790
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,004
Jeez.

791
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,172
Seriously…

792
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,258
Wait up!

793
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:42,928
Sam-dal, hold on.

794
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,807
Hey, Sam-dal.
It's just a misunderstanding.

795
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,185
Really? A misunderstanding?

796
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:54,356
You're no different from them.

797
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:58,444
I know you're happy too.
You're only curious about my failure.

798
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:00,612
What are you talking about?

799
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,781
You're curious about how I've been doing?

800
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,534
You know dozens of news articles
about me pop up each day.

801
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,036
So you're seriously curious
about how I've been?

802
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,458
What do you think?
Does it look like I'm doing well?

803
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:15,836
What? Friends?

804
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,964
If you were truly my friends,

805
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:23,218
you wouldn't have cared
that I failed and came back.

806
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:26,763
You would've wondered

807
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:30,976
if someone really tried
to kill herself because of me.

808
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,271
And why I'd do
such a thing if it was true.

809
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,065
You should've been curious about that.

810
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:42,988
People I don't need to explain myself to
keep asking questions.

811
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:47,159
But people I want to talk to
won't even hear me out.

812
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:49,369
No one will ask me anything.

813
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:53,248
Do you admit
that you've been abusing Bang?

814
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:56,126
-No, I never did that.
-Why did you do it?

815
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,545
You're mistaken. I never did such a thing.

816
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,713
Is this news article true?

817
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,715
Is it true?
Did you really abuse your power?

818
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,091
Is this true?

819
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:04,927
Mom.

820
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:06,720
Look, I just…

821
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:09,056
Let me explain what happened.

822
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:09,973
Hang these.

823
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,768
-What?
-Hang them out to dry.

824
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:17,022
By the way, Mom--

825
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,234
What else do you want to know?

826
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:24,196
Is there anything else you want to ask me?

827
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:26,490
No.

828
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,575
It's not true.

829
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,202
I really didn't do it!

830
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,163
What they say on the news isn't true.

831
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:36,750
I didn't do it. I'm really innocent!

832
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,961
So why won't you ask me?

833
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,005
Why aren't you asking me anything?

834
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:46,385
I'm innocent. I didn't do it!

835
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,862
Are you okay?

836
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,617
Are you sure?

837
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:14,621
Are you certain
that our daughter is innocent?

838
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,331
Of course.

839
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,876
She just had an argument
because of her ex-boyfriend.

840
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:25,716
You should've just asked her
instead of worrying about it.

841
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,802
I was too afraid to ask.

842
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,223
What if she admitted to really doing it?

843
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:35,392
You're her mother.

844
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:37,185
You know her.

845
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:41,565
She's been away for 18 years,
so how would I know?

846
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,404
I shouldn't have let her go
to the mainland.

847
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,208
I'm innocent!

848
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,879
So why won't you ask me anything?

849
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,757
Why won't any of you ask me?

850
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,218
I'm innocent. I didn't do it!

851
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:12,721
I'm really innocent.

852
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,556
Why won't you ask me?

853
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,600
Why won't anyone ask me?

854
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,935
I'm truly innocent.

855
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:23,398
WELCOME TO SAMDAL-RI

856
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:29,196
Don't worry. I'm having some right now.

857
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,783
-Jeez, that smell!
-Man, it stinks!

858
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,243
Look at all the cup noodles.
What are you up to?

859
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:38,330
-Lock your door, will you? Seriously.
-Why are the lights off?

860
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,123
Cup noodles again? Give me a bite.

861
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,249
-Don't eat that.
-Hey!

862
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,377
Don't eat that. I'm making seaweed soup.

863
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,503
What are you doing here?

864
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,296
What do you think? We came to eat.

865
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,674
Check this out. Jeju mackerel.

866
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,802
-That's really expensive!
-So I could only buy one.

867
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,054
Why is it so expensive?
It's cheap in Jeju.

868
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,640
We should've bought one more.
This isn't enough.

869
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,058
-Eun-u!
-Don't eat this.

870
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,768
-What?
-What's wrong?

871
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:04,690
I think this will last you
until your next birthday.

872
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,441
How much seaweed did you put in?

873
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,777
-All of it.
-Don't you know seaweed?

874
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,446
You can't put in
the whole pack like ramyeon.

875
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,282
-It's my first time cooking it!
-It's steamed seaweed.

876
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,410
Take it easy, guys.

877
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,121
The seaweed will feel bad.

878
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,332
-Hey, you spat on me.
-Sorry.

879
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:23,792
-Disgusting.
-The ramyeon…

880
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,210
-Just eat a lot.
-Let's try it.

881
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:28,672
-Happy birthday, dear Cha Eun-u
-Happy birthday, dear Cha Eun-u

882
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:31,216
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

883
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,968
Blow them out!

884
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,557
By the way, did you get any presents?

885
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,891
No.

886
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:41,518
-Really?
-What is it?

887
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:42,769
-What?
-What did you get?

888
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,355
What? No way!
Did you really get him something?

889
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,816
-What's that?
-What's gotten into you?

890
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,447
You idiot.

891
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,448
It's for you.

892
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,574
-Jeez.
-You ass.

893
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:57,200
He definitely stole this too.

894
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,744
This is illegal, you bastard.

895
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:01,204
Where did you steal this from?
Was it Korail?

896
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:03,832
I didn't steal it.
This was so hard to find.

897
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:07,502
All the other rolls were used up.
It's hard to find one that's this big.

898
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:10,547
I'm broke. I can't buy this.
Are you nuts? Hope you like it.

899
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,258
Man, this will hurt my butt.

900
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:16,052
-Damn it.
-Eun-u, please. Don't be disgusting.

901
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,637
-He has sensitive skin.
-Damn it!

902
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,514
That's gross. Don't say that.

903
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:22,976
Who's that?

904
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:25,729
-Are you expecting someone?
-No, I'm not.

905
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,022
Open it.

906
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,358
-Check this out.
-Holy cow, Sang-do!

907
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:31,485
How many are there?

908
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,904
To the poor hillbilly living in Seoul.

909
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,072
These are all for you.

910
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,281
-Right.
-Happy birthday.

911
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:37,365
Hey, Sang-do!

912
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:38,992
-Thanks!
-Sang-do!

913
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,827
-We got the fish!
-How are you doing?

914
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,454
How many did you send?

915
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,289
-How are you doing?
-What about abalone?

916
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,874
Jeju has a variety of seafood.

917
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,084
How are you, Sang-do?

918
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,336
How's working
with the night view of Seoul?

919
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,838
Don't mention night views.
It makes me puke.

920
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,341
Don't mention that.
My customer puked and I cleaned it.

921
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,551
Don't mention customers.
I didn't find a job yet.

922
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:57,844
Don't mention jobs.

923
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:00,222
I'm sick of my part-time job.
Hey, Sang-do.

924
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,974
Should I just go back
to Jeju tomorrow? It sucks here.

925
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:04,768
Are you bragging right now?

926
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:05,936
How is this bragging?

927
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,563
Living in Seoul is unbearable.

928
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,982
It may be hard for them,
but I love it here.

929
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,318
-You have my address, right?
-Be quiet.

930
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,986
Sang-do, you should come too!

931
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,196
Hurry on up!

932
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,198
-Let's hang out!
-Thanks for the fish!

933
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,146
Don't follow me, you jerks.

934
01:00:49,271 --> 01:00:51,523
-Do you remember what happened last night?
-No.

935
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,525
-Tell them yourself.
-Where are we going?

936
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,403
-Mom.
-That girl named Bang Eun-ju…

937
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,613
-What?
-Mom!

938
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:01,283
Didn't it seem obvious
you shouldn't answer it?

939
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,325
-Excuse me.
-What the…

940
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,452
-Why is he even your boyfriend?
-What?

941
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:07,080
A project came in from Magazine X.

942
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:09,416
This must be
about something else. What is it?

943
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,126
I dumped you eight years ago?

944
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,461
-Go home. Hurry.
-You're the one who dumped me.

945
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:14,963
It doesn't matter.

946
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,006
Damn it.

947
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,549
This has turned into a mess.

948
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:23,013
