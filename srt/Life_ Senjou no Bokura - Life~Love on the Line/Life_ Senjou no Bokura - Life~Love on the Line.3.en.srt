That's why it's scary and lonely and why we get lost.

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,230
If, from the start, you could

109
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,490
find a line that you can connect to,

I think a lot of things will change from here on out.

133
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,690
So I wanted to talk to you properly about it.

- Shall we search for it?

That's what I had believed.

158

But ever since that day...

159
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,380
A feeling of unease has been constantly following me around.

160
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,160
I'm home.

Are you still going to work?

163

Sorry, I want to stick with doing this.

164
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,430
I've finally decided on the topic after all.

165
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,880
I'm going to bed then.

166
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,670
At that time, more so than when we first met, that mature smile

167
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,350
was really pretty, I thought.

168
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,210
However, in the next moment...

169
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,640
I imagined a world without Yuki.

170
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,590
And I thought that I would slip off

171
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,570
from my feet, and it was scary.

172
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,810
Would Yuki always be

173
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,610
together with me from here on out?

174
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,140
I understand.

175
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,060
Okay, in front of the station.

176
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,220
Okay, see you.

177
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,750
- Your parents?
- Yeah.

178
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,160
They keep pestering me with stuff like, "Are you not getting married?"

179
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,630
And stuff like, "I want to see my grandchildren's faces!"

180
