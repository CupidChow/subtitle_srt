00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,020
Apparently, it was just created recently.

181
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,020
Oh, it's Nishi-kun. What are you doing?

182
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,840
I'm waiting for someone.

183
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,700
Here?

184
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,790
If you're waiting for someone, why don't you meet them at a cafe or something?

185
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,270
It has to be here.

186
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,590
This line is connected to that person.

187
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,610
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

188
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,640
What was the meaning of that?

189
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,190
Well, anyway, about that green soybean flavored thing.

190
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,040
- The tapioca?
- Yeah.

191
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,820
Why are you turning there?

192
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,690
If you go that direction, we can't meet!

193
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,390
I'm sorry.

194
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,050
I'm ashamed to look you in the face.

195
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,670
Don't screw around!

196
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,290
You! The other day, you...

197
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,000
He truly is mad after all.

198
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,430
But I'm happy just to see his face.

199
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,170
I'm a horrible person!

200
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,180
The other day, you fell from the line. Right!?

201
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,400
That's what he's mad about!?

202
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,730
You definitely died right there!

203
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,320
You were definitely skewered by those pointy ice things!

204
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,860
And you left me behind...

205
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,590
Don't stray from the line so selfishly!

206
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,630
You don't understand the problem at all.

207
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,300
What's the problem?

208
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:41,270
I... um....

209
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,380
I look at you with a strange gaze.

210
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,450
And if I'm with you again, I might put you through another unpleasant memory.

211
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,090
That's not a problem at all!

212
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,050
The problem is...

213
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,230
whether you want to meet me or not!

214
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,430
I want to meet you!

215
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,270
How about you?

216
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,890
- Huh?
- How about you!?

217
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,960
Me, too.

218
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,130
I want to meet you.

219
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,510
Then there's no problem.

220
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,670
Yeah.

221
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,390
There's no problem.

222
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,990
Right?

223
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,490
- But...
- But?

224
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:55,890
If possible, I want to walk at your side from here on out.

225
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,880
Then...

226
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,900
We need to think of a new setting.

227
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,590
Right!

228
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,660
The same setting for both of us.

229
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,070
What would be good?

230
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,150
A desert or something?

231
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,170
A desert?

232
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,920
- When it comes to deserts, what comes to mind?
- Camels!

233
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,030
- That's good!
- The two of us are riding camels.

234
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,550
