Do you want to go eat something?

I was just thinking the same thing!

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,980
I was thinking of catching a really fat salmon in the Alaskan outdoors!

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,510
We would grill it on an open fire. And if we ate it while watching the aurora,

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,440
it would be so delicious!

13

I mean, are you living life honestly with yourself?

However, when I imagine things I always come to my senses and give up.

In order not to fail... It's too late if

- Nishi-kun, don't you often walk along lines?
- Yeah.

83
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,910

Can't you see that I'm troubled by this?

So he really didn't like it after all.

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,310
You're always too selfish!

114
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,900
The other day, you came to me outside so suddenly...

115
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,940
I need to be mentally prepared for these things!

116
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,590
Um... So it's not that you don't like it?

117
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:41,810
I don't like this sudden feeling at all!

118
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,920
I didn't mean that.

119
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,170
So basically,

120
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,650

But when I see your face,

126
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,970
I can't hold myself back.

127

I'm going to visit some fellow alumni next week.

183
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,420
I don't know where I should start from, on these decisions.

184
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,460
Salary and working conditions, and your companies future prospects in the business world.

185
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,070
If they seem like an earnest company.

186
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,310
Also, if your profession has any connections to them or not.

187
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,780
Why don't you think about it like that?

188
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,110
That's a wake-up call...

189
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,580
Huh, why?

190
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,940
The things you say sound like an old man.

191
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,080
You started smoking, too.

192
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,330
Hey now.

193
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,810
I can't take this anymore!

194
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,130
Oh.

195
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,860
Let's have you feel more like a working adult!

196
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,920
- We're going now!
- No, it's fine.

197
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,440
Stand up!

198
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:35,060
Pull yourself together, man!

199
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,870
I don't want to go!

200
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,070
All these formal suits are all the same, aren't they?

201
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,730
Just try it on!

202
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,980
It's important to get the right size!

203
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,210
Right?

204
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,510
That's correct!

205
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,660
- That's what's important?
- Yeah.

206
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,760
Is this fine?

207
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,560
That suits you quite well.

208
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,670
I'll adjust the hems.

209
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,290
Akira, how is it?

210
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,770
Well, it's really nice.

211
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,490
- Really?
- Yeah.

212
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,570
I mean...

213
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,480
It's kind of sexy.

214
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,590
This should do it.

215
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,140
You know,

216
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,100
I can't imagine it.

217
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,650
What?

218
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,930
Myself, as a working adult.

219
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,910
I have nothing I'm good at and nothing I want to do.

220
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,630
Everyone else has a goal they're running towards.

221
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,500
I'm the only one who's unsure.

222
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,940
I end up just following everyone else.

223
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,890
And if I just end up going somewhere because of that...

224
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,040
Would that be okay?

225
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,010
I really badly want to become a working adult.

226
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,560
I guess that...

227
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,230
your sense is just worlds apart from mine.

228
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,370
If we become working adults, we can live together, can't we?

229
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,410
Then we can be together every day.

230
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,800
That's my goal.

231
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,440
Everyone has their own reasons for working.

232
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,810
I see.

233
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,380
We can live together.

234
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,660
Yeah, you don't want to?

235
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,460
No, I do.

236
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:24,390
- We all have our reasons for working, right?
- Shut up!

237
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,830
I'm back.

238
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,150
I'm so tired.

239
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:01,740
Welcome back, I just finished making our meal.

240
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,140
Awesome!

241
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,330
Are you hungry?

242
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,560
- I'm starving!
- Here's a big serving of stir-fried vegetables and meat.

243
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,290
That looks delicious!

244
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,880
It smells great!

245
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,530
Thank you!

246
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,300
It's great!
[Twenty-five]

247
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,420
Yummy!

248
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,510
Delicious!

249
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,620
- Amazing!
- You're praising yourself.

250
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,850
As expected of me!

251

[Akari Corporation]

252
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,190
Hey, Itou!

253
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,400
- Can I have a moment?
- Yes.

254
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,270
This is Ms. Shiraishi, who has joined the company part way through the year.

255
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,540
Please take care of me.

256
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,290
I like you, please go out with me.

257
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:57,310
If there's anything you don't understand, please ask him.

258
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,510
- Okay.
- I'm counting on you!

259
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,880
Okay.

260
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,980
Please treat me kindly.

261
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
Me as well.

262
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:30,690
Itou-kun, I like you.

263
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,000
I found some gold in the desert!

264
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,370
Let's break up.

265
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:46,840
♫ Under the waning moon ♫

266
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:51,040
♫ Dense fog wanders ♫

267
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,860
Don't look at me!

268
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,300
♫ The maze-like ♫

269
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,730
♫ Night is dawning ♫

270
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,490
♫ The silent but tumultuous scenery  ♫

271
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:09,390
♫ is printed on my memory ♫

272
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:14,360
♫ I just want to know ♫

273
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,460
♫ the meaning of the breath ♫

274
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,990
♫ The lonely sky and the silent blue ♫

275
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,350
♫ took my breath away ♫

276
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,000
♫ Nowhere to go ♫

277
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,870
I found some gold in the desert!

278
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:35,470
♫ The rain falls violently ♫

279
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,270
♫ The place to return hasn’t changed since long ago ♫

280
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,880
Ever since that day...

281
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,160
A feeling of unease has been constantly following me around.

282
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,480
It's a mistake.
