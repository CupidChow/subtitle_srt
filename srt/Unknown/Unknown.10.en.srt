San Pang, I'm grateful to you

229
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,960
for taking care of our family
since we were kids.

230
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,420
Rent has been cheap,

231
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,170
and you've never raised it.

257
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,040
I heard everything
outside the clinic that day.

258
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,170
You'll have to go

259
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,080
to a major hospital for check-ups.

You know how your brother is.

263

He's as stubborn as a mule.

264
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,960
We all thought it was nothing

265
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,540
after those three boxing matches.

266
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,670
But it seemed there was a small issue.

There was a blood clot
pressing on the optic nerve.

268
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,540
The doctor suggested surgery,

269
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,790
but do you think Wei Qian would agree?

270
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,170
He was adamant
about not getting it done.

That's why Dr. Lin was in a hurry

277
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,290
to get him checked out
at a major hospital.

278

00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,210

374
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,670

♪It doesn't matter anyway♪

376
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,540

377
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,420
We eat.

378

We're fine.

389
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,830
San Pang?

390
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,170
I have to leave for work.

391
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,420
I'll be back tomorrow at noon.

392
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,420
I need you to take over for me.

393
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,420
Who is it?

394
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,420
Wei Qian.

395
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,170
Open the door.

396
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,040
Don't you have a key?

397
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,670
My hands are full.

398
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,420
Just letting you know.

399
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
Lili isn't home.

400
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,040
Oh.

401
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,170
Well, that's not a problem.

402
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:58,460
I came to have a drink with you.

403
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,330
It's been a long time
since we drank together.

404
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,580
Come on.

405
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,540
Look what I bought.

406
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,540
Your favorite Chinese sticky rice.

407
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,040
Right?

408
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,170
Let's see. What do we have here?

409
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,790
Stir-fried chicken gizzard.

410
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,710
Wow! This is diced chicken.

411
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,080
Yuan.

412
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,670
That... That's mine.

413
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,580
My brother can't have beer

414
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,920
or greasy food.

415
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,920
But I can.

416
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,670
Have a salad.

417
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,580
Did you buy those for me

418
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,580
or for him to throw away?

419
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,040
He wouldn't have done that

420
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,040
if he didn't care about you.

421
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,420
Yuan

422
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,670
can't bear to leave you alone.

423
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,420
Before I had Yuan leave the country,

424
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,170
I had been thinking

425
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,710
I was doing the right thing for you two.

426
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,460
But seriously,

427
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,580
be honest,

428
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,710
did you feel empty

429
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,420
when Yuan was away?

430
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,080
Let me tell you something.

431
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,670
When Lili and I first got together,

432
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,460
I...

433
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,290
Hear me out.

434
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,920
I've struggled too.

435
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,040
I...

436
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,830
I always wondered,

437
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,210
what happiness could I bring her?

438
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,710
Was I doing the right thing?

439
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,040
How could I face you?

440
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,790
And then...

441
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,420
I felt it wasn't right.

442
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,580
Life is too short.

443
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,040
Getting hung up over it for years,

444
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,540
would it be worth all the time lost?

445
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,040
Who's been good to me?

446
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,170
Who put me before themselves?

447
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,290
A lot of things are only
between you and Yuan.

448
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,540
Unless you really have something
against being with a guy,

449
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,420
Yuan's the only one

450
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,080
who will be by your side,
no matter what.

451
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,670
Are you really not going

452
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,170
to confront it?

453
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,290
San Pang.

454
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,460
Do you know...

455
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,460
Do you know what my biggest wish

456
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,170
in life is?

457
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,210
My biggest wish in life

458
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,830
is for them to be happy.

459
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,920
Mine is the same.

460
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,290
I just want them

461
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,330
to grow up healthy and happy,

462
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,040
because I'm their big brother.

463
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,540
We grew up together.

464
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,540
You think I don't know
how hard life's been on you?

465
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,040
But you know that Yuan's feelings

466
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,670
for you are different.

467
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,080
We've tried everything.

468
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,330
We even sent him abroad for years.

469
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,420
You were miserable every day.

470
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,790
You love him,

471
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,080
and he loves you.

472
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,290
Even if you're not together,

473
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,290
he'll be sad

474
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,420
to see you sad.

475
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,790
I'm scared, you know?

476
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,540
You haven't even tried.

477
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,790
What are you scared of?

478
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,290
You know he went
to find Le by himself that day?

479
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,670
I know.

480
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,420
He was surrounded
and beaten by six people,

481
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,170
and in the end,

482
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,080
they pointed a gun at...

483
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,790
Heck, you...

484
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,790
You're telling me that now?

485
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,210
Then, you...

486
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,920
Right now, you...

487
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,290
So, you've lost...

488
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,920
So, this isn't a decision
I can make so lightly.

489
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,670
I have to consider the future.

490
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,290
Do you want him to have a future

491
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,420

you might not want all that I've given,

hearing it firsthand

523
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,040
still hurts a little.

00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,830
I'll be fine. I just need some time.

00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,170
I didn't mean it that way.

526
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,040
Then what do you mean?

I can't really figure out

528
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,790
if it is love

529
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,040
or something else
that my feelings for you are.

530
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,040
Is it the love of a brother?

531
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,670
Can we really turn it
into romantic love?

532
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,710
I don't know.

533
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,830
Yes.

534
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,790
All I know is I can't live without you.

535
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,290
Four years later, you came back.

536
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,170
I saw your letter of last words.

537
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,420
That's when I started to feel scared.

538
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,330
I'm terrified.

539
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,830
What if you had no chance to come back?

540
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,290
I don't know what I would do.

541
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,170
Wei Qian,

542
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,040
I've told you.

543
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,670
I can sum up my life

544
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,120
with two words, Wei Qian.

545
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,540
But I'm not making you
take responsibility for me.

546
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,170
Did you come after me
because you feel guilty,

547
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,170
or because you care?

548
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,790
I really don't know.

549
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,290
You don't need to know.

550
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,420
It's always been my problem.

551
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,670
Going home with you.

552
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,290
Getting attached to you.

553

00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,540
