Why did you get together with him?

193
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,210
Why can't I?

194
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,000
San Pang has been protecting me
and treating me well

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,920
since I was little.

196
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,750
I like him.

197
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,710
Let go!

198
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,000
Like?

199
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,920
Do you know what that word means?

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,960
Xiong.

201
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,420
Did you know about this?

202
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,500
Yuan.

203
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,670
Of course, we just knew about this

204
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,710
like you.

205
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,670
We're just as shocked
and angry as you are.

206
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,380
You two are really…

207
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:46,880
You should have told your brother

208
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,250
about this first.

209
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:48,920
Right?

210
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,630
Yes.

211
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,540
Young people have their own ideas.

212
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,080
They have the freedom
to choose who they love, right?

213
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,670
They...

214
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,920
Your sister has a boyfriend now.

215
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,880
You can start a relationship too.

216
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,920
That beauty...

217
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,790
Beauty something...

218
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,500
Feng Ning.

219
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,210
Right, Feng Ning.

220
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,460
"Ning Feng Jia Ren", right?

221
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,290
Xiong.

222
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,250
My brother has me to take care of him.

223
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,290
Right. See? You two have each other.

224
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,420
They're together.

225
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,130
All good, right?

226
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,630
It's all fair.

227
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,500
Right.

228
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,630
All right.

229
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,040
I'm always the last to know anyway.

230
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,750
Great.

231
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,040
- Wei Qian.
- Qian...

232
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,080
Wei Qian...

233
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,420
Qian...

234
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,000
What should we do?

235
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,290
Please help us.

236
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,290
Come on. Talk to him for us?

237
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,290
OK, first, you guys...

238
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:36,920
Listen.

239
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,630
Put away all the knives,

240
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,960
toothpicks, cotton swabs,

241
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,040
and everything dangerous

242
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,130
in the house.

243
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,790
I'll get the knives.

244
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,540
OK? Hurry up.

245
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,420
And the dessert forks too.

246
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,540
- What should we do?
- Wei Zhiyuan.

247
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,250
We're so dead. How can you still laugh?

248
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,170
San Pang, what are you doing?

249
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,380
Stop laughing!

250
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,170
Why are you holding those?

251
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:55,790
I don't know where to put them.

252
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,130
Are you turning that into a panpipe?

253
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:57,920
Are you going to blow them?

254
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,210
Get rid of them!

255
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,420
Is the garbage truck coming today?

256
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,790
Why are you guys still standing around?
Put everything away.

257
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,210
Stop laughing.

258
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,390
Get a move on!

259
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,810
Put the knives away.

260
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,630
Lili and I are together.

261
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,380
Who is it?

262
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,830
It's me.

263
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,750
Just come in.

264
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,210
Since when did you start knocking?

265
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,250
So, you're used to me
directly coming into your room?

266
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,710
What's this got to do
with whether I'm used to it?

267
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,080
Why are you here?

268
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,790
Still mad at Lili?

269
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,500
You guys are all grown up now.

270
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,790
You can do whatever you want.

271
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,000
What's the use of me being mad?

272
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,040
Qian.

273
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,920
Have you ever thought

274
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,960
that we can't accept changes

275
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,380
because we're too used
to the way things were?

276
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,540
Just like how you're used to Lili

277
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,960
being your younger sister
who hasn't grown up,

278
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,290
and me being the little brother

279
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,920
you always protect.

280
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,540
So?

281
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,630
Nothing.

282
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,040
I just want to say

283
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,880
I'm happy

284
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,750
to be back home.

285
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,960
Good night, Wei Qian.

286
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,710
Wei Qian.

287
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,580
Do you have a minute?

288
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,250
Do you want to talk?

289
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,000
No.

290
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,380
Still busy?

291
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,040
I can wait for you.

292
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,290
I'll give you a ride home.

293
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,580
No need.

294
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
All right, then.

295
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,710
I'll take my leave

296
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,380
then.

297
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,670
See you tomorrow, San Pang.

298
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,540
See you tomorrow.

299
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
I'm off.

300
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,830
Take care.

301
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,540
Got it.

302
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,290
Wei Qian, come to my office.

303
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,580
Take a seat.

304
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,790
Still mad?

305
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,540
How old are you?

306
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,630
Sometimes you just can't help it

307
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,580
if you like someone.

308
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,830
Don't you understand that?

309
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,960
Why are you angry?

310
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,670
What if it was your sister?

311
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,250
I'm mad.

312
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,250
I'm mad that they kept it from me.

313
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,460
If you had let me know ahead of time,

314
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,420
maybe I'd throw a few punches

315
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,710
and that'd be it.

316
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,170
Maybe.

317
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,710
Instead of what I saw...

318
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,960
The hickeys?

319
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,080
Your sister is an adult.

320
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,170
She knows what she wants.

321
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,040
Even if you think they're wrong,

322
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,290
you should talk to them about it.

323
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,750
You're her brother.

324
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,290
Has this ever happened to you?

325
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,130
Your friend getting together
with your sister.

326
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,460
And you're the last to know.

327
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,830
I give up.

328
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,250
You do have a temper.

329
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,920
My friends only ask me out to eat,

330
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,710
so I'm going to eat now.

331
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,380
Think about it.

332
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,040
Also,

333
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,290
why are you still here at this hour?

334
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,920
There hasn't been too much
to deal with lately.

335
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
Why won't you go home?

336
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,500
All right, I'll let you think about it

337
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,750
on your own, OK?

338
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,580
And please, when you leave,

339
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,880
turn off the power

340
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,210
and remember to lock the door.

341
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:23,960
If you're going to sleep here,

342
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,960
don't sleep on my couch.

343
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,710
It will be all right.

344
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,670
You can't even handle this little thing?

345
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,290
All right.

346
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,630
Qian.

347
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:09,830
What is it?

348
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,330
There's an issue

349
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,580
with my game programme.

350
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,290
Take a look at it for me.

351
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,490
[Fragrant Restaurant]

352
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,170
Qian.

353
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,130
Perfect timing.

354
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,380
Be my taste tester.

355
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,710
How is it?

356
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,250
Not bad.

357
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,580
I'll do it myself.

358
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,040
Is it that good?

359
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,210
There's a little bit left.

360
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,000
OK.

361
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,710
All clean.

362
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,790
I'm going to work.

363
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,920
Wait.

364
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,460
What?

365
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,670
There.

366
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,920
Thanks.

367
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,500
Take care.

368
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,880
It's already been a week.

369
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,540
Why is Qian still upset?

370
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,460
I even asked Fei

371
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,500
if Qian needed to work late today.

372
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,080
She said no.

373
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,130
I even made

374
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,040
all of Qian's favourites.

375
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,920
Why isn't he back yet?

376
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,790
Oh,

377
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,880
you know how he is.

378
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,330
He doesn't take it
the soft way or the hard way.

379
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,290
You'll just have to wait
for him to cool off.

380
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,630
The fried rice is a little salty.

381
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,000
Is it? I think it's good.

382
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,790
There are eggshells

383
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,630
in it.

384
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,330
Really?

385
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,880
It's OK. Eggshells are nutritious.

386
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,460
What about this?

387
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,580
This isn't fully cooked.

388
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,330
It's not?

389
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,710
Fine. Don't eat it.

390
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,500
All you do is complain.

391
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,540
I'll save it for Qian.

392
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,540
I wasn't complaining.

393
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,920
Suddenly, I feel like

394
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,290
I'm the female lead in a drama

395
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,540
where the parents
are against the relationship.

396
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,750
It's really sad.

397
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,920
I even get criticised for my cooking.

398
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,170
You're all grown up now.

399
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,670
It's normal for you
to have someone you like.

400
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,500
I'll tell you something.

401
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,250
I have someone I like too.

402
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,790
Really?

403
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,580
Who is it?

404
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Do I know the person?

405
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,000
Mhm.

406
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,630
You do.

407
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,630
Qian does too.

408
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,250
Qian, you're home.

409
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,420
Qian, don't stay mad.

410
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,330
Lili made your favourites.

411
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,420
At least San Pang treats you well.

412
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,830
Not like my friend,

413
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,540
he had a crush on someone for years,

414
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,920
and his crush just told him

415
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,420
he only saw him as a brother

416
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,000
and

417
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,250
brushed him off.

418
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,790
Why are you bringing that up?

419
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,750
It's annoying enough
that one of you is seeing someone.

420
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,830
Qian, are you not going to eat?

421
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,710
I made your favourites.

422
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,500
Lili.

423
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,420
Qian will come through.

424
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,750
After all,

425
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,710
it's not easy to find someone

426
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,330
you like.

427
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,540
I'll teach you how
to make fried rice next time.

428
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,540
OK?

429
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,710
OK...

430
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,250
It's good.

431
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,880
It's just a little salty.

432
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,250
He had a crush on someone for years,

433
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,750
and his crush just told him

434
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,630
he only saw him as a brother

435
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,540
and brushed him off.

436
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,380
I like being around you.

437
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,460
Qian.

438
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,420
No matter who I date,

439
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,540
I'll always be your one and only Lili.

440
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,710
Cherish what fate brought together.

441
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,210
Zhiyuan's finally home.

442
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,380
How about

443
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,750
the three of us go on a family trip

444
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,920
this weekend?

445
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,040
Qian.

446
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,920
I followed the script,

447
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,540
but Qian is still ignoring me.

448
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,630
[Qian]
Do you have time?

449
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,000
If you want, we'll go.

450
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,420
I invited him.

451
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,540
Why is he asking you

452
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,750
instead?

453
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,080
Because he didn't give birth to you,

454
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,880
but he adopted me.

455
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,330
And I was the one
who let you into our house.

456
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,210
Zhiyuan.

457
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,380
You've been away from home for so long.

458
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,500
Are you worried
you'll grow apart from us?

459
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,540
Of course.

460
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,290
But that's OK.

461
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,460
Have you ever heard
of behavioural psychology?

462
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,540
In behavioural psychology,

463
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,000
there's a 21-day effect.

464
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,790
I believe that if I persist,

465
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,080
I can fill in the gaps

466
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,920
over several 21-day cycles.

467
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,630
Wei Zhiyuan,

468
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,290
if you weren't my brother,

469
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,540
I would think

470
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,670
you're a charming man.

471
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,960
Liking someone

472
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,420
has nothing to do

473
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,670
with who they are.

474
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,830
Just like you never thought

475
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,580
you would like San Pang,

476
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,580
the guy

477
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,830
who changed your diapers
when you were little.

478
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,830
He never changed my diapers!

479
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,920
Qian, Zhiyuan, look! This is Milan!

480
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,290
[Lili]
Isn't it gorgeous?

481
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,920
The weather's great today.

482
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,420
Sorry

483
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,080
I couldn't join the family trip.

484
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,040
I'll bring back souvenirs.

485
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,960
Bye!

486
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,040
That girl...

487
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,920
She's the one who wanted this trip,

488
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,500
and she's the one who bailed.

489
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,040
Lili's abroad for work.

490
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,460
Maybe we should go next time?

491
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,790
Wouldn't be so rushed too.

492
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,960
But I'll be busy next week.

493
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,000
It's a pity to cancel.

494
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,330
That's true.

495
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,540
Since you don't want to go,

496
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,000
let's forget it.

497
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,830
Hold on.

498
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,830
I didn't say anything about cancelling.

499
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Get in the car.

500
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,670
Qian,

501
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,130
is there something you want me to do?

502
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,750
I want you to drive.

503
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,960
Step on the big rocks,

504
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,330
avoid the small ones.

505
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,420
Got it.

506
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,080
Be careful. It's slippery here.

507
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:39,830
I'll wait for you.

508
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,330
OK. Ready?

509
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,830
When did you get so good at fishing?

510
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,170
When I was abroad,

511
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,580
I used to go hiking
and fishing by myself.

512
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,960
I didn't feel lonely

513
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,960
when I imagined you were by my side.

514
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,630
Qian,

515
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,790
do you have something to say?

516
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,750
Yuan,

517
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,250
don't keep your feelings for me anymore.

518
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,210
Nothing will come of them.

519
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,330
What makes you think

520
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,750
I still have feelings for you?

521
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,460
Qian,

522
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,250
do you remember a long time ago

523
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,830
you asked me

524
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,920
what I would do if the person I liked

525
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,750
got married?

526
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,960
What would you do if the person you like

527
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,830
gets married one day?

528
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,080
I'd probably go crazy.

529
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,250
You said you'd go crazy.

530
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,630
My answer's changed.

531
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,000
During the time abroad,

532
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,460
I've been thinking a lot.

533
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,250
It doesn't matter

534
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,540
what stage the person I like

535
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,130
is at.

536
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,290
As long as he's happy,

537
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,710
even if he gets married,

538
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,960
has kids,

539
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,830
or gets old,

540
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,960
as long as he's still around,

541
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,830
and I can still see him

542
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,000
and be around him,

543
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,210
that's enough for me.

544
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,380
Wei Qian,

545
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,170
don't you like Wei Zhiyuan?

546
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,170
If you do,

547
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,170
is it only because we're brothers?

548
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,960
This thing about us,

549
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,920
is it that you don't want,

550
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,670
or you don't dare?

00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:11,360
