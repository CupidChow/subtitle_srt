00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,460
You mean everything to him too.

190
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,080
Are you sure you want to do this?

191
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,210
Yes.

192
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,920
Thanks.

193
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,920
I think that's all.

194
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,920
Let's end the meeting here.

195
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,290
All right. Good work, everyone.

196
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,540
- Good work.
- Thank you.

197
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,670
Why are you so clumsy today?

198
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,790
Yuan's only away for work
for a couple of days.

199
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,540
You're making a big deal out of it.

200
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,790
He always gives a day's notice
when he's travelling.

201
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,790
Never on short notice.

202
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,920
And the point is,
his phone is switched off

203
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,960
and he's not answering it.

204
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,790
You're acting like a wife
trying to catch her cheating husband.

205
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,960
He's an adult!

206
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,670
Mind your own business.

207
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,540
I haven't approved of you two yet.

208
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,540
Not yet?

209
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,830
You're on probation.

210
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,540
Understand?

211
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,040
OK.

212
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,080
How long have we known each other?

213
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,330
Can't believe I'm still on probation...

214
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,920
Lin Zuyuan!

215
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,040
Get up.

216
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,540
Get up!

217
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,290
Why weren't you picking up?

218
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,210
My clinic isn't open.

219
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,210
Can't I take a nap?

220
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,420
What did you text Yuan?

221
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,710
Who's back?

222
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,790
Le's back.

223
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,960
Why did you tell him?

224
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,420
He was worried
that Hu might do something.

225
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,170
So where is Yuan?

226
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,420
You were under Le.

227
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,540
You know where he is.

228
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,290
Who are you?

229
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,420
Is Le around?

230
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,540
Which gang are you from?

231
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,540
Are you mute?

232
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,540
I'm Wei Qian's brother.

233
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,920
Wei's Yuan?

234
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,290
Long time no see.

235
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,670
All grown up.

236
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,790
A handsome lad.

237
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,960
You're well-informed.

238
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,920
You showed up as soon as Le came back.

239
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,460
Just in time.

240
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,420
I'm looking for your brother too.

241
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,420
Ever since he showed up,

242
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,080
I've been nothing to Wang Junle.

243
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:26,070
[Heibaiqie Noodle Stand]

244
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,040
Le, as usual.

245
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,170
Don't be so aloof.

246
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,460
Get yourself a cup and join me.

247
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,040
Let's try this.

248
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,330
Your cooking skills
have gotten so much better.

249
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,330
Le.

250
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:51,920
Here.

251
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,080
Cheers!

252
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,920
[Hu]

253
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,210
Le.

254
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,710
Got a present for you.

255
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,460
Le.

256
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:37,790
Have a seat.

257
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,670
Haven't seen you in over ten years.

258
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,830
Looks like life's treating you well.

259
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,830
What about you, Le?

260
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,040
Have you been well?

261
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,830
I've been fine.

262
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,920
So-so.

263
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,290
I've been rather idle

264
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,040
these years abroad.

265
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,170
I've kept thinking about the past.

266
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,290
Before I realised,

267
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,040
I had gotten old.

268
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,920
I came back

269
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,580
to see how you guys

270
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,670
are doing.

271
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,170
I almost got you caught back then.

272
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,210
I'm sorry.

273
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,540
It's all right.

274
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,790
You weren't

275
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,920
the only reason.

276
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,170
I didn't sell drugs.

277
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,790
I got in their way.

278
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,210
The higher-ups had been meaning
to throw me under the bus.

279
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,040
It was okay.

280
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:18,920
You didn't come

281
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,670
just to apologise, did you?

282
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,830
Le,

283
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,290
can I ask a favour of you?

284
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,170
What favour?

285
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,040
Help me find Yuan.

286
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,790
Are you asking me to help you find him

287
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,040
or hand him back?

288
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,920
Oh, Wei Qian.

289
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,540
You don't trust me.

290
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,290
Long.

291
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Where's the thing?

292
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,170
Serious, Le?

293
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,290
Le.

294
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,330
Lighter.

295
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,420
Le, I'll go with you.

296
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,580
Take care of the shop.

297
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,790
Come on.

298
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,040
Haven't you already owed me enough?

299
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,920
One more won't make a difference.

300
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,540
Take care, Long.

301
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,290
Kill him!

302
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,920
Get him!

303
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,330
Yuan!

304
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,420
Yuan!

305
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,210
Qian!

306
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:51,960
Qian!

307
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,040
Cocky guy, huh?

308
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,290
Get him up.

309
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,210
Let him go.

310
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,920
I said, let him go.

311
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,290
Le!

312
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,670
How long are you going

313
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,040
to keep protecting them?

314
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,170
He's so cocky!

315
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,290
We fed them, we clothed them,

316
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,920
and they looked down on us!

317
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,170
Chirp, chirp, chirp.

318
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,080
Are you a bird?

319
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,540
I know

320
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,920
you've never gotten along with Wei Qian,

321
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,040
and you sure don't care about me either!

322
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,540
OK!

323
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,790
Everyone's here.

324
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,540
Party.

325
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,170
I have one bullet left

326
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,830
in this gun.

327
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:55,920
Let's make it big.

328
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,420
Russian roulette.

329
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,290
Party time.

330
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,170
Want to go first, Hu?

331
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,460
How about it?

332
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,170
No?

333
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,330
You?

334
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,920
Le, I'll go first!

335
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,040
Shut up, Wei Zhiyuan!

336
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,920
Le, I'll do it!

337
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,420
Shut up!

338
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:11,920
Listen...

339
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,290
No!

340
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,420
Shut up!

341
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,540
How can I refuse a request

342
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,290
from a man like that?

343
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,210
No!

344
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,540
No!

345
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,290
No!

346
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
No!

347
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,540
Don't do it...

348
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,710
Pass!

349
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,710
Safe.

350
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,420
Safe!

351
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,420
Who's next?

352
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,170
You?

353
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,790
Hu.

354
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,790
No one wants to play.

355
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,540
If no one wants to play, I'll play.

356
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,920
Safe!

357
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,670
Who's up next?

358
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,420
I know you're not playing.

359
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,670
I'll do it!

360
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,290
Let me do it!

361
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,920
I know it's your turn.

362
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,670
But we have to be fair.

363
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,210
Don't touch my brother!

364
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,420
Don't you touch my brother!

365
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,670
Le, let my brother go!

366
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:20,420
Le!

367
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,790
Shoot me!

368
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:22,920
Le...

369
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,040
Le, please!

370
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,670
Le, please let my brother go!

371
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,670
Le!

372
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,790
I'm sorry, Le! Please!

373
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,710
Le!

374
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,670
Game over.

375
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,330
We're done.

376
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,330
Let him go.

377
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,670
Le.

378
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,210
I said, let him go!

379
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,670
Yuan!

380
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,040
Let's go.

381
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,790
Let's go home.

382
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,420
We're going home.

383
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,670
Come on.

384
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,960
Wei Qian!

385
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,080
Let's never see each other again.

386
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,670
I'll pay you back

387
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,580
everything I owe you.

388
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,790
Wang Junle!

389
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,920
Why are you protecting him?

390
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,790
I wouldn't have been in this state

391
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,040
if it weren't for them!

392
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,790
Who gives you the right to let them go?

393
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,670
No bullets left?

394
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,330
No bullets.

395
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,330
Shoot.

396
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:54,960
Hu,

397
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,920
they'd risk their lives

398
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,170
for each other.

399
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,830
Can you?

400
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,540
You can't.

401
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,290
Leave a way out

402
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,210
for yourself.

403
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,080
Got it?

404
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,420
Anyone want a ride?

405
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,170
No?

406
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,330
I'm out, then.

407
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,290
Bye!

408

415
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,790
go to Le's turf by yourself?

I don't want you to get involved

Wei Zhiyuan.

421
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,420
Wei Zhiyuan, I'm asking you.

422
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,790
My second year abroad,

423
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,540
I went to the summit
with the hiking club

424
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,830
and got caught in an avalanche.

425
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,040
We got lost

426
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,210
and lost contact with the outside world.

427
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,670
When we were waiting for rescue

428
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,420
in the snow,

429
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,540
some people started writing
their last words.

430
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,330
That's when I realised that,

431
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,420
in the end,

432
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,670
life comes down to just a few things.

433
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,920
Where you come from,

434
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,920
where you linger,

435
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,290
what you want,

436
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,540
and what's left.

437
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,670
So, I didn't write much.

438
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,540
Everything I own

439
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,540

Qian,

442
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,540
I can sum up my life

443
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,170
with two words,

444
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:47,790
Wei Qian.

445
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,420
If my running away had ended up

446
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,080
with that letter,

447
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,420
would I regret it?
