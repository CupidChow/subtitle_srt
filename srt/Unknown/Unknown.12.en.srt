Is the person you like Qian?

Yes.

6
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,580
Did he accept it?

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,580
Accept?

Wei Zhiyuan,

10
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,540
I was the one
who let you into this house.

11
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,540
You were shorter than me
when you first came.

12
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,080
I bet you took all of my nutrients.

13
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,040
That's why I couldn't grow taller.

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,790
And now?

15
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,540
Now you even want
to take my brother away from me.

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,710
Aren't we a family?

17
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,670
Why didn't any of you tell me?

18
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,460
It's because we're family

19
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,960
that we're trying to figure out
how to tell you.

20
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,460
Let me ask you a serious question.

21
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,040
If I give you my brother,

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,540
will you be very nice to him?

23
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,210
You know how I treat him.

24
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,290
Then should I keep calling you brother

25
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,040
or my "sister-in-law"?

26
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,210
Wait a minute.

27
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,080
So, Mr. Tan already knew it before?

28
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,670
Mr. Tan?

29
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,960

30
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,080

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,210
Incredible.

33
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,290
You all have kept me in the dark.

34
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,290

35
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,210

I've been working with your brother

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,330
and there he is,
acting all lovey-dovey with his brother.

191
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,040
What's the deal, huh?

192
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,290
You don't get it.

193
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,540
Mr. Wei's always so serious.

194
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,710
But when it comes to his little brother,

195
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,170
he's like a lamb.

196
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,420
Like a lamb in a tiger's den.

197
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,080
San Pang,
who's the lamb and who's the tiger?

198
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,790
Sometimes…

199
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,580
What does that mean?

200
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,080
What?

201
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,210
It means who's the bottom
and who's the top.

202
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,330
Bottom and top?

203
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,920
All right.
I'll give you guys a lesson on it.

204
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,540
The top is the tiger.

205
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,040
When a tiger sees a lamb, it…

206
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,670
It what?

207
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,040
What does it do?

208
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,290
- Come on
- Come on! Tell us!

209
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,080
Come on!

210
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,540
What is it?

211
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,170
See who?

212
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:16,920
Hurry up and tell us…

213
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,790
What?

214
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,540
Qian.

215
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,670
What's this about a lamb and a den?

216
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,040
Den…

217
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,330
It's a dent.

218
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,420
- Making a dent.
- I'll go water the plants.

219
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,960
This is heavy!

220
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,920
Is this OK? This is no good.

221
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,540
Didn't I tell you to…

222
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,670
Um, Qian…

223
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,580
It's nothing, really.

224
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,710
I just want you to know

225
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,710
that

226
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,540
everyone is very supportive.

227
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,290
We're all OK with your relationship.

228
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,290
Yes. It's just…

229
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,460
Just what?

230
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,330
It's just…

231
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,420
We're just

232
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,540
a little curious

233
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,830
about who's the top
and who's the bottom.

234
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,670
It's obvious, isn't it?

235
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,790
I'm home.

236
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,330
Yuan!

237
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,290
Lili!

238
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,420
I'm home.

239
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,790
What's going on?
And they told me to get the groceries.

240
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,890
[Lili's Room]

241
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,540
Qian, you're back.

242
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,670
Why were you in Lili's room?

243
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,330
What's the meaning of this?

244
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,540
You saw it.

245
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,670
Well…

246
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,420
You…

247
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,420
You're going to be an uncle.

248
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,420
Lili, let me ask you something.

249
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,210
Are you ready for this?

250
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,460
Have you thought this through?

251
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,920
Didn't you want to be a model?

252
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,170
What are you going to do about it
if you have a baby?

253
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,420
Having a baby is not easy.

254
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,960
It's a lifetime commitment.

255
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,330
You have to think it through.

256
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,790
What about San Pang?

257
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,670
Is he going to take responsibility?

258
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,580
Yes.

259
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,790
Will he marry you?

260
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,920
Yes.

261
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,710
Will he take care of you for life?

262
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,170
Yes.

263
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:56,920
Qian…

264
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,580
Promise me.

265
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,290
Promise me you won't be mad at San Pang.

266
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,040
OK.

267
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,790
I promise.

268
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,080
You… You promised.

269
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,210
You won't be mad at me.

270
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,170
Take this, Lili.

271
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,290
You're going to be an uncle.

272
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,920
I'll kill you!

273
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,330
She's still so young!

274
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,670
I can't believe you got her pregnant!

275
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,290
Don't be mad!

276
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,290
I'll kill you!

277
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,920
Let go! Don't fight!

278
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,040
Please don't fight!

279
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,330
Enough!

280
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,920
Qian!

281
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,540
Stop fighting!

282
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,920
Wei Zhiyuan, don't hold me back!

283
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,080
How could things end up this way?

284
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,210
I'll kill him!

285
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,170
Stop fighting!

286
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,040
Qian, stop hitting him!

287
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,960
Enough!

288
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,790
Having a baby is something
to be celebrated.

289
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,920
Why are you doing this?

290
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
I'm getting my knife.

291
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,920
Where's the knife?

292
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Just forget it.

293
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,790
Sit down and calm down.

294
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,210
I'm not against Lili having a baby.

295
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,960
The point is she's too young.
It's too soon for her to have a kid.

296
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,790
She's only 23.

297
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,580
And San Pang got her pregnant
even before they get married.

298
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,960
I know you're scared to be alone.

299
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,710
But don't worry.

300
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,920
We're not leaving you.

301
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,420
So, don't be afraid.

302
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,330
Why are you talking about this?

303
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,830
I didn't say I wouldn't get the surgery.

304
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,290
I just need some time to prepare myself.

305
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,540
OK.

306
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,670
We'll go as soon as you're ready.

307
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,830
Lili.

308
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,210
Lili. Li…

309
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,040
Get up.

310
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,790
It's all right.

311
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,040
Don't kneel.

312
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,420
You're pregnant.
You shouldn't be doing this.

313
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,710
Get up, Lili!

314
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,920
Come on. Let's leave them alone.

315
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,670
Let them talk.

316
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,420
I…

317
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,580
Let them talk it out.

318
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,290
Sit down.

319
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,580
You raised me.

320
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,290
Normally, you're my big brother.

321
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,210
You're like a father
when you provide for the family.

322
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,790
You're like a mother when you nag.

323
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,420
Get up and talk, OK?

324
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,790
Come on. Get up.

325
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,420
Sit down.

326
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,790
Your hair is all messed up
from kneeling.

327
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,790
My goodness.

328
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,830
Lili,

329
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,580
I'm not against you.

330
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
It hurts me to think about it,

331
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,670
and I can't bear to see you
go through that.

332
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,670
You're too young. You're only 23.

333
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,420
You still have a lot to do,

334
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,330
dreams to follow,

335
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,670
and places you want to go.

336
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,920
Don't you?

337
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,040
That's why I'm afraid.

338
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,210
I'm afraid
you'll end up like our mother.

339
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,790
Getting pregnant,

340
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,040
then getting married,

341
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,670
and leading an unhappy life.

342
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,830
Qian,

343
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:36,790
because of you,

344
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,460
I've always been well-protected.

345
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,420
But because of San Pang,

346
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,670
I've learned that in this world,

347
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,040
there are people who are willing

348
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,290
to wholeheartedly care
for you besides family,

349
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,040
just like Zhiyuan does for you.

350
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,040
We all deserve happiness.

351
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,330
Let's keep going strong!

352
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,960
Protect her.

353
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,830
Love her.

354
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,960
Don't let her suffer.

355
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,990
♪That I'm everywhere?♪

356
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,920

357
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,210
never ever wrong her.

even if you're my friend,

361
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,080
I will turn my back on you.

I promise you.

364
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,670
I'll make you some chicken soup.

365
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,540
I've left the groceries there
for too long.

366
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,790
Let me help you.

367
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,420
Sit down. I don't need you.

368
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,170
You stay with Lili.

369
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
Yuan, come here.

370
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,040
San Pang,

371
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,670
we entrust Lili to you.

372
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,920
All right. Get going.

373
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,420
What's on your mind?

374
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
I'm just thinking,

375
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,040
