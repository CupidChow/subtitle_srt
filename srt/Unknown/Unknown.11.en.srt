186
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,630
and appetizers and desserts.

187
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,630
Sure.

188
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,130
Excuse me.

189

Don't say I'm not romantic.

190
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,380
When I get romantic,

191
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,750
even I can't handle myself.

192
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,920

194

196

198
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,630
He's shy.

199
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,250
He's reserved.

Hello?

206
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,750
Hello, Mr. Wei Qian.

207
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,880
Hello.

208
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,750
Your test results are out.

209
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,920
Can we schedule a time for you

210
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,540
to check and discuss the report?

211
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,920
Mr. Wei,

212
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,770
your optic nerve has been

213
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,310
under prolonged compression
by the blood clot,

214
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,380
leading to functional deterioration.

215
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,790
I recommend a minimally invasive surgery

216
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,250
to remove the blood clot,

217
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,250
which will improve the survival rate
of healthy cells

218
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,000
and allow the nerve function to recover.

219
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,040
For surgeries like this,

220
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
we cannot guarantee
that there won't be any issues.

221
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:36,250
Even if you regain consciousness
after the surgery,

222
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,790
it might still affect your daily life
to some extent.

223
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,920
For example, the optic nerve function

224
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,540
may not fully recover
after decompression.

225
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,500
Lili is bringing San Pang over
for dinner tonight.

226
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,000
She specifically asked

227
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,170
that you refrain
from criticizing San Pang

228
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,500
in front of her.

229
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,290
She doesn't want to be in a tight spot

230
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,170
between her brother and boyfriend.

231
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,000
When has San Pang ever given a heads-up

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,380
before coming over?

233
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,130
Tell your sister
not to be fooled by him.

234
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,920
Lili is smart actually.

235
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,750
She just doesn't want us

236
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,380
to demand too much from her,

237
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,500
so she pretends to be naive.

238
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,880
It's good that she's smart.

239
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,000
She'll have to depend on herself more

240
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,170
in the future.
