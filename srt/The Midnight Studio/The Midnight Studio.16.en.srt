Entering the body of a living person

546
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:20,100
and doing things with that body is called possessing.
[Mr. Go Seung Ho is so handsome...]

547
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:24,860
For a ghost who's been in this world for four years,

548
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:27,510
possessing is considered standard.

549

Do you want to try dating me intensely?

713
01:07:55,360 --> 01:08:01,590
♫ On the boat called love under the night sky ♫

714
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:03,500
I'd love to, intensely.

715
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,380
We'll probably fight a lot,

716
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:12,740
but please go easy on me.

717
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:14,440
Me, too.

718
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:21,090
Mr. Seo!

719
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:22,680
Mr. Seo...

720
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,680
M-Mr. Seo...

721
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,110
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

722
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:29,400
Mr. Seo!

723
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,180
- Seriously!
- Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

724
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:36,490
Mr. Seo!

725
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,080
Hey, stop...

726
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,730
Seong Ho, are you kissing him right now?

727
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:48,450
- You've been well, right?
- Yes.

728
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:51,030
- Hold on.
- Yes?

729
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:53,240
- Where did you get those clothes?
- Asking me that again?

730
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:57,590
I turned my phone on the moment I came back to this world.

731
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:59,270
- Do you know what I saw?
- What did you see?

732
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:02,450
The texts about your spending! Seriously!

733
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:06,460
We reunited in a year, but you're talking about clothes again.

734
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:07,890
I turned the text notification off.

735
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:10,460
Well done. Well done.

736
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,830
Oh, should we take a photo?

737
01:09:17,910 --> 01:09:19,070
Ready, right?

738
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:20,680
Yes!

739
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,660
Deputy Go won't even be in the shot. Why are you here?

740
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:31,360
But photos are all about the memories.

741
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,590
We'll take the last photo.

742
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:39,760
One, two, three.

743
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,560
After I came back from the netherworld,

744
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:44,540
the door to the studio didn't open again.

745
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:50,540
I returned to the boring but ordinary life like normal people.

746
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:54,710
If someone asks what the studio was like,

747
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:56,760
I'll tell them this.

748
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,920
One, two, three.

749
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:03,510
That it helped the people who've only been chasing tomorrow

750
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:07,770
- cherish the precious moment right now.
- One, two, three.

751
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:17,100
And I'll ask them to cherish today.

752
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,110
♫ I've been out of breath every single day ♫

753
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:29,590
♫ I endured the long night on my own ♫

754
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:32,700
♫ Please believe me now ♫

755
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,800
♫ I'm on your side. Don't worry, baby. ♫

756
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:37,130
♫ I'm serious ♫

757
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:39,260
♫ Whatever it is ♫

758
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:42,050
[The Midnight Studio]

759
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,690
♫ It's all right. Even if it's full of scary things. ♫

760
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:49,870
♫ I'll always be with you, at least ♫

761
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:55,230
♫ It's okay if it's very late at night ♫

762
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:58,380
♫ Don't worry from now on ♫

763
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:01,250
♫ I'll be by your side ♫

764
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,000
♫ Oh, look at me now ♫

765
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,170
♫ I'm with you in this rough world ♫

766
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:09,190
♫ We won't be running away anymore ♫

767
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:12,350
♫ I'm here for you no matter what happens ♫
