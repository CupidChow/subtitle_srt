This is all the trash, right?

358
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,650
You show up only after I cleaned up everything else.

359
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,670
Come on, I know you're happy.

360
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,110
Hurry up, Grandma.

361
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:44,450
So, how did your meeting with the photographer go?

362
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,010
How did you know?

363
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:50,280
His face is totally your type.

364
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,950
He's a pretty boy.

365
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,200
He's not, okay?

366
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,170
He's a scammer. A scammer.

367
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:01,030
He doesn't have a single contact on his phone.

368
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,970
He calls it a photo studio,

369
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,440
but you know the back of the boiler room?

370
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,290
He kept the windows shut,

371
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,190
but there are petals flying behind the windows-

372
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,500
Geez, come on. There's nothing back there.

373
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,060
It's just a storage room.

374
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,790
The strangest weirdo is you, you brat.

375
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,460
Everyone is busy making a living,

376
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,320
but you're leeching off me when you're over 30 years old. Is that normal?

377
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,920
Right, let me see.

378
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,030
You... Look at this.

379
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:34,180
You haven't paid the rent in three months and 10 days.

380
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,560
You haven't paid for the water in two months, and the utility bill-

381
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,300
Enough. That's enough, Grandma.

382
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,690
You must've written down how much you spent on my snacks as a kid.

383
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,070
Of course. I wrote down how much I spent on a pencil, too.

384
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,690
I'll make sure you pay me back until the day I die.

385
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,890
Are you sure I'm your biological granddaughter?

386
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,770
Gosh, I'll die while paying off my debt at this rate.

387
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,820
What did you do with your watch?

388
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,010
The watch? It broke, so I'm getting it repaired.

389
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,720
Aren't you interested in removing that scar?

390
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,200
They say medical technology improved a lot these days.

391
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,070
Why would I remove it?

392
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,340
It's a mark that says I survived alone.

393
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,280
By the way, Madam So, your tteokbokki business...

394
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,150
You need help since you sell out all the time.

395
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,050
So, I was thinking...

396
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,780
should I try selling tteokbokki, too?

397
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,320
You little.

398
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,480
- It' hurts, Grandma.
- You've got to be kidding right now.

399
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,470
I made you a prosecutor selling tteokbokki.

400
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,330
But you quit for some reason.

401
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:43,180
If I invested the money I spent on you in stocks,

402
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,890
I'd be rich by now.

403
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,830
Give me that, you brat.

404
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,420
Madam So, wait for me, please?

405
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,670
Mr. Seo, how's this one?

406
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,460
Is it too casual?

407
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,440
H-How about this?

408
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,930
Why is there nothing to wear?

409
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,090
Even if you were naked, that woman wouldn't see you, anyway.

410
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:29,520
But the attitude is important.

411
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,670
Why is it so dusty?

412
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,030
When was the last time you cleaned?

413
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:36,120
By the way, why are you working so hard?

414
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,370
You aren't usually like this.

415
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:43,780
This might be the last chance God's giving me, right?

416
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,590
Father.

417
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,970
Brothers, please help me.

418
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,020
I have a...

419
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,030
I-I-I have a video.

420
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,540
Holy Father.

421
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:10,240
[Shinil Catholic Church]

422
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,490
Is someone back there?

423
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,700
Okay, listen.

424
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,700
The church will be empty until tomorrow afternoon because of a funeral.

425
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,110
It'd be better to go to the priest's office

426
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,460
through the back door in the afternoon rather than at night.

427
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,900
Good luck, both of you.

428
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,250
Pardon?

429
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,550
You need to come with us, Mr. Baek.

430
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,810
I was a violent crime unit detective, after all.

431
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,170
I can't break the law.

432
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,510
- I'm off now.
- Pardon?

433
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,060
Pardon?

434
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,760
Is it okay for me to break the law, then?

435
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,010
What kind of newbie picks and chooses?

436
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,260
Hey, Baek Nam Goo!

437
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,760
You...

438
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,280
had better stop acting up.

439
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,600
Once you get caught,

440
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,130
he removes all the moisture in your body.

441
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,820
He's the legendary "spin-dryer" police officer.

442
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,520
Detective.

443
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:52,030
He's Detective Baek.

444
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,350
W-Well...

445
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,280
W-What's the difference once you're dead?

446
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,020
I'm a senior in terms of being a ghost.

447
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,690
You're dead.

448
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:16,040
Oh, I'm dead.

449
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,100
Ma'am.

450
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,760
My son says he really wants to eat your tteokbokki today.

451
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,980
Could we get some to go?

452
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,960
You're a little too late.

453
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,530
Make sure to come tomorrow.

454
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,070
I'll set some aside for Yeong Ho, then.

455
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,300
Come on, I know it's back there.

456
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,120
I know you set some aside for Bom.

457
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,540
She doesn't have time to eat because she's busy. You can't take hers.

458
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,320
What do you mean, she's busy?

459
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,190
The whole neighborhood knows she's a jobless bum.

460
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,950
What?

461
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,260
Who said such nonsense?

462
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:57,550
Ma'am, Bom didn't quit her job as a prosecutor.

463
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,720
She got fired.

464
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,730
My brother-in-law worked at the same Prosecutors' Office.

465
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:07,290
She apparently got fired because she upset a very important prosecutor there.

466
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:11,060
That's why the law firms won't hire her, either, because they don't want to offend him.

467
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,320
What...

468
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,520
I'll leave. Let us buy some tomorrow.

469
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,700
Come to the studio when the sun sets.

470
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,720
I'll show you the world I live in.

471
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,450
You came.

472
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,750
Here are the photos of the visitors for the past hundred years.

473
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,690
The photo studio existed for a hundred years?

474
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:55,500
Hold on. Are these photos of ghosts, then?

475
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,590
Yoon Dal is a human, and Yoon Hae is a ghost.

476
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,630
This is a space that connects the living and the dead.

477
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,860
And my job is to open the door for them.

478
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:14,400
Unless I let them in, no living person can come in here.

479
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,510
But I came in.

480
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,790
That's why you're special.

481
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:23,620
You're the only one who can come in here without my permission.

482
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,200
You came.

483
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,290
I told you not to do stuff like this.

484
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,830
He said he was introduced to you once.

485
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,010
Me?

486
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,610
We finally meet, Bom.

487
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,930
This is meant to be.

488
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,270
Meant to be, my foot. You never got to meet her.

489
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,050
We might not have met, but...

490
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:59,890
we exchanged countless messages.

491
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:02,190
We planned to watch "Crash Landing on You" together, too.

492
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,540
They're real flowers.

493
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,250
What would you like to drink?

494
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,160
Iced Americano? Hot Americano?

495
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,560
We have decaf, too.

496
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,530
What would you like to drink?

497
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,120
Oh, this is Mr. Baek.

498
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,050
He guards the photo studio.

499
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:23,150
But of course, you don't see him.

500
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,500
Please relay my message now!

501
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,670
Okay.

502
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:32,530
Well, I heard you said you liked Hyun Bin.

503
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,890
I've never been on a blind date.

504
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,980
And I prefer Won Bin over Hyun Bin.

505
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,660
He must be mistaken.

506
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,230
By the way, are you sure there are ghosts here?

507
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,440
That can't be.

508
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,180
Try to remember.

509
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,920
How about the countless messages we exchanged?

510
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,920
We spent countless nights together.

511
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:02,510
W-What was that just now?

512
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:06,400
Don't worry about it. Come this way.

513
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,450
Tea cookies...

514
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:21,950
Mr. Baek, it hurts too much.

515
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:25,140
Oh, Mr. Baek, Mr. Baek! You're lifting me up, too!

516
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,840
Mr. Baek. Mr. Baek!

517
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,100
Put me down, Mr. Baek.

518
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,810
Sorry.

519
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:43,900
I'm not good at controlling my strength yet. Aigoo, aigoo.

520
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,910
You'll pay for this, Baek Nam Goo.

521
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,470
What's this place actually for?

522
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:09,500
Like I said, I photograph the dead people for their last memory.

523
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:14,840
You really see dead people?

524
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,830
I've been seeing ghosts since I was a kid.

525
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:23,660
They've always chased me, trying to kill me.

526
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,360
Why do they try to kill you?

527
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,760
I mean, if you're actually a photographer for the dead,

528
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,150
I think I'd be grateful.

529
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,370
The photo studio isn't open to all dead people.

530
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,650
So the ghosts who couldn't come here

531
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:47,840
try to kill me to steal the camera with a mysterious power.

532
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,630
I've never gone outside feeling comfortable.

533
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,790

There's no need to go on.

722
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:11,010
I'll remove you from the family registry.

723
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:14,780
You and I are strangers from now on.

724
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,290
I didn't even know.

725
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:20,420
Aigoo, she couldn't even tell me.

726
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:24,320

Do you believe me now? That I see ghosts?

733
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,380
How could I still not after all that?

734
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,500
Will you provide me with a safe zone, then?

735
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,400
Mr. Seo,

736
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,160
should we have a drink as neighbors?

737
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,400
Here's your order.

738
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,570
Thank you.

739
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:24,360
What do you drink? Soju? Beer? Or a mix?

740
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,940
I haven't had any of them.

741
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,940
I get weak if I get drunk.

742
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:32,760
If I get weak, I get attacked easily.

743
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:36,920
I thought ghosts would tell me the lottery number,

744
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,630
punish the people I hate, and I'd feel so protected.

745
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:42,470
But there are so many things you can't do.

746
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:45,560
How do you live like that? It's no fun.

747
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:01,090
You said I provide a safe zone or whatever.

748
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:04,580
You're in a safe zone. Why don't you try some?

749
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,090
I don't want to.

750
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:15,140
I haven't heard your answer yet.

751
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:23,020
Mr. Seo.

752
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:26,230
You asked me to protect you for just a hundred days, right?

753
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:28,740
You said I have a circle or whatever.

754
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:33,570
It's like a safe zone that protects you from ghosts.

755
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:37,540
Then, should I tell you a secret, too?

756
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:48,410
To be honest, I was fired at the Prosecutors' Office.

757
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:54,740
Not for being a prosecutor of justice or anything.

758
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:59,600
Even my grandma doesn't know this. I told you a major secret, okay?

759
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:10,560
A person died because of me.

760
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,850
If only I didn't free him,

761
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,260
and if only I didn't misjudge then,

762
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,960
he might not have died.

763
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:23,800
He might still be in prison, but he'd still be alive.

764
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,220
How could someone like me protect someone?

765
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,390
This is different.

766
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:36,050
Mr. Seo, we met first at the police station regarding Ms. Jang, right?

767
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:39,580
We met again at the police station regarding Yoon Dal.

768
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,900
And we met at the police station again regarding the priest.

769
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,920
Then, we might go somewhere more dangerous than a police station, right?

770
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,460
I can't let someone be in danger again.

771
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:57,880
I understand how desperate you are for the circle,

772
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:02,860

but I didn't want to bother and be in danger.

796

01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:41,390
♫ Stay by my side ♫

884
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,300
♫ I still wonder why ♫

885
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:49,150
♫ Tell me why ♫

886
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:53,040
Can't you see it's the red light?

887
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:57,470
Did you see my grandma?

888
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:00,130
- Bom.
- No.

889
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:01,580
You didn't see her, right?

890
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,990
I'm mistaken, right?

891
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:07,490
Come on and say I'm mistaken.

892
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:10,980
♫ I don't want to forget ♫

893
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:15,590
That the moment comes to us sooner than expected.

894
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:17,900
Please.

895
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:24,060
♫ So I could walk past it ♫

896
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:29,630
♫ I still wonder why ♫

897
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:32,970
♫ Where you are ♫

898
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:36,620
♫ I still don't know why ♫

899
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:44,340
♫ You told me we'll never change ♫

900
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:51,930
♫ Can you hear me? I'll call your name again today ♫

905
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,100
Grandma, what are you doing here?

906
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:18,370
Grandma!

907
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:20,420
Don't tell Attorney Han.

908
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:22,520
I never came here, okay?

909
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:25,170
Does my grandma not want to see me?

910
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:28,440
Looks like she gave away a lot of cash gifts.

911
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,890
She wants to get paid back for all of it.

912
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:33,400
You've been doing whatever you wanted all this time.

913
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,980
I'll do whatever I want from now on.

914
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,390
I'm to blame for this accident.

915
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:39,930
I think death is really approaching me.

916
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,110
Can I like you?

917
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:44,320
♫ Oh, look at me now ♫
