179
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,900
Will you let that bastard take your home while complaining?

180
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,000
Never.

181
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,900
Gosh. Mr. Seo, what's the matter?

182
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,300
How could a living person enter through the gate of the dead?

183
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,050
I've never seen such a thing in my three years as a ghost.

184
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,250
Three years?

185
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,060
I've never seen one for 20 years I've been running the photo studio.

186
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,500
Does it mean she entered through the gate of the living?

187
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,800
Only you can open the gate of the living.

188
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,250
Only the visitors can open the gate of the dead.

189
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,500
She's neither of those things and is alive. How was she supposed to enter the studio?

190
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,930
Geez! You think I don't know that?

191
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,990
Maybe you hallucinated since you've been in poor health.

192
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,190
She was definitely alone in the hallway.

193
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,690
By chance, did you leave it open and forget?

194
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:51,490
I think you haven't recovered fully after the virgin ghost incident.

195
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,420
Here?

196
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,610
There doesn't seem to be a wound here.

197
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,900
What?

198
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,320
Geez, you can't do this now.

199
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,340
Geez, seriously.

200
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,840

201
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,550
Mr. Seo!

202
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:00,080
I'll kill you if there's nothing here.

203
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,810
I-I think there's a ghost here.

204
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,500
- Hey, Deputy Go.
- Yes?

205
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,300
What do you think you are?

206
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,020
I'm talking about an evil spirit.

207
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,860
I'm a nice ghost.

208
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,960
This is the photo studio. How could an evil spirit enter?

209
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,420
You... What are you?

210
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,090
I feel an evil energy somewhere.

211
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,580
I'm Kang Rim.

212
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,540
Hey, kid! What's this now?

213
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,720
Are you out of your mind?

214
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,050
Don't move.

215
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,140
I, Kang Rim, am here to destroy you. Yap!

216

Faceless ghosts, bachelor ghosts, and virgin ghosts.

228
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,720
There are a lot of notorious ghosts,

229
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,960
but the scariest one is...

230
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,960
the child ghost. They're the scariest.

231
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,030
You clean up the mess.

232
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,780
You clean up the mess again.

233
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,210
Is this what they mean by "Childrearing hell"?

234
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,380
It's okay.

235
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,100
I endured two months. Three days aren't so bad.

236
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,180
Who did you have for two months?

237
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,340
You won't know. She was a very annoying first visitor.

238
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,580

Hey, put that down.

242
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,710
Put it down.

243
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,990

- Do it. Do it.

- Do it. Do it.
- You can't, can you?

249
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,500
That's mine!

250
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,300
I looked up the accident records in the neighborhood.

251
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,900
There was a car accident at the intersection a month ago.

252
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,250
A seven-year-old boy died.

253
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,090
The suspect was drunk driving.

254
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,000
They couldn't settle since the boy was from an orphanage.

255
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,400
You're in trouble, okay?

256
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,370
Mr. Seo, catch him!

257
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,240

00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,950
- Let go right now.
- Mr. Seo.

537
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,040
Yoon Hae is here.

538
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,290
Let go.

539
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:19,090
Yoon Hae has a scar on the back of his neck.

540
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:22,910
Who's this kid in front of me?

541
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:25,340
Were they twins?

542
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,840
Ahjussi, why are you bothering my brother?

543
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,420
Why are you bothering him?

544

00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:06,880
I think we're really meant to be.

549
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,950
Did you want to give this sword to your brother?

550
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,470
Tomorrow is Yoon Dal's birthday.

551
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,470
I wanted to get it for him.

552
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,090
You should've told me so, then.

553
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,190
I didn't know, and I told that woman-

554
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,090
Pardon? What do you mean?

555
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:52,610
Forget it. Whatever.

556

Pardon?

560
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,460
Well, I think I need new clothes.

561
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,220
I might go on a date.

It's so tasty.

You can't use this alone.

565

Tell me. What do you need?

572
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,450
The sword.

573
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,550

00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,450
Yoon Dal, did you pack your things?

575
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,660

Okay.

717
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:02,520
Hurry up and repeat after me.

718
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,430
Fire of devotion!

719
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:09,830
Hey, kiddo. I have social status and dignity.

720
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:12,380
Do you think I'd do anything you tell me to?

721
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,660
Fire of devotion.

722
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,920
Fire of devotion!

723
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,720
Pierce the enemy with the burning flame.

724
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,200
Fire of devotion.

725
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:51,920
Pierce the enemy with the burning flame!

726
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:04,570
- Kang Rim...
- Seals the evil energy!

727
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,690
Kang Rim seals the evil energy!

728
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:27,090
Was expelling ghosts always this embarrassing?

729
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,900
You need to have a birthday party, kiddo.

730
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:15,170
♫ I've nothing to lose ♫

731
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,880
♫ Every day was the same ♫

732
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,910
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

733
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:28,760
- Congrats. Congrats!
- Congrats. Congrats!

734
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,990
Hyung!

735
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:34,960
Hyung!

736
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:41,170
I don't need stuff like this.

737
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:45,610
I don't want this anymore.

738
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:51,640
If only I didn't ask you for the toy...

739
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,760
I'm sorry, Hyung.

740
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:00,690
I'm actually not dead.

741
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:08,670
I'm executing my mission according to Kang Rim's order.

742
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:11,310
You're lying.

743
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,180
I'm serious.

744
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:17,520
Have you ever seen me lying?

745
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,090
When are you coming back, then?

746
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:22,560
After I finish my mission.

747
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,950
You'll wait for me until then, right?

748
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,610
Swear on Kang Rim's name.

749
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:34,910
I swear on Kang Rim's name.

750
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:43,010
Come back soon, okay?

751
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,770
How dare he report me at my house?

752
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:14,080
Why does he want a photo studio on top of the hill?

753
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,440
He never gets customers, but why is the light on?

754
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,740
How strange.

755
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:29,270
Are they open or not?

756
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,670
I'm sure I was mistaken then.

757
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:43,620
There can't be a space like that behind the boiler room.

758
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:45,280
By the way, this is strange.

759
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,140
He just moved, but he's showing interest in Yoon Dal's orphanage.

760
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:52,380
Is he committing some kind of new crime?

761
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,460
[Director]

762
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,480
Hello, Director.

763
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,790
I haven't volunteered there in a while. I'm sorry.

764
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:09,340
Attorney Han, is Yoon Dal there, by chance?

765
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:13,260
- Pardon?
- Someone saw him following some man earlier today.

766
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:16,360
Yes, I'll look for him, too.

767
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:42,870
Mr. Baek put his blood and sweat into this special cake.

768
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:45,400
Make a wish now.

769
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:52,970
Please make Hyung come back quickly.

770
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,820
Amen...

771
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:58,850
Please make sure Yoon Dal doesn't feel afraid.

772
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:02,780
Okay. One, two, three.

773
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,680
Happy birthday!

774
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,860
It's your birthday, too, kiddo.

775
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,800
Ahjussi.

776
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,460
Goodbye, kiddo.

777
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:31,640
Hyung, come back soon.

778
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,560
Hyung!

779
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,630
Hyung!

780
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,560
Hyung!

781
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:54,440
Hyung!

782
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:04,470
Hyung...

783
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,690
Don't go.

784
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,290
Hyung!

785
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:33,710
Oh, my gosh!

786
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:36,310
Thank God!

787
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,090
Lee Yoon Dal, we were worried about you.

788
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:44,410
I met Yoon Hae just now.

789
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:48,640
The Hyung at the photo studio let me see him.

790
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,840
- What?
- Look at this.

791
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,460
I had a birthday party with Yoon Hae.

792
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,250
He gave me the Biryong Exorcising Sword, too.

793
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:06,550
This bastard was an awful man.

794
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:40,770
The people who come here ask me.

795
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:45,240
"Why? For what reason...

796
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,680
Where's the camera?

797
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:53,400
only my life is filled with misfortunes?"

798
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,850
Where's the camera?

799
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:28,700
Give me the camera!

800
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,600
Give me!

801
01:02:46,370 --> 01:02:49,260
Even though life is...

802
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:52,060
filled with misfortunes...

803
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,050
don't be discouraged.

824
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:30,600
That man is suspicious in so many ways.

825
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,610
He doesn't have a single contact on his phone.

826
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:37,450
I'm a ghost photographer who takes photos of the dead.

827
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,020
I really need you.

828
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:42,530
Come to the studio when the sun sets.

829
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:45,390
You actually see dead people?

830
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:47,170
Shit, seriously.

831
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:49,330
Don't tell Attorney Han.

832
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:51,540
