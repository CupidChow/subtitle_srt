1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,954
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,749
You'd better

3
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,584
step up

4
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:44,753
while I'm being nice.

5
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,799
Someone keeps talking to
the School Violence Committee.

6
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,219
Who is it?

7
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,097
Where are you going?

8
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,515
Where's Do-eon going?

9
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,184
Will you stop it?

10
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,354
You're the one who has been
bullying us for no reason.

11
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,650
What did we ever do to you?

12
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,194
You startled me!

13
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,278
Hey, you.

14
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,947
Did you just turn yourself in?

15
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,616
Well, aren't you fearless.

16
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,452
Why you little…

17
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,370
You're a dead man.

18
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,499
Why did he tattle to the Committee?

19
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,920
That useless kid's only here
thanks to the Equal Opportunity System.

20
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,173
The poor just love handouts.

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,551
Still, he's a good son
because he volunteered to leave

22
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,845
so his dad can keep his job.

23
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,264
Oh, the company his father works at is

24
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,183
Hanmyung Electronics'
subcontractor, right?

25
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,267
Yes.

26
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,270
He wouldn't dare lay a finger on Jenna.

27
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,855
They're in a completely different class.

28
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:47,899
Let's go.

29
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,943
They said it was our fault

30
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,612
for being born this way.

31
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,789
You there.

32
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,587
You asked what you did to us.

33
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,136
You really don't know?

34
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,432
It's your fault for being born this way.

35
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,937
Even though it wasn't our choice…

36
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,696
they said we should take responsibility.

37
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,831
You should've hung on
just a little bit longer.

38
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,254
Are you here to see me off?

39
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,677
I thought I didn't have
a single friend here.

40
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,180
We both got in

41
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,349
through the Equal Opportunity System.

42
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,643
It's a shame.

43
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,688
It would've been better
if we became friends earlier.

44
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,651
I hope you survive until you graduate.

45
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,741
The one who called
the School Violence Committee…

46
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,536
wasn't you.

47
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:25,622
Why didn't you say so?

48
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,337
If I said it was someone other than me,

49
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,964
would that have changed anything?

50
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,888
I should go now.

51
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,036
I handed in so much evidence,

52
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,414
so why won't you take any action
against the bullies?

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,585
Well, we looked into it.

54
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,714
The situation isn't serious enough
to make it an issue,

55
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,633
and the students involved…

56
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,810
Being born this way.

57
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,688
OVER 5 BILLION WON: DIAMOND CLUB
HANMYUNG GROUP

58
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,481
Perhaps…

59
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,442
GENEROUS BENEFACTORS

60
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,945
…it is my fault.

61
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,084
Would you like to use this?

62
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,046
No. I'm fine.

63
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,173
KIM HYE-IN

64
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,175
KIM HAE-IN

65
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,597
We have similar names.

66
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,404
Thanks for lending it to me.

67
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,998
SORRY, I'M A LEECH

68
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:36,252
Do they think
I fucking wanted to be born this way?

69
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,887
LEECH

70
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,365
CHEONGDAM INTERNATIONAL
HIGH SCHOOL

71
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,575
Excuse me.

72
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,661
Where are the admission interviews
taking place?

73
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,956
Why would you ask me something like that?

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,374
Don't you know who I am?

75
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,170
Psycho bitch.

76
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,671
Who does she think she is?

77
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,299
REALIZE THE VALUE
OF THE TOP CLASS!

78
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,331
Do you know why rich kids
get depressed easily?

79
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,127
They're born
with everything they could want,

80
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,170
so life is fricking boring.

81
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,803
I didn't ask you.

82
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,556
No, you didn't.

83
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,064
But I happened to be a volunteer
and was wondering if you needed help.

84
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,865
Do you want one?

85
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,878
It's me, Seo Do-eon.

86
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,466
A student's smoking on the rooftop.

87
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,012
It's obvious he was reprimanded
and was told to volunteer.

88
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,808
Can you inform
the teacher in charge? Thanks.

89
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,895
-Why you little--
-Worry about…

90
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,148
yourself.

91
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,699
Go that way.

92
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,127
ENTRANCE INTERVIEW

93
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,801
I hate this.

94
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,681
Three more hours to go?

95
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,229
You took your sweet time
when we should be working together.

96
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,439
Hey.

97
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,483
Freshman Yoo Min-kwon.

98
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,193
Yes?

99
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,571
Some get to play while others work.

100
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,991
Your dad owns a company
and you don't even know that?

101
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:00,456
We're at school, not at work.

102
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,833
As students, we're equal,
so some shouldn't get to slack off

103
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,710
while others work.

104
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,090
A student at Cheongdam International
talks about equality?

105
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,469
See if you can say that
to the Diamond Club.

106
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,642
-Damn it.
-What did you say?

107
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,690
Also, the premise is wrong, okay?

108
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,276
You volunteered to volunteer,

109
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,569
so you must work.

110
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,946
I was forced to do this
after getting reprimanded,

111
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,573
so you're lucky I'm even cooperating.

112
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,910
Like that's something to brag about.

113
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,996
What did you just say?

114
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,165
You're a freshman
which means you answer to me.

115
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,003
Do you think I'm a pushover?

116
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,717
My mom told me that

117
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,051
old age isn't a virtue.

118
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,639
This is why they should be
using bats instead of

119
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,558
volunteer work to educate.

120
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,811
I'm the only one in the whole school

121
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,271
who's in their right mind.

122
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,815
You have totally lost it, haven't you?

123
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,859
Say that again, punk.

124
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,277
I said you need educating. So what?

125
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,445
Why you little…

126
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,913
This school is fricking huge.

127
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,628
Where on earth
are the entrance interviews happening?

128
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,096
Right around that corner.

129
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,891
Thank you.

130
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,944
Hey. What was that?

131
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,530
What was that massive bucket?

132
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,617
It can't be an interview prop.

133
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,243
Is she here to educate someone?

134
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,914
You little… Stop talking about education.

135
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,666
-You…
-You're defying me?

136
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,053
Fuck your stupid dreams.
You must become a decent person first.

137
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,182
Kim Hye-in, you…

138
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,895
I'm going to tell my mom on you!

139
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,567
You lied about attending
Hankuk University,

140
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,653
and if that wasn't enough,
you show up here and ruin everything?

141
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,697
Are you set out
to ruin my daughter's life?

142
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,491
Do you think I'll let this slide?

143
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,536
You fucking bitch! You skank!

144
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,379
Are you done?

145
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,006
What?

146
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,969
Are you done venting?

147
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,929
My goodness.

148
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,432
What if I'm not done yet?

149
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,599
Calm down.

150
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,152
The interview hall is a mess
because of your daughter.

151
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,487
If you want to cause a bigger mess,

152
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,531
do so off the school grounds.

153
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,116
-Mom.
-Well…

154
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,411
Chairman,
there must be a misunderstanding.

155
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,830
My daughter and that crazy brat

156
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,624
are completely unrelated
and my girl is the victim here.

157
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,252
She barged in and made a mess.

158
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,628
Whatever the case…

159
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,548
at Cheongdam International High School,

160
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,759
we do not tolerate substandard behavior.

161
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,971
What happened during the interview

162
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,226
will be reflected in the result
of Kang Na-yeon's interview.

163
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,562
Remember that.

164
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,771
What?

165
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,483
Wait. Chairman.

166
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,987
What do I do now?

167
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,243
I'll call all the lawyers

168
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,870
and connections I have

169
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,331
and ruin your life,
just like you did hers.

170
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,916
Just wait and see, okay?

171
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,211
You're dead, Kim Hye-in.

172
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,631
Let's go home.

173
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,682
Is this something to get expelled for?

174
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,769
Look. "Those who forge or alter

175
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,521
an official document

176
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,856
for wrongful reasons could be expelled."

177
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,319
Do you see Article 37
of the Code of Discipline?

178
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,154
Lying about being
a Hankuk University student

179
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,114
to tutor someone is fraud.

180
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,910
Do you know how many dozen calls a day

181
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,955
her family's making to our school
and the Office of Education?

182
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,583
I apologize.

183
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,173
If it turns out
that you stole from them too,

184
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,133
you won't be able to avoid expulsion.

185
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,010
Go beg for forgiveness
or get them to settle--

186
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,178
Just a moment.

187
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,098
What do you mean I stole?

188
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:14,436
They said they have evidence.
Don't feign ignorance.

189
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,772
How can there be evidence when it's not…

190
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,736
No way. Did Kang Na-yeon…

191
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,206
-It's her.
-She has no conscience.

192
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,833
-I told you it wasn't true.
-How shameless.

193
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,126
But she insisted.

194
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,712
She lied so brazenly and shamelessly.

195
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,963
How could I not believe her?

196
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,755
Exposing the truth about
fake Instagrammer Kim Hye-in.

197
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,761
At the brunch party last time,

198
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,805
someone brought up couples
who'd been promised to marry years ago.

199
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,351
If even couples that marry for love
divorce after ten years,

200
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,603
how long could an arranged couple last?

201
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,980
Really?

202
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:44,401
If that wasn't about us,
then who was it about?

203
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,863
You know J Distribution's chairman's
second daughter, right?

204
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,491
She pretends she doesn't mean to,

205
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,201
but she says stuff that is so annoying.

206
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,964
Oh, J Distribution,
second daughter. I know her.

207
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,507
What were you looking at?

208
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,384
-Is it another girl's--
-No, it's not that.

209
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,551
Look at this.

210
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,139
She goes to our school,
but I don't know her at all.

211
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,687
Based on her feed,

212
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,272
she doesn't seem like a complete nobody.

213
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,816
-Right?
-Right.

214
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,985
If neither you nor I recognize her,

215
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,195
then she's from an insignificant family.

216
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,406
Or is she pretending?

217
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,913
Anyway, when Baek Jenna finds out,
things should get interesting.

218
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,792
She loathes it
when nobodies use our school name.

219
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,421
I don't loathe it. I find it ridiculous.

220
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,966
The real distinguished kids
don't show off.

221
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,844
Let me see.

222
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,304
I want to see her ridiculous mug.

223
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,399
What is it? You saw her before?

224
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,241
USER CANNOT BE FOUND

225
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,037
The account got switched to private.

226
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,830
What's going on?

227
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,335
LOL
SHE'S CRAZY

228
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,672
Does she think it'll go away
if she switches the account to private?

229
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,967
She used someone else's clothes,
bags and house to pretend to be rich.

230
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,720
She was an all-round fake, not rich.

231
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,805
I would've been so embarrassed
and dropped out of school.

232
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,516
Tell her to transfer
to Cheongdam International High School.

233
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,185
That's fucking hilarious.

234
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,271
To think she posed in a stolen uniform

235
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,774
and said "Should I transfer?"

236
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:35,197
FAKE RICH LOL, DISGUSTING,
TRANSFER TO CHEONGDAM

237
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,168
You think this is the end?

238
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,088
My mom said she'll sue Lee Sun-ju,

239
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,798
who lent you her student ID.

240
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,592
Let's see you spend all you have
on the settlement,

241
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,636
you stupid, penniless Kim Hye-in.

242
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,555
Why that little…

243
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,563
Before you go,

244
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,524
shouldn't you apologize to us?

245
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,734
Apologize?

246
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,498
I'm sorry for pretending to be rich
when I'm penniless.

247
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,543
I guess I deserve to die for it.

248
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,253
Happy?

249
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,992
CHAIRMAN SEO HEE-SU

250
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,702
Someone's here to see me?

251
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,330
Send her in.

252
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,463
I'm very sorry I caused a scene
during the admission interview.

253
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,050
I regret it deeply and I'm so very sorry.

254
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,554
Isn't that already in the past?

255
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,058
Also, you came to the wrong place.

256
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,937
If you wanted to apologize,
you should've gone to see Na-yeon.

257
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,813
Well…

258
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,901
I'm apologizing to ask you to reconsider

259
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,278
accepting Na-yeon to your school.

260
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,739
I could plead and beg all day every day,

261
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,408
but unless Na-yeon gets admitted here,

262
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,577
I don't think they'll ever settle.

263
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,374
That means your apology isn't sincere.

264
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,543
Oh, well…

265
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,631
I am in the wrong, but…

266
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,969
I have impeccable grades,

267
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,972
and got good feedback from everyone.

268
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,224
I must've briefly lost my mind,

269
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,185
but honestly,
I've been a good person so far.

270
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,480
I'll be expelled, framed for stealing,

271
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:17,192
and an unrelated third person
will get sued because of this.

272
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,279
I think that's too harsh a punishment.

273
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,743
My life is already bleak and miserable,

274
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,413
and it'll only be making it even worse.

275
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,750
So…

276
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,962
could you please

277
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:41,341
consider it an act of mercy
to save the life of a poor student

278
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,971
and let it go just this once?

279
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,808
You said your grades are impeccable,

280
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,810
but you're foolish.

281
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:53,603
Pardon?

282
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,564
Say I were to save a poor student.

283
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,941
What would that improve?

284
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,694
Honor?

285
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,195
Finances?

286
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,324
If I were to accept Na-yeon

287
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,660
because of your tear-jerking plea,

288
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,582
I guess I could make
a few tens of thousands more won.

289
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,626
But if you're really smart,

290
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,588
you should do the math.

291
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,299
To make some chump change,

292
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:26,595
if I were to turn a blind eye
to the disaster that many future students

293
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,264
and parents witnessed,

294
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:33,602
who would want to attend
Cheongdam International High?

295
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,353
Oh, but still--

296
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,355
Consider this a valuable lesson.

297
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:43,361
However hard you try, it must not change.

298
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,696
No.

299
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,949
It must be impossible to change.

300
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:52,579
That is what makes it valuable.

301
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:55,999
Still,

302
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,627
-even if that's so--
-Mr. Yoon.

303
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,630
Escort the student out.

304
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,063
I'll go even if you tell me not to.

305
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,273
I just need to go to the bathroom.

306
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,611
You must return the visitor's pass
at the main gate

307
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,113
to get your student ID back.

308
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,721
This is it.

309
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,849
That hits the spot.

310
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,489
What kind of lesson is that?

311
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,491
What a fucking lesson.

312
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,036
What did I do that was so wrong?

313
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,535
Why won't she go away?

314
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,948
Who are you?

315
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,581
You fucking pervert.

316
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,999
How long were you here for?

317
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,253
You people don't have class at all.

318
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,546
-This is what you lot are like.
-Hey, don't!

319
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,799
You can't call the cops. Hear me out.

320
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:51,925
Let go.

321
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,343
Let me explain first.

322
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,388
Check the vent in the last cubicle.

323
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,390
You'll find my cigarettes.

324
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,185
I'm just one of the many smokers.

325
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,230
Like hell. Aren't you a student?

326
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:08,483
Let's say you're a smoker.
Why smoke in the girls' bathroom?

327
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,236
Ask anyone here.

328
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,280
None of the girls who go here

329
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,574
use the first-floor toilet
in the main building.

330
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,868
What does that mean?

331
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,669
Last year, a student…

332
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,591
She…

333
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,261
had a baby here.

334
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,179
No way.

335
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,515
That's why no one comes here.

336
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,976
They say it's bad luck and whatnot.

337
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:48,023
I'd have gone to the rooftop
if it weren't for that punk Seo Do-eon.

338
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,525
I'm not here because I want to be.

339
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,694
It's my final hideout.

340
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,412
That hurt.

341
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,122
Sorry.

342
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,671
Who are you anyway?

343
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,758
You're not a student here.

344
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,594
Admissions are over.

345
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,767
Hey, it's you. Bucket Girl.

346
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,685
You…

347
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:31,191
Where on earth
are the entrance interviews happening?

348
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,403
I was dying to find out who you were.

349
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,530
What was all that about?

350
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,034
You want to know about that?

351
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,535
Who in their right mind

352
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,079
brings a bucket to an interview?

353
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:47,374
What on earth did you do with it?

354
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,629
I used it to fuck up my life, okay?

355
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,641
Here.

356
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,646
ENTERED 9:30 A.M.
EXITED 4:30 P.M.

357
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,399
-You're leaving?
-Yes.

358
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,530
-Here.
-Goodbye.

359
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:45,932
Here.

360
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,809
Thanks.

361
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,018
Don't thank me.

362
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:53,523
You go and do your business,
and I'll go get another smoke.

363
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,150
-We're even.
-Geez.

364
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,281
Just tell me already.

365
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:05,744
Okay. Over there in the parking lot.
Do you see the Porsche Boxster?

366
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,412
Box what?

367
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,165
Gosh…

368
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,462
The flashy red sports car.

369
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,964
It's the chairman's favorite.

370
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,345
Do you think begging again
will make a difference?

371
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,556
You must know by now.

372
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,143
It won't work.

373
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,354
Should I just sit and do nothing

374
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,024
while my life goes down the drain?

375
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,568
Don't take it out on me.

376
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,153
You flipped the bucket yourself.

377
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,157
I will wish you luck, though.

378
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,535
I'm off.

379
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,413
You can do it, Bucket Girl.

380
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,210
Do whatever you want.

381
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,587
Darn pervert.

382
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,004
Oh, right.

383
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:43,758
There's another car he rides sometimes.
Should I have told her that?

384
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,483
When on earth does he get off work?

385
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,392
Holy shit.

386
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,168
KIM HAE-IN

387
