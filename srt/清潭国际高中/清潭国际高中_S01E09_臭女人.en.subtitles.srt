1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,954
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,631
It was true.

3
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,259
She lied.

4
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,929
OVER ONE BILLION WON

5
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,016
OH SI-EUN

6
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,436
1 YEAR AGO

7
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,856
OVER 5 BILLION WON

8
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:17,160
Isn't she ashamed?
How could she even come to school?

9
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,788
I know. Isn't her dad in prison?

10
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,915
Did you see?
Reporters camped outside the main gate

11
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,833
because of her family.

12
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:28,880
My mom said that Si-eun's family
was famous even in her day.

13
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,007
For being lunatics.

14
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,013
What are you looking at?

15
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,517
What are you looking at?

16
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,852
You think this is fucking funny?

17
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,188
Look away!

18
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,106
You're all trash!

19
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,737
She's the trash
and we're just avoiding it.

20
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,449
What if she makes a scene
like her grandmother or dad? Let's go.

21
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,784
Is she on something?

22
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,540
You fucking bitch.

23
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,252
Know your place!

24
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,796
My family might stumble and fall,

25
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,716
but we'll always do better
than your useless family.

26
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,679
Yes. I'm on something.

27
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,764
So what?

28
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,186
Jenna.

29
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,161
How…

30
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:45,206
How could you do that to me?

31
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,835
When we were young, you said to me

32
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,547
only people on the same level
can be friends.

33
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,594
That means you can no longer be my friend.

34
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,140
Because your family's going down.

35
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:10,356
You accepted
all the nice things I gave you.

36
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,074
So why are you being such a bitch now?

37
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,038
You of all people
shouldn't treat me like this.

38
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,374
You should return the favor
for the rest of your life.

39
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,542
The favor?

40
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,596
I waited for this moment for so long.

41
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,366
Why won't she pick up?

42
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,126
I warned you.

43
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,673
That I'd mess you up
if I saw you at school.

44
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:21,803
That's why I stayed
in the quieter corners of the building.

45
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,390
If I still got on your nerves, sorry.
I'll be more careful.

46
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,432
You.

47
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,143
What are you up to?

48
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,729
What do you mean?

49
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,065
Why are you hanging out with Kim Hye-in?

50
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,945
Kim Hye-in? I don't know who you mean.

51
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,530
Are you kidding me?

52
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,867
No, what I mean is,
there was a girl with a similar name.

53
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,287
I was asking which girl you meant.

54
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,374
Are you talking about Hye-in with a Y?

55
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,753
Oh Si-eun.

56
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,007
I don't know what you're thinking,

57
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,384
and why you're being friendly
with a commoner

58
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,928
when you never treated them like humans.

59
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,975
Whatever you're thinking, forget about it.

60
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,354
If I catch you,
I'll expose what you did before--

61
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,439
Is there proof?

62
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,859
What?

63
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,070
Do you have proof that because of me,
your younger brother,

64
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:25,033
Hanmyung Group's precious heir died?

65
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:30,079
You said so yourself,
you psycho killer bitch.

66
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,832
That's when you were to be heir to

67
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,169
the great Hanmyung Group
and be my best friend forever.

68
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,673
No.

69
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,469
Aren't we on the same level again?

70
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,428
Why you…

71
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,764
I'm sorry, Jenna.

72
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,434
The restraining order
you got against me is still in force.

73
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,227
I can't be near you.

74
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,070
See?

75
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,822
I said back then that you'd regret it.

76
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,701
You ungrateful bitch who turned against
someone who showed you favor.

77
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,788
You don't even dare come after me.

78
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,430
When we were young, you said to me

79
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,558
only people on the same level
can be friends.

80
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,979
That means you can no longer be my friend.

81
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,900
Because your family's going down.

82
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,916
But now…

83
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,879
aren't we on

84
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,007
the same level again?

85
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,428
Hanmyung Group's humiliated.

86
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,180
It's all over the internet.

87
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,850
I saw that. He found real love.

88
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,352
I feel so sorry for her.

89
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,772
All the money he has
will go to his second wife.

90
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,627
This talk is to help prevent
such an unfortunate incident

91
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,795
from happening again--

92
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,005
What if it's not unfortunate?

93
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,924
Because of us, someone almost died.

94
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,679
Aren't you talking about
the other one, Kim Hae-in?

95
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,557
Don't you hang out with just anyone.

96
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,393
Not all friends are the same.

97
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,354
You should befriend people
who'll help you in life.

98
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,648
Like Baek Jenna.

99
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,117
Damn it!

100
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,247
Where is it?

101
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,420
Shoot.

102
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,430
Hye-in.

103
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,434
I want to ask you something.

104
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,436
What is it?

105
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,772
Why did you lie to me?

106
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,442
Did you think I wouldn't know or…

107
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,527
What?

108
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,739
It was you. That day.

109
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,244
The shoe thief?

110
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,580
The note?

111
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,999
Or…

112
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,213
Lee Duk-min?

113
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,549
You crazy bitch.

114
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,593
You could become an actress.

115
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,972
Are you a psychopath?

116
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,308
You secretly filmed me and sent
the threatening text message, didn't you?

117
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,271
To be exact, Duk-min took the video.

118
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,773
I do know about his hobby.

119
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,442
Hey. This is a crime.

120
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,113
You committed a crime first.

121
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,698
What kind of nonsense…

122
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,791
The uniform you got in exchange for murder

123
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,669
suits you well.

124
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,467
I don't know what you know and how,
but I think you misunderstood.

125
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,638
Director Seo wouldn't have hired you.

126
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,016
Was it to keep you quiet?

127
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,812
I guess it just got harder
to become an Equal Opportunity Leech.

128
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,025
Poor little Hae-in.

129
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,278
Outside the main gate--

130
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,362
It wasn't me.

131
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,076
I just happened to be at the scene.

132
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,454
I don't know who did it. I swear.

133
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,164
Is that so?

134
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,333
That'll do.

135
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,585
What?

136
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,921
If you were there, that'll do.

137
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,174
That's enough for you to be a witness.

138
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,179
I already know

139
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,640
who the culprit is.

140
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,353
It's Baek Jenna.

141
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,493
Don't go.

142
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,662
Sit down and take this.

143
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,958
I have nothing to say to you yet.

144
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,127
Hey, guys.

145
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,962
How long will you keep on fighting?

146
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,590
You two are being childish right now.

147
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,094
You two. If you argue like this instead of

148
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,013
celebrating us at our party,
we'll cut you at the door.

149
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,557
You're out. Make up by then.

150
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,019
Then…

151
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,232
I'll bring Hye-in to the party.

152
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,317
What?

153
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:34,944
You lunatic.

154
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,530
Are you trying to make me angry
on purpose?

155
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,325
Why? Can't I?

156
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,537
Because I chose a girlfriend

157
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,497
who's poor again?

158
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,460
Let me ask just one thing.

159
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,048
What about Hae-in did you dislike so much?

160
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,762
What's going on?

161
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,765
It was you?

162
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,976
You called me up here?

163
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,813
You came. I didn't think you would.

164
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,442
Are you out of your mind?

165
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,736
A leech like you dares make me come here?

166
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,780
But here you are.

167
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,533
Doesn't that mean my threat worked?

168
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,368
What?

169
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:30,666
I only texted you to ask if Ms. Ha
will really quit teaching

170
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,835
because she became
a rich chairman's mistress.

171
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,212
And you came running.

172
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,049
As if the rich chairman were your father.

173
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,718
You.

174
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,512
Where did you hear that crap?

175
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:50,478
I'm the only one who caught on
that the rich chairman's your father.

176
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,687
You can relax.

177
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,608
But…

178
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,944
Ms. Ha should be more careful.

179
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,072
I saw the chauffeur who drives you
to and from school

180
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,410
pick up Ms. Ha
a few times after she worked late.

181
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,623
How do you know
what my chauffeur looks like?

182
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:14,752
The poor tend to be more observant.

183
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:21,425
"The shoes she's wearing,
what if I were to wear them?

184
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,969
The house she lives in,

185
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,556
what if it were my house?

186
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,352
The fancy car that waits for her, what if…

187
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,774
it was here for me?"

188
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,736
That's what we always wonder.

189
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,073
So?

190
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,034
What do you want from me?

191
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,915
What do I want?

192
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,419
Are you going to
give it to me if I tell you?

193
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,260
I can't tell you right now.

194
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,554
It was Baek Jenna.

195
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,848
She hated Kim Hae-in's guts.

196
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,309
You don't know

197
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,397
how scary Jenna is.

198
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,983
Jenna would've wanted her dead.

199
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,110
She was being threatened too.

200
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,655
Baek Jenna?

201
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,575
And

202
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,370
Kim Hae-in threatened Jenna?

203
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,915
But

204
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,334
she couldn't be the culprit.

205
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,044
Hey.

206
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,046
What?

207
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,590
I should ask you that.

208
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,717
What are you on about?

209
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,679
Are you a transfer?

210
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,601
Yes. Jenna's not the culprit.

211
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,145
She didn't recognize me at first.

212
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,524
Why do you think she tried
to get you to drop out

213
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,151
by bullying you so hard?

214
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,235
Because…

215
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,157
Because…

216
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,784
But…

217
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,079
No, Si-eun. First--

218
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,372
Okay.

219
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,666
Let's do this.

220
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,502
Make Jenna the culprit.

221
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,796
What?

222
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,965
You're the witness.

223
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,636
Say you saw Jenna push Hae-in from behind.

224
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,348
Are you a real psycho? I've had enough.

225
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,434
How conscientious do you think you are?

226
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,269
Know your place.

227
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,397
Crazy bitch.

228
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,232
You're really crazy.

229
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,367
I'll pretend I didn't hear the request.

230
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,204
And

231
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,624
stay away from me from now on.

232
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,043
How you pretended to be a friend
gives me the chills.

233
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,338
Wait, Hye-in.

234
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,009
It wasn't a request.

235
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,387
It was a threat.

236
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,640
What the fuck are you talking about?

237
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,944
Would I have paid pervy Duk-min a fortune

238
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,446
to get this video for nothing?

239
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,825
You don't know the position you're in.

240
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,326
You…

241
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,956
One touch of my finger

242
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,835
and the whole school
will get your disgusting video.

243
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,461
Do you not mind?

244
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,136
Look at that face.

245
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,933
You can be so simple-minded.

246
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,604
You stripped for five million won,

247
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:07,609
transferred to this school
after seeing someone fall from the roof.

248
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,528
Hey.

249
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,824
Do you like freebies that much?

250
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,301
Why are you doing this to me?

251
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,054
What's the reason for all of this?

252
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,014
What did I do to you?

253
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,726
No, it's not because of something you did.

254
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:48,776
I just want you to do me a small favor.

255
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,617
Of course I remember.

256
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,577
The maid who kept breaking plates

257
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,787
-when you were young?
-Yes.

258
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,083
She was sweet, though.

259
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,210
She just had shaky hands.

260
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,506
It's so much fun to talk about
the past. It's been a while.

261
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,425
They say you're old
if you like talking about the past.

262
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,260
Hey.

263
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:22,226
Still, I guess I was happier back then.

264
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,353
I laughed as we talked.

265
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,817
How come you do better
at the hospital than at home?

266
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,068
I wonder why.

267
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,778
Hospital life must suit me.

268
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,614
Visit me often.

269
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,283
You want me to skip school often?

270
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,410
Life is short.

271
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,497
A student should
skip school sometimes too.

272
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,293
I'm off now.

273
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,878
Why?

274
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,214
Don't. It's cold, so don't come outside.

275
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,560
See you.

276
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,193
MS. SEO

277
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,572
Yes. The shareholders
won't like instability.

278
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,743
Ms. Seo's shares will be mentioned
at the general assembly.

279
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,582
If we consider the future
of the chairman's son that will be born,

280
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,168
we will need some restructuring.

281
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,129
I understand.

282
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,339
I'll handle it as soon as possible.

283
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:58,238
OH SI-EUN: UNLESS YOU WANT TO
RUIN YOUR LIFE, GRANT MY REQUEST

284
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,241
Request, my ass.

285
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,452
She called it a threat.

286
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,461
But that's a real crime.

287
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,422
It's not just anyone.

288
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,840
It's Baek Jenna.

289
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,432
My life will really be ruined.

290
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,400
WITNESS APPEAL: NOV. 24
BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND 3 A.M.,

291
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,485
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING

292
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,028
OR SAW A GIRL FALL
FROM CIHS'S ROOF, PLEASE CALL

293
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,988
MY DAUGHTER WOULD NEVER
COMMIT SUICIDE!

294
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,955
Yes. I already committed a crime.

295
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,669
I shouldn't have turned a blind eye.

296
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:58,382
I shouldn't have come to this damn school.

297
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,715
I'm already losing my mind.

298
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,592
Why do you have to show up now?

299
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,720
Why yell as soon as you see me?

300
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,556
We agreed to ignore each other.

301
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,393
So please, just stay out of my life.

302
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,395
What's going on?

303
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,815
Her and me both.

304
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,277
Why must we go through this
for coming to this school?

305
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,195
I feel sorry for us.

306
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,699
I'm so sorry I wanted something
that was out of place for me.

307
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,869
You don't have to feel sorry for her.

308
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,912
What?

309
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,789
Dead Hae-in.

310
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,667
She's not like you.

311
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,465
Was it you who…

312
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,675
Me what?

313
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,598
Never mind.

314
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,602
Why are you acting
out of character and crying?

315
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,146
Act like you usually do.

316
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,191
Callously grab people by the hair

317
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,359
and beat them up.

318
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,823
You said you'd stay and graduate.

319
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,537
You're even more horrid when you're nice.

320
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,167
I'm being nice? This is nice?

321
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,422
How crazy must you be for me to give up?

322
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,972
OH SI-EUN

323
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,688
One more thing.

324
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,237
Beware of Oh Si-eun.

325
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,038
OH SI-EUN

326
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,654
Seo Do-eon.

327
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,699
I'll accept your offer.

328
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:14,369
In return, help me out with something.

329
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,959
Seo Do…

330
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:28,300
What… Are you two officially--

331
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,010
Can you give us some privacy?

332
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,511
What? Why?

333
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,013
What are you two going to do?

334
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,768
-You won't--
-What else would a couple do?

335
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,313
You must know. Right, babe?

336
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,024
Yes.

337
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,526
Hurry.

338
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,156
Seo Do-eon, you've changed a lot.

339
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,617
You used to always back out.

340
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,995
Fine. I'm leaving.

341
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,081
Bye.

342
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,723
You're not kidding, are you?

343
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,391
Shut up and start looking.

344
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,197
I found it.

345
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,740
Why won't it open?

346
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,159
Wait.

347
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,003
Hey.

348
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,140
KIM MIN-JIN
LIM SO-YOUNG

349
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,365
I found it.

350
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,045
Yes. You found it?

351
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,716
Yes. You know what to do, right?
Wrap it up nicely.

352
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,926
I got it. Okay.

353
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,224
Come on, Duk-min.

354
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,476
Type the password.

355
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,477
Okay.

356
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:51,234
But just so you know,
I meant to keep it for personal use.

357
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,777
I really wasn't going to post--

358
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,863
It's okay to keep the videos?

359
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,992
The pervert has a twisted logic too.

360
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,665
Your fellow students can only relax
when you've deleted it for good.

361
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,542
Right?

362
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,629
Type your cloud password, punk.

363
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,673
Okay.

364
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,101
You know you must accomplish
the mission I gave you, right?

365
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,603
Yes.

366
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,647
After today,

367
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,817
if any of these videos
should ever appear online…

368
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,363
You know I have a video
of you on my phone.

369
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,158
You'll go down too.

370
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:41,951
Okay.

371
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,998
If I delete everything,
will you delete that too?

372
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,166
Get typing.

373
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,626
Sorry.

374
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,170
-Type.
-Okay.

375
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,718
Yes.

376
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,138
I'm Kim Hye-in, a crazy girl
that even Baek Jenna acknowledged.

377
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:06,851
I can't let another crazy girl
take me down.

378
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,731
Is the chairman still in?

379
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:12,816
Yes.

380
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,416
What are you doing here?

381
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:33,169
I was in the area
and dropped by for dinner.

382
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,966
I didn't know you'd be here, Jenna.

383
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,721
Can't an only daughter
come to see her dad?

384
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,433
Did I make my mom feel all uncomfortable?

385
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,186
"Mom?"

386
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,688
Come on, you.

387
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:56,234
Telling her to call you "Mom" already
when people are watching. It's a bit…

388
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,196
I don't know what Jenna said, but--

389
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,699
It's okay. I understand.

390
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,701
I'll get going now.

391
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,287
Why? You won't join us for dinner?

392
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,874
No. Don't leave. Come with us, Jenna.

393
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,334
-Yes.
-What did you say you liked?

394
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,087
I can't ruin your date.

395
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,299
Today, I didn't come here for dinner.

396
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,217
I came to see Dad work.

397
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,513
To learn in advance what Dad does.

398
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,901
Aren't you going on your date?

399
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,279
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

400
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,201
Since when were you
an affectionate daughter?

401
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,496
Why?

402
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,956
Now that I'm actually affectionate,

403
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,501
do you hate me even more?

404
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,169
What?

405
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,924
If needed, rich people
treat family like business partners.

406
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,218
You didn't know that?

407
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,225
The baby you're carrying
will become the Hanmyung Group heir?

408
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,937
I wonder if it'll even stand a chance.

409
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,105
Against someone like me, no less.

410
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,984
Not to mention
if he has half his mom's DNA…

411
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,029
It'll be real tough.

412
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,239
How dare you say that?

413
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,783
You shouldn't have come after me first.

414
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,409
I'm Baek Jenna.

415
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,872
Listen up, Stepmom.

416
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,961
Your stepdaughter always gives back
what she's dealt with.

417
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,421
To whomever that may be.

418
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,607
OH SI-EUN:
D-5

419
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:13,454
LEE SO-MANG: I'LL GO GET
OH SI-EUN'S LAPTOP TOO.

420
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,336
Oh Si-eun.

421
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,255
Just you wait.

422
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,508
You're dead meat.

423
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,776
What's this?

424
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,138
What's this?

425
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,810
What are you doing?

426
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,731
-Wait.
-Why?

427
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,394
KIM HAE-IN

428
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:44,147
Other girls have stripped here before you.

429
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,406
Many others.

430
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,868
What kind of person

431
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,203
are you really?

432
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:03,392
