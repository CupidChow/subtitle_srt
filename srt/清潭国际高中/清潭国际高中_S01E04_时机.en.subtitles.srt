1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,954
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,215
Chairman?

3
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,383
Are you there?

4
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,385
So?

5
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:53,887
How's the kid?

6
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,181
Is she dead?

7
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,434
She's in surgery,
but it's not looking good.

8
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,187
Did you check the security camera footage?

9
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,397
I told the police
they were down for maintenance

10
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,940
and deleted the footage but…

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,942
But what?

12
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,863
I don't think it was suicide.

13
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,286
If she got in
via the Equal Opportunity System,

14
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,748
it doesn't matter if she dies or not.

15
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,334
What's important to us

16
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,586
isn't who died,

17
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,714
but who killed.

18
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,143
Listen carefully, Mr. Yoon.

19
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:49,192
What happened tonight
must be treated like it never happened.

20
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,529
Say the dead student took her own life…

21
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,073
due to the stress of studying.

22
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,746
Many students in Korea
kill themselves for that reason.

23
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,166
It's not even newsworthy.

24
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,170
Do you get what I'm saying?

25
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,130
Yes.

26
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,300
But there's…

27
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,428
a little problem.

28
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,813
A witness?

29
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,530
No. It's good.

30
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,992
I'll handle that kid.

31
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,766
We have similar names.

32
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,144
KIM HAE-IN

33
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,398
Someone, help!

34
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,693
Is anyone there?

35
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,863
Help! Someone's dying!

36
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,490
Help!

37
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,784
So, someone fell…

38
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,536
Gosh…

39
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,204
From the rooftop.

40
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,549
She was bleeding.

41
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:42,013
I'd never seen
anything like that in my life.

42
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,392
I was so scared and shocked.

43
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,145
Oh, no…

44
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,480
Calm down.

45
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:54,525
So you're sure you saw
someone else on the rooftop?

46
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,611
What a long day.

47
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:44,534
It's almost time for school,
so why hasn't she left yet?

48
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,123
What? Why is she coming
from that way and not from home?

49
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:51,791
Hey.

50
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:56,879
What do you want?

51
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,798
What else?

52
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,385
You didn't answer your phone,
so I got anxious and came over.

53
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,306
Are you just coming home now?

54
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,350
My phone's off because the battery died,

55
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,312
and I was at a hospital all night…

56
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,275
It's none of your business.

57
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,236
What did you come all the way here for?

58
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:26,117
You're not here to see my dad
because of what I did to Na-yeon, are you?

59
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,077
Goodness. What are you talking about?

60
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,290
I'm here because I have business with you,
and I want to ask you what happened.

61
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,837
What did you do to win the chairman over

62
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,714
when I couldn't
with money or connections?

63
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,383
He said, one word from you,

64
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:46,054
and he'll let Na-yeon
into Cheongdam International High School.

65
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,638
What?

66
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,516
We'll drop the lawsuit.

67
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,896
And I'll tell your school
it was a misunderstanding on our part.

68
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,857
What on earth are you…

69
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,358
Mr. Kim.

70
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,198
Can you grab me the thing?

71
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,199
Yes, ma'am.

72
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,884
All is well as long as
we get what we want.

73
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,969
If my Na-yeon can get into CIHS,

74
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,181
there's no reason for us
to be at each other's throats.

75
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,769
So will you please put in
a good word with the chairman for her?

76
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,980
I spent a lot of money to get her a spot,

77
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,566
but if my husband's business
is to flourish,

78
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,485
we need to make connections…

79
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,490
I don't have to say any more, right?

80
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,159
Right? Will you help us out?

81
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:01,879
Dad.

82
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,632
You didn't go to work?

83
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,803
Where in the world have you been?

84
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,682
I stayed at a friend's place.

85
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,352
We studied together and I dozed off.

86
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,149
Who's the woman
I saw you talking to outside?

87
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,067
And what's that in your hand?

88
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,446
Well…

89
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,324
It's nothing.

90
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,869
I'm tired and sleepy.

91
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,912
You should go to work.

92
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,664
Stop right there!

93
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,293
You didn't call,
so I was worried all night.

94
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,879
Do you think saying nothing happened
makes it okay?

95
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:47,175
If you went out
and got into trouble without me knowing…

96
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,802
What do you want me to say?

97
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,973
-How dare you--
-I get it.

98
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,100
If I get in trouble,

99
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,103
we have no money or connections
to solve the problem.

100
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:04,108
Even if I do get in trouble,
I'll take care of it myself,

101
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,527
so mind your own business.

102
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,655
You…

103
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,782
MISSED CALL

104
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,095
SOLVING ONE PROBLEM WON'T MAKE
YOUR MISERABLE LIFE BETTER.

105
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,388
CALL ME WHEN YOU GET THIS.

106
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,811
My life is already bleak and miserable,

107
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,230
and this is making it even worse.

108
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,024
Hello?

109
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,603
The doctor says…

110
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,023
there's no hope.

111
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,901
And the school…

112
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,905
says it's suicide
due to stress about her grades

113
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,785
when she's not even dead yet.

114
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,998
But to see that she has friends

115
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,376
who came to cheer her on…

116
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,671
I'm so very grateful.

117
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,591
Stay strong, ma'am.

118
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,593
Hae-in will get better.

119
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,477
But, ma'am…

120
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,357
Did someone other than me visit her?

121
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,317
What?

122
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:39,698
You just said her friends came by.

123
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,700
Oh.

124
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,371
One student from
Cheongdam International High School

125
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,581
came by before you did.

126
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:53,421
They said they are
Hae-in's closest friend in school.

127
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,631
A Cheongdam student…

128
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,134
said they were her friend?

129
00:11:58,717 --> 00:11:59,677
What is it?

130
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,724
There are no such things as friends there.

131
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,980
DO NOT ENTER - OPEN CASE

132
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,989
The cafeteria. That's where we can eat.

133
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,032
What else is there?

134
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,540
Seo Do-eon?

135
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,375
What?

136
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,461
Never mind.

137
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,173
What you have seen so far
are the school's main buildings.

138
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,925
The annex over there

139
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,387
is where Chemistry, Biology, Humanities,

140
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,181
and some other departments are.

141
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,059
You'll figure things out in a few days.

142
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,478
Do I have to explain?

143
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,229
What?

144
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,231
Aren't you going to give me a full tour?

145
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,987
This is…

146
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,245
I'm volunteering
because I'm being reprimanded,

147
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,831
but I have
a strong sense of responsibility.

148
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,584
I'll give you an important tip
about life here

149
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,503
which is a hundred times more valuable
than a tour.

150
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,171
So shall we say we're even?

151
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,593
Students here
have a rank that's invisible.

152
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,388
We're divided
based on our parents' assets.

153
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,148
That's not how you eat that.

154
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,692
You've never had it before,
so you don't know.

155
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,626
You can't do what you never learned.

156
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,129
Why's he always like that?

157
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,673
We could do without him.

158
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,008
He ruins the atmosphere.

159
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:07,179
That's why retaliation or insubordination
are never tolerated.

160
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,099
You can't even afford to hire a lawyer.

161
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,850
You leech off of us

162
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,645
because you can't afford the tuition,
let alone get your name up here.

163
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,021
GENEROUS BENEFACTORS
(HONORS CLUB)

164
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,982
Well, you can sue.

165
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,109
If you have the money to.

166
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,530
You know my dad's a senior judge, right?

167
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,161
The queen of our school hates
impudent students the most.

168
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,372
-Gosh.
-Be quiet.

169
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,586
You.

170
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,464
Point at your name.

171
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,178
Where is it?

172
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:50,931
Well…

173
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,862
OVER 100 MILLION WON: GOLD CLUB

174
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,699
Oh. Way down there.

175
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,910
That's your position.

176
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,121
Don't you think…

177
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,249
it's a bit too shabby to brag…

178
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,878
in front of that leech?

179
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,593
So aside from everything else,

180
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,055
shouldn't you know where you stand here?

181
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,683
To not end up like that?

182
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,519
That's it?

183
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,982
My dad owns
a cosmetic surgery clinic in Apgujeong.

184
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,031
I heard you studied in the U.K.

185
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,200
So I guess you really don't know anything
about our school.

186
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,204
If your dad owns a cosmetic clinic…

187
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,667
it means you're on the bottom rung here.

188
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,961
Think you can manage?

189
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,176
The Office of Education

190
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,096
wants us to increase the ratio
of Equal Opportunity students?

191
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,639
To three or four percent per year,

192
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,349
-so up to three students.
-Come on.

193
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,560
-Show me.
-Hold him tighter.

194
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,979
Will you show me?

195
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:24,900
I apologize.

196
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,784
I heard you made the starting lineup.

197
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,995
Congratulations.

198
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,538
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

199
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,831
Your father must be proud.

200
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,459
Well, yes. Thank you.

201
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,961
Good.

202
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,050
What's so good about it?

203
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,760
-Let's have a look.
-Hey.

204
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,193
NAME, STUDENT NUMBER, NOTES

205
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,950
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY SYSTEM:
HWANG MIN-SU, KIM MIN-GYEOM

206
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:24,585
Today, we'll talk about
teenager suicide prevention.

207
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,005
I'd like to touch on
controlling your emotions.

208
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,508
Being honest and open about how you feel.

209
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,763
In other words, mind control
is most important when preventing teen…

210
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,724
Guys.

211
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,351
Am I boring you?

212
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,605
-Yes.
-It's no fun.

213
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,398
Why must we even listen to this?

214
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,443
"Why?"

215
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:55,365
Recently, one of your classmates
jumped from the school rooftop.

216
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,826
She's still in a coma.

217
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,789
This talk is to help prevent
such an unfortunate incident

218
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,624
from happening again--

219
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,125
What if it's not unfortunate?

220
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,211
What?

221
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,886
I think what happened
is prevention enough.

222
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,147
Everyone will have learned by now.

223
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,576
Should we leave too?

224
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,084
It's insane.
Did you hear about Kim Hye-in?

225
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,596
-What?
-She's packing her stuff?

226
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,476
Isn't she leaving
because she's embarrassed?

227
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,894
I would, if I were her.

228
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,815
I'd be so ashamed.

229
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,779
Move.

230
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,409
Kim Hye-in.

231
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,037
What is it now?

232
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,624
You really don't know what you did wrong.

233
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,505
It's not that you lied
about being rich when you're not.

234
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,549
Feeling embarrassed about it

235
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,427
and trying to cover it up
is what you did wrong.

236
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,055
My family's not that well-off,

237
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:46,602
but I never felt embarrassed about
the environment I was brought up in.

238
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,272
Did I ever ask?

239
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,941
What a joke.

240
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,905
Why that little…

241
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,656
Hey, guys.

242
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,033
Listen.

243
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,745
Hye-in was forced to transfer to
Cheongdam International High.

244
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,040
No way.

245
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,375
Is she not lying again?

246
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,134
Did you have to quit working too?

247
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,764
What CIHS student works part-time?

248
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,351
I'm a CIHS student now,
so I should act accordingly.

249
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,395
My goodness.

250
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,564
How great could a high school be?

251
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,693
Do you know that

252
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,863
scholarship students there
get so many various benefits?

253
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,950
The school chairman said

254
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,744
Equal Opportunity students like me

255
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,497
get their college enrollment fee
and tuition paid in full.

256
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,042
They even send us
to quarterly language courses abroad.

257
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,005
People really do love free handouts.

258
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,967
It's not a free handout. It's a benefit.

259
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,137
The first day I was there,

260
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:50,183
do you know what I saw
that shocked me to the core?

261
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,103
What did you see?

262
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,299
Forget it.

263
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,675
What's the point in telling you?

264
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:31,141
Anyway, my going to that school
could be a once-in-a-lifetime benefit

265
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,351
and chance to change my life,

266
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,938
so I decided to bet
my life on that school.

267
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,357
Don't be so cynical.

268
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,403
Why would you say I was cynical?

269
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,656
It feels like a loss on my part.

270
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,745
With you gone, who will give me
free expired convenience store food?

271
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,417
The nighttime part-time slot
that used to be mine.

272
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,920
Are you not interested?

273
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,589
I don't want to hear
another word about that.

274
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,091
You finish your story.

275
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,515
You and the school chairman.

276
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,184
What deal did you make…

277
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,687
for the once-in-a-lifetime chance

278
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,107
to come to you?

279
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,488
There was an extra opening
in the Equal Opportunity System.

280
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,573
There was no deal.

281
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,118
You said he contacted you first.

282
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,122
He didn't?

283
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,459
Oh, right.

284
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,963
I withdrew the money I was saving up
for college.

285
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,425
I won't need it once I start
at Cheongdam International.

286
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,972
For the first and last time,
I'll treat you to pork belly.

287
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,683
Let's go eat.

288
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,102
What?

289
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:58,937
Pork belly?

290
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,191
Kim Hye-in, you…

291
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,949
You have great presence of mind
and sense of reason.

292
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,076
Let's go right away.

293
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,496
-Pork belly.
-Pork belly.

294
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,582
-Are you that happy?
-You bet.

295
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,208
You're happy a younger person's buying?

296
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,418
I'm hungry,

297
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,336
but let's just say
you're older than me today.

298
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,172
You haven't showered today.

299
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,340
But you love me.

300
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,821
Thank you.

301
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,879
KIM HYE-IN

302
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,279
Do you have something in mind?

303
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,950
Oh, well…

304
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:45,794
Oh.

305
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,171
Those pumps.

306
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,966
How much were these Mary Jane shoes?

307
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:54,219
Those? They were 900,000,
maybe 800,000 won.

308
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,847
Their shoes are at least a million won.

309
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:00,809
Would you like to try them on?

310
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,145
-They cost 1.4 million--
-I know.

311
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:08,608
That's the pair that costs
1.45 million won, right?

312
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,194
I don't need to try them on.

313
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,280
Give me that pair.

314
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,415
I splurged.

315
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,501
If I make minimum wage,

316
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,587
it's worth 158 hours of work.

317
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,008
I should've just bought

318
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,592
ten 140,000 won pairs.

319
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,929
I must be out of my mind.

320
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,348
No.

321
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,518
A uniform of this caliber
deserves shoes like these.

322
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,270
As it's the standard.

323
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,246
Are you looking for something
in particular?

324
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,414
Oh, no.

325
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,070
You're a CIHS student.

326
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,448
Why not buy one? It doesn't cost much.

327
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:43,536
You won't want to wear
just any jacket over that uniform.

328
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,081
That's true,

329
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,083
but I already spent a lot today.

330
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,042
Oh.

331
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,461
Can I just try it on?

332
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,880
Yes, of course you can.
I'll take that for you.

333
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,134
Let me help.

334
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,305
Would you like to try this one?

335
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,270
It suits you well.

336
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,484
Would you like to try this on too?

337
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,653
Okay.

338
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,164
Gosh.

339
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,712
-Sorry.
-What are you…

340
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,383
What was that about?

341
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,510
Just saying sorry doesn't make it okay.

342
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,806
Oh, no.

343
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,477
Shoot.

344
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,955
The shoes are fine, fortunately.

345
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,377
Gosh, it's so annoying.

346
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:16,880
Oh?

347
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,891
THE UNIFORM YOU GOT IN EXCHANGE
FOR MURDER SUITS YOU WELL

348
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,111
Gosh.

349
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,452
That girl from earlier?

350
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,464
Hey, excuse me.

351
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,883
Sorry.

352
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,220
Shit.

353
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,725
Where on earth did she go?

354
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,477
I feel weird and awful now.

355
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,614
Oh. Right.

356
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,074
My shoes.

357
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,204
What?

358
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,997
Where are my shoes?

359
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,834
I'm sure I left them here.

360
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,421
It's not like they could've just run off.

361
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,048
Where did they go?

362
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,655
Hey.

363
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,241
What?

364
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,743
I should ask you that.

365
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,704
Who are you?

366
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,418
You're wearing my uniform.

367
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,212
And you're asking who I am?

368
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,341
Shouldn't you deny it first?

369
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,677
What are you on about?

370
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,348
Are you a transfer?

371
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,434
Don't you know who I am?

372
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:41,524
You. I'll let you off today
because I'm in a bad mood.

373
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,862
Stay out of my sight at school.

374
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,408
You little piece of shit.

375
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,494
"Shit?"

376
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,205
How dare that thief say that to me?

377
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,165
You can't just walk off.

378
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,208
What are you doing? Are you insane?

379
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,002
Even prison food's a waste on you.

380
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,631
I'll educate you with my own hands,
so keep on talking.

381
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:21,272
EPILOGUE

382
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,526
I should go now.

383
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:29,405
Okay. Thanks for coming, Min-sol.

384
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,828
Oh, right. Ma'am.

385
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:42,210
The other Cheongdam High student
you said came by.

386
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,545
Do you know their name?

387
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,423
Well,

388
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,636
I don't remember their family name.

389
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,098
Oh, their name was…

390
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,977
What?

391
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:00,955
