1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,954
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,457
Jenna.

3
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,335
You're going to be an older sister now.

4
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,379
I'm 12 weeks along now.

5
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,965
We'll become a family soon.

6
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,676
Let's not anger or humiliate each other.

7
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,390
This is madness.

8
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,310
How dare she…

9
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:01,978
Jenna!

10
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,407
Do we have any more alcohol in the cellar?

11
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,122
It's my daughter.

12
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,291
You're so pretty.

13
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,461
You drinking in the middle of the day?
You're already drunk.

14
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,717
Didn't you hear what your doctor said?

15
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,429
You can't drink alcohol
while you're on anti-depressants!

16
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,724
You had more than one or two glasses.
How much did you drink?

17
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,436
The English teacher's pregnant?

18
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,815
Your dad must be overjoyed.

19
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,984
It'll be the icing on the cake
if it's a boy.

20
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,571
She did what I couldn't do.

21
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,574
Chairman Baek is so blessed.

22
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,202
How can you say things like that?

23
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,247
It's okay.

24
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,415
Chairman Baek.

25
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,044
That fool got to where he is thanks to me.

26
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,213
So how dare he…

27
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,056
My marriage was like an empty shell.

28
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,892
I think it's actually for the better.

29
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,353
So…

30
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,357
will you please just let it slide?
Just for today.

31
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,362
To celebrate my decision to divorce.

32
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,660
More alcohol!

33
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,453
Mom!

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,210
I'm okay.

35
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,087
You're not okay!

36
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,756
Get her medicine. Hurry.

37
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,510
Hurry!

38
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,894
Hye-in, come and eat.

39
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,782
Come and sit down.

40
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,202
Oh, I'm not hungry.

41
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,122
Why not?

42
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,583
Sit and at least try to eat something.

43
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,542
Here.

44
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,466
Here you go.

45
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,260
Now, let's eat.

46
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,680
-Oh, gosh.
-Goodness. Eat up.

47
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,564
-Dad.
-Yes?

48
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,274
Do you have…

49
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,985
some money?

50
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:58,863
Money?

51
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,619
Why? Does that darn school
want you to buy something?

52
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,664
Well,

53
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,916
something like that.

54
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,046
Lucky for you, yesterday was payday.

55
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,589
How much do you need?

56
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,636
So I need about

57
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,597
eight million…

58
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,016
What? How much?

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,769
Eight million…

60
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,604
Will you be quiet?

61
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,106
Eight million won.

62
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,529
Can you give me that much?

63
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,914
What did you just say?

64
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,541
Eight million? You--

65
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,459
Hey. Open this door!

66
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,878
Have you lost your mind?

67
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,466
I get less than 80,000 won a week,
and you want what? Eight million?

68
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,261
Do you even know
how much Father makes a month?

69
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,221
Hey, leave her alone.

70
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,140
I'm sure she misspoke.

71
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,183
Father.

72
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,437
How can you say
"eight million won" by mistake?

73
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,066
That brat got into CIHS
which is way beyond her means,

74
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,027
and she's getting ideas.

75
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,909
What the heck?

76
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,626
How can you think of dry-cleaning
a dress that expensive?

77
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,297
I'll give you one month.
Pay me in full for the dress.

78
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:44,052
If you miss the date, I'll go straight to
my mom, so keep that in mind.

79
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,012
I was just a lucky lowborn

80
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,182
who got invited to a party for the nobles.

81
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,937
For a very brief while, I thought…

82
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,113
Do you know her?

83
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,120
Wow, what a pretty dress.

84
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,414
It suits you well.

85
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,965
SOLE HEIRESS TO SJ FASHION,

86
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,633

89
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,818
JK LAW FIRM

90

JM ENTERTAINMENT HEIRESS JUST
AS STUNNING AS ACTRESS MOTHER

91
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,122
RANK, COMPANY, MARKET WORTH

92
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,624
MOGULS AND CELEBS, HONORARY
CHAIRMAN, HOSPITAL DIRECTOR

93
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,635
I thought that perhaps I was…

94
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,683
not that different…

95
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:02,398
from the other girls that were there.

96
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:56,536
Even if it was for free,
didn't you take it a bit too willingly?

97
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:02,625
Those brats. This is an expensive dress.

98
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,670
Ouch, my ankle.

99
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,715
Are you okay?

100
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,300
Hey.

101
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,928
You're…

102
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,517
You don't know me?

103
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,103
I know you.

104
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,982
Nice to meet you.
You're Seo Do-eon's girlfriend.

105
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,319
Why are you here?

106
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,531
A party like this is
way beneath my standards,

107
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,908
but someone insisted
I should attend this time.

108
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,952
So I did.

109
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,294
It's Baek Jenna.

110
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,547
I'd wish she'd follow me on Instagram.

111
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,632
Isn't she beautiful?

112
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,098
-Look.
-She's so pretty.

113
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,030
Oh, no. The dress…

114
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,740
This costs a fortune!

115
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,785
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

116
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,662
What did I do?

117
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,539
The dress is getting stained.

118
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,885
Are you crazy?

119
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,639
You're the crazy one.

120
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,266
How dare you set foot in here?

121
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,896
Did you think dating Do-eon
actually made you a somebody?

122
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,357
Listen up.

123
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:36,821
People like you, unless you're reborn,
can never escape your lowly status.

124
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,658
So know your place.

125
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,035
Don't get in my way.

126
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,455
Baek Jenna.

127
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,542
You need another beating, don't you?

128
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,671
What are you doing? What did I do?

129
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,089
Will you please leave?

130
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:58,217
What do you mean? She started it.

131
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,636
If you want me to leave,
send her away first.

132
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,680
Why do you only pick on me?

133
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,227
What a moron.

134
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,438
Who cares who's right or wrong?

135
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,648
All these people are employed by…

136
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,192
Baek Jenna herself.

137
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,952
HANMYUNG - LEE YU-SIN

138
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,522
Ms. Jenna.

139
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:57,693
Dr. Moon called about your mother.

140
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,874
She has to be admitted
for a few days to rest.

141
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,129
Which housekeeper cleans my room?

142
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,049
Why do you ask?

143
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,050
Fire her.

144
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,303
After she's done cleaning,

145
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,723
I told her to put my things
back in the right place.

146
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,352
It bothers me that things
keep getting moved around.

147
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,147
If it's about that,
a warning and not a dismissal--

148
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,565
I think

149
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:42,071
a thing or person
should not stray from their places.

150
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,159
They keep forgetting their place.

151
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,789
That's out of line.

152
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:01,257
CHAIRMAN B'S TRUE LOVE
AND HOW IT'LL AFFECT SUCCESSION

153
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,936
I bet Kim Hye-in's all stressed out now.

154
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,730
I should go now.

155
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,650
It was fun meeting…

156
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,235
It was an honor to meet you.

157
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,987
-Okay. See you again.
-Sure.

158
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,786
Baek Jenna.

159
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,788
You…

160
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,000
What did you do to Hye-in
at the party yesterday?

161
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,672
If you came all the way here to complain,

162
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,925
the rumor that you're dating
that leech must be true.

163
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,012
I'm disappointed by your low standards.

164
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,763
You think that's important?

165
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,017
Even if we weren't dating,

166
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,103
I was going to ask you to quit
your childish bullying.

167
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,023
Because of us…

168
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,319
someone almost died.

169
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,450
Aren't you talking about
the other Kim Hae-in?

170
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,202
The girl you actually like.

171
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,833
I was going to say something too.

172
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,961
I don't know if you have
a fetish for poor girls,

173
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,923
or if you have a thing
for names that sound like "Hae-in."

174
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,925
-Hey.
-Fuck.

175
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,137
Let me give you a piece of advice
from a friend of 18 years.

176
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:32,723
You, Do-eon.

177
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,393
If you want to fall in love,
wait until your next incarnation.

178
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,105
Though even if you're born just as poor,

179
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,401
I doubt they'll let you toy with them.

180
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,574
Jeez.

181
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,245
You think dating a poor girl
makes it the romance of the century.

182
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,958
Men are pathetic.

183
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,127
You don't know anything about Hae-in.

184
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,587
Don't talk about her like that.

185
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:05,923
Hey.

186
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,967
You think I don't know?

187
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,260
You'll end up…

188
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,764
just like my mom.

189
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,353
People like them just want to use us
as a ladder to climb society.

190
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,107
She just forgot her place and fell.

191
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,483
I told you to stop!

192
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,906
Please.

193
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,951
You're the one
who didn't know about Hae-in.

194
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,079
I bet all the kids in
the Diamond Club knew.

195
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,020
-Oh, no. The dress…
-Bucket girl?

196
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:05,024
What on earth is she getting up to
at and away from school?

197
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,572
Gosh.

198
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,666
What was that?

199
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,210
UNMANNED HOTEL

200
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,634
Are you "Real Love?"

201
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,677
Oh.

202
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,639
Are you "Typical Poor
Peninsula Highschooler"?

203
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,558
-Yes.
-Just a moment.

204
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,602
I brought cash.

205
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,228
Let me count it out.

206
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,189
Go ahead.

207
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,529
What? You're "Real Love?"

208
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,823
I should fry you in the pits of hell.

209
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,576
How can you do this to a minor?

210
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,703
-Who are you?
-Me?

211
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,789
I'm Lee So-mang, son of the son of God.

212
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,958
Tonight, I'll kill you
in the name of Jesus.

213
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,960
Lee So-mang from school?

214
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,215
You crazy brat.

215
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,175
There are some things you should never do

216
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,927
no matter how much
you're in need of money.

217
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,011
What are you on about?

218
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,138
I'm selling second-hand stuff
because I need money.

219
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,481
-Second-hand stuff?
-Darn you.

220
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:32,027
She said it was new and never worn,
so I wanted it for my girlfriend.

221
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,154
Why did you do that to me?

222
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,041
I'm really sorry.

223
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,012
Hey…

224
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,349
One more word and I'll rip off your lips.

225
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,352
Hey, wait.

226
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,729
Kim Hye-in.

227
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,945
Why do you always walk off in a huff?

228
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,281
Bucket Girl.

229
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,576
I'm talking to you.
You could at least pretend to listen.

230
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,829
Anyone would've misread the situation.

231
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,415
But why are you so angry about it?

232
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,295
Because of you,
I lost an extra 50,000 won.

233
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,594
You're not angry
I misunderstood the situation?

234
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,723
You're this pissed that
you didn't get the 50,000 won?

235
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,018
A measly 50,000 won?

236
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,396
"Measly"?

237
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,649
Why do you think I'm walking home

238
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,444
this late at night
when I live quite far away?

239
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,200
To spend more time with me?

240
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,957
It can't be to save
a little on the taxi fare.

241
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,089
For real?

242
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,385
Seriously?

243
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,263
That's why you're walking home?

244
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,933
Do you know what really pisses me off?

245
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,437
I was humiliated at the party,

246
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,107
and everyone laughed at and mocked me.

247
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,737
But more than that,
I'm annoyed that if I don't get the money

248
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,448
for the dress,
I don't know what'll happen to me.

249
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,912
For chump change that's nothing to
the kids at Cheongdam International High.

250
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,414
A measly eight million won.

251
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,668
Why are you talking like that to me?

252
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,420
Anyone would've misread the situation?

253
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,172
What a joke.

254
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,925
Put a hand on your heart and think.

255
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:05,222
If it had been Baek Jenna and not me,
would you have had the same gross idea?

256
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,099
Of course I wouldn't…

257
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:11,979
See?

258
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,529
Hey, so how much is it?

259
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,206
That did not look cool at all.

260
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,126
-Gosh.
-And I thought

261
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,712
you'd be cool
and give me the eight million.

262
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,088
Did I ask for a ride?

263
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,717
You said you'd walk
because you can't afford the taxi fare.

264
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,804
Hey, do you really go to CIHS?

265
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,808
Or like me, are you also an Equal Oppor--

266
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,892
Hey.

267
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,646
My family's not too shabby
compared to the other kids there.

268
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,815
Wow.

269
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:59,359
I wish I could say something like that.

270
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,118
But it's not all great.

271
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,205
You're so spoiled
you don't know you're blessed.

272
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,459
Try living like me and see if it's great.

273
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,836
Will you live like me, then?

274
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,505
-No.
-That was quick.

275
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,424
Why are you following me?

276
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,051
I have nothing else to do.

277
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,980
Part-time acting?

278
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,402
150,000 won?

279
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,034
Two hours a day.

280
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,161
BRUNCH CAFÉ, 9,800 WON/HOUR,
2 HOURS/DAY

281
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,829
MATH TUTOR, 3 TIMES/WEEK,
COLLEGE STUDENTS ONLY

282
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,956
CONVENIENCE STORE NIGHT SHIFT,
6 HOURS

283
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,249
CAFÉ, WEEKENDS

284
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,626
TOO FAR AWAY

285
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,722
How's school life?

286
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,641
I heard you weren't well.

287
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,811
Oh, well, yes.

288
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:22,067
You just transferred and it seems like
you lost your enthusiasm already.

289
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,577
Read these and pick one.

290
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,997
SECOND-HALF SCHOLARSHIP SUPPORT

291
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,750
What? We get a house too?

292
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,669
It's not for good.

293
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,421
You get a monthly scholarship, right?

294
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,425
We just kicked off a new program
that's separate from that.

295
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,637
You could move into a rental apartment.

296
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,683
There are students
who don't even have their own room

297
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,853
and they should study too.

298
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,983
There are company-funded scholarships too
so take a good look.

299
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,623
LEECH LOL

300
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,197
It really sucks.

301
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,158
Same here.

302
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,995
Do you get it now?

303
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,706
However hard you try,

304
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,376
your existence
is meaningless and pointless.

305
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,586
You lot.

306
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,256
Whenever you see me,
you keep telling me to know my place.

307
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,842
I know my place.

308
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,722
How could I not when every day sucks?

309
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,891
The problem is that I know so well.

310
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:20,477
But…

311
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,314
you don't seem to know your place at all.

312
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,151
You haven't come to your senses yet.

313
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:34,950
You go to a psychotic school for the rich
where people call you a Diamond

314
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,162
and you have everything in the world
anyone could possibly want.

315
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,040
And yet you follow around people like me

316
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,293
who have nothing at all
and get all worked up.

317
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,670
Isn't that crossing the line?

318
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,425
I get all worked up?

319
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,345
Over an Equal Opportunity Leech like you?

320
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,431
Yes. You do get all worked up.

321
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,560
You're wasting a lot of time
and energy on me.

322
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,021
You might not get it,

323
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,358
but we're paid by hours and time is money.

324
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,781
If I really were nothing but a bug,
you'd ignore me completely.

325
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,199
You are…

326
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,869
such an eyesore.

327
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,456
Enough that I want you dead.

328
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:32,299
I, too, will stay quiet
if you don't touch me.

329
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,551
No.

330
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,929
Even if you harass me, I'll keep quiet.

331
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,516
So treat me like I don't exist.

332
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:46,271
And we can both
go to school in peace, right?

333
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,865
No.

334
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,367
I like things to be clear.

335
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,538
Rather than act like you're invisible,

336
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:05,915
you can quit.

337
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,546
You want me to quit school?

338
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,798
Not for free.

339
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,468
I'll pay you well.

340
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,346
How much would do?

341
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,684
Oh.

342
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,270
The price of that dress.

343
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,608
You're too poor to have bought it.

344
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,445
For that kind of damage,
any rental shop would charge you.

345
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,867
Right?

346
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,253
I'll give you a week…

347
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,634
to fill in the dropout form.

348
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:04,724
If you leave voluntarily,
I'll pay you for the dress.

349
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,360
Oh, right.

350
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,909
If you drop out sooner,
I'll pay you extra as a bonus.

351
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,453
You said time is money.

352
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:36,983
What now?

353
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,872
The bus gets me to school in no time.

354
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,550
Hey.

355
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,179
Could I ask you for a favor--

356
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,722
Why'd you go to the party?

357
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,099
What?

358
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,272
Why go when you'd be so out of place

359
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,400
and give them a reason to bully you?

360
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,614
It doesn't suit you.

361
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,828
At our school,
it's best for people like you

362
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,540
to keep quiet and stay well out of sight.

363
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,918
Do I really have to tell you that?

364
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,510
I can't wait any longer.

365
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,681
Tell me who tried to kill Hae-in.

366
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,517
Tell me who it is.

367
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,773
I've waited long enough. Tell me.

368
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,281
Is it…

369
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,785
one of the people I know well?

370
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,332
Tell me right now!

371
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,254
I will tell you.

372
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,133
Will you lend me some money?

373
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,137
What?

374
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,723
Answer me first.

375
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,351
If I tell you,
will you loan me some money?

376
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:41,983
Depending on your answer,
I'll decide whether to tell you or not.

377
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,158
Someone might get wrongfully killed

378
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,827
and you're trying to make a deal?

379
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:58,249
I tried to understand when you asked me
to pretend to be your boyfriend.

380
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,128
You know what?

381
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:07,175
Your name's like Hae-in's but you're less
than the dirt under her nails.

382
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,054
You both got in through
the Equal Opportunity System,

383
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,307
but Hae-in never asked me
for help or a favor!

384
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,688
But you, you're asking me for a loan.

385
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,570
You can't lend it to me?

386
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,072
Then we're done talking.

387
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,157
I'll get out here.

388
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:40,959
Hey.

389
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,586
Hey!

390
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,387
Truth be told,

391
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,349
I was never going to tell you
from the start.

392
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,855
Regardless of the deal
with your dad to keep quiet,

393
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,192
to be honest,
I didn't see the killer's face clearly.

394
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:09,779
What?

395
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,864
I only saw their silhouette.

396
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,242
So I only know it was a woman.

397
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,921
It was a woman?

398
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,675
I should've milked you for more,
but I showed my hand too soon.

399
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,468
Oh.

400
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,345
One more thing.

401
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,225
If it's best for me to keep quiet
and stay out of sight like you said,

402
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:42,020
what did Kim Hae-in do
to end up like that?

403
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,108
You're in the Diamond Club
at the top of the food chain,

404
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,028
but you couldn't
even protect the girl you liked.

405
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,740
Before she asked you for anything,

406
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,617
you should've looked out for her.

407
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,298
What now?
Why are you on the outs with Do-eon?

408
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,258
You don't need to know.

409
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,015
Oh, because it's Kim Hye-in this time?

410
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:24,729
When it comes to that,
I don't get him either.

411
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,235
You talk as if you're different.

412
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,034
What?

413
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,870
How much do you know?

414
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,000
Enough. Yul-hee's here.

415
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,045
What were you talking about?

416
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,506
We were just talking nonsense.

417
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:56,052
Do you think the leech
will really drop out?

418
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,806
I think so.

419
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:03,935
Do you know why
the poor can never escape poverty?

420
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,940
Because they'll risk their lives
for chump change. Right?

421
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,485
I think I get smarter each day.

422
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,779
You really have gotten smarter.

423
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,949
Hurry up.

424
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,995
-Come here.
-I really don't feel like eating.

425
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,918
Haven't you been skipping lunch?

426
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,712
I don't have an appetite.

427
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:35,299
I brought this from home.

428
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,926
Will you taste it for me?

429
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,011
Come on. I put in a lot of effort.

430
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:43,641
I can't believe a nice girl like you
goes to this school.

431
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,395
I think you're an angel without wings.

432
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,772
No.

433
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,568
I'm not the nice girl you take me for.

434
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,865
I feel too lonely when I eat alone.

435
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,783
So I called you over.

436
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,376
Do you have the money for the dress?

437
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:15,756
Oh…

438
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:23,222
It's not that simple.

439
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,268
Eight million won's a lot of money for me.

440
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,272
Should I drop out voluntarily

441
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,399
and get the money…

442
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,236
for the dress from Jenna?

443
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:44,452
Maybe I shouldn't have come
to a great school so far out of my league.

444
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,121
Should I drop out--

445
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,373
I think there might be a way.

446
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,292
What?

447
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,923
A way to get the money
for the dress without dropping out.

448
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:03,221
If there were a way, what would you do?

449
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,684
A way for you not to drop out.

450
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,245
