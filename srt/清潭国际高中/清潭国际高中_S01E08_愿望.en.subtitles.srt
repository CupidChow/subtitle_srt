1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,954
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,920
Lee Duk-min?

3
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,381
That's him?

4
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,340
Yes.

5
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,635
He lends students
however much they need to settle.

6
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,888
It's like a private loan.

7
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,182
He can spend that much
without his parents knowing.

8
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,892
Darn it.

9
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,685
What are you, blind?

10
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,312
LEE DUK-MIN

11
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,773
You idiot. Apologize right now.

12
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,483
Why are you just standing there?

13
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,194
I'm so sorry.

14
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,113
That's why everyone's intimidated
by him even though he's just a freshman.

15
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,828
You don't know who he is?

16
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,216
OVER 5 BILLION WON

17
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,219
Unlike us, they have money rotting away.

18
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,428
JLK GROUP

19
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,181
They belittle people
who gave ten million won,

20
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,974
and my name's not even here.

21
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,477
I know.

22
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,651
Oh, what's your next class, Si-eun?

23
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,985
I have biology.

24
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,321
I have art,
so I have to stop by my locker.

25
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,573
Okay. See you at lunchtime, then.

26
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,658
Okay.

27
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,547
OVER ONE BILLION WON - OH SI-EUN

28
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,553
LEE DUK-MIN: IF YOU WANT
THE MONEY, COME BY 4 P.M.

29
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,742
KH BANK TRANSFER FROM LEE,
DEC. 14 4:05 P.M. 3,000,000 WON

30
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,120
Thank you so, so much.

31
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,707
You offer meaningful help with money.

32
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,876
Unlike the others
who act stupid with money.

33
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,086
It's nothing.

34
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,840
Hey.

35
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,886
Do you mind if I pay you back
over a long time?

36
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,597
I'm going to work part-time and--

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,639
But

38
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,351
it's an extra 200
for each week you're late.

39
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,314
Two…

40
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,611
It's not 200 won, is it?

41
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,447
No, it's not.

42
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,074
No.

43
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,951
No.

44
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,162
Or…

45
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,708
do you want to help with what I do
and earn it yourself?

46
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,836
I could even give you the money.

47
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,010
Why won't she pick up?

48
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,647
OH SI-EUN

49
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,609
Still no news yet?

50
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,362
I think I'm almost done.

51
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,867
Aren't you taking too long?

52
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,830
I'm coming. I'll be right out.

53
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,333
Are you sure no one else will be here?

54
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,169
Yes. No one else will come.

55
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,540
You're in the Diamond Club
at the top of the food chain,

56
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,959
but you couldn't
even protect the girl you liked.

57
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,005
Before she asked you for anything,

58
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,090
you should've looked out for her.

59
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,879
I'm sorry for taking so long to visit.

60
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,509
I think…

61
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,306
I felt guilty.

62
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,019
Why is there so much you can't tell me?

63
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,937
To defend you,

64
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,648
I even fought Jenna
and went against my dad.

65
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,319
So what's--
Who's giving you such a hard time?

66
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,612
Just tell me outright!

67
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,614
I don't want you to misunderstand.

68
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,574
It's not like that.

69
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:14,999
Why don't you trust me?

70
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,169
What more do you want me to do?

71
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,214
To be honest, I can help with

72
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,133
whatever happens at school.

73
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,805
Not this time.

74
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,271
Will you even let me help you?

75
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,320
Is it because of your pride?

76
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,405
No.

77
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,909
I think that's just an excuse.

78
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,913
It's just victim mentality.

79
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,491
Oh, nice.

80
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,370
This time, will you pose like this?

81
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,124
Oh, that's great. A bit more.

82
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,213
-This time…
-My dad said

83
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,175
pride won't put food on the table.

84
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,718
Oh, that's lovely.

85
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,886
Yes.

86
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,555
Stuff like pride means nothing.

87
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,975
This is just

88
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:59,187
a sweet part-time job
that pays three million won an hour.

89
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,441
Oh, that's awesome.

90
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,738
It's nice, but can you do any other pose?

91
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,700
That's incredible.

92
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,452
-So…
-Hang on.

93
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,578
…I'll just shut my eyes…

94
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,331
-Hang on.
-…and bear with it for an hour.

95
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,253
This is the last one. I swear.

96
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,838
Let's take photos in this.

97
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:26,881
-This--
-Hey.

98
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,010
You said this was the last look.
Why do you keep adding more?

99
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,470
Are you toying with me?

100
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,724
This is really the last one.

101
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,062
I'll pay you a little extra.

102
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,776
Time me and calculate the pay
down to the last second.

103
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,739
What is it?

104
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,241
But you have to…

105
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,953
change out here.

106
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,039
Are you kidding me?

107
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,006
Then I'll pay you five million more.

108
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,254
Regardless of the deal
with your dad to keep quiet,

109
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,840
I only saw their silhouette.

110
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,675
So I only know it was a woman.

111
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,013
That means Seo Hee-su knows…

112
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,600
who the culprit is.

113
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,730
Wow.

114
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,357
We've been engaged for five years already.

115
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,028
Right. Which hotel shall we make
a reservation at this time?

116
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,157
Last year, we stayed at Hanmyung Hotel
thanks to Jenna.

117
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,118
This time…

118
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,745
Sweetie.

119
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,956
To be honest,

120
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,293
I deserve some praise, you know?

121
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,547
Oh, I know. Yes, I know that.

122
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,506
I know.

123
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,842
In this day and age,

124
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,928
what couple has no fun
between the sheets until marriage?

125
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,141
Of course,
that's what I find cute about you, but…

126
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,103
Still,

127
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,481
I let you do everything

128
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,566
-up to that.
-You do, I know that.

129
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,277
But…

130
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,990
Then…

131
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,786
On this anniversary…

132
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,954
No.

133
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,539
You managed just fine so far.

134
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,999
Okay.

135
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,214
Seriously, I swear,

136
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,592
as soon as I turn 20,
I'll spend Mom and Dad's money

137
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:19,303
on the wedding, and then I'll just…

138
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,060
You really didn't sleep with anyone?

139
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,603
Of course not.

140
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,939
Who else would I do that with but you?

141
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,820
Right.

142
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,073
If you did, I'll kill myself.

143
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,494
Don't say that even as a joke. It hurts.

144
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,126
Let me take this.

145
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,847
-Hello?
-I told you not to call today

146
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,223
because it's an important day.

147
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,018
So what?

148
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,189
That's your problem.

149
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,279
How does Jenna know?

150
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,246
Listen carefully.

151
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,875
If Yul-hee hears about this…

152
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,129
then you're dead meat.

153
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:37,798
Okay?

154
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,220
-Right, presents.
-What?

155
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,930
Is there anything you want?

156
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,183
Yes. I sent it to you.

157
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,436
-Where? To my messenger?
-Yes, the link.

158
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,105
-Oh, that link is for that?
-Yes.

159
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,399
Okay. Is that all you want?

160
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,901
Don't you think it'll suit me well?

161
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,194
Yes, of course.

162
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,488
Help!

163
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,865
Is anyone there?

164
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,283
Help!

165
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,118
Someone's dying!

166
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,204
Oh, no.

167
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,663
What do I do?

168
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,207
Is anyone there?

169
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,724
Oh, what do I do?

170
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,520
What do I do?

171
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,443
Hey, wake up.

172
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,904
What do I do?

173
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,200
What now?

174
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,367
So,

175
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,036
did that girl and you

176
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,331
say anything to each other
or do you remember anything else?

177
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,837
I'll have tea
and take care of personal business.

178
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,922
I'll be about an hour.

179
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,007
I'll call when I'm ready to leave.

180
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,557
-Ms. Ha, it's been so long.
-Ms. Kim.

181
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,267
You're successful.

182
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,186
You have a driver now too.

183
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,356
-I feel a tad jealous.
-Don't be silly.

184
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,566
I'm just the same as before.

185
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,444
I'm the same.

186
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,905
You're not. The teachers' forum

187
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,784
is full of talk that you're marrying into
a seriously rich family.

188
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,706
I think I know which one.

189
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,375
-Are the rumors--
-Ms. Kim.

190
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,127
I'll tell you when the article comes out.

191
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,171
Okay.

192
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,923
Just because you joined that society,

193
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,175
don't you turn your back on me
or the other teachers.

194
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:53,137
I told you, I'm the same as before.

195
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,724
The moguls aren't that special.

196
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,977
I'm really marrying for love

197
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,104
so nothing will change.

198
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,023
Gosh, that is so you.

199
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,158
Jenna, are you all right?

200
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,828
What are you doing here?

201
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,748
I came to say hi to the teachers.

202
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,292
Do you not feel well? You're sweating--

203
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,170
Why do you care if I'm unwell or not?

204
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,505
I told you before.

205
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,300
Remember your place
and don't cross the line!

206
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,261
You're speaking too harshly.

207
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,889
Ms. Kim, you go ahead.

208
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,266
I'll take Jenna to her classroom
and then join you.

209
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,809
Okay, then.

210
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,688
Are you okay? Let me see.

211
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,648
You feel a bit warm.

212
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,568
You're fortunate I just spoke harshly.

213
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,237
You're just a mistress.

214
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,367
You being pregnant
doesn't change your lowly birth.

215
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,580
What? Am I wrong?

216
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,714
I saw a doctor today

217
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,841
and he told me something.

218
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:19,932
He said that blue would suit my baby.

219
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,685
The baby I'm carrying

220
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,314
could become the heir to Hanmyung Group.

221
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,275
Don't belittle my pregnancy.

222
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,321
What?

223
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,532
-Why you--
-Don't say that now.

224
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,035
You should call me "Mom" now.

225
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,039
"Mistress?"

226
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,461
I won't put up with your antics anymore.

227
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,506
Address me properly.

228
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,384
I'm your stepmother

229
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,220
who will give birth to your baby brother.

230
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,061
The English teacher's pregnant?

231
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,355
Your dad must be overjoyed.

232
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,774
It'll be icing on the cake if it's a boy.

233
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,819
Mom!

234
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,712
Who are you?

235
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:32,796
A fri…

236
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,428
I'm her senior.

237
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,430
Oh, I see.

238
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,514
You must be worried.

239
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,808
I'll help Jenna get back to her classroom.

240
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,272
She doesn't seem to want that.

241
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,567
Take me to where I can't see that woman.

242
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,651
Quickly.

243
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,513
That's her?

244
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,474
The chairman's second wife.

245
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:32,189
Gosh. I thought that was
a forced plot for crazy TV dramas.

246
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,774
Reality must be worse.

247
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:38,028
The great Baek Jenna couldn't do anything.

248
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,739
I feel bad for you.

249
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,372
What was that about?

250
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,250
The thing I hate the most in the world

251
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,711
is pointless pity and awkward comforting.

252
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,798
You and your darn temper.

253
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,883
Do you think you have something on me

254
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,386
just because you caught us at that time?

255
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,473
Do you think
your situation's better than mine?

256
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,934
What?

257
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,644
No matter how miserable I feel,

258
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,731
people like you comforting me
so they can feel superior

259
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,485
is a complete eyesore,
so get lost if you're done.

260
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,237
What the heck?

261
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,907
Do you think I'm here to console you?

262
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,993
Why are you here, then?

263
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,810
This is what I'm here for.

264
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,647
I heard you put Kang Na-yeon up to it.

265
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,191
I'm here to pay you for the dress.

266
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,486
But what?

267
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,906
I feel superior while I comfort you?

268
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,201
Whatever mess you're in,

269
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,079
my life's way more fucked up than yours.

270
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,623
How could I ever feel superior?

271
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,295
You have no idea what I had to do

272
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,630
just to get this stupid chump change.

273
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,345
Change out here.

274
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,722
Are you kidding me?

275
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,602
Then I'll pay you five million more.

276
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:40,525
Other girls have stripped here before you.

277
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:42,944
Many others.

278
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,324
Leave it if you don't want to.

279
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,204
I'm not the one with anything to lose.

280
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,123
You are.

281
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,585
Anyway,

282
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,130
this means we're done.

283
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,257
So please,

284
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,425
just leave me alone.

285
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,928
Because now,

286
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,806
I need to stay here and graduate
to make up for everything.

287
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,184
I'll survive here the best I can,

288
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,603
and make my fucked-up life

289
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,439
even ten won more worthwhile
than it is now.

290
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,024
Do you get that?

291
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,201
You're a real psycho.

292
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,245
"Psycho?"

293
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,749
What are you doing? Don't come any closer.

294
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,502
Beat me up again and I'll call the cops.

295
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,754
Do you think

296
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,508
you're the scariest person in this school?

297
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,261
You're wrong.

298
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,890
The scariest bitch in the world

299
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,727
is the bitch with nothing to lose.

300
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,854
Like me right now.

301
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,112
You're not the only one.

302
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,280
Fuck.

303
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,782
That's so pretentious.

304
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:57,037
People as rich as you will be
richer than me even if you go down.

305
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,249
Anyway, I kept my word.

306
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,337
Let's try to coexist somehow.

307
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,173
Who knows?

308
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,383
In the distant future,
you could be my employer.

309
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,555
Do you have no pride?

310
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:17,515
Pride?

311
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,479
I traded that in for scraps long ago.

312
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,777
That's why

313
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,862
you're no match for me.

314
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,739
That little…

315
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,661
Hey, Kim Hye-in.

316
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,829
Don't act like you know me ever again.

317
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,456
Right back at you.

318
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,303
Wow. A morning where I'm not being chased

319
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,389
or angry about anything.

320
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,352
Yes. Let's just take care of myself.

321
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,855
I'll study and get a scholarship.

322
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,862
Kim Hye-in won't drop out, then.

323
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,948
Jenna said to leave her be.

324
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,199
Impressive, Kim Hye-in.

325
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,827
I bet she'll be the first to stay.

326
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,911
She's really something.

327
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:50,608
What's up?

328
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,113
They won't bother you with me right here.

329
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,826
Was this Baek Jenna too?

330
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,415
Baek Jenna?

331
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:07,917
No.

332
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,427
What's up between you two?

333
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,678
Don't mind me.

334
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,473
Now I'll really stay quiet
and out of sight.

335
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,311
But sorry about everything so far.

336
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,317
Let's talk after class.

337
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,197
I have nothing else to say to you.

338
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,088
Don't leave without me.

339
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,256
Go with me.

340
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,690
You can do whatever you want.

341
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,775
No,

342
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,069
I'll do whatever you say.

343
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,320
Have you lost your mind?

344
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,614
What are you up to now?

345
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,325
I took care of Jenna and now it's you?

346
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:26,079
Our fake relationship ended long ago.

347
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:29,874
Help me.

348
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,126
-With what?
-Hae-in.

349
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,377
I said I was sorry!

350
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,379
I told you everything then!

351
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,881
I know where I stand now,

352
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,925
and I'll keep quiet
and just attend school.

353
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,052
Let's not cross paths.

354
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,554
Please.

355
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,979
My dad's a scary guy.

356
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,230
I know.

357
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:55,066
What would happen if my father finds out…

358
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,654
you don't know who the culprit is?

359
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,378
Are you blackmailing me?

360
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,630
This is unbelievable.

361
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,926
You said stuff. That I was less than
the dirt under her nails.

362
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,098
What? Did you learn
some dirty tricks from me?

363
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,644
I promise you won't suffer.

364
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,190
I won't report it.
I just want to know who it was.

365
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,442
I'll take care of the rest.

366
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,236
-I didn't see her face!
-You said it was a woman!

367
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,073
If it's the person I think it is,

368
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,534
I want to watch how my dad reacts.

369
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,995
So you just hang out with me.

370
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,079
Just

371
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,457
act like we're dating.

372
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,459
You're so frustrating.

373
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,837
Get lost. I'm leaving.

374
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,099
Oh, forget it.

375
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,227
Why would I bother about that?

376
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,396
I'll enjoy this freedom quietly,

377
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,441
and graduate quietly.

378
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:20,568
You're doing good, Kim Hye-in.

379
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,237
Yes.

380
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:26,699
CALLER ID UNKNOWN:

381
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,118
YOU TRIED SO HARD TO GET IN
AND NOW YOU HIT ROCK BOTTOM?

382
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:34,040
But you must change out here.

383
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,835
Then I'll pay you five million more.

384
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:43,550
What should I wear?

385
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,803
Can you come over after school
and help me pick something out?

386
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,138
Something

387
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,473
pretty and sexy.

388
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,393
That way, Woo-jin won't stray
even in our fifth year together.

389
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,481
Do you really want to marry Park Woo-jin?

390
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,109
Yes.

391
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,861
It's what I always thought about.

392
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,071
I think you're too good for him.

393
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,950
What? You've been real strange lately.

394
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,750
Did you decide not to care at all now?

395
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,752
Kim Hye-in?

396
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,089
Yes. Getting tangled up with her
is just tiresome.

397
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,260
-Hye-in.
-Hey.

398
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,392
The girl next to her.

399
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,768
Isn't that Oh Si-eun?

400
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,186
Let's go.

401
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,730
Oh Si-eun?

402
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,149
Right.

403
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,151
Did you handle the money problem?

404
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,652
Nothing happened?

405
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,070
What?

406
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,285
Yes, I took care of it.

407
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,455
Oh, that's such a relief.

408
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:58,583
I got worried
wondering if I should've gone with you.

409
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,961
I'm really glad everything went well.

410
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,800
-Lee A-reum.
-Here.

411
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,805
-Ko Hae-ju.
-Here.

412
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:14,933
Kim Hye-in.

413
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,311
Kim Hye-in?

414
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,896
Oh, yes, here.

415
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,900
-Lee A-ram.
-Here.

416
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,448
-Park Young-chan.
-Here.

417
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,744
-Ku Min-ji.
-Here.

418
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:35,954
YOU OKAY? HAHA

419
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,548
-Park Min-sun.
-Here.

420
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,257
THE UNIFORM YOU GOT IN EXCHANGE
FOR MURDER SUITS YOU WELL

421
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,365
YOU OKAY? HAHA

422
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:12,508
I can't believe a nice girl like you
goes to this school.

423
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,429
I think you're an angel without wings.

424
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,515
No.

425
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,478
I'm not the nice girl you take me for.

426
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,284
EPILOGUE

427
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,665
Hello.

428
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,917
Hello, Si-eun.

429
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,133
How is Hae-in doing?

430
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,843
Just the same.

431
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,143
-Was someone here?
-Yes.

432
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,771
Someone called Do-eon.

433
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,357
He said he's close to Hae-in.

434
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,318
Oh, Seo Do-eon was here.

435
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,032
I'm going to take this outside.

436
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,034
Okay. Take your time.

437
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,722
I'm here, Hae-in.

438
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,892
Hae-in.

439
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,644
I'm jealous of you.

440
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,773
Someone like Do-eon only cares for you.

441
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,574
How did you manage to bewitch him?

442
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,618
You ghostly bitch.

443
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:08,249
I bet he's like that
because he doesn't know what you did.

444
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,563
You must change out here.

445
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,899
Then I'll pay you five million more.

446
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,365
I knew it, Kim Hye-in.

447
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,952
You didn't let me down.

448
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:49,475
