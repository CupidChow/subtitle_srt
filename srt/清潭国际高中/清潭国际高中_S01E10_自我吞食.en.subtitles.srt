1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,954
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,585
What are you doing?

3
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:56,014
-Wait.
-Why?

4
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,275
KIM HAE-IN

5
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,196
Kim Hae-in.

6
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,226
Kim Hae-in.

7
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,938
What on earth happened to you?

8
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,650
What kind of person

9
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,819
were you really?

10
00:01:57,117 --> 00:02:00,537
OH SI-EUN:

11
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,750
My goodness.

12
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,211
Seo Do-eon?

13
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,338
What's up?

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,095
I just wanted to ask you something.

15
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,436
What did you want to ask me?

16
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,483
Before that…

17
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,244
are you feeling okay?

18
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,788
You don't look too good.

19
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,874
I'm perfectly fine.

20
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,460
I guess it's because
I didn't sleep well last night.

21
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,922
Just get to the point. I'm busy.

22
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,887
I just wanted

23
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,514
to ask you a favor.

24
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,558
What is it?

25
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:11,900
A date.

26
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,989
Woo-jin and Yul-hee's celebratory party.

27
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,539
Why are you making that face?

28
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,001
Oh.

29
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,718
I'd only be humiliated again.

30
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,406
Hey.

31
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,745
I saw you did something cheeky.

32
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,501
Why did you trust that slowpoke Duk-min?

33
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,839
This is why

34
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,342
stupid kids never get anywhere.

35
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,805
I won't ever lose your video.

36
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,473
Why would I?

37
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,477
The more I think, the angrier I get.

38
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,063
-Should I just post it now?
-Fine.

39
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,232
I get it.

40
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,654
Give me some time to prepare

41
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,781
for what is coming.

42
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,704
The moment I say that Jenna's the culprit,

43
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,706
my deal with the director falls through.

44
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,833
Then I'll definitely be expelled.

45
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,420
My life will be over.

46
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,548
Hye-in.

47
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,344
I've waited long enough already.

48
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,853
Then…

49
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,356
let me ask you something first.

50
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,525
What is it?

51
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,034
KIM HAE-IN

52
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,206
Oh, this?

53
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,543
I knew, of course.

54
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,338
I told you, stupid.

55
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,508
Hae-in was blackmailing Jenna.

56
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,596
So when Hae-in died,

57
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,182
I was so very sad.

58
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,102
I hadn't yet achieved my goal,

59
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,271
and Jenna got to her first.

60
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,525
Then…

61
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,322
did you put her up to it?

62
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,327
That bitch was a moron.

63
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,162
You know,

64
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,165
you must use your brain
if you want to deal with Jenna.

65
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:16,959
But then…

66
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,464
the biggest moron is Min Yul-hee.

67
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,884
She doesn't even know
what her boyfriend is up to.

68
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,299
RESTRICTED CALLER ID

69
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,223
-Wait.
-Why?

70
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,725
Do something, will you?

71
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,731
Does Seo Do-eon know

72
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,443
what a dirty rag you are?

73
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,029
You have no money
but pretend to have pride.

74
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,823
You put on such a show.

75
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,660
No matter how much Do-eon likes you,

76
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,579
when he watches this clip,

77
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,706
his love for you
will cool down right away.

78
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,837
The favor I mentioned.

79
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,007
You'd better do it.

80
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,802
I'M MEETING JENNA SOON. KEEP
YOUR WORD AND DELETE MY VIDEO!

81
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,807
What's going on?

82
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,645
It was you? You called me up here?

83
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,775
Was it really…

84
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,694
Baek Jenna?

85
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,202
Would I make it up?

86
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,872
Quit wasting energy by
trying to be a detective.

87
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,251
Anyway,

88
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:07,088
shouldn't you be worrying
about something else?

89
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,340
What?

90
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,762
The whole school could see your video.

91
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,432
Do you know something?

92
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,727
The dead Kim Hae-in.

93
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,647
She begged me right here.

94
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,859
I'm just saying.

95
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,487
I'm off.

96
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,763
It was my sweet tip.

97
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,142
Main building's first-floor girl's toilet.

98
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,020
As if no one comes here.

99
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,568
Hey.

100
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,789
I'm sorry.

101
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,920
I should've done it myself
instead of leaving it to Duk-min.

102
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,550
No.

103
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,349
Si-eun's worse than I heard about.

104
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,354
Hey.

105
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,980
Just you wait.

106
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,649
I'll take care of it for you.

107
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,652
Leave it. What can you do?

108
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,694
Why should I leave it?

109
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,447
That crazy bitch.

110
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,581
Hey.

111
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,666
Let's call the cops.

112
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,380
So-mang.

113
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,261
Do you know what the first thing
I learned at this school was?

114
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,561
People like me, who don't have
rich or powerful parents…

115
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,484
Equal Opportunity Leeches.

116
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,362
No matter how hard we try…

117
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,616
we can't change anything.

118
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,337
Isn't that why my family makes a living?

119
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,465
What?

120
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,179
Faith, hope, charity.

121
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,184
The thought that praying to Jesus
might change something.

122
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,311
That pointless hope.

123
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,702
I'll grant you your wish.

124
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,207
Oh Si-eun.

125
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,878
Do you want me to punish her?

126
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,596
Congratulations.

127
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,556
You're so impressive.

128
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,521
I'd love to see you get married.

129
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,024
Yul-hee, I'm so jealous.

130
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,486
Woo-jin arranged all this
as a surprise for me.

131
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,070
How nice.

132
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,156
I had no idea at all.

133
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,533
That explains the sudden location change.

134
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,827
Hey.

135
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,579
All this is on me.

136
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,664
Woo-jin, you're the best!

137
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,752
Take photos of me
with the flowers. You too.

138
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,295
-Sure.
-Sounds good.

139
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,465
-On three. One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

140
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,091
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

141
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,344
-You look lovely together.
-Woo-jin, you look amazing.

142
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,762
-Yes.
-It looks nice.

143
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,930
Woo-jin's really…

144
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,015
One, two, three.

145
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,600
One, two, three.

146
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,768
-Two, three.
-How pretty.

147
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:34,021
I'll take some more.
Woo-jin, you look great.

148
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,732
-Make them look good.
-They look awesome.

149
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,487
You smoke?

150
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,033
Well, sometimes?

151
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,956
Do you want one?

152
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,041
No.

153
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,524
Seo Do-eon.

154
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,903
Why

155
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:09,241
do you think
something like that happened to Hae-in?

156
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,705
What do you mean?

157
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,295
If you and Hae-in were close,

158
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,549
you must have a gist of an idea.

159
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,555
Someone pushed her off the rooftop

160
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,307
with the intent to kill her.

161
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,853
Would they do that
without any motivation or grudge?

162
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,275
The truth is…

163
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,071
that's what I'm trying to find out.

164
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,868
Hae-in was a good person.

165
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,372
So what could she have done so wrong…

166
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,751
that something so horrible would happen?

167
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,800
Good

168
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,052
and innocent?

169
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:16,767
You don't think you could've been mistaken
about Hae-in?

170
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,522
What do I think about her that's wrong?

171
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:30,781
It's nothing.

172
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,826
Even later on,

173
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,246
if I remember something about the culprit,

174
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,123
I'll tell you.

175
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,299
Thanks.

176
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,432
Sometimes…

177
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,603
I do think I had the wrong idea.

178
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,940
Do you?

179
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,693
About you.

180
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,279
Kim Hye-in.

181
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,162
We'll win this time.

182
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,622
-Give it a go.
-Okay. I want to play.

183
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,046
I want to hit the red ball. What do I do?

184
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,432
Hey.

185
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:39,975
What?

186
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,729
Is that an expensive brand?

187
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,689
What is?

188
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,235
The necklace Yul-hee's wearing.

189
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,160
Why? Are you going to ask
Do-eon to buy one for you?

190
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,496
It's expensive.

191
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,581
That's not why I asked.

192
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,086
You can't buy it even if you're rich.

193
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,545
There's a long waiting list.

194
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,717
For something like that?

195
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,700
You're not still upset with me, are you?

196
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,374
You're not bullying Hye-in.

197
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,129
Are you spying on me?

198
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,131
Dating made you lose your mind again.

199
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,136
You kept talking about someone else.

200
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,054
Are you sure it's not a fetish?

201
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,767
Watch what you say.

202
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,396
I can't take it sometimes,
even though we're friends.

203
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,152
I…

204
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,822
hate it sometimes that you're like my mom.

205
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,160
What about the drunk you?

206
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,161
Hey!

207
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:30,210
You turned your back on
our 18-year friendship over that girl.

208
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,632
You.

209
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,635
Do you really not know why I'm like this?

210
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,262
Tell me.

211
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,307
As if you've ever
told the whole truth.

212
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,768
I'll tell you everything, then.

213
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,479
You be honest too.

214
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,232
Kim Hye-in.

215
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,653
You were sure it was a woman.

216
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,489
My dad

217
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,659
isn't capable of covering for just anyone.

218
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,995
It would have to be

219
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,747
a powerful family he'd benefit from.

220
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,420
Do you think

221
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,007
I killed her or something?

222
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,384
-Hey!
-You hated her!

223
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,094
-Hey.
-Stop it.

224
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,056
You said you were glad she died!

225
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,767
Hey.

226
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,228
Is being poor that big of a sin to you?

227
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,437
You're always tormenting others!

228
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,273
Because you were being
cluelessly strung along!

229
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,442
What has gotten into you two?

230
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,110
Jenna, let's go. Don't do this.

231
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,365
Let's say it wasn't a crime
that Hae-in was poor.

232
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,243
But what about using it
as an excuse to extort money from me?

233
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,747
Is that not a crime either?

234
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,416
What?

235
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,752
-Jenna, let's go home.
-Let go!

236
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,672
You think it was just me?

237
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,553
He was being blackmailed too.

238
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,267
Why?

239
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,317
-Kim Hae-in slept with your boyfriend.
-Hey!

240
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,360
You think I didn't know?

241
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,611
Have you lost your mind?

242
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,321
What are you trying to do?

243
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,533
Where are you off to? Jenna.

244
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,327
-Where are you going?
-Don't.

245
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,453
Baek Jenna!

246
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,749
Hey.

247
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,647
RESTRICTED CALLER ID

248
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,445
-Wait.
-Why?

249
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,031
Do something, will you?

250
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,249
The favor I mentioned.

251
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,169
You'd better do it.

252
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,182
PARK WOO-JIN

253
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,396
Hey, Kim Hae-in!

254
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,773
What's this video?

255
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,858
-What is this?
-Hey.

256
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,736
If Yul-hee finds out about this,

257
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,488
what will happen to your engagement?

258
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,073
Are you insane?

259
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,324
Where are you?

260
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:52,287
Where are you?
I'll find you and kill you, okay?

261
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,206
Darn you!

262
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,167
What the fuck is this?

263
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,463
So?

264
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,841
What do you want from me?

265
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,097
What do I want?

266
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,434
Are you going to
give it to me if I tell you?

267
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,520
Let's hear it first.

268
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,273
And stay away from me and those around me.

269
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,401
And also,

270
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,696
quit toying with Do-eon.

271
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,828
I know you slept with Woo-jin.

272
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,787
I…

273
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,748
like Do-eon a lot.

274
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,125
You still…

275
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,170
I…

276
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,673
I always hated you.

277
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,135
Why are you so proud and arrogant?

278
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,596
Other than being born rich,

279
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,140
how are you different from me?

280
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,100
How are you better than me?

281
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,440
I'm just trying to change my life somehow.

282
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,945
Is that such a huge sin?

283
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,203
How could you do this to me?

284
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,249
Today should've been
the happiest day of my life.

285
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,794
Sorry.

286
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,505
I didn't mean to tell you like this.

287
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,632
But I thought about it for a long time.

288
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,552
Woo-jin was treating you like a fool
because you didn't know--

289
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,312
I knew.

290
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,106
What?

291
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,067
I knew all about it.

292
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,783
Now I have complete control over him.

293
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,660
Yul-hee.

294
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,790
You…

295
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,337
You wanted to keep
your dad's fling a secret.

296
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,259
I have such secrets too.

297
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,553
And that secret…

298
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,889
You just went and…

299
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,019
ruined everything today.

300
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,375
Hey, give me a lift.

301
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,793
There are no more buses.

302
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,016
I've never brought anyone home before.

303
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,024
What?

304
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,775
You've never seen
such a small house before?

305
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,246
Baek Jenna.

306
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,124
Come here.

307
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,604
You…

308
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,024
Where'd you get this?

309
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,984
I want to sink the green ball.

310
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,944
-Then…
-Stay calm.

311
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,655
Bounce it like this.

312
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,158
I do that the best.

313
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,412
Okay, I'll show you.

314
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,290
Let's see if you can do it.

315
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,422
Earlier, you said…

316
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,509
this necklace is expensive

317
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,677
and you can't buy it even if you're rich.

318
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,142
You think…

319
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,857
Oh Si-eun

320
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,359
and Seo Do-eon.

321
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,737
They think you might be the culprit.

322
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,032
But I know.

323
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,744
It wasn't you.

324
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,290
This necklace.

325
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,256
Kim Hae-in gave it to me

326
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,009
that night after she fell.

327
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,107
Now…

328
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,610
you know who the culprit is.

329
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,706
I got you an even better one
since you lost yours.

330
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,833
It's lovely. I like it.

331
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,960
-It's really pretty?
-Yes.

332
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,628
You can't see it at all.

333
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,260
Isn't it pretty?

334
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,182
Does she have something on him?

335
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,854
You're not hiding anything from me,
are you?

336
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,522
No.

337
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,154
You really didn't sleep with anyone?

338
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,739
Of course not.

339
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,741
Who else would I do that with but you?

340
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,537
Right.

341
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,582
If you did, I would kill myself.

342
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,003
Don't say that even as a joke. It hurts.

343
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,260
-Let me take this.
-Okay.

344
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,399
Listen carefully.

345
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,529
If Yul-hee hears about this…

346
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,376
then you are…

347
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,796
dead…

348
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,465
meat.

349
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,352
Wait. I'm on my way.

350
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,118
Min Yul-hee. Why are you…

351
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,746
You dirty rag.
You dare touch what's mine?

352
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,207
How dare you touch what's mine?

353
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,086
Stop it. Why are you doing this?

354
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,130
Why am I doing this?

355
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,173
Why?

356
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,804
Don't you know you get sick
if you eat what isn't yours?

357
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,098
How dare the likes of you?

358
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,558
How dare you?

359
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,978
How dare the likes of you do that to me?

360
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,980
Seriously?

361
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,736
You get a grip!

362
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,738
What is Woo-jin to you?

363
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,078
Darn you! Let go of me!

364
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,497
-Let go.
-You!

365
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:57,999
Let go!

366
00:33:58,911 --> 00:33:59,912
What's going on?

367
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,374
Why is Si-eun so quiet this morning?

368
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,670
Did my wish actually come--

369
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,467
Midnight tonight. At last.

370
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,262
Nothing changes.

371
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,057
There's no way anything would change.

372
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,820
Where are you?

373
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,907
Midnight is just an hour away.

374
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,371
I'll come to where you are. Let's talk.

375
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,706
Let's make another deal.

376
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,252
What?

377
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,587
Make another deal?

378
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,966
Gosh, you're so arrogant.

379
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,635
You're the one who didn't keep your word.

380
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,513
The person who actually killed Hae-in.

381
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,015
I know who it is.

382
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,559
Well,

383
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,228
I think that's something I already know.

384
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,774
You're at school, right?

385
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,193
I'll be there in five minutes.
Just you wait.

386
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,028
Let's talk face-to-face.

387
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,073
Listen to what I know

388
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,117
before you make a decision.

389
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,046
NEW POST: SAVE DRAFT

390
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,464
Kim Hye-in.

391
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,050
I don't think I have to see you again.

392
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,184
You're here.

393
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,894
What's the occasion?

394
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,353
Why'd you ask to see me first?

395
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,619
Is this brat Si-eun even at school?

396
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,205
Did she lie to mess with me?

397
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,108
For a moment…

398
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,862
I thought

399
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,199
it was déjà vu.

400
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,091
This school…

401
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,345
is most definitely…

402
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,022
cursed.

403
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,424
EPILOGUE

404
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,057
Why did you do that?

405
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,561
I'm…

406
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,606
so confused.

407
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,737
I wish you'd wake up and say something.

408
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,783
I don't care if it's an excuse.

409
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,082
I wish you'd tell me something.

410
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,305
