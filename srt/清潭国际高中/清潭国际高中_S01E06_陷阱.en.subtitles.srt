1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,954
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,044
I'm screwed.

3
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,101
Hey! Get her!

4
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,655
Damn it.

5
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:23,875
Oh, no.

6
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,430
They're gone at last.

7
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,059
Thanks for helping me.

8
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,313
I just happened to see you
when I was passing by,

9
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,689
and you seemed to be in trouble.

10
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,903
By the way,

11
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,988
are your feet okay?

12
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,785
Oh.

13
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,413
I was so busy running,
I didn't realize I had no shoes on.

14
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,666
Wait here.

15
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,306
Do you want to wear these?

16
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,475
They're a bit dirty,

17
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,270
but it'll be better than just socks.

18
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,523
Yes.

19
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,816
This is better than nothing.

20
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,027
Thanks.

21
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,364
Gosh. I really owe you.

22
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,787
Oh, I transferred here today. My name--

23
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,913
I know you.

24
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,126
You're Hye-in. Kim Hye-in, right?

25
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,048
Have we met before?

26
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,467
Well,

27
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,177
the truth is,

28
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,347
your name was mentioned
on the school forum.

29
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,146
HANMYUNG GROUP
AND 3 OTHER COMPANIES

30
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,314
DONATE OVER 5 BILLION WON
TO CIHS

31
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,863
What you're saying is,

32
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,867
money is everything
and your background means power

33
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,036
here at Cheongdam
International High School,

34
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,122
and Baek Jenna's practically a royal.

35
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,291
-Is that it?
-Yes.

36
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,628
There are Jenna and the kids
in the Diamond Club

37
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,379
who are right beneath her,

38
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,881
and no one can disobey them.

39
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:39,010
The reality is that people like us
rarely get to talk to them.

40
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,933
I can't believe I got on Jenna's bad side
on my first day here.

41
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,144
My school life's done for.

42
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,941
Even if it hadn't been for Jenna,

43
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,610
you'd have gotten bullied just the same,

44
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,196
since you got in
thanks to the Equal Opportunity System.

45
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,701
That's so comforting.

46
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,120
Sorry.

47
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,539
I was too thoughtless, wasn't I?

48
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,918
No. Don't apologize for that.

49
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,046
Of all the students
I have met at this school so far,

50
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,257
you're the only one
with their head on straight.

51
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,055
Wait.

52
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,807
You're not the only one.

53
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,145
I have to go somewhere.

54
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:32,981
Already?

55
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,901
If they barge in here,
you'll get in trouble too.

56
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,237
It's my chance to sneak out
while it's quiet.

57
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,156
Thanks a lot for today.

58
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,494
Hey, so…

59
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,413
Your name's Oh Si-eun, right?

60
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,335
I'll return these shoes
when I see you next time.

61
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,839
See you, Si-eun.

62
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,483
Do we have to look for her too?

63
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,778
If you want to get any closer to Jenna,

64
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,488
keep your eyes peeled and look.

65
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:26,993
SEO DO-EON. YOU SAID TO CALL YOU

66
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,286
IF I GOT IN TROUBLE.
IS THAT STILL VALID?

67
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,632
Where's she hiding, like a little mouse?

68
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,967
Did she go to the main building?

69
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,136
My gut tells me she's here.

70
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,567
Kim Hye-in's up there!

71
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,652
-Go get her.
-Go!

72
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,737
Isn't that her?

73
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,083
Gosh. I found the mouse at last.

74
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,927
You lot.

75
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,389
This is a clear case of bullying.

76
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,558
Take one more step,

77
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,312
and I'll take a video
and post it everywhere online.

78
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,273
I'll have you summoned by the police
or School Violence Committee

79
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,776
and make sure it stays on your record.

80
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,331
Record?

81
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,252
Isn't that what bottom feeders like you,

82
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,672
who have no other options in life, fear?

83
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,258
Do whatever you want.

84
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,554
You'll get to learn just how unreasonable

85
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,848
and prejudiced the world is.

86
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,186
Why waste everyone's energy
when you're bound to get dragged away?

87
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,896
There's nowhere else to run.

88
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,120
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

89
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,523
Why would Do-eon help that leech?

90
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,652
Of course…

91
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,280
it's valid.

92
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,629
Seo Do-eon did what to that psycho?

93
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,839
I don't get what's going on.

94
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,342
He doesn't care about anyone else.

95
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,302
What else could it be? It's obvious.

96
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,804
If a girl's pretty, that's it for a guy.

97
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,306
So what if she's pretty?

98
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,892
Old habits die hard.

99
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:38,893
What?

100
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,479
Never mind. Hang up.

101
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,036
I just love him as a human being should.

102
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,372
Is that such a grave sin?

103
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,999
Is that such a grave sin?

104
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,381
Love, my ass.

105
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,351
Is this the right way?

106
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,896
I was told our family dinner
would be at Seocho Hotel.

107
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,106
Well…

108
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,567
The chairman just changed the location.

109
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:44,792
Jenna.

110
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,711
Did you get hurt?

111
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,837
Your face…

112
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,171
Where's Mom?

113
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,592
Why would you mention her right now?

114
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,012
Because it's our monthly family dinner.

115
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,724
Not a day on which we eat out
with a stranger.

116
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,311
I decided to arrange this on purpose.

117
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,315
You should try to get along with her.

118
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,734
Why should I do that with her?

119
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,986
Of all the owner risks,

120
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,404
an affair has the worst effect

121
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,364
-on stock prices--
-Watch what you say!

122
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,574
Did I say something wrong?

123
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,908
Must you always--

124
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,328
You promised not to get angry.

125
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,955
I'll talk to her.

126
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,387
Jenna.

127
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,936
You're going to be an older sister now.

128
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,272
It's 12 weeks old now.

129
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,445
I asked the chairman
to arrange this dinner.

130
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,781
We'll become a family soon.

131
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,991
Let's not anger or humiliate each other.

132
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,997
This is madness.

133
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,584
How dare she…

134
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,961
Jenna!

135
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,345
Are you really okay?

136
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,848
Yes. I just scraped my knee.

137
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,977
Your uniform's dirty.

138
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,857
I'll apologize instead.

139
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:36,070
If you want, I can get you a new uniform.

140
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:39,198
No. The other kids are in the wrong.

141
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,491
Why should you do that?

142
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,577
Oh.

143
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,957
I don't know if you know, but my father's
the chairman of this school.

144
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,211
I feel a sense of responsibility.

145
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,338
You don't have to refuse.

146
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,425
But still…

147
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,468
I'm a nobody.

148
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,560
This won't do.

149
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:40,634
You know…

150
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,637
I…

151
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,265
like Kim Hae-in.

152
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,857
When I was young,

153
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,193
I hated Cinderella.

154
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,876
ART HOMEWORK:
MY DREAM IS TO BECOME CINDERELLA

155
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,338
You really want to become Cinderella?

156
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,089
ART HOMEWORK:
MY DREAM IS TO BE RICH

157
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,382
What about it?

158
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,552
If you become Cinderella,

159
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,805
you can marry a prince.

160
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,436
What's so great about marrying a prince?

161
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,855
Even if you marry him,

162
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,983
you must do all the cooking,
cleaning, and laundry.

163
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,612
It would be better to become rich
and eat all you want

164
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,114
and do everything you want.

165
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,952
Would it?

166
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,209
Idiot.

167
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,964
If you marry a prince,
you'll automatically become rich.

168
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,590
You didn't even know that.

169
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,972
The 18-year-old me
entertained the idea very briefly.

170
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,686
Can I dream of becoming Cinderella now?

171
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,146
So…

172
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,983
I want an answer.

173
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,663
If that's what you want.

174
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,167
Kim Hae-in.

175
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,216
Who killed her?

176
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,017
You saw what happened that night.

177
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,730
Who pushed Hae-in from the rooftop?

178
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,858
Of course.

179
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,444
Fucking…

180
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,362
Cinderella.

181
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,163
If I tell you that…

182
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,834
what's in it for me?

183
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:31,907
Hey, leech.

184
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,955
What are you?

185
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,915
What do you mean?

186
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,042
You don't get what we mean?

187
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,878
What's your relationship with Seo Do-eon?

188
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,588
Why do you want to know?

189
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,799
Oh.

190
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:53,345
Because Do-eon is
in the Diamond Club or something?

191
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,432
The group you morons grovel before.

192
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,310
She's a psycho nutcase.

193
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,772
No, right?

194
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,275
Do-eon would be crazy
to date someone like you.

195
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,861
I'd get it if she were a pretty face.

196
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:09,945
Her figure even…

197
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,488
How dare you?

198
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,407
Did we say anything wrong?

199
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:18,579
It looks like Do-eon
happened to do you a favor,

200
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,956
and you got all excited
thinking you're special.

201
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,791
A favor?

202
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,586
Yes, a favor. Out of pity, compassion.

203
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,466
Are you done?

204
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,634
I'm done.

205
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,430
Then it's time for me to answer.

206
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,517
Me…

207
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,770
and Seo Do-eon.

208
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,272
We're dating.

209
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,487
Seo Do-eon.

210
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,031
Tell us yourself.

211
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,284
Are you really dating that weirdo?

212
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,370
Kim Hae-in.

213
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,707
Who killed her?

214
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,421
You saw what happened…

215
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,423
that night.

216
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,555
Who pushed Hae-in from the rooftop?

217
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,645
The Kim Hae-in you just said you like is…

218
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,531
Would you like to use this?

219
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,117
He has a girlfriend.

220
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,581
You approached me on purpose, didn't you?

221
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,628
There was a reason you told me to call you
if I got in trouble.

222
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,762
I told you my father's the chairman.

223
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,307
I overheard your phone call with him,

224
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,352
so don't try to deny or pretend.

225
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,276
Then go ask your dad, punk.

226
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,193
The fuck?

227
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,868
You're the only one…

228
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,246
who will tell the truth.

229
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,003
If I tell you that,

230
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,297
what's in it for me?

231
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,135
Will you tell me?

232
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,805
Not now.

233
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,310
It depends on you.

234
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,108
Yes, we're dating.

235
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,654
So don't bother her from now on.

236
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,659
If that's all, I'll head out.

237
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,343
No way. He's out of his mind.

238
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,471
"Yes, so don't bother her from now on."

239
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,181
What did I even do?

240
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,974
What really shocked me…

241
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,478
is that the girl isn't pretty at all.

242
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,480
Why…

243
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,482
What…

244
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,360
This is so sudden.

245
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,030
Does she have something on him?

246
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,661
You're not hiding anything from me,
are you?

247
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,246
No.

248
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,378
What is it?

249
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,797
I want to ask you that.

250
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,259
What have you done
in just two days since transferring?

251
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,679
Well, you know already.

252
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,972
Why even ask?

253
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,809
So did you really headbutt Baek Jenna

254
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,645
and steal Seo Do-eon's heart?

255
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,943
How amusing, Kim Hye-in.

256
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,820
What are you on about?

257
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,281
If it's true, congrats.

258
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,411
You cornered me to say that crap?

259
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,878
I really asked because I was amused.

260
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,716
Transfer student.

261
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,885
Shall we formally introduce ourselves?

262
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,013
I hope we can get along from now on.

263
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,516
You changed your tune real quick.

264
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,312
We don't feel like it,

265
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:57,399
but if you are dating Do-eon,
we don't have to be enemies.

266
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:02,195
Unlike the bulky fools sitting over there,

267
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,907
we're quick when it comes to calculations.

268
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:12,331
Well, I guess
I don't have to go out and make enemies.

269
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,541
Then it's a done deal?

270
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,544
How did you meet Do-eon anyway?

271
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:18,795
Who asked whom out first?

272
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,255
Did you already know each other?

273
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,758
You can't have fallen in love
at school in one day.

274
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,344
If there's a secret to seducing a member
from the Diamond Club, tell me.

275
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,096
Me too.

276
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,348
If you want to know, ask one at a time.

277
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,059
You're getting on my nerves.

278
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:35,187
But then we don't just have today.

279
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,938
This coming Friday,

280
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,274
there's a sorority party.

281
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,027
We can sit down and talk properly then.

282
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,572
So… A what party?

283
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:53,497
Simply put, there's a school club
that only girls can join.

284
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:59,086
But don't you think of
a silly club just anyone can join.

285
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:04,216
Girls like us, from verified families
worth over a certain amount,

286
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,719
get together regularly
to strengthen our friendships.

287
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:12,015
And you want me to go there?

288
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:16,144
To a party for girls
from verified families?

289
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,687
Leeches like you…

290
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,608
is not what I was saying.

291
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,152
Commoners who got in
via the Equal Opportunity System

292
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,737
could never dream of attending.

293
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,157
But you're dating Seo Do-eon.

294
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,911
The girlfriend of the Diamond Club member
would have privileges.

295
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,581
I'm not too sure.

296
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,292
Whether you give me the privilege or not,

297
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,753
I don't think I'd suit the event.

298
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:45,382
Are you kidding me?

299
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,300
You must go.

300
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,720
When will you get another chance
to attend a flashy party like that?

301
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,642
Why would I hang out with them
not knowing what could happen?

302
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,018
It would be stupid to go.

303
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,483
What did you tell me
when you first went there?

304
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,028
You said what the school gave you
were benefits, not freebies.

305
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:12,492
Wasn't it your goal to take advantage
of all the benefits and change your life?

306
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,039
You can get to know company successors,

307
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,042
and it's your chance
to get up close and personal.

308
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,460
Why are you shying away?

309
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,630
Why are you so aggressive today?

310
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,597
I want to end this jobless life,

311
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,975
so I'm applying for internships
here and there.

312
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,687
What used to be a menial internship

313
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,981
still requires connections.

314
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,318
I see.

315
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:54,868
I don't know what kind of horrors
you'll face at the party.

316
00:24:55,911 --> 00:25:00,832
But the world you'll emerge into
will be much dirtier and more unfair.

317
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:01,917
Don't forget that.

318
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,628
Okay.

319
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:08,757
Thanks for teaching a high schooler
who's trying hard such great life lessons.

320
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:12,677
Will you go, then?

321
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,096
No, I still can't.

322
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,015
Why not?

323
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,768
I want to go but I can't.

324
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,025
I don't have a dress to wear.

325
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,695
Wait.

326
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,667
NOT IN STOCK

327
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,545
What should I do now?

328
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:51,549
The girls there
will show up in designer dresses.

329
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,845
Instead of these cheap rental shops
that are a joke,

330
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,307
is there anyone who can lend you
a real designer dress?

331
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,894
I don't know anyone like that.

332
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,442
I think you know one person.

333
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,947
Who on earth is that?

334
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,740
Why not?

335
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,995
For real? You can lend me one?

336
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,079
Ms. Kim.

337
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:24,207
I mean Unnie.
How did you get an invitation?

338
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,251
Did you cause another scene?

339
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:27,877
Hey.

340
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,213
I know about the sorority party.

341
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:33,675
You must attend if you want to enter
the upper-class society.

342
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:38,722
I was unable to obtain information
because the qualifications were so strict.

343
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,849
Well, all is good.

344
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,144
Tell me everything in detail afterwards.

345
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:47,355
That's the condition
for me lending you a dress.

346
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,526
You're so shrewd, Na-yeon.

347
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,945
Of all the middle school kids I know,

348
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,322
I think you're the smartest.

349
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,157
Thanks.

350
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,535
Well, a review's easy.

351
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,662
If you lend me a dress,

352
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,165
I'll pay you decently
though it won't be enough.

353
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:08,585
Forget it. What would I do
with chump change?

354
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,255
I just need you
to keep it clean and return it.

355
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,925
You know party dresses
go for tens of millions of won, right?

356
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,517
Ma'am, it's me, Na-yeon.

357
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,102
The dress I bought last month.

358
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,146
Gosh, I wish she was my older sister.

359
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,522
Can you set it aside?

360
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:31,983
Okay, bye.

361
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,458
BAE GA-YOUNG

362
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,502
Come to this address by 7 p.m. tomorrow.

363
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,463
They check every guest at the door,

364
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,631
so show them this QR code.

365
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,511
A QR code and student ID?

366
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:01,721
What a fuss.

367
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,673
Oh, wow, perfect.

368
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,508
Just right.

369
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,385
You won't look out of place.

370
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:45,932
What's wrong?

371
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,435
Why do you look so glum?

372
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,938
I came all the way here,

373
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,566
but I feel intimidated.

374
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,446
You're wearing an eight-million-won dress.

375
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,656
Why would you say something like that?

376
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,241
Won't you be a debutante?

377
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,952
A debu-what?

378
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,496
Oh…

379
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,332
It's from a British drama I watch a lot.

380
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,587
When a noble comes of age
and is introduced to upper-class society,

381
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,088
that's what they are called.

382
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,468
You think we're in medieval England?

383
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,929
Not to mention, I'm not a noble.

384
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,056
Hey.

385
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,310
You might have been born lowly,

386
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,104
but through this party
you'll enter upper-class society,

387
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,898
so that is what you are.

388
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,441
A debutante.

389
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,109
Jeez.

390
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,655
Even Cinderella…

391
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,535
met her prince
because she was at the party.

392
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,537
Got that?

393
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,418
Go inside.

394
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,963
It'll be all girls,
so there won't be any princes,

395
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,510
but upper-class connections
who'll do your life a great deal of good…

396
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,012
might be in there.

397
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,903
Yes.

398
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:25,114
To get even a bit closer to them.

399
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,076
That'll do.

400
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,086
Do you know how much I wanted it?

401
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,630
Isn't it pretty?

402
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:41,631
Hey, today,

403
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,842
-can we hang out at the hotel?
-Yes.

404
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,745
I love this kind of feel.

405
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,847
Oh, gosh.

406
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,150
Even if it was for free,
didn't you take it a bit too willingly?

407
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,822
Those brats. This is an expensive dress.

408
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,659
Ouch, my ankle.

409
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,202
Are you okay?

410
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:57,332
Hey.

411
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,044
You don't know me?

412
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,338
I know you.

413
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,217
Nice to meet you.
You're Seo Do-eon's girlfriend.

414
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,971
Why are you here?

415
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:15,433
A party like this is
way beneath my standards,

416
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,561
but someone insisted
I should attend this time.

417
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,314
So I did.

418
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,364
It's Baek Jenna.

419
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,324
I'd wish she'd follow me on Instagram.

420
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,492
That's unexpected.

421
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,868
Isn't she beautiful?

422
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,351
Keep it clean

423
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,979
and return it.

424
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,860
This…

425
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,862
has to be…

426
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,325
a trap.

427
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,661
Fuck.

428
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:27,356
