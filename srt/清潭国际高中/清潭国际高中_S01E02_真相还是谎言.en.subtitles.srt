1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,954
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,167
You'd better step up

3
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,586
while I'm being nice.

4
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,007
Someone keeps talking to
the School Violence Committee.

5
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,719
Who is it?

6
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,890
How dare you?

7
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,351
No one's coming clean?

8
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,108
You're not talking?

9
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,076
Where are you going?

10
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,413
Where's Do-eon going?

11
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,336
Will you stop it?

12
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,465
You're the one who has been
bullying us for no reason.

13
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,224
What did we ever do to you?

14
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,308
You startled me!

15
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,227
Hey, you.

16
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,979
Did you just turn yourself in?

17
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,815
Well, aren't you fearless.

18
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,569
-I should just--
-I'm leaving.

19
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,949
What-- You're leaving already?

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,869
I haven't found out who tattled yet.

21
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,955
I was going to make
whoever tattled drink the whole pool

22
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,499
until they confessed
and beat the shit out of them.

23
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,336
Come on. Just spit it out.

24
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,338
Get a grip.

25
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,673
Then you drink it.

26
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,676
What?

27
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:22,016
You haven't found out who tattled.

28
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,104
You little…

29
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,148
Jump in right now.

30
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,828
Me too?

31
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,706
Damn it.

32
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,631
You there.

33
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,431
You asked what you did to us.

34
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,187
You really don't know?

35
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,864
It's your fault for being born this way.

36
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,042
-Oh, wow. Awesome.
-It's so pretty.

37
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,336
Look at this.

38
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,005
It's the bag I wanted.

39
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,089
Gosh.

40
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,050
Oh?

41
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,593
Where's this?

42
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,845
The photo came out amazing.

43
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,139
Oh.

44
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,017
The lights in my kitchen are
perfect for selfies.

45
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,896
How much were these Mary Jane shoes?

46
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,316
I'd love to buy a pair from this brand.

47
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,821
Those? They were 900,000,
maybe 800,000 won.

48
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,993
-Their shoes are at least a million won.
-Yes.

49
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,830
They are? I got confused.

50
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,337
Why did you only post it on Instagram?

51
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,923
You could've brought it to school.

52
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,341
Yes.

53
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,304
There is this junior in my department.

54
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,431
She is fricking pretty,

55
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,767
and has a fantastic bod.

56
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,020
She got into Hankuk,
so she must've done well in school.

57
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:36,317
All her clothes and shoes are
luxury brands, so she must be rich.

58
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:41,072
She drives a Mercedes-Benz
instead of a compact car.

59
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,365
That says it all.

60
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,075
She said that

61
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,247
she's never been given
an allowance in her life.

62
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,542
Since she was young,
she earned her own allowance.

63
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,797
I have something to confess.

64
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,720
I've never received an allowance before
in my life.

65
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,139
I work part-time to buy what I want.

66
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,893
I tutor middle school kids,
or work at a convenience store.

67
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,854
For real?

68
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,188
Yes.

69
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,066
What about the stuff on your Instagram?

70
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,818
So I asked her.

71
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:23,197
"How could you afford
the expensive clothes and the car?"

72
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,991
And?

73
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,871
"Clothes, food, housing.

74
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,248
Shouldn't one's parents provide that?

75
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,794
My father was lending me the car
until I can afford my own.

76
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:41,340
I cover other expenses with
what I earn myself."

77
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,092
That's what she said.

78
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,429
Clothes, food, and housing

79
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,890
are obviously provided by my parents.

80
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,726
Whatever else I need,

81
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,311
I earn myself.

82
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,937
Wow.

83
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,564
That's awesome.

84
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,194
But I don't want to bring
what my parents got me

85
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,196
to school just to show off.

86
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,700
They're so expensive
and I don't want to lose them.

87
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,993
What?

88
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,080
Only you and I react like that.

89
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,290
She's really popular on campus.

90
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:18,461
Looks, education, figure, background…
She has it all,

91
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,965
and yet she earns her own allowance,
making her a true model student.

92
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,468
Hye-in, you're so amazing.

93
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,970
On top of that, you do well in school too.

94
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,433
You're the model student
I've only read about online.

95
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,395
-Keep posting, okay?
-Okay.

96
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,315
You'll score ads and sponsors
if you have over 10,000 followers.

97
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,734
Then you won't have to
promote anything else.

98
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,533
How much can you make
by promoting stuff on Instagram?

99
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,702
About three or four million won a month?

100
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,162
That's what my friends said.

101
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,443
Who's sleeping in the back?

102
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,154
Can the student in front wake her?

103
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,659
Why won't you wake her up?

104
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:35,163
It's Baek Jenna. The chairman
of Hanmyung Group's only child.

105
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,501
Is the chairman of Hanmyung Group's
only child allowed to sleep in class?

106
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,347
Wake up.

107
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,060
What?

108
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:03,399
I don't care if your grades are poor
or if they get worse.

109
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,776
But attitude's a different matter.

110
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,656
I heard all of you here are special,

111
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:15,495
but still,
a student should have some basic manners.

112
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,728
Do you know something?

113
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,940
Your pronunciation sucks.

114
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,529
I heard you're new.

115
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,783
How dare an under-qualified
fixed-term teacher talk about basics?

116
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,160
You're being presumptuous.

117
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,506
Ma'am.

118
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,216
The tutor's here.

119
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,593
Na-yeon won't be home for a while.

120
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,639
She's been coming early lately
to prepare for the session.

121
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,933
Hello, ma'am?

122
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,812
You're working extra hard
because of Na-yeon.

123
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,398
I'll tell the housekeeper

124
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,857
to serve you something nicer.

125
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,111
It's fine. I'm only doing my job.

126
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,071
Don't say it's fine.

127
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,284
Please look out for Ms. Sun-ju
so that she has everything she needs.

128
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,451
Yes, sure.

129
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:17,533
If I want to get Instagram ads,
I need my follower count to go up.

130
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:22,163
The reactions are all the same
because my posts are the same.

131
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,122
What are you doing in there?

132
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,213
Oh, I was on my way to the bathroom

133
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,048
and it caught my eye,
so I was looking around.

134
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,134
You shouldn't do that.

135
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,303
Poking around in someone else's room
could look suspicious.

136
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,265
Right.

137
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:29,957
What's this?

138
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,261
Wow.

139
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,515
So this is the uniform
of that special school for the rich.

140
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,243
Excuse me, ma'am.

141
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,329
What?

142
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:15,252
Is this the uniform of the high school
Na-yeon's going to attend?

143
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,129
Why does she have it already?

144
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:21,050
Oh, that uniform, if you want it made
with golden…

145
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,637
What was it? Some fancy fabric.
And have every seam hand-stitched,

146
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,723
you must order in advance, apparently.

147
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,643
I think my impatient employer
placed the order

148
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:34,188
with the most famous
premium Gangnam tailor shop a year ago.

149
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,398
Why'd she do that?

150
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,109
What if Na-yeon doesn't get in?

151
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,987
That's impossible. She spent a fortune.

152
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:46,158
Anyway, that was delivered
in a limousine yesterday,

153
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,868
so hang it back up
so it doesn't get scratched.

154
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,329
Okay.

155
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,397
I got in.

156
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,281
Wow.

157
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,285
It's not at all like my uniform.

158
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,514
What should I say?

159
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,434
I'll go with this.

160
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,186
TRIED ON THE UNIFORM

161
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,855
OF THE FAMOUS CHEONGDAM
INTERNATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL

162
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,189
SHOULD I JUST TRANSFER SCHOOLS?

163
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,108
#CIHS
#UNIFORM SELFIE

164
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,222
You're so lucky,

165
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,600
Kang Na-yeon.

166
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,946
I'm home!

167
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:49,865
No way.

168
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,742
Why is she back already?

169
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,455
-You're back early.
-Where's Mom?

170
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,166
-She just left for a gathering.
-Great.

171
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,252
Where's the uniform I got yesterday?
I want to update my Instagram.

172
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,546
-Check the walk-in closet.
-Okay.

173
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,178
Oh, no.

174
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,098
Why can't I get the buttons out?

175
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,977
It's not there.

176
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,064
Damn it.

177
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,658
That crazy goldfish of a woman.

178
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,202
My uniform wasn't in the walk-in closet.

179
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:43,711
What am I supposed to do
if it's not in my room either?

180
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,714
Ma'am.

181
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,216
Please leave the room.

182
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,766
What was that?

183
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,870
Ms. Sun-ju?

184
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,258
CIHS REALLY IS A WORLD APART.

185
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,349
ARE THOSE SHOPPING BAGS
FROM A LUXURY BRAND?

186
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,071
Is she out of her mind?

187
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,343
Ms. Sun-ju. No, that's not it.

188
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,846
Should I call you "Ms. Hye-in?"

189
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,849
I shouldn't even say "Ms."

190
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,644
You're just two years older than me.

191
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,940
Shall I call you Unnie instead?

192
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,485
I didn't have any bad intentions.

193
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,446
-I swear.
-I don't know about intentions.

194
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,658
Isn't it fraud to lie about your degree?

195
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,744
My mom will definitely sue
if she finds out.

196
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,205
I'll tell your mother

197
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,416
that I must quit due to personal reasons.

198
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,546
Can you please not tell your mom?

199
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,633
Please don't tell her. Please? For me?

200
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,724
Okay.

201
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,518
Really?

202
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,645
Thank you.

203
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,813
Thanks, Na-yeon.

204
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,441
You're the nicest
middle school kid I know.

205
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:16,530
I will make it up to you one day.

206
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,163
That doesn't mean I'll let it slide.

207
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,667
What?

208
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:35,591
As you asked,
I won't tell my mom what you did.

209
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,217
In return,

210
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,721
you must make up for what you did to me.

211
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,809
Are you a member?

212
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,144
That'll be 2,800 won.

213
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,627
-I'll pay with this.
-Okay.

214
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,675
The transaction's complete. Please take

215
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,844
-your credit card.
-Thank you. Goodbye.

216
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,183
Are you done with math?

217
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,644
I'm almost done.

218
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,278
YEAR 3 CLASS 3 KANG NA-YEON

219
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,823
Why is middle school homework
so hard these days?

220
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,410
I don't think I learned this back then.

221
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,122
Will you do it properly?

222
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,041
Look, like this.

223
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,085
Use some colored pens.

224
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:56,588
Do you know how thoroughly
that brat Na-yeon checks?

225
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,386
Why did you have to go
and do something so insane?

226
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,682
Hey.

227
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,935
No matter how hard I try,
I just don't get it.

228
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,437
What did you always say to me?

229
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,774
"If I'm lucky, I'll get a salary.
Even if not, I'll be a civil servant."

230
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:19,069
That was the future,
dream, and goal you had.

231
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,571
So why did you pretend to be a rich kid?

232
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,909
I guess I lost my mind for a while.

233
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:27,953
What?

234
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,380
At first, I did it
because I didn't want to be embarrassed.

235
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,675
As if being born poor wasn't enough,

236
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:45,387
standing there being humiliated
felt worse than anything.

237
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,557
But then

238
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,768
once I got the taste of it,

239
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,854
it wasn't too bad.

240
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,149
Good grief.

241
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,485
Oh, whatever.

242
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,572
It's a dream
that'll never come true in this life.

243
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,075
I guess I wanted to live it on Instagram.

244
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,665
You say that as if
you're talking about someone else.

245
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,209
What's the problem?

246
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,337
I'm being punished for it, aren't I?

247
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,923
This is the punishment?

248
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,759
Doing homework for a middle school kid?

249
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,180
You should be eternally grateful that

250
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,057
you got caught by
someone nice like Na-yeon.

251
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,100
"Nice?"

252
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,060
Who's nice?

253
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:39,733
Kang Na-yeon, that brat,
is the nastiest middle school kid I know.

254
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,152
She's evil and malicious.

255
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,321
She's a bitch.

256
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,827
-Hey, isn't this cute?
-It is.

257
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,871
-What do you think? Is it cute?
-It's pretty. Yes.

258
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,122
-Shall I get it?
-Yes.

259
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,265
Can you take one in landscape mode?

260
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,063
You took it when my eyes were closed.

261
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,273
Here. Hold it up like this.

262
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,822
Girls, can you get out of the frame?

263
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,156
Keep going.

264
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,462
Again.

265
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,383
Ms. Sun-ju.

266
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,137
Thanks for today.

267
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:34,848
What?

268
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,392
Is there something else
you want me to do?

269
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:41,229
You catch on right away now. Then…

270
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,691
This will be the last.

271
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,907
YEAR 3 CLASS 3 SHIN HA-NEUL

272
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,992
YEAR 3 CLASS 3 HAN JI-SOO

273
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,119
YEAR 3 CLASS 7 YANG HA-EUN

274
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,537
What's this?

275
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,294
I have to do
your friends' homework too now?

276
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,838
Hey. This isn't fair.

277
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,925
Do you really want to raise your voice?

278
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:10,884
My mom's

279
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,220
in the living room
right around the corner.

280
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,354
My exams are coming up.

281
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,398
But because of you, I can't study.

282
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,109
Do you know how important
a high-school junior's grades are?

283
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,820
You're not the only one who has exams.

284
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,490
My entrance exam is next week too.

285
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,452
Once the interview's done,

286
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,039
I won't need a tutor anymore.

287
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:42,749
Am I wrong?

288
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,095
I'll let it slide
because it's the last time.

289
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,635
Oh? Hey, your phone's ringing.

290
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:37,637
What?

291
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,682
KANG NA-YEON

292
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,656
-Hello…
-What took you so long?

293
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,410
I said I have mid-term exams.

294
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,911
ENTRANCE INTERVIEW

295
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,873
I left my interview script at home.

296
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:09,002
Hey. You should've been more careful.

297
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,713
I don't know what to do.

298
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,882
I need you to get it for me.

299
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,512
Did you try calling your mom?

300
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,516
How about your chauffeur
or your housekeeper--

301
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,353
Mom won't pick up,
the housekeeper's on a break,

302
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,356
and the chauffeur
doesn't even know what it is.

303
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,776
I can't do the interview
without the script.

304
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,028
What do I do?

305
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,868
My exam starts soon.

306
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,581
If I miss the interview
and don't get into Cheongdam High,

307
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,416
I'll go and kill myself.

308
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,254
And I'll tell my mom
all the lies you told.

309
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,594
Come on.

310
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,231
It's 8:00 a.m., so…

311
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,801
I found it.

312
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,978
She'll come when I call her.

313
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,148
She came to carry our stuff
when we went shopping.

314
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,858
She must have no self-esteem.

315
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,026
It would be insane
if she comes here today.

316
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,446
Do you think she will come?

317
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,157
What other choice does she have?

318
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,993
If I were to tell
everything she has done so far,

319
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,579
knowing what my mom's like,
she will pitch a fit.

320
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,207
Calling her over
on the day of the mid-term

321
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,834
to mess with her is cruel, though.

322
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,586
You said she's poor.

323
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,047
She should go to
a good university at least.

324
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,009
Who told her to be born that way?

325
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,179
She can tour Cheongdam International High
thanks to me.

326
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,808
There she is.

327
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,602
Over here.

328
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,731
See? What did I tell you?

329
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,566
She'll come when I call her.

330
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,778
I can't believe you have
a high-school errand girl.

331
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,909
Didn't you say this was urgent?

332
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,787
Oh. Right.

333
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,289
Thanks a lot.

334
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,083
But…

335
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,797
I'm sure going to miss you
when we're done.

336
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,090
I had a lot of fun thanks to you.

337
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,970
Oh.

338
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,431
Am I the only one who thinks so?

339
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:17,774
I'll talk to my mom for you
and ask her to give you a huge bonus.

340
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:19,984
Well, then…

341
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,862
I must go to my interview.

342
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,031
Let's go, girls.

343
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,450
Already?

344
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,620
What a shame. I was having fun.

345
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,747
Will you hurry up?

346
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,049
Explain the situation, then.

347
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,510
You can't retake the exam.
It's your fault.

348
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,346
Why did you miss school
when you care so much about your grades?

349
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,639
On an exam day of all days!

350
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,766
You said she's poor.

351
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,352
She should go to
a good university at least.

352
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:57,564
When you're poor,
hard work only gets you so far.

353
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,566
As if being born poor wasn't enough…

354
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,359
-We should live according to our means.
-Are you really loaded?

355
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,986
-It felt worse than anything.
--She has the balls to say that…

356
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,530
And usually the poor do that.

357
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,637
Why won't anything work out?

358
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,680
Hey.

359
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:16,559
Oh.

360
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,103
Would you like to use this?

361
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:26,027
No. I'm fine.

362
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,279
KIM HAE-IN

363
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,948
KIM HYE-IN

364
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,247
We have similar names.

365
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,646
Thanks for lending it to me.

366
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,826
SORRY, I AM A LEECH

367
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,372
Do they think
I fucking wanted to be born this way?

368
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:40,309
If you give me a chance to study at the
great Cheongdam International High School,

369
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,311
I'll work on realizing my big dreams

370
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,022
and become someone
that represents Korea…

371
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,193
Who's that?

372
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,630
Hey.

373
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,215
Kim Hye-in?

374
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,815
Fuck your stupid dreams.

375
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,401
You must become a decent person first.

376
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:34,340
