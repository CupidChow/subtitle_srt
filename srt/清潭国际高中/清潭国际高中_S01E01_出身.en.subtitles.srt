1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,038
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,134
No matter how hard I work or live,

3
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,720
nothing changes much.

4
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,973
And that's why…

5
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,392
I wasn't even envious.

6
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,437
Cheongdam High encourages
social inequality. Shut it down!

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,773
-Shut it down!
-Shut it down!

8
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,733
We're against privileged education!

9
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,318
We're against privileged education!

10
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,070
No more school for nobles!

11
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,738
I'm so sick of this.

12
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,491
How long will they keep it up?

13
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,993
They're whining out of jealousy.

14
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,413
If we let their kids attend our school,

15
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,999
those punks would do
a cartwheel to celebrate.

16
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,169
-What?
-I'm already…

17
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,547
These kids think life is easy
because they were born lucky.

18
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,601
You know, I have nothing to wear.

19
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,437
You too? Me too.
Why don't I have anything to wear?

20
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,485
-Is that a new bag?
-Dad got it for me. Pretty, right?

21
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,278
How much was it?

22
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,323
He said he paid a premium.
About four million won?

23
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,497
I'm sorry,
but we're fully booked until dinner.

24
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,748
What?

25
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,126
How are you fully booked?
The place is empty.

26
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,968
We were just lucky enough to be born
with silver spoons in our mouths.

27
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,055
Welcome.

28
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,238
Hey.

29
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,499
Hey, you. Get off.

30
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,130
There's nothing to think about.
I'll take it.

31
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:55,842
Did you see the price tag?

32
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,135
It's 58 million won.

33
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,303
Yes.

34
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,347
I chose this because
the newest model's not yet released.

35
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,849
Is there a problem?

36
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,645
What I mean is, where would
a student get the money for it?

37
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,565
Where would a student get the money?

38
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,276
Obviously, I'm putting it on…

39
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,403
my mom's credit card.

40
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,990
They never earned
even 100 won in their lifetime.

41
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,162
Gosh.

42
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,291
Sorry, Do-eon. This is too much…

43
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,879
I don't feel comfortable taking it.

44
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,716
Then throw it away.

45
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,384
What?

46
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,345
But it's…

47
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,141
This is nothing to me. Happy now?

48
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,143
But I…

49
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,732
They think they're special.

50
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:10,875
You got others to bully others who got in
via the Equal Opportunity System

51
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,627
and even instigated it.

52
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,926
They say you're the ringleader,
so explain yourself if you can.

53
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,934
Listen, Baek Jenna.

54
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,146
Don't you know
your father Chairman Baek Ju-won

55
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,275
and the board chairman agreed
to this School Violence Committee?

56
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,946
People are already complaining
you're privileged nobles, and…

57
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,241
This…

58
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,368
is not at all a simple matter.

59
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,164
There's evidence too.

60
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,874
Exactly.

61
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,584
What?

62
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,312
It wasn't Jenna. I did it.

63
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,479
-I did it.
-It was me.

64
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,605
-I did it.
-It was me.

65
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,525
-I did it all.
-It was actually me.

66
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,694
If it's that serious an issue,

67
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,866
you shouldn't investigate so sloppily.

68
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,080
You're using a laptop my company made.

69
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,751
That model's at least two years old.

70
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:37,587
Shall I get you the newest one?

71
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,053
If this is a school for nobles,

72
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,307
that makes me a royal.

73
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,894
You didn't know that?

74
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,440
Now I curse

75
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,568
their haughty, arrogant mugs.

76
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,908
-She's a low-income applicant?
-What a pauper.

77
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,453
No one told you to be born that way.

78
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,793
Help me. Is anyone there?

79
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,294
I'm in here!

80
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,799
Do they think
I fucking wanted to be born like this?

81
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,225
It's true, to be honest.

82
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,607
You lot and I. How are we different?

83
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,377
I want to be like you all.

84
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,630
I'd die for it.

85
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,765
SUNWOO GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL
3 MONTHS AGO

86
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,019
Sorry.

87
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,115
What do you think of
Cheongdam International High?

88
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,539
Isn't the annual tuition 100 million won?

89
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,001
To be honest, I feel relatively deprived.

90
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,044
I'd want to go there if I could afford it.

91
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,715
But you need more than cash to get in.

92
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:50,261
Still, it's a fact
that I'm dead jealous of the kids there.

93
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,056
Don't mind them.

94
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,143
They were born in a league of their own.

95
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,396
They live in a world
that has nothing to do with me.

96
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,023
So why bother yapping about it?

97
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,164
CHEONGDAM INTERNATIONAL HIGH
ADMISSIONS INFO

98
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,709
Should I have dressed up a bit?

99
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,021
Who is it?

100
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,483
I'm here to interview
for the tutor position.

101
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,564
Hello.

102
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,776
How are you?

103
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,736
Come and sit down.

104
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,533
You look so young in person.

105
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,202
A bit different from the photo.

106
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,173
The long trip must've been tiring. Eat.

107
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,133
Oh, thank you.

108
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,886
It was closer than I thought,
so it wasn't too far--

109
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,764
It must be your first time
in a neighborhood like this.

110
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,230
Gosh. I can't believe
our housekeeper served you this.

111
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,569
Even the clueless can tell what's good.

112
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,450
Oh, these cookies are hard to get.

113
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,869
Do you know Seocho Hotel?

114
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,289
I'm friends with the owner's wife,

115
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,710
and I asked her to get the head patissier
to set some of the cookies aside for me.

116
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,589
Try it.

117
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,635
When would you
ever get to have one, right?

118
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,313
Your daughter's preparing to enter
Cheongdam International High School?

119
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,483
I prepared a curriculum.

120
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,527
-Would you like to--
-Oh, leave it.

121
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,071
You go to Hankuk University
so I'm sure you did well.

122
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,907
I'll cut to the chase.

123
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,451
You must know if you've heard,

124
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,620
but Cheongdam High's
admissions office

125
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,373
doesn't care that much about math grades.

126
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,919
What really matters when securing a spot
is money and connections.

127
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,216
Then why do you need a math tutor?

128
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,801
Why hire a tutor?

129
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,930
Just in case Na-yeon doesn't get in,
despite throwing

130
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,308
all the money and connections we have.

131
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,645
Just because her math score's
a few points below par.

132
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,649
But then neither of us want to get

133
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,986
too stressed out over a few points.

134
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,321
How should I put it?

135
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,908
See what you can do somehow,
as best you can, kind of.

136
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,743
You get what I'm saying?

137
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:32,209
Somehow, as best I can, kind of.

138
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,545
Ma'am.

139
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:36,630
Got it.

140
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,722
Why isn't she here yet?

141
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,767
I'm not late, am I? Is it a close safe?

142
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,187
You're not late,

143
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,399
but can't you come
at least ten minutes early to take over?

144
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,739
I'll think about it if you pay me
for the extra ten minutes.

145
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,702
That person over there.
You know her, right?

146
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,039
She's been waiting for you.

147
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,500
This isn't a shelter for the homeless.

148
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,002
Tell her to wash her hair at least.

149
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,055
Thanks for lending it to me.

150
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,015
And this is your pay.

151
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,853
Nice. I was just about to starve to death.

152
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,955
Did you wash your face today?

153
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,748
Why won't you wash your hair?

154
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,793
I don't have hot water.

155
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,880
Shouldn't you be a tutor, not me?

156
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:04,134
Why live like this
when you go to Hankuk University?

157
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,931
It's the same even if you attend Harvard.

158
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,851
We were born penniless
and hard work will only take us so far.

159
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,813
Hey.

160
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,859
Didn't you see the news
about the doctor who died all alone?

161
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:28,742
Should you say that to a high schooler
who's trying so hard?

162
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,957
What do you live on?

163
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,294
-Your love?
-Gosh.

164
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,274
Kim Hye-in.

165
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,067
Our teacher wants to see you.

166
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,409
I won't get any financial aid?

167
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:15,289
Wasn't the school
going to pay for the English Camp?

168
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:19,627
I was told my grades were good enough.

169
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,298
Yes, of course
your grades are good enough.

170
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,634
It's just that…

171
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,512
there's another student
who's even worse off than you.

172
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:34,016
The school decided to pay for her.

173
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,643
What?

174
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,938
I know your financial situation, but…

175
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:47,321
The other kid's an orphan
and lives with their grandmother.

176
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,575
-Try to understand--
-What does that have to do with me?

177
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,497
Knowing there's a kid who's even worse off

178
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,750
doesn't make my situation any better.

179
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,714
Right. It doesn't make it better.

180
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:15,474
It's not that you can't go.
You have to pay just 3.5 million won.

181
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,686
Can't your parents pay that much?

182
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,898
Hye-in, are you going to the New Zealand
English Camp over the holidays?

183
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,942
What?

184
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,654
Rumors say that
you already have a study plan.

185
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,950
Let's study together.

186
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,786
Not as freeloaders.

187
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,748
We'll share our English essays with you.
How does that sound?

188
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,377
Oh, well…

189
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,800
I'm actually considering not going.

190
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,510
Why not?

191
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,346
To be honest,

192
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,142
a school-wide English camp
will have a boring program.

193
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,395
I don't think it'll do me any good.

194
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,440
Really?

195
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,025
Yes.

196
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,907
-I'm home.
-Hi.

197
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,583
Your leg's hurting again, Dad?

198
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:27,004
I walked home from the bus stop
and it's acting up.

199
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,380
I'll be fine after a while.

200
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:33,052
I told you to take a taxi.
It doesn't cost much anyway.

201
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:37,723
It's not like money grows on trees.
Not even 100 won's for free in this world.

202
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,935
We should live according to our means.

203
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,064
Not that again.

204
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,818
That means
I should live penniless forever.

205
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,195
You said something?

206
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,199
What is it?

207
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,580
What are you doing
in my room again? Get out!

208
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,083
You little…

209
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,751
Get out!

210
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,421
Gosh, you and your temper…

211
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,674
What's that bitch's problem?

212
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,478
SUNWOO GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL NOTICE

213
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,358
ENGLISH CAMP APPLICATION

214
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,362
Hye-in, are you going to the New Zealand
English Camp over the holidays?

215
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,847
You said you would just unbox it.

216
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,015
Did you have to try it on for photos?

217
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,810
Uploading on Instagram
after a shopping spree

218
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,311
is basic manners, you know.

219
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,815
Don't you have any manners for me?

220
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,360
Ms. Kim. Do you think this cardigan

221
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,654
and this bag go well together?

222
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,866
It's adorable in real life,

223
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,952
but it looks a bit gaudy in the photo.

224
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,248
Don't you already have that bag?

225
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,794
I'm pretty sure I saw a bag
that looked just like it.

226
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,630
Yes. There it is.

227
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,930
What are you saying?

228
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,767
One's a limited edition,
and one's a steady seller

229
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,020
that's also the most basic design.

230
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,192
Look. How are they the same?

231
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,736
No amount of money can get you this.

232
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,323
It's an ultra-rare item
that a celeb helped design.

233
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,119
This is a new release
and there's a pink one too.

234
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,997
Well…

235
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,501
I just can't tell the difference.

236
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:16,798
Three million won?

237
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,592
What about it?

238
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,928
This cost even more.

239
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:23,847
Was it five million won?

240
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,063
It costs just as much as
the New Zealand trip.

241
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,147
That's madness.

242
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,070
Aren't you wasting too much on luxuries?

243
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,405
However immature you may be.

244
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,117
Why would you put it like that?

245
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,912
I really don't get it, that's why.

246
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,749
Why does a schoolgirl need bags
that cost three or five million won?

247
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:53,835
Same goes for the clothes
and shoes you usually wear.

248
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:59,007
If I were you,
I wouldn't spend money on stuff like that.

249
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,051
To be honest, it's a waste of money.

250
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,514
Is it?

251
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,099
Yes.

252
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,694
As you said, they do look similar.

253
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:23,365
I'll give you the one I had.

254
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,410
Take it.

255
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,750
What?

256
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,462
I'll give it to you for free.

257
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,132
I don't think I'll use the old bag.

258
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,346
If I were to sell it second-hand,

259
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,975
could I get at least
three or four million won?

260
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,102
You don't need it?

261
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,689
-Forget it, then.
-No.

262
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,861
See?

263
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,741
You'd jump at the chance
if someone were to offer it for free.

264
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,242
What a joke.

265
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,499
My mom said that Koreans

266
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,419
have a weird tendency
to degrade and pretend.

267
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,714
They don't want what they can't have.

268
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,425
And usually…

269
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,969
the poor do that.

270
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,016
Well,

271
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,560
I'm not directing that at you.

272
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,604
I need a bathroom break.

273
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,576
Why is it so quiet today?

274
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,853
Hey, what's up with you?

275
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,480
Are you insane?

276
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,235
I think life's so unfair.

277
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,363
What? You got that now?

278
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,158
Even so,

279
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:34,079
I believed
I'd be rewarded for my hard work.

280
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:36,832
But…

281
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,919
I think the gods have all gone and died.

282
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,507
Wow. Furious high schoolers
are scary beings.

283
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,599
One of the juniors in my department

284
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:59,896
was super pretty
and had a fucking sexy body.

285
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,903
For some reason, the mundane story

286
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,780
Sun-ju told me came to me so clearly

287
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,700
right at that moment.

288
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,913
Perhaps it all started that day.

289
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:22,252
So, what's the moral of the story?

290
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,045
The moral?

291
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:26,882
There isn't one.

292
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,218
I guess

293
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,555
to work and struggle hard like you

294
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,098
and expect a reward for it,

295
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,228
this world's a bit too corrupt

296
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,314
and totally unfair.

297
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,234
That's it.

298
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,364
That sucks.

299
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,789
Hello.

300
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:02,751
Welcome. Na-yeon said she's running late.

301
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,925
We covered this too.

302
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,656
Koreans have a weird tendency

303
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,116
to degrade and pretend.

304
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,577
They don't want what they can't have.

305
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,081
And usually…

306
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,417
the poor do that.

307
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,802
Why would I degrade it?

308
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,846
It's not pretty at all.

309
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,408
HOW DOES THIS LOOK?
I DON'T THINK IT'S PRETTY AT ALL

310
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,869
FYI, IT COSTS FIVE MILLION.
LUXURY BAG

311
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,166
I'm home.

312
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,349
-You're home.
-Yes.

313
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,272
We'll study this today.

314
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,649
-We'll see.
-Okay.

315
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,531
Hey.

316
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,392
Kim Hye-in.

317
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,061
Is it true that you applied for

318
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:12,607
the low-income scholarship
for the New Zealand English Camp?

319
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,859
Who told you?

320
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:19,864
The class president heard you
and our teacher talk in the office.

321
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,370
I can't believe that you're poor,

322
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,457
but you said the boring program
wouldn't do you any good.

323
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,209
Why did you even say that?

324
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,839
She has the balls to say that
when she's going for free.

325
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,135
Hey, I have mad news.

326
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,636
Kim Hye-in.

327
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,348
Why'd you put on a show
when you were loaded?

328
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,195
A rich high schooler
with a five-million-won bag.

329
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,697
I'm dead jealous.

330
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,950
It's a limited edition.
They imported only a few. That's mad.

331
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,203
I wish I had her life.

332
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,247
She lives in a different world.

333
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,875
What do you think her family does?

334
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,004
Oh, wow. If it's not pretty,
please throw it away to me.

335
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,673
Did you see this? The house looks fancy.

336
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,802
-Aren't you Hye-in from Class One?
-What a life. I'm envious.

337
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,637
What's all this?

338
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,931
FOLLOWERS

339
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:40,528
Kim Hye-in. Tell us straight up.

340
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,322
Are you really loaded?

341
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,241
-See?
-What did I say?

342
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,289
Hye-in. Tell the truth.

343
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,999
You're a low-income student.

344
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,877
-What?
-She's low-income?

345
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,754
-What's this, then?
-It's a lie?

346
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,298
I must explain two things.

347
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,801
-What was that, then?
-She's unbelievable.

348
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:10,016
The fact that I'm low-income
and that it's a lie that I'm loaded.

349
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,605
You're here already?
Na-yeon won't be back for a while.

350
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:19,025
I was in the area and had time to kill.

351
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,902
Can I wait in her bedroom?

352
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,153
-Yes, sure.
-Thanks.

353
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,918
But when given a chance to choose,

354
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,547
wouldn't everyone choose to seem rich?

355
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,426
Expensive bags.

356
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,057
Pretty stilettos.

357
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:54,811
Nice clothes.

358
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,860
I just have to choose.

359
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,455
Because the kids anyway…

360
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,708
That's right.

361
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:20,044
I was actually born filthy rich.

362
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,715
See? What did I say?

363
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:41,376
