1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,954
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,125
YOUR EVERYDAY ONLINE COMMUNITY

3
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,045
Who do you think is
the most influential teen in Korea?

4
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,840
I'M THE LEGEND
FOR POSTING THIS FROM MY ROOM

5
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:49,966
Jang Won-young from IVE?

6
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,176
Excluding celebs.

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,761
Then it's her.

8
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,722
Hanmyung Group's chairman's only daughter.

9
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,390
Oh, Baek Jenna?

10
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,393
I heard she's fricking pretty.

11
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,145
She's living the true life of a god.

12
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,651
Oh, her name's Baek Jenna?

13
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,075
What do people like her lack in life?

14
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,220
Shall I book this place for dinner?

15
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,222
Yes.

16
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,435
It's pretty.

17
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,191
Jenna.

18
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,152
Oh, just my damn luck.

19
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,116
I spend a fortune here each year

20
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,201
and you let just anyone into my space?

21
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,995
I apologize.

22
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,997
I lost my appetite.

23
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,334
Get the car ready. I'm going home.

24
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,087
And I'll just wear these home.

25
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,263
Jenna, wait.

26
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,267
How dare you?
Who said you could act like you know me?

27
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,310
Do you want to die?

28
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,232
I get why you hate and resent me.

29
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,152
But I don't want to be your enemy.

30
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,449
Then should I become best friends
with the gold digger who stole my dad?

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,787
You indiscreet crazy bitch.

32
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,205
I might have wronged you,

33
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,709
but not your mother.

34
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:52,630
To be honest, it's not my fault
your parents drifted apart.

35
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,468
I'm not interested in
your company or assets.

36
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:01,931
I don't even care that your father's
the chairman of the Hanmyung Group.

37
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,143
I just love him as a human being should.

38
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,562
Is that such a grave sin?

39
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,734
5,120,000 WON

40
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:16,529
You're using his money to buy a dress
that costs more than your salary,

41
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,072
and you dare talk about love?

42
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,038
Do you know why I treat
the likes of you subhumanly?

43
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,541
If you had at least been honest
about wanting his money,

44
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,501
then I'd have taken pity on you.

45
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,713
I can't believe
even the poor have self-esteem.

46
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,108
I knew it. She tattled to him already.

47
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,193
FATHER

48
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,157
Hello.

49
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,411
Ms. Jenna, he says to answer your phone.

50
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,288
Say you're not with me.

51
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,374
He knows you're headed home.

52
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,125
Then I won't go home.

53
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,337
Don't you dare look for me.

54
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,911
Where did they go?

55
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,097
Hey.

56
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:08,516
What?

57
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,143
Who are you?

58
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,646
You're wearing my uniform.

59
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,399
And you're asking who I am?

60
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,653
Shouldn't you deny it first?

61
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,905
What are you on about?

62
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,618
Are you a transfer?

63
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,620
Don't you know who I am?

64
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,375
You. I'll let you off today
because I'm in a bad mood.

65
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,755
Stay out of my sight at school.

66
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,051
You little piece of shit.

67
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,095
How dare that thief say that to me?

68
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,555
You can't just walk off.

69
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,683
-What are you doing? Are you insane?
-Even prison food's a waste on you.

70
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,269
I'll educate you with my own hands,

71
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,687
so keep on talking.

72
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,314
-Why you…
-Damn it!

73
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,024
Let go of me!

74
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,734
You crazy bitch.

75
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,824
-What are you doing?
-Keep still!

76
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,868
You sneaky thieving bitch.

77
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,953
-Why won't it come off?
-Hey!

78
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,375
I said keep still, you crazy bitch.

79
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,336
Do you know how much these cost?

80
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,520
Kim Hye-in?

81
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,025
CHEONGDAM
INTERNATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL

82
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,204
What were you doing in there?

83
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,545
I was looking for a book to read.

84
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,383
You're back early.

85
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,179
The pastor's not feeling too well.

86
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,183
It looks like So-mang
got in trouble again.

87
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,228
Oh, Lee So-mang in senior year?

88
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,273
What happens at school
goes away if we cover it up.

89
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,737
But why did he have to
cause trouble in front of others,

90
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,697
making it hard to clean up?

91
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,282
Goodness.

92
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,743
You're not close, are you?

93
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,746
Not really.

94
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,708
Don't you hang out with just anyone.

95
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,504
Not all friends are the same.

96
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,424
Of course not. Don't worry.

97
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,150
Lee So-mang?

98
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,986
I thought your father grounded you.

99
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,201
Well, I made up for it with this.

100
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,787
Gosh, the pastor packs a punch.

101
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,293
My dad will most definitely go to hell.

102
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,639
I'm just asking you
to pack them like before.

103
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,558
Why can't you do that?

104
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,893
Look. I even have a receipt from today.

105
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,689
Designer labels charge for packaging too.

106
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,318
People even resell
dust bags and boxes online.

107
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,698
I'm not saying I want it to sell it.

108
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,826
I lost them because someone stole them.

109
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,412
This is a first for us too.

110
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:55,261
It's the first designer item of my life
and that psycho bitch…

111
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,958
Ms. Jenna. What happened?

112
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,710
Not another word!

113
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,046
How dare she touch me?

114
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,423
I'll murder that psycho weirdo.

115
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,014
It's said that…

116
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:45,061
nice shoes take you to nice places.

117
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,443
The first day I was there,

118
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,570
do you know what I saw

119
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,781
that shocked me to the core?

120
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,741
What did you see?

121
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,498
A new world.

122
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,632
There was a new world

123
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,009
I never knew of.

124
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,569
And I realized something.

125
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,073
Up until now, I thought

126
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,368
my life was pretty good.

127
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,414
That was just because…

128
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,083
during the 18 years of my life…

129
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,253
I hadn't seen much.

130
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,508
I hadn't experienced much.

131
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,896
I didn't even know what to be envious of.

132
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,367
I was a teeny tiny fish in a tiny pond.

133
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,037
Ta-da. Isn't it pretty?

134
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,706
My gosh.

135
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,626
The lady at the store said it'll take
a while to get the exact same stone.

136
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,045
I got you an even better one
since you lost yours.

137
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,006
Woo-jin…

138
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,507
-I'll put it on for you.
-Okay.

139
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,606
There.

140
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,234
It's lovely. I like it.

141
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,069
-It's really pretty?
-Yes.

142
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,613
You can't see it at all.

143
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,980
It's so hard to resist the temptation.

144
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,527
You're doing so well.

145
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,490
Shall I help?

146
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,119
Sweetie. Shall we just get married?

147
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,164
We're bound to marry anyway.

148
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,626
Come here.

149
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,938
Jenna, what the hell?
You can't come in without knocking!

150
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,402
What happened to your face?

151
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,529
Did you get hurt?

152
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,699
Honey, I think I'm hurt too.
Will you take a look?

153
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,534
What?

154
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,162
-Baek Jenna, what--
-Shit!

155
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,956
I'm so pissed off.

156
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,170
What happened?

157
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,217
There's someone I need to find.

158
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,180
Wait and see.

159
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,726
I'll make school a living hell for you.

160
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,860
Welcome to
Cheongdam International High School.

161
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,948
I'll do my best until I graduate.

162
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,992
At what?

163
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,243
At anything.

164
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,287
I like your enthusiasm.

165
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,206
Here's the key to your locker.

166
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,044
If you have any questions,
ask the volunteer student over there.

167
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,296
Okay. I'll see you later.

168
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,422
Bye.

169
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,555
Bucket Girl. You…

170
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,731
This kind of coincidence has to be fate.

171
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,316
How so?

172
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,110
Who'd have thought Bucket Girl and I
would meet again like this?

173
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,447
Can you not call me that?

174
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,157
Why not? It's a nickname only we use.

175
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,202
If I'm Bucket Girl
then you're Pervert Boy.

176
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,163
Hey, I like that.

177
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,873
School was getting a bit boring.

178
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,000
That's just stupid.

179
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,879
First impressions are important
on the first day of transfer.

180
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,092
Anyway, I already looked
around the school,

181
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,885
so I don't need a guided tour.

182
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,137
How about we part ways here?

183
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,305
Goodbye.

184
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,517
Hey. You can't walk off like that.

185
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,102
What do you want?

186
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,479
I haven't yet given you a massive tip
on school life here.

187
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,606
I don't smoke,

188
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,775
so I don't need your tips.

189
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,694
You think I'll tell you
where to go to smoke?

190
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,197
Do you know how extreme
the hierarchical society is--

191
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,120
Let go.

192
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,205
Seo Do-eon?

193
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,166
She refused.

194
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,212
Why are you holding her, when she said no?

195
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,259
What does this have to do with you?

196
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,261
Do you know her?

197
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,728
Now you're the one holding her back.

198
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,940
Bucket Girl, you don't know him, right?

199
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,412
We can get to know each other from now on.

200
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,792
Do you think
you're her knight in shining armor

201
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,920
just because everyone bows to you,
the heir to the Cheongjae Foundation?

202
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,339
If you're in the Diamond Club,

203
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,259
act like it and hang out with your queen.

204
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:36,055
Bucket Girl is very different from you.

205
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,228
You can go on your own.

206
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,868
That makes me look like the bad guy.

207
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,957
The more we meet,
the more interesting you get.

208
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,459
Bucket Girl.

209
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,223
Sorry.

210
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,683
My grip was too tight, wasn't it?

211
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,437
It's fine.

212
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:34,947
So…

213
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,658
I'm Seo Do-eon, sophomore.

214
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,788
If you get into trouble at school,

215
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,791
call me whenever you want.

216
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,669
Oh…

217
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,255
If you don't mind…

218
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,432
I got it.

219
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,944
-I'll head off now.
-Okay.

220
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,244
Oh, I didn't tell him my name.

221
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,663
Seo Do-eon!

222
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:30,252
My name is Kim Hye-in.
It's spelled H-Y-E. Hye-in.

223
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,177
They're all expensive hobbies.

224
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:41,305
Are they all rich kids?

225
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,563
He has a girlfriend.

226
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,277
Sorry.

227
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,863
Watch where you're going.

228
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,489
Darn it.

229
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,411
What was that?

230
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,372
Why did that feel familiar?

231
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,572
Have they never seen a transfer before?

232
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,760
Why are these here?

233
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,381
What the hell?

234
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:43,302
Why are you just staring,
when I tripped and fell?

235
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,389
What the hell are you doing?

236
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,393
I think it's her.

237
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,937
You said she's a transfer student, right?

238
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,147
And she looks fierce.

239
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,898
And looks poor.

240
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:57,983
What?

241
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,944
Do you know how curious I was?

242
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,363
What on earth did you do

243
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,907
to anger the school queen so much?

244
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,409
Why couldn't she find you?

245
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,620
Does the President
have your back or something?

246
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,582
What stupid nonsense is that?

247
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,209
You.

248
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,629
You're a leech, aren't you?

249
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,715
What?

250
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,279
It's said that…

251
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,949
nice shoes take you to nice places.

252
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,411
But…

253
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,165
the shoes whose owner I didn't recognize…

254
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,710
There she is!

255
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,840
…brought me straight to hell.

256
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,279
Kim Hye-in?

257
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,740
Did you know this when you admitted me?

258
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:30,992
Know what?

259
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,829
That Equal Opportunity students
are treated like crap.

260
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,540
You acted all generous
with the scholarship and whatnot.

261
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,875
How will you take responsibility now?

262
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,130
"Take responsibility"?

263
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,216
Who do you think caused me to enroll here?

264
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,676
I'm your responsibility now.

265
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,518
Right.

266
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,895
The annual tuition is 100 million won,

267
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,858
and others want to
attend this school but can't.

268
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,652
Who do you think let you enroll?

269
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,282
Hello?

270
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,659
I want to make an offer.

271
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,081
To change…

272
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,834
your miserable life.

273
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,423
I checked with the police
and the evidence on scene

274
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,134
and circumstances
aren't against the school.

275
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,137
It looks like Kim Hye-in cooperated.

276
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,390
-That's what she said?
-Yes.

277
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:39,352
She stated that
she doesn't know the culprit.

278
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,981
Okay. You can go home now.

279
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,242
The choice is yours to make, Hye-in.

280
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,372
TEACHER'S SIGNATURE: SEO HEE-SU

281
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,505
If you want, I'll have you transferred
back to your old school.

282
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,217
Do you want to go back?

283
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,138
I'm not saying I'll leave.

284
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,516
Just do something
about this nonsensical state of--

285
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,851
Oh.

286
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,356
I let you enroll, gave you a scholarship,

287
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,485
and on top of that, you want me to
take responsibility for your social life?

288
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,283
You are a kid after all.

289
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,622
I'm responsible for one thing only.

290
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,166
Your coming in…

291
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,754
or your leaving.

292
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,675
The rest is entirely up to you.

293
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,843
The choice is yours.

294
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,765
CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE

295
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,643
Take the opportunity and forge ahead.

296
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:08,817
Or go back to your old life,
despite being given an opportunity.

297
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:43,101
It looks like the welcoming
I arranged for you went well.

298
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,187
You…

299
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,107
Now do you know who I am?

300
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,693
The psycho bitch from yesterday?

301
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,777
You're a student here?

302
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,154
Why you…

303
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,994
You still don't get why
the whole school's in an uproar, do you?

304
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,914
It can't be.

305
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,835
The whole school went crazy
on my first day here

306
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,171
because you instigated them?

307
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,589
Because of yesterday?

308
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,719
I instigated them?

309
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,763
Me?

310
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,057
For the likes of you?

311
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,352
Who do you think you are?

312
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,716
You got on my bad side, which means…

313
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,805
your life here is going to be hell.

314
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,531
WHO DO YOU THINK IS THE MOST
INFLUENTIAL TEEN IN KOREA?

315
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:29,833
Oh, her name's Baek Jenna?

316
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,669
I'm curious.

317
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:36,339
What do people like her lack in life?

318
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,889
I'm screwed.

319
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,604
You bitch.

320
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,780
Hey! Get her!

321
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,827
-Are you okay, Jenna?
-You okay?

322
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:17,482
