00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:39,939
Mi-Joo is kind of

192
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,493
I think I've become more feminine?

193
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Did you lose weight?

194
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,977
And Professor also

195
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:53,156
You've gotten cooler

196
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,595
oh, really?

197
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:57,981
Professor, perhaps

198
00:19:58,334 --> 00:19:59,615
Did you move?

199
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,812
The cafe that you taught me in
I've been there a few times...

200
00:20:06,053 --> 00:20:07,053
oppa

201
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,975
Jin-ah

202
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,780
Why are you standing there?
You're not sitting down?

203
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:14,719
Who this?

204
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,060
She looks so cute?

205
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:17,916
Ah.

206
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,802
This is a past
student who I was tutoring

207
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
tutoring?

208
00:20:22,546 --> 00:20:23,546
Say hello

Oh, ok

It was nice to meet you

213
00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:44,088
She's got double eyelids, right?

214
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:45,615
What's wrong with you

215
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:48,363
What should we eat?

216
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:49,409
What to eat?

217
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,456
What do you want to eat?

218
00:21:47,863 --> 00:21:50,523
You're nose

00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,060
I'm in a station right now

229
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,700
Someone crazy person is after me.
They're chasing after me with acid?

230
00:25:31,514 --> 00:25:33,968
They are holding acid,
and saying they're coming for you?

231
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,049
I hid in the bathroom

232
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:38,162
Please tell me the exact location

00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:40,269

00:25:40,692 --> 00:25:42,246

00:25:50,913 --> 00:25:52,754
wearing a hospital outfit

240
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Hello?

241
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,540
Hello?

242
00:26:00,273 --> 00:26:02,059
How did you know it was a woman?

243
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:11,773
That nose

244
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,215
It's so pretty

245
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:31,102
You're nose
You're so pretty

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,559
Uh, no

248
00:27:08,113 --> 00:27:09,113
It's not that

249
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:12,930
but that story

250
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:15,323
Where did you hear it?

251
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:26,249
Oh, my

252
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:28,923

253
00:27:36,326 --> 00:27:37,786

258

All right.

259
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,260
Right now, I'm

260
00:27:52,993 --> 00:27:54,816

261
00:27:59,653 --> 00:28:00,373
Did you see it?

262
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:02,421
Did you see it?
I think it's a poltergeist

263
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,065
Poltergeist, right
Poltergeist is right

264
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:06,860

269
00:28:15,006 --> 00:28:16,326

I'm going to play it for you

271
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:20,179
I'm warning you

272
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,724
If you have a weak heart

273
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:23,930
Right now, this place
You'd better get out

274
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:26,233
Horror Queen

275
00:28:26,684 --> 00:28:27,684
Da-kyung

276
00:28:38,726 --> 00:28:39,726
How is it?

277
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
Ms. Da-kyung

278
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
All right.

279
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,280
Horror Queen is back

280
00:28:46,573 --> 00:28:48,433
The story is fun, also
The development is fast

281
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:50,621
It's not bad?

282
00:28:53,414 --> 00:28:55,821
Thank you...
Thank you.

283
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:58,653
What?

284
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,140
What do we got here?

285
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,279
Did you just see it?

286
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,230
What?

287
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:18,769
What...

288
00:29:21,152 --> 00:29:22,152
What is that?

289
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,719
It's not?

290
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,060
This is a ghost, right?

291
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,361
This never happened in the past,
Its's never been filmed?

292
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,480
Do you want a drink

293
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,395
Oh, I...
I've stopped drinking

294
00:29:52,473 --> 00:29:54,473
You said you had a lot of views

295
00:29:54,823 --> 00:29:56,323
Let's celebrate

296
00:30:12,689 --> 00:30:14,189
Well, one more drink

297
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,624
What do you think the subway is?

298
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,999
Public transportation... Right?

299
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,119
Well in general, yes?

300
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:41,833
But to someone It's life also

301
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,080
In the beginning it wasn't bad

302
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,160
Like any office worker
It was normal

303
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:52,928
But little by little
I'm starting to lose what I had

304
00:30:53,666 --> 00:30:56,810
well-earned but
My job is gone

305
00:30:57,306 --> 00:30:58,806
And then family

306
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,330
Next, moderation

307
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,860
as such

308
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,095
falling and falling

309
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,200
until you have
nowhere to fall

310
00:31:09,006 --> 00:31:11,006
but To the cold floor

311
00:31:12,153 --> 00:31:13,153
Mister

312
00:31:14,153 --> 00:31:15,153
Mister

313
00:31:15,546 --> 00:31:16,546
Mister

314
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,736
Get up

315
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:19,623
Hurry up and get up

316
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,379
You can't sleep here

317
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,570
Oh My.

318
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:30,169
You see
People are passing by

319
00:31:31,076 --> 00:31:32,576
Please move that way

320
00:31:44,496 --> 00:31:45,996
Oh, Mister

321
00:31:46,303 --> 00:31:48,303
Don't touch it if you are buying it

322
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,362
It's always Mr. Lee.

323
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,856
here.

324
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:57,435
Oh, this is not it

325
00:31:58,255 --> 00:31:59,880
I'm asking for redon French black.

326
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
What do we got here?

327
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:01,681
Did you move to this place?

328
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:03,481
Why are you scared?

329
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:05,167
Oh, what's in your pocket

330
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:06,899
Take it out

331
00:33:07,406 --> 00:33:09,267
Eon-nung, Lee, shi, T

332
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:24,233
Is this it?

333
00:33:36,503 --> 00:33:38,003
Let's say hi more often

334
00:33:41,057 --> 00:33:42,257
affectionately

335
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:01,076
that fucking bastard

336
00:34:01,989 --> 00:34:04,782
That's right
I'm gonna kill you, son of a bitch

337
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,953
Hey, you son of bitch

338
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:17,338

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:23,099
Fucker

00:34:26,758 --> 00:34:28,565
Fuck that fucking asshole.

341
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,880

342
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:34,163
ahh, shi...

343
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,330
Mr. Kim?

344
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,770
Mr. Kim is that you?

345
00:38:48,423 --> 00:38:51,547
what's with that outfit? Huh?

346
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,857
It's very, very, very...

347
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,885
What are you doing

348
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,406
If there's anything good,
We have to share with each other.

349
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:13,330
How can you be so mean,
When I look like this

350
00:39:18,048 --> 00:39:19,048
Oh, this is

351
00:39:23,189 --> 00:39:24,409
What's wrong with me?

352
00:39:26,461 --> 00:39:27,961
You, shi...

353
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:33,487

Help me, please.

355
00:39:42,503 --> 00:39:43,822
Help me, please.

356
00:41:10,623 --> 00:41:11,623
Excuse me

357
00:41:14,043 --> 00:41:16,043
It's 4,400 won

358
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,980

00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,410

Help me!

363
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,061
Since then

364
00:43:27,494 --> 00:43:30,461
there are clothes that don't have owners
that are often found in the station

365
00:43:39,899 --> 00:43:40,899
So...

366
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,320
if you liked it

367
00:43:44,986 --> 00:43:47,126
Is that what you wanted?

368
00:43:49,972 --> 00:43:52,132
Yeah, I'm going to use it all

369
00:43:54,193 --> 00:43:56,475
Those who ignore me

370
00:43:58,516 --> 00:44:01,000
I won't let you go

371
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:49,499
Congratulations

372
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:52,273

00:44:57,759 --> 00:44:58,759

I was just going to congratulate you,
I also wanted to see you

377
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:10,459
To be honest

566
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,400
Oh, Doctor.

567
01:00:21,778 --> 01:00:23,778
This isn't some kind of bacterial infection, is it?

568
01:00:23,967 --> 01:00:25,687
First, I'll prescribe
you some medicine.

569
01:00:25,926 --> 01:00:28,266
and
let's see how things go, okay?

570
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,791
Oh, no, it's dirty.

571
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,928
And, this here.

572
01:00:32,193 --> 01:00:33,528
Could you please sign this?

573
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:38,254
Ouch. Of course.

574
01:00:38,819 --> 01:00:41,277
Doctor,
how did you find out?

575
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:42,780
Huh?

576
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,900
I'm somewhat famous, you know.

577
01:00:46,073 --> 01:00:47,935
I'm the industry's No. 1 beauty YouTuber.

578
01:00:48,342 --> 01:00:49,342
That's not it...

579
01:00:49,568 --> 01:00:52,023
Please sign this consent form.

580
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:53,860
Sign the consent here

581
01:01:14,193 --> 01:01:15,993
Oh, this is embarrassing.

582
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:38,079
Huh? Da-kyung

583
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:40,190
What you doing here?

584
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:43,850
The story...

585
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:45,356
Oh, right.

586
01:01:45,776 --> 01:01:47,196
That dull story?

587
01:01:49,466 --> 01:01:50,466
But

588
01:01:53,707 --> 01:01:54,907
Da-kyung, surely you not

589
01:01:56,059 --> 01:01:56,996
lying about the story

590
01:01:57,021 --> 01:01:58,443
You're not here to spy on me, are you?

591
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:00,080
What?

592
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:02,191
Oh, just kidding.

593
01:02:02,926 --> 01:02:05,026
Well, I hope it goes well.

594
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,040
That way, Da-kyung
will be able to sign a good contract.

595
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:09,680
Yes.

596
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,260
Is there anything else you'd like to say?

597
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:17,340
No

598
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,900
Not really

599
01:02:25,899 --> 01:02:26,899
blood

600
01:03:35,585 --> 01:03:36,585

01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,340

602
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:44,732
Million, million, million
Million, million, million

603
01:03:44,757 --> 01:03:47,321
A million, a million, a million
A million, a million, a million

01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:51,180
Thank you

Thank you~

606
01:03:54,868 --> 01:03:56,096
That's awesome!

607
01:03:56,398 --> 01:03:56,998
Applause!

608
01:03:58,386 --> 01:03:59,431
A million Let's go~

609
01:04:02,753 --> 01:04:04,051
Let's go~

610
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:52,570
I'm Rina

611
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,050
#1 Beauty YouTuber

612
01:04:56,996 --> 01:04:58,496
I'm Rina from Rina World

613
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,264
This station is...

614
01:05:01,289 --> 01:05:03,713
Gwanglim, This is Gwanglim Station.

615
01:05:04,062 --> 01:05:06,163
The exit door is on the right.

616
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,460
Excuse me.

617
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,310
By any chance,

618
01:06:10,335 --> 01:06:11,835
Are you Rina?

619
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:14,460
Can I help you?

620
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:19,991
It's okay, it's okay.

621
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:22,480
Are you sure you're okay?

622
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,324
Oh, please get out!

623
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:18,730
It's Gwanglim Bridge.

624
01:07:19,156 --> 01:07:20,196
Have you heard of it?

625
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:22,090
I heard everything.

626
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:24,623
This subway station

627
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,426
was originally the Gwanglim Church's chapel.

628
01:07:27,929 --> 01:07:30,629
Because of that,
strange things keep happening here.

629
01:07:36,838 --> 01:07:39,992
There's even a record of them committing suicide together
to ensure the leader's immortality.

630
01:07:43,389 --> 01:07:44,338
Also

631
01:07:44,363 --> 01:07:46,464
Some people believe

632
01:07:47,483 --> 01:07:49,983
the cult leader is alive Somewhere right now.

633
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,932
Is that really possible?

634
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:00,504
What if such a thing really exists?

635
01:08:01,927 --> 01:08:03,007
I want to report on it.

636
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,880
That group called Gwanglimgyo.

637
01:08:06,226 --> 01:08:07,944
Would you like to meet them in person?

638
01:08:14,161 --> 01:08:15,957
didn't answer the phone.

639
01:08:16,045 --> 01:08:19,198
After the beep,
please leave a voicemail.

640
01:08:26,013 --> 01:08:27,013
It's time.

641
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,220
I'd rather not eat with someone like you.

642
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,998
I think it's better to keep it professional.

643
01:08:34,966 --> 01:08:35,966
Woo-jin

644
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:38,829
Are you looking for Da-kyung?

645
01:08:42,499 --> 01:08:43,919
Who are you?

646
01:08:44,733 --> 01:08:47,518
Hi, I'm from Mapo Police Station,
I'm Detective Park Joo-oh

647
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:49,400
Do you know where she is?

648
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:52,273
Oh, if you don't mind,
what's going on?

649
01:08:52,786 --> 01:08:55,030
I just watched her YouTube video.

650
01:09:30,473 --> 01:09:31,473
Friday

651
01:09:33,106 --> 01:09:34,703
3:34 PM

652
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,311
There be a train coming in.

653
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,882
If you get on that train

654
01:09:41,072 --> 01:09:43,072
You'll be able to meet him.

655
01:11:10,253 --> 01:11:13,133
The train for...is now arriving.

656
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:16,660
The train for...is approaching.

657
01:11:17,879 --> 01:11:19,229
Passengers,

658
01:11:19,254 --> 01:11:21,425
After everyone has disembarked

659
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:23,723
Please board safely.

660
01:11:28,254 --> 01:11:29,425
[PD Woo-Jin]

661
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:41,492
The train is now arriving.

662
01:11:42,313 --> 01:11:44,313
The platform safety door will open.

663
01:11:50,989 --> 01:11:53,449
Our train
will depart shortly.

664
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:37,263
The station chief

665
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:39,313
is Someone else?

666
01:16:39,808 --> 01:16:43,358
but in the video, she clearly says
that she interviewed the station chief.

667
01:16:43,757 --> 01:16:45,320
Well, the recording
was also uploaded.

668
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:47,614
But the person in charge there

669
01:16:47,698 --> 01:16:48,917
is a different person.

670
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:52,010
Then

671
01:16:52,158 --> 01:16:54,384
The person Da-kyung interviewed is

672
01:16:57,065 --> 01:16:58,065
three years ago

673
01:16:58,563 --> 01:17:00,563
He's went missing.

674
01:17:21,156 --> 01:17:22,156
Hello?

675
01:17:25,636 --> 01:17:26,636
Hello?

676
01:17:28,576 --> 01:17:31,017
I knew it the moment I saw you.

677
01:17:31,716 --> 01:17:34,656
You're desire would lead you here.

678
01:17:36,169 --> 01:17:39,209
You were always curious about the story,

679
01:17:39,782 --> 01:17:42,259
But you never really wondered about me.

680
01:17:43,429 --> 01:17:44,449
Who am I?

681
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:48,190
And why am I telling you this?

682
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:53,390
The last story I'll tell you is

683
01:17:54,763 --> 01:17:56,063
It's my story.

684
01:18:01,267 --> 01:18:03,107
What are you looking at?

685
01:18:03,973 --> 01:18:05,153
Hey, over there

686
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:08,086
I thought I saw someone there just now?

687
01:18:08,713 --> 01:18:09,713
Is it this time?

688
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,456
There's definitely someone there

689
01:18:12,765 --> 01:18:14,049
Someone got in there.

690
01:18:22,273 --> 01:18:24,279
Oh, no, I don't want to.

691
01:18:24,335 --> 01:18:25,702
I have to go to that office. Sir.

692
01:18:25,727 --> 01:18:26,295
Sir, shi...

693
01:18:26,801 --> 01:18:28,330
Stop feeding the cat.

694
01:18:28,615 --> 01:18:30,300
is it a pig or a cat, you idiot?

695
01:18:30,381 --> 01:18:31,606
It's Ming ming.

696
01:18:31,699 --> 01:18:32,686
A pig?

697
01:18:32,973 --> 01:18:34,752
Stop talking nonsense.

698
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:36,755
You're already here.

699
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,469
If someone gets in,
what are you going to do?

700
01:18:38,715 --> 01:18:39,215
Huh?

701
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,016
Hey, last time you were talking
this and that about that cult

702
01:18:42,041 --> 01:18:43,323
you're going to film that YouTube video

703
01:18:43,348 --> 01:18:44,778
Because of all that

704
01:18:46,313 --> 01:18:48,539
You know how embarrassed I was

705
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,258
I was there too

706
01:18:52,233 --> 01:18:53,233
So...

707
01:18:54,598 --> 01:18:55,849
You're going this time too.

708
01:18:56,766 --> 01:18:58,016
Oh, it's always just me...

709
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,218
Is there anyone on the subway at this hour?

710
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:03,845
Oh, o h my...

711
01:19:15,923 --> 01:19:16,923
Excuse me.

712
01:19:18,530 --> 01:19:19,530
Is anyone there?

713
01:19:21,794 --> 01:19:22,794
No.

714
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,160
Hey, Jae-gul did you find anyone?

715
01:20:14,913 --> 01:20:16,413
No one is there.

716
01:20:17,922 --> 01:20:19,935
Hey, go deeper and look.

717
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:21,735
I clearly saw it.

718
01:20:22,645 --> 01:20:23,645
Yes.

719
01:20:38,318 --> 01:20:39,628
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

720
01:20:39,653 --> 01:20:40,477

Come back the way you came

722
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:48,800
Hello

723
01:20:51,678 --> 01:20:52,678
Hey, Jae-gul

724
01:20:54,307 --> 01:20:55,307
More...

725
01:20:55,993 --> 01:20:56,993
It's hot

726
01:21:00,596 --> 01:21:01,336
Hello

727
01:21:02,571 --> 01:21:03,571
Hey, Jae-gul

728
01:21:18,131 --> 01:21:19,631
Oh, why is it so hot in here?

729
01:21:22,463 --> 01:21:23,963
Hey, Jae-gul!

730
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:27,783
Hey, Jae-gul!

731
01:22:17,836 --> 01:22:18,836
Is that you Jae-gul?

732
01:24:45,917 --> 01:24:46,917
What is this?

733
01:25:12,611 --> 01:25:13,611
Oh, it's hot.

734
01:25:18,817 --> 01:25:19,817
Oh, it's hot.

735
01:25:20,297 --> 01:25:21,297
Oh, it's hot.

736
01:25:59,783 --> 01:26:00,783
Oh, hot.

737
01:26:03,786 --> 01:26:04,786
Ah, shit.

738
01:27:17,009 --> 01:27:18,009
Station chef

739
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:23,110
Station chef

740
01:27:25,966 --> 01:27:26,966
Hello.

741
01:27:27,573 --> 01:27:28,573
Is this Jae-gul?

742
01:27:29,312 --> 01:27:29,912
I

743
01:27:30,374 --> 01:27:31,274
It's the station.

744
01:27:31,299 --> 01:27:32,314
Hey, call me.

745
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:33,620
I'm here.

746
01:27:34,361 --> 01:27:35,993
I'm stuck on the subway.

747
01:27:36,472 --> 01:27:37,592
Where are you now?

748
01:27:39,234 --> 01:27:39,734
20...

749
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:40,888
I see...

750
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,938
Hey, Jae-gul,
Where are you now?

751
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,120
I'm going...

752
01:27:46,942 --> 01:27:47,542
I can see it.

753
01:27:48,134 --> 01:27:48,987
I'll be there soon...

754
01:27:49,012 --> 01:27:49,979
Station chef

755
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:53,343
Can see me?

756
01:29:04,643 --> 01:29:05,643
Open the door

757
01:29:30,721 --> 01:29:31,721
You've probably heard that

758
01:29:32,886 --> 01:29:36,201
This place originally was
the Gwanglim Church worship hall.

759
01:29:38,733 --> 01:29:40,902
I can help you meet him.

760
01:29:54,004 --> 01:29:55,391
Please open the door.

761
01:29:56,530 --> 01:29:57,909
Please open the door.

762
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:14,610
The times I spent with you
were quite enjoyable.

763
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:17,703
However you

764
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:20,310
I'm going to miss.

765
01:30:26,246 --> 01:30:26,846
Open the door...

766
01:30:27,411 --> 01:30:28,458
Open the door...

767
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:29,834
Open it!

768
01:30:30,193 --> 01:30:30,933
Open!

769
01:30:31,892 --> 01:30:32,892
Mister

770
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:30,109
The train to Singeol-dong
has just left.

771
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:03,149
Da-kyung

772
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:06,606
Ah, Da-kyung

773
01:32:06,631 --> 01:32:08,495
Why aren't you answering my phone?
I was worried...

774
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:31,460
Woo-jin

775
01:32:31,634 --> 01:32:34,604
Shall I tell you an interesting story?
