1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,560
Because This Is My First Life

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,470
Lee Min Ki

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,080
Jeong So Min

4
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,510
Lee Som
Park Byeong Eun

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,060
Kim Ga Eun
Kim Min Seok

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,430
Because This Is My First Life

7
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,450
Stop. Yoon Ji Ho.

8
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,630
You can't

9
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,820
stop crying?

10
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,190
Then...

11
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,160
Let's go together.

12
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,440
It's alright if you cry.

13
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,460
Come with me.

14
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,150
I'll stay by your side.

15
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,390
I will be with you.

16
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:48,030
1988 the whole world is looking at South Korea.

17
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,340
1988 on the day that the World Festival was going to start

18
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,040
I was in Mom's belly preparing to be born.

19
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:05,170
That way, I became an 88er whom the world was watching over.

20
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,010
Born during the heyday of South Korea,

21
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,510
it was a given that our family had a car.

22
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,470
I spent my early childhood in this high growth and abundance.

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,670
In the midst of all that, I also changed my identity

24
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,080
from a guk-min elementary student (older term) to a cho-deung elementary student (newer term).

25
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,640
Of course, trials came.

26
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,480
However there was hope.

27
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,530
If someone works hard, then they can stand again.

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,060
I believed that one's earnest dreams could come true.

29
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,380
However that belief did not last long.

30
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,090
Then somehow the dreams came to have ranks.

31
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,880
We were not 88ers,

32
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,200
but became the 880,000 won (US $880) generation.

33
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,260
The vote of the 20's had no strength.

34
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,150
The world was no longer

35
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,210
paying attention to South Korea.

36
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:15,250
In the infinite war, the friends that bet their necks for specs,

37
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,490
among them I was a snail who dreamed.

38
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,920
Even if I were slow, if I worked hard

39
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,830
my dreams would come true.

40
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,380
I persistently believed in that.

41
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,970
If I were to tell the 20-year-old me,

42
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,920
would that punk believe me?

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,160
Bride and groom, enter.

44
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,970
Let's go.

45
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:03,290
The 88er, Yoon Ji Ho who is now 30, instead of becoming a writer,

46
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:30,700
I held the hand of the man who gave me a discount on rent.

47
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,550
I really

48
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,890
got married...

49
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,450
because of a house.

50
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,010
I'm taking the picture.

51
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,070
One, two.

52
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,450
It's done.

53
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,080
Aigoo. You have worked hard. You worked hard.

54
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,090
You worked hard.

55
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,590
Hey, stop crying.

56
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,040
If someone saw, they would think you had a story with the groom.

57
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,680
And what about you? You're like a part-timer as a guest.

58
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,520
How could you not shed a single tear?

59
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,950
Coldhearted.

60
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,240
We will be taking a photo with the groom and bride's friends.

61
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,890
Hey, let's go for the picture.

62
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,040
- Heol!
- Why?

63
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,200
Hey, let's hurry.

64
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,500
Hey, we jet off as soon as she takes the photo. Got it?

65
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,240
Are all your friends here?

66
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,740
Yes.

67
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,250
Se Hee-nim too?
- Yes.

68
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,610
CEO and the one wearing the shoes with heels move to the bride's side.

69
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,060
- Me?
- Yes, you two.

70
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,890
- No!
- No!

71
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,110
This side is cramped.

72
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,920
These are not heels. She keeps calling them heels.

73
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,760
I ask for your cooperation for a smooth progression of events.

74
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,520
CEO, Heels. Hurry and move to the bride's side.

75
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,080
Now let's balance it out.

76
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,730
Here.

77
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,630
Now, okay.

78
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,120
Excuse me. Heels and the tall girl, switch places.

79
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,210
I'm taking it. One, two.

80
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,090
Hey, your girlfriend.

81
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,730
Hyung.

82
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,200
Pretend you don't know when you meet my girlfriend since we haven't made up yet.

83
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:08,040
Okay, okay. But then, the tall girl beside your girlfriend, do you know her, too?

84
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,120
She's best friends with Rang, so we are close.

85
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:17,040
No. Then that 88er, that small brat blocked someone older.

86
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,390
Hyung. We're just going to eat quietly and go. Don't pretend you know her. Seriously, okay?

87
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,610
Why would I pretend to know her? I'm the shy type.

88
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,170
Aigoo.

89
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,920
No one's sitting here, right?

90
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,770
There is someone.

91
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,760
There isn't.

92
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,000
Is that so? Then if you don't mind.

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,080
Hyung, wait!

94
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,290
Is it tasty?

95
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,980
Do you want to try?

96
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,250
It's tasty.

97
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,610
Hello.

98
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,820
We're meeting for the first time, right? After just hearing stories of each other.

99
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,740
Yes, hello. I've also heard a lot about you.

100
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,080
This is my friend Woo—

101
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,320
Soo Ji.

102
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,740
- What? You know her?
- I don't.

103
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,170
Then how did you know?

104
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,330
No, it's just that she looks like a Soo Ji.

105
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,820
Clean, stuck up, and someone who would block someone else's text and all.

106
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,080
"Blocking Soo Ji." It's written on her face.

107
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
- What?
- What?

108
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,380
We met through work once.

109
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,320
How are you, CEO Ma?

110
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,970
Aigoo, thanks to you, I am doing fine.

111
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,670
Maybe it's because of the change between seasons, but I got a bad cold,

112
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,430
I got blocked, and my mental state is shaken, too.

113
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,670
But still, I am happy and such.

114
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,080
Soo Ji blocked.

115
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,610
It's Ji Ho!

116
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,180
You look good together!

117
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,270
Who knew our Ji Ho would be the first one to get married.

118
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,980
I know. It seems just like yesterday when she vomited after drinking in our rooftop room.

119
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,110
So the pigeons gathered up the next morning.

120
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,430
I had such a hard time.

121
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,320
And you pretended to be an eagle to try to chase them away.

122
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,580
Hey, that wasn't an eagle. I was a falcon.

123
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,640
But what has he been eating that he has a smudge on his lips?

124
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,700
That... It looks like pepper paste.

125
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,890
That's true, why is he going around smudged like that?

126
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,050
But then, why is pepper paste continuously dripping down his nose?

127
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,240
I know.

128
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,140
That pepper paste.

129
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,650
You must have really been tired.

130
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,990
I think it's because my level of activity these past days has suddenly increased.

131
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,480
Must be.

132
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,850
So much that you had a nosebleed.

133
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,290
I thought bleeding from both nostrils only happened when you got beaten by someone.

134
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,900
It was as chaotic as if I had been beaten by someone.

135
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,510
A wedding is not any less stressful than projects I have developed.

136
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:21,730
It's all over now, so just hang in there a little bit more.

137
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,150
Yes.

138
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,840
I want to hurry and rest in our house.

139
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,850
What? Did I say something wrong?

140
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,400
N-No. I need to rinse this.

141
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,460
I want to hurry and rest in our house.

142
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,090
Our house.

143
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,190
It's because your body is at a low.

144
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,440
In times like this you need to put something in your mouth. Hurry and drink this.

145
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,490
Yes.

146
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,220
You need to take this with that.

147
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,650
Why are you so skinny?

148
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,250
What do you like? Do you eat snake soup?

149
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,690
Snake soup. I haven't tried it.

150
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,670
Right? People from Seoul don't usually eat things like that.

151
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,820
Then, what should I feed you?

152
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:04,810
That... Ji Ho is a strong person.

153
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,250
- Pardon?
- I may not know much about her yet, but

154
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,910
when she decided to write, and when she decided to stop writing,

155
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,420
and also marriage.

156
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,640
She decided it for herself.

157
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,770
Because even though she looks weak and shy, she is strong.

158
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,660
She's someone with a well-designed brain.

159
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,090
She would not make herself go through something that would make her miserable.

160
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,800
So, Ji Ho, as always,

161
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,130
will choose the path toward her happiness.

162
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,100
And I, for as long as we are married, that decision,

163
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,960
I will not hinder it.

164
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,320
The only thing I can promise is that.

165
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,090
For what?

167
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:26,140
Because it's not "I will make her happy," "I will protect her."

168
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:32,030
The promise I can give is only this.

169
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,140
What about that? It's right though.

170
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,880
Just because you are a couple, you are not in charge of each other's happiness.

171
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,650
How could you make another person happy?

172
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,650
When it's an era where making one's self happy is hard enough.

173
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,080
Not being a hindrance to the other is the best.

174
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,450
I like that a whole lot better than when you said you won't be having her touch water (not have her do housework).

175
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,310
I will make you snake soup later on.

176
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,120
Try it once.

177
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,650
Ahh. Snake soup?

178
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,490
It's delicious.

179
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,900
We are people who rose up from those hard times, In-law.

180
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,590
Yes, yes, that's right.

181
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,140
Because your son is born in such a good generation,

182
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,430
they say it's hard and all.

183
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,120
Let's go now. Everyone is tired.

184
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,430
- That's right, Dad. Let's go.
- Okay.

185
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,680
Even though she's a lacking daughter,

186
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,410
please take care of her.

187
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,750
- Yes. Yes.
- Don't worry.

188
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,220
Please take care of her.

189
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,940
Go home safely.

190
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,000
Unni! I'll be going.

191
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,550
Okay. I'm sorry, you're pregnant and all.

192
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,690
It's okay.

193
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:06,020
But then Unni, Brother-in-law is SH.

194
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,680
Huh?

195
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,500
He's super handsome.

196
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,540
Then let's get going too.

197
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,150
Yes.

198
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,690
He's super handsome.

199
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,760
What's wrong?

200
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,130
Ah. I thought my nose might be bleeding again.

201
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,560
You have been sneaking glances at my face.

202
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,620
Is there something on my face?

203
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,840
No. That...

204
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,830
Mosquito... I think there is one.

205
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,380
In this weather?

206
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:18,010
I know. It survives through anything.

207
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,960
That...

208
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,960
Thank you.

209
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,290
I heard from outside.

210
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,760
To my mom, for saying those things to her,

211
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,520
thank you.

212
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:45,710
I think she made you worry for no reason.

213
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:49,250
I should have settled it beforehand.

214
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,470
That. It does not only concern you.

215
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,920
If the other end feels unsettled,

216
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,270
then I thought I should be the one to explain it as the landlord.

217
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:09,520
And to put it bluntly, it's not concerning you only, it's our concern.

218
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,410
Our concern?

219
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,570
Yes, it's "our" concern since it's a shared matter.

220
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,800
- Episode 6 -
Because It's Our First

221
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,970
- Auntie, are there any open seats here?
- Nope, no seats.

222
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,950
Is that so?

223
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,640
Hey! You knew about it, right?

224
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,380
That this place is a famous one? Of course.

225
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,490
Ms. Ho Rang. Wow!

226
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,930
Oh!

227
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,590
How could we surprisingly meet by coincidence here?

228
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,950
Oh my! I know. Isn't Seoul so small?

229
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,710
I know. Well, since the land is small let's just sit together.

230
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,730
No, it's okay.

231
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,620
Aigoo! I'm so busy. Why are you blocking the way?

232
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,480
- I'm sorry.
- Hurry and go in!

233
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,430
Let's go in. Why are you bothering her?

234
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,730
That's right. She says she's busy.

235
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,270
- Here, cheers!
- Cheers!

236
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,700
Wow, one shot. Fighting!

237
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,940
Ms. Ho Rang, you are good at drinking somaek (soju+beer). Based on your looks, it looks like you only drink morning dew.

238
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,890
I originally can't, but these days I drink well. I broke up with my boyfriend.

239
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,730
Is that so? So you broke up with your boyfriend. What do we do?

240
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,160
I should register on your app.

241
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,400
Well, if it's someone with your looks who would sign up to use our app, it would be an honor.

242
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,460
What style of man do you want?

243
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,960
I'm not picky with anything. He just needs to not be an engineering graduate.

244
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,320
Aha! Engineering... He's...

245
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,420
Something bad must have happened with someone who's an engineer.

246
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,270
What did the engineering guy do so wrong?

247
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,580
Please ask her that so we can listen.

248
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,570
You heard it, right?

249
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:51,250
What's the use of saying when we already broke up. Please tell him that.

250
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,770
No, you two. Why are you doing this to me?

251
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,800
Hey. Stop it.

252
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,800
I hope in the next life he learns the language of humans. Please tell him that, too,

253
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,330
because I think there's no hope for him in this life.

254
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,900
Yang Ho Rang! Seriously!

255
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,930
Seriously what!

256
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,290
I tried to understand you, but you were too much this time, you know?

257
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,110
What were you trying to understand?

258
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,160
How are you going to understand me?

259
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,730
Hey, don't put on that twisted smile. That's what I hate the most.

260
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,300
Do you know even just a bit about the reason why I was mad!

261
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,470
I also know the real reason!

262
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,380
I also know. I also know why you were so mad.

263
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,230
Now, now. Calm down.

264
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,920
Honestly, Won Seok was in such distress knowing that.

265
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,180
The real reason why you got mad.

266
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,010
It was because he bought the sofa that was on display.

267
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,890
Pardon?

268
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,810
That because that was a sofa on display, dirt would be stuck on it.

269
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,610
He wiped it so hard that

270
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,390
he has muscles here already.

271
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,830
CEO Ma, that mouth, please.

272
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,290
So he can save those few delivery dollars, he dragged that up all the way from the station.

273
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,530
- With all his body devoted to it.
- Can you close your mouth now?

274
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,020
Ms. Ho Rang.

275
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,390
Won Seok really tried his best.

276
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,000
In the end,

277
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,950
this is the reasoning you came up with?

278
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:34,730
That I'm mad because you got me the couch that was on display?

279
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,790
What?

280
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:44,980
I... I guess that's the level of girl you saw me as.

281
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,380
Even though we've been dating for 7 years.

282
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,600
- No. Ho Rang. Ho Rang.
- Ho Rang.

283
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,890
What happened, Hyung? Get up.

284
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,710
Ho Rang! Ho Rang!

285
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,910
Ho Rang! Ho Rang!

286
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,290
Hey, Yang Ho Rang, seriously!

287
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,700
It wasn't that either? Then what was it?

288
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,350
You...

289
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,340
Did you see me receiving Ji Ho's bouquet today?

290
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,510
Yes, I saw it earlier. I even saw how you almost fell just to catch that.

291
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:35,360
Rang, don't beat around the bush and just tell me why you are mad. Okay?

292
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,140
Do you know that if you catch the bouquet,

293
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,300
you will get married in six months?

294
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,510
Why are you talking about that all of a sudden?

295
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,690
Stop beating around the bush. Let's just talk this through, okay?

296
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,160
If you catch the bouquet

297
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,930
and you don't get married in six months,

298
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,380
then you won't be able to for the next three years.

299
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,320
Why do you keep saying useless stuff, crazy head? Rang.

300
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,040
That's not important right now.

301
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,840
Oh my gosh!

302
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,860
Aish! Yang Ho Rang, are you seriously crazy?! What's wrong with you?!

303
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,590
Marriage!!!

304
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,510
I'm saying that I want to get married, you idiot!

305
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,520
Marriage...

306
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,090
I, seriously! It switched from full-on combat to a melodrama in the blink of a second. Marriage!

307
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:55,040
Oh, Ho Rang! That wasn't just some story reversal but to the level of genre wreckage!

308
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,220
You must not have dated a lot, right?

309
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,280
What? Dating?

310
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,080
Ah, seriously. I'm speechless.

311
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,690
Do you know why my name is Ma Sang Goo, Deputy Woo?

312
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,230
Since I was 18, I've never had a dating jinx.

313
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,800
"Ma" Sang Goo.
(Ma - 'jinx' in Korean. Play on words.)

314
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,850
I mean, besides texting back and forth. Real dating.

315
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,150
When you're not clear if she's your family or your friend, or if she's you or you are her, and you feel pinched and muddled.

316
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:29,350
You've never spent over a year like that with someone, right? Like those two earlier?

317
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:33,820
I've often seen the case of is this your leg or is it my leg.

318
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:39,100
No, then have you dated those types of guys before?

319
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:41,300
The "real dating"?

320
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,260
I don't do stuff like that because it's stressful.

321
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:50,130
I don't date men. I only create memories with them.

322
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,620
I'm going to catch a taxi this way. What about you?

323
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,900
What is wrong with him? Seriously.

324
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,600
Hello.

325
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,320
What are you doing?

326
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,440
Your daughter. She was crying in there, so I rescued her.

327
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,450
- What the heck?
- What do you mean what? She's your exact replica.

328
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:43,020
- No need. Take it back.
- Keep it. Keep it.

329
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,810
You said you only make memories with guys.

330
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,020
This is today's memory, so take it. Okay?

331
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:57,270
And also, from human to human, could you stop cutting me out?

332
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,120
I won't send you spamming texts anymore.

333
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,820
Okay?! Okay, leave.

334
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:23,490
Looks like me? Yeah right!

335
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:37,230
Ji Ho and the youngest girl at my work got married too.

336
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,690
Ji Ho married too, and the youngest girl at your work married too.

337
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,830
I got it. I got it. Stop crying and just sleep.

338
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:49,640
If you continue to cry, your head will hurt.

339
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,210
I got it. Let's sleep.

340
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,500
I got it. I got it.

341
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,860
Stop crying.

342
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,220
Don't cry.

343
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,230
- You're awake?
- Yeah.

344
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,910
You made a good breakfast.

345
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:51,060
Yes, I'm a type of person who has to have breakfast.

346
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,830
Also, since this is our first day after the wedding.

347
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,480
Yes.

348
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,690
Then, enjoy the food.

349
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,350
You should at least eat the food and then leave.

350
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,530
Ah. I'm alright.

351
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,360
Still...

352
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,450
It's the first official day after the end of the project.

353
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,280
I did make a lot too so we could eat together.

354
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,420
Then, I'll eat just a bit.

355
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,260
Ah, okay!

356
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,990
♫ What I need to do ♫

357
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,130
I'll enjoy the food.

358
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:52,920
♫ I don't want to spend my emotion  ♫

359
00:28:52,920 --> 00:29:01,360
♫ Love to someone like me is an useless emotion ♫

360
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:06,290
♫ Though I tell myself that ♫

361
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,770
♫ When you are in front of me ♫

362
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,260
♫ Walking by  ♫

363
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,240
It's delicious.

364
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,530
Yes.

365
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,130
I know. I'm good at cooking.

366
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,500
Yes. You really are.

367
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,430
It's a good thing to be skilled in.

368
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,640
♫ Then I want to hold your hand  ♫

369
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,000
Besides ramen, this is our first time

370
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,760
eating together like this.

371
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,490
You're right.

372
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,530
What did you do yesterday?

373
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,050
Yesterday?

374
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,160
I went home and washed up and went to bed after watching some soccer.

375
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,120
Soccer? The two of you together?

376
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,890
No, we were tired yesterday, so we each watched on our phones in our own rooms.

377
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:06,160
Your own rooms? You guys sleep in different rooms?

378
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:11,530
I mean, our own phones. We watched on our own phones, I mean.

379
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,530
Hey, try this. It's so good.

380
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:17,810
It's alright, you should be eating it, as a newlywed. You'll need the energy.

381
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,400
When is he the sexiest?

382
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,680
You're newlyweds. They say you get in the mood suddenly without warning in the newlywed phase.

383
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,130
I don't. There's nothing like that.

384
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:31,820
Ji Ho. Are you guys sexless, by chance?

385
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,490
No, not like that either.

386
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,670
Not like that either? Then why are you so stingy about telling it?

387
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,730
I fessed up to you about all the men I've met all these years.

388
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:44,860
But you won't tell me a thing about your husband.

389
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,360
When he says "our."

390
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,660
I like it when he uses the word our.

391
00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:01,410
When he says things like, our house and our work,

392
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,460
I feel really nice.

393
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,900
So you mean when he says our you get all excited?

394
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,530
That's your fetish?

395
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,070
It's not like that.

396
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,330
What's Ji Ho's fetish?

397
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,000
- It's not a fetish but—
- She gets all excited when he says we.

398
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,640
Indeed, for a writer, even their fetish is literary too.

399
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,690
- We?
- We!

400
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,380
But Ji Ho, where are you headed to be out here on the first day after being married?

401
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,020
I'm going to find a part-time job.

402
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,690
What? A part-time job? Why?

403
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,410
Huh?

404
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,600
Oh. I should work to pay for re—

405
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,390
I mean to pay for living costs and cellphone costs, too.

406
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:46,500
Hey! Isn't Brother-in-law too much?

407
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,250
What, why?

408
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,140
I mean, how can he let her go work part-time when they're married?

409
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,110
Hey, these days, you can't live together on one income.

410
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,130
You're not going to work after you're married then?

411
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,230
I will. Housework.

412
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:03,030
I'll have kids and serve my husband's parents, too.

413
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,890
Hey, you know that stuff needs to be done with a pro mindset, too.

414
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:09,060
What did Won Seok say?

415
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,580
Did he respond to your out-of-this-world proposal?

416
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,630
What response? Is he in a position to respond

417
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,800
when he made a girl bring up marriage first?

418
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,390
I woke up and he was already out and gone. I guess he knew he was in the wrong too.

419
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:28,010
Ho Rang. Are you sure Won Seok is even thinking of marrying you?

420
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:28,820
What?

421
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,460
I mean, have you ever talked about it seriously?

422
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,790
About the two of you getting married.

423
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,390
Talk about what?

424
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:39,210
Woo Soo Ji. We've dated for seven years!

425
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:42,220
So if he isn't even thinking about marriage, is he even human?

426
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,090
He'd be trash.

427
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,060
You should just get married.

428
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,500
Even a personality like that gets married, so why couldn't you?

429
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,870
But he's got a job, and he's got a home, too.

430
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,430
Me, even if I got married, where would I live?

431
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,750
I can't show Rang's parents the rooftop room.

432
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,970
Still no investors yet?

433
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,250
I'm supposed to meet them later.

434
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,680
But I don't really know. I think I might end up having to wrap it up after only getting a taste of it.

435
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,670
Listen to this without misunderstanding.

436
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,520
Do you want to just come to my company?

437
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,690
I mean, I know you're the CEO of your app too.

438
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,320
But it'd be easier to get married if you belonged somewhere.

439
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,510
Thank you, but I still should see what I'm doing to the end.

440
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,040
There's the time I've invested in it too.

441
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,870
And more than anything else, I'm not sure what marriage is.

442
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,950
Do you know? Marriage?

443
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,220
Huh?

444
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,440
I don't know.

445
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,270
I think it's a good thing. Two is better than one, right?

446
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,130
Someone who'd always be understanding no matter what I do.

447
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,890
To have that same person by my side always,

448
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,740
isn't something like that something good?

449
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,350
What happened to you suddenly? How did you get all soppy?

450
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,280
Maybe there's someone of that sort these days?

451
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,080
Someone magnificent, kid!

452
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,600
Chief Nam. What is getting married?

453
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,230
What is getting married, Mr. Married?

454
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,840
Is it nice being married, Ahjussi?

455
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,100
I told you not to start talking to me while I'm working, right?

456
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,170
Because of you, my logic got scattered.

457
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,090
Alright, friend.

458
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,410
Also. Don't talk about personal stuff at work.

459
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,790
Okay.

460
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:51,030
It seems a human being can actually spit at you with their eyes.

461
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,120
He's someone without any common awareness.

462
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,150
Even a punk like him can get married, so why can't we?

463
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,410
You look so young for your age.

464
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:05,170
Compared to your looks, your age is... Maybe you're preparing to take some exams?

465
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,300
Nothing like that. I am just taking a break for a while.

466
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,200
I see. At your age?

467
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,090
So you were a writer before?

468
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,010
Yes, a drama assistant writer.

469
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,510
Assistant writer?

470
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,110
There's such a thing?

471
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,950
I think it'd be difficult at our shop.

472
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,820
To be honest, we're looking for 20-something's.

473
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,220
I'm sorry.

474
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,740
Yes.

475
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:43,120
Part-time help wanted

476
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,380
Ack, this is bad.

477
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,870
Oh, you're part-time—

478
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:50,820
Bok Nam! Bok Nam! Where did that punk go?

479
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,280
- You're here to find a part-time job?
- Ah, yes.

480
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,010
- Boss?
- Yes, just a second, please.

481
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,390
It's so busy here. Where did he go?

482
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,400
Can you help me find Bok Nam out in front?

483
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,600
Who is Bok Nam?

484
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,990
He's a kid of ours but, he went out while I was in the kitchen, I think.

485
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,910
I should get him tied up by the neck or something.

486
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,880
- He went out alone?
- This is what he looks like.

487
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,680
He's got brown fur here. And curly.

488
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,690
Pink colored clothes. He likes corners. So if you look around those places, he's probably there.

489
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,490
Brown color. Curly. Pink color.

490
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,660
Boss, aren't you going to take our order here?

491
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,510
When you see him. He's pretty.

492
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,820
Please do me the favor.

493
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,920
Yes, coming. Just a second.

494
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,930
Bok Nam?

495
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,300
Bok Nam?

496
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,200
Bok Nam?

497
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,900
I forgot to ask him what kind of a dog.

498
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,470
Brown poodle?

499
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,080
Bok Nam?

500
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:07,000
Bok Nam? Bok Nam? Bok Nam?

501
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,130
Bok Nam?

502
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,820
Bok Nam?

503
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,930
What are you looking for?

504
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,380
Oh.

505
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,050
The puppy that the shop up front raises.

506
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,580
I think he went out alone without the owner.

507
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,330
His name is Bok Nam.

508
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,070
Oh, Bok Nam?

509
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,970
By chance, did you see him?

510
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:40,510
Curly brown fur.

511
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,660
Pink colored clothes.

512
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,650
When you look at him, he's pretty.

513
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,440
He said pretty?

514
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,660
Yes.

515
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,340
I think so.

516
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,620
Oh.

517
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,620
You saw him?

518
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,440
No.

519
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,260
Then.

520
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,950
Wait.

521
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,230
Give me your number.

522
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,280
Why?

523
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,960
I'll call you when I find the dog. Then I'll need your number.

524
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,510
Oh. Yes.

525
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:21,710
The name doesn't sound like he's pretty. Bok Nam.

526
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:32,350
But why did I give him my number when I don't know him?

527
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,920
Come on in.

528
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,180
Oh no. I didn't find him. Bok Nam.

529
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,000
He came back on his own feet. Just a little while ago.

530
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,620
Really?

531
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:54,240
What a relief. But where...

532
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,490
Have a seat. You said you were looking for a part-time job, right?

533
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,320
Oh, yes.

534
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,870
Thanks for helping me find Bok Nam.

535
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,450
He often likes to go out and roam around.

536
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,360
But you named him so well. Bok Nam.

537
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,370
You brought your resume?

538
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,560
Oh, yes, of course.

539
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,220
Bok Nam

540
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:24,210
Oh, right. Earlier, someone named Deputy Park called to tell you they've got a company dinner tonight.

541
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:30,090
Those rascals! What era are we living in now? Isn't that too obvious? They're asking me to pay for their company meal!

542
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,350
Deputy Park? It's that Deputy Park from Felix, right? That rascal.

543
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,030
Nope. Deputy Park from HK.

544
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,520
HK?

545
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,700
Oh, they're having their company dinner then.

546
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,900
Where and what time, how...

547
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,620
I sent it to you by messenger.

548
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,370
Really?

549
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:53,040
But how come it's always just me with this chained-up, heavy feeling?

550
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,020
On account of age and on account of social position, isn't this heaviness something you should be carrying?

551
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,960
It's Se Hee's wife!

552
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,720
Oh, Sister-in-law!

553
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,400
Oh. Hello.

554
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,610
What brings you here? Oh, you must be here to see Se Hee.

555
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:10,250
Oh. No. I had an errand nearby and somehow...

556
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:13,960
That's great. It's our snack time. Come on in and share it with us.

557
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,700
No, I should go home.

558
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,120
But it'd be nice if you came with us.

559
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:25,340
Make yourself at home, Sister-in-law. This is your first time here, right?

560
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,040
- Yes.
- How is it?
- It's so great!

561
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,890
Yes, I put some thought into it.

562
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:33,500
Oh, Se Hee is in a meeting right now, but it'll be done soon.

563
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,830
This is Chief Nam's seat.

564
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:38,560
Look around and I'll go prepare this.

565
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,750
Sister-in-law, fighting! I love it!

566
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,080
It's Me

567
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,990
It's Me (bulletin board)

568
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,270
Ma Sang Goo / Desired nickname: Mably.
Desired salary: Immeasurable.
Likes: Women and Working into the night. / Dislikes: Yolo.

569
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,500
Nam Se Hee / Desired nickname: None.
Desired salary: Enough to pay back the loan before retiring.
Likes: Cat. / Dislikes: Stuff like this.

570
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,670
Didn't you clearly say last week that there weren't any?

571
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:28,360
I asked you if there were any edits to be made in the final draft. Twice.

572
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:33,310
Oh. That's is because it's linked to so many aspects.

573
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:37,450
Am I supposed to know each and every detail like that?

574
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:41,190
You should have balanced that up in advance.

575
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,620
Yes. Though that's true—

576
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,970
From now on, when it comes to matters of such low priority as this,

577
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:48,180
I hope you never break the project flow over something like that.

578
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,840
Yes, I understand.

579
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,300
- Eat up.
- Thank you!

580
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,710
There is no reason to thank me. I bought it with the company credit card.

581
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,180
This isn't a hologram, is it?

582
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:17,880
Who would have imagined that I would see Se Hee with his wife in my lifetime?

583
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,990
Stop overreacting.

584
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,890
Is it alright if I take a picture, for business purposes?

585
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,330
Sure, me?

586
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,240
Ah, pretty.

587
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,200
But why are you taking my pic—

588
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,240
You are Se Hee's ideal type, so I wanted it to be reflected in our data.

589
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,500
Ideal type?

590
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,450
He said that to the President. He married you because you are pretty.

591
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:42,670
This is the first time I heard Mr. Nam using such a flashy term about a woman. "Extremely."

592
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:46,190
"Extremely pretty." That's what he said I'm telling you!

593
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,580
So unexpected.

594
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:55,090
It's so nice that you visited, Ji Ho. When would we ever get a chance to tease Mr. Nam like this?

595
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,970
That's right.

596
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,420
Come by often, Sister-in-law.

597
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,200
This.

598
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,690
- Have one.
- So dirty, touching it with bare hands.

599
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,910
Have this.

600
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,430
Have a lot.

601
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,750
Thank you.

602
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,680
Eat up!

603
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,420
Let's do a wave, starting with me and moving to the right.

604
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,380
Shall we leave now?

605
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,430
No, let's stay a bit longer.

606
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,580
Why isn't he here already?

607
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,640
Oh, CEO!

608
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,270
Come over here.

609
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:46,170
- Ah, you've come a long way.
- Have you been well?

610
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,630
What team dinner do you have today?

611
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:53,200
It's the last day for the newbies, so I wanted to buy them a drink.

612
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,090
Nice to meet you.

613
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,440
This is Gyeolmalae's CEO, Ma Sang Goo. Applause!

614
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,880
Applause!

615
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,580
As Gyeolmalae's representative, Ma Sang Goo, cheers for dating!

616
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,880
Fighting!

617
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,550
Let's have a glass.

618
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,490
Since he's here, let us move to another place.

619
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:14,370
We can go to the good beef sashimi restaurant next door.

620
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:17,790
Beef sashimi? Beef sashimi sounds good. Let's head to the beef place.

621
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:27,190
I'll settle the bill.

622
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,660
On this, please.

623
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,760
What are you doing? I was going to pay.

624
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,070
Why would you? We're the ones that drank.

625
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:41,210
- Please give me the receipt.
- It's $206.

626
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,620
Please sign here.

627
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:46,680
I know you make a lot of money, but don't use it on people who abuse their power to get you to pay.

628
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,300
If you have money for that, play some more on those doll-claw machine games.

629
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,630
Here.

630
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:56,080
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you, goodbye.

631
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,380
What is that woman playing at?

632
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:06,650
Is it an appeal of charm? To make me fall for her?

633
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,440
The card. Work hard.

634
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,660
Welcome and cheers!

635
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,340
I added you, check it.

636
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:23,830
Assistant manager, we're friends now.

637
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:27,570
Who says we're friends?

638
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,280
I'm jealous!

639
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,310
- Assistant Manager Kim.
- Yes?

640
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:36,540
Why didn't you accept my invite? I think it's been two weeks.

641
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,040
Really? I didn't know.

642
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,290
Check it now.

643
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:45,110
Later.

644
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,510
You don't friend married guys?

645
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,600
No, it's not that.

646
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,740
Assistant Manager Park. I was also recently dumped by an employee.

647
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,510
"What CEO sends a friend request?!"

648
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,380
It must be the work culture these days.

649
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,740
Let's not send or accept friend requests among work people.

650
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,880
That employee was female, right?

651
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,610
Yes, she was.

652
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:15,880
Of course! Women are like that.

653
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,780
In such cases, it's always this. There's must be loads of pictures taken with her boyfriend.

654
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:25,010
If not, then what the heck is the reason for not accepting?

655
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:27,150
Right, totally.

656
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:32,010
Fine, I'll accept it.

657
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:37,450
Our Assistant Manager Woo is totally cool!

658
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:42,490
In exchange, you can't erase your bikini pictures taken at the hotel.

659
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,550
Don't Like It though, okay? I'll get goosebumps if you do that.

660
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:52,910
Yeah!

661
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,560
Another shot!

662
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,140
She's cool.

663
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,860
Smoke?

664
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,640
Why are you like that?

665
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,980
Why do you hold it in even after hearing those trashy words?

666
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:28,020
CEO Ma. Be careful.

667
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:33,040
In front of me you speak your mind loud and clear, but in there you're weak and gloss over things. Why is that?

668
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,820
Do you suddenly become a loser in front of them?

669
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,410
Hey! You might not know because you are a mighty CEO,

670
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:41,720
but to a salaried worker like me, gatherings like these are a continuation of my workday.

671
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,740
It'd be a really nice scene for the newbies if I fought with Assistant Manager in there.

672
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:48,580
That's why you must out him, because your juniors are there!

673
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,870
- They should know not to behave that way!
- Why me?

674
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,540
Have you ever tried working as a woman in a big corporation?

675
00:47:54,540 --> 00:48:00,000
If it becomes a big deal for nothing, I'm the one they'll gossip about.

676
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:05,950
So please don't worry about someone else's worker, CEO Ma.

677
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:22,120
CEO Ma, he seems so much more fun after talking to him.

678
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,070
Does he?

679
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:27,640
Did you see Bo Mi's expression earlier?

680
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,170
When CEO Ma hid the sandwich,

681
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:35,050
he was somewhat cute.

682
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,950
I see.

683
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:44,320
Do you know that going home together like this,

684
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,080
it's our first time.

685
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,380
Is that so?

686
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,580
While living in Seoul, everything was okay, but

687
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:01,310
strangely, I hated having to go home by myself.

688
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,210
I had vaguely imagined it in school.

689
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:11,220
If I got married, I would be going home together with someone.

690
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,810
Then that would be so lovely.

691
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,720
Yes.

692
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:27,340
Woori.

693
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,580
You were bored, weren't you?

694
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:42,810
Ah, I gave her a name.

695
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:45,270
Woori.

696
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:52,640
I thought it would be nice if she had a name.

697
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:58,510
To keep calling the cat Kitty is sort of, how should I put it?

698
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:04,940
It's similar to my mom telling me, "Primate, come eat."

699
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:23,500
You don't like the name?

700
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,220
Rather than disliking it,

701
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:33,650
I find it uncomfortable.

702
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,660
Un...comfortable?

703
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,300
Yes, It's my cat, but

704
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:47,270
having someone call it by another name is uncomfortable.

705
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,200
Ah, right.

706
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,060
You could feel like that.

707
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:06,570
Then, the fact that I went to your office today

708
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:10,300
must have been uncomfortable for you too.

709
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:17,560
Yes, it was.

710
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,500
Okay.

711
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:23,130
Right?

712
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:27,000
Without another option, we chose marriage, but

713
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,940
expecting a deeper relationship than homeowner and tenant

714
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,690
is truthfully uncomfortable for me.

715
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:37,950
Situations where we have to play a couple in front of others,

716
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:42,550
I'd like to avoid them if possible.

717
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,970
Yes. I'll do that.

718
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:51,740
That's the right thing.

719
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:54,940
Right.

720
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,720
I'll do that from now on.

721
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,430
Then...

722
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:08,390
I have to trim its toenails.

723
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:11,930
Oh, sure.

724
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:33,720
Ho Rang, are you sure Won Seok has thought about marrying you?

725
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,560
So have you guys ever talked about it seriously?

726
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,000
About wanting to marry each other.

727
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,020
You're here?

728
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,610
Ah, I'm so tired. Seriously.

729
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,400
You had the meeting with the investors today, right?

730
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,050
You've worked hard.

731
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,910
Yeah, I worked really hard today.

732
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:03,760
I mean, is anyone and everyone Steve Jobs?

733
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,830
They're all telling me to start from the garage. Are we in America?

734
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:10,150
I don't even have a car. What garage would I have?

735
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,890
I'm so comfortable.

736
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,610
- Seok.
- Yeah?

737
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:23,960
About our marriage...

738
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,670
Yeah?

739
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,560
What do you think about it?

740
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,270
- My opinion?
- Yeah.

741
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:43,050
I don't think I ever talked about it officially before.

742
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:46,890
Do you also want to get married?

743
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,810
You see...

744
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,690
Honestly, I still don't know.

745
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:00,580
You don't know?

746
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:05,160
You know I really love you

747
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:11,080
and want to live with you, which is why I'm living here with you.

748
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,740
But...

749
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:19,270
I still don't know about marriage.

750
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,530
You said you love me, though.

751
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:27,160
Of course. You also know that without you, I can't live.

752
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,400
However, I don't know about marrying just because we are in love.

753
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:38,640
- What?
- We have to raise kids and take on a lot of responsibilities once we get married.

754
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:43,030
But right now, I can't even secure an investment.

755
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,350
So how could I handle marriage?

756
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,690
So that's what comes to your mind.

757
00:54:56,330 --> 00:55:00,350
Yeah, I've been giving that a lot of thought lately and worrying about it, too.

758
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:04,860
Rang. Are you disappointed?

759
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:10,350
N-No. I can become worried, too,

760
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:12,910
since dating and marriage are different.

761
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,710
Right?

762
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:18,030
So that's why I said it's quite hard.

763
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:23,210
Rang, I sometimes think about that, too.

764
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:29,070
Is loving each other and marriage the same thing?

765
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:36,530
Those ill-fated 1988 births.

766
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:46,920
Born during South Korea's most spectacular time.

767
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,120
The generation that is experiencing the worst vagrancy.

768
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,820
The generation that has tasted abundance and destitution at the same time.

769
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:58,480
So, that's why we...

770
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,800
- Honey Honey!! I love you!
- I love you, Yang Ho Rang.

771
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,130
... are called the ill-fated 1988 births.

772
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:07,460
To us, both marriage

773
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,980
and dating and "we"

774
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,250
and all the whatever's are not givens to us.

775
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:24,540
I'm sorry. It's because I'm an old geezer.

776
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:31,000
No.

777
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,090
Even ordinary things like bonding and romance,

778
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:43,760
have become expenses and energies.

779
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,900
So,

780
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:49,400
I must've been mistaken for a moment.

781
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,140
I'll stay with you.

782
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,970
Now that isn't just your situation anymore, it's ours.

783
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,630
Our situation?

784
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:02,180
Yes, it's our situation.

785
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,200
Those words of yours

786
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,920
made me think I could have those common comforts.

787
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,770
I thought

788
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:16,930
I could also now say "our."

789
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,770
♫  Stay with me  ♫

790
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:33,890
I was happy

791
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,710
for a moment.

792
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:42,370
♫  Come with me  ♫

793
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,660
You made a delicious breakfast again today.

794
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:14,080
It was obvious that I did go overboard about yesterday.

795
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,820
What? Well, it's fine—

796
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:22,330
I think that I've been a little bit out of it after I quit my job.

797
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:25,190
I'm sorry I was a nuisance.

798
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:34,070
Honestly,

799
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:38,110
it's been such a long time since I heard the word "our."

800
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,590
"Our house." "Our neighborhood."

801
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,380
It's hard to hear those types of words nowadays.

802
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:51,390
It had been too long since I felt like I belonged somewhere,

803
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:54,220
so I went a bit overboard.

804
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:59,120
I must have been mistaken about

805
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,820
being in an "our" type of relationship between you as the house owner and me as the tenant.

806
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:16,090
So from now on, don't say "our" so easily.

807
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:19,110
Because it makes me misunderstand.

808
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,900
Yes. I understand.

809
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:34,600
I know

810
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:45,140
why I'm mad right now.

811
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,590
Could you pass my chopstick and spoon, please?

812
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:50,630
Oh, yes.

813
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:55,630
♫ Creating a beautiful night  ♫

814
00:59:55,630 --> 01:00:02,190
♫ On getting married and meet a nice person  ♫

815
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:06,220
♫ And be a nice person  ♫

816
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:10,320
Because I started reading too deeply into this. Because my pride was hurt.

817
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,320
Because I'm embarrassed.

818
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:15,880
Though the reasons must be varied.

819
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,000
- Hello?
 - Yoon Ji Ho?

820
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,470
Yes, who are you?

821
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:48,160
- It's me, the alley road.
- Alley road?

822
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,100
Oh, the alley road where I went to look for Bok Nam?

823
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,630
Yes, Bok Nam.

824
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:54,870
Ah, but what's the matter?

825
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:57,970
I have something to ask you. Do you have a piece of paper with you?

826
01:00:57,970 --> 01:00:59,360
Paper?

827
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,400
Ah, yes.

828
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,370
Then, what about a pen?

829
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:05,760
I also have a pen.

830
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,230
- Then what about a boyfriend?
- Boyfrie—

831
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:13,560
- What?
- Do you also have a boyfriend?

832
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:17,770
Though the reasons must be various,

833
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:26,790
one thing I'm sure of is...

834
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,700
Boyfriend...
 what I am to you.

835
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:37,010
...don't have one.

836
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:40,680
That I've started to want to hurt you.

837
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:45,190
Because the force of attraction between us

838
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:50,410
was broken.

839
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:55,820
♫ Even if I don't want love ♫

840
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:59,730
♫ When you are in front of me  ♫

841
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:04,960
♫ I become wanting to hold your hands and everything's fine ♫

842
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,760
♫ And I become wanting for love  ♫

843
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:15,480
Because This is My First Life

844
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,490
- From the first day we met—
- From the first day you guys met,

845
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:20,400
you must be very close.

846
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,820
But you were jealous.

847
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:23,750
- Earlier, the whole time.
- I wasn't.

848
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:26,480
What is that? That bad attitude just now?

849
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,190
- By any chance, are you mad at me for anything?
- Why would I be?

850
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:32,950
Isn't he just the complete opposite of Brother-in-law?

851
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:35,820
What's wrong with you?

852
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:38,280
The thought occurs to me that my experience is too lacking.

853
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:42,040
I think if I continue to be with you, I might end up jumping on you.

854
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,710
Why would I put on both of these?

855
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:46,070
Since you're anti-marriage, make it clear.

856
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:49,620
I feel like dating him would also be a great experience in life.

857
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:52,990
I do not hold the authority to get involved in my wife's social life.

858
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:55,520
What should we do about your husband?
