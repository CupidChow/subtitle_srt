Hurry and come

8
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,860
so we can go to our home.

9
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,170
You dropped it at the bus stop.

10
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,960
I see.

Unanswered calls (6)
- Landlord

12
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,580
You called me many times.

13
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,310
Yes, I did.

14
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,160
I called many times.

15
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:45,910
♫ Let me briefly borrow your warm shoulder ♫

16
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,150
♫ Please be a shelter ♫

17
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,680
♫ For my tired soul ♫

18
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,530
Can I shower first? Since I'm so sweaty.

19
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,870
Yes, go ahead.

20
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,230
Yes.

21
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,090
Why?

22
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,470
Yes?

23
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,120
Why are you following me?

24
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,270
It's not that I'm following you.

25
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,570
I didn't know.

26
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,880
Yes. I thought so.

27
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,740
Well, take a shower.

28
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,090
It seemed off but it went in really rather well, didn't it?

29
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,170
The receiving of the ball from the center was awesome.

30
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,650
Yes.

31
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,000
He seems to be the suspect in the Namgang Station case.

32
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,660
The stalker of that female college student?

33
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,840
The report content is similar and also, the spanner (wrench).

34
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,320
But, why didn't you say anything to me?

35
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,000
Didn't you know all along?

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,990
You said it was a job that was difficult for you to get.

37
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,950
I couldn't let you know recklessly.

38
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,570
Still, if you had given me a clue

39
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,920
then I could have acted like I didn't know and kept a watch on him.

40
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,700
You? Act like you didn't know?

41
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,160
Why?

42
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,070
Do I look like I can't do that?

43
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,860
I overreacted a bit. So from now on, saying 'us' too easily,

44
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,990
please stop.

45
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,510
Did you come home on the bus?

46
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,520
Do I have to answer that?

47
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,220
Well, you don't need to.

48
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,390
Exactly.

49
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,090
That person seemed to know about our contract?

50
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,760
Yes.

51
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,430
He definitely said 'fake husband.'

52
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,410
Who told you to get married to a fake husband?

53
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,500
Even if he stalked me, how could he know that?

54
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,660
You're right.

55
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,950
No one knows that besides the two of us.

56
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,230
Ah, is it because of my cellphone?

57
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,100
What?

58
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,690
He saw what I saved you as on my cell phone.

59
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,720
He said, instead of your husband, isn't he your landlord?

60
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,130
Yes.

61
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,610
You saved me as "Landlord."

62
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,360
That's certainly unusual.

63
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,830
So why did you save my number as "Landlord?"

64
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,430
Then what would I save you as?

65
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,130
Well, there's nothing else I can call you.

66
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,930
Well, there is my name.

67
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,150
Like Se Hee or Se Hee-ssi.

68
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,480
Then Se Hee-ssi, what did you save me as?

69
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,230
Obviously, I saved you as

70
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,190
"Tenant."

71
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,680
Bo Mi's uncle works at the precinct and we've let him know.

72
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,910
So it should be resolved by tomorrow or so.

73
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,320
Then what will happen to Bok Nam?

74
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,150
He will have to eat rice and beans (go to jail).

75
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,580
Yes.

76
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,620
Oh, it's passed through. Now, Sanchez.

77
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,440
It's going in!

78
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,720
He put it in nice and square.

79
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,670
Indeed! Sanchez!

80
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,680
Yes, Sanchez came out fierce.

81
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,050
We've had a few misfires so far,

82
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,280
but this was a perfect through goal. The tempo was perfect.

83
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Thank you,

84
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,480
for running to me,

85
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,400
and coming down from there with me.

86
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,820
Also...

87
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,250
For saying 'our home.'

88
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,530
Were you really disappointed?

89
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,220
That line I drew?

90
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,710
For asking not to act like a married couple in front of others,

91
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:59,710
and for asking not to say 'us' as well,

92
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,640
were you hurt by that?

93
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,740
Yes.

94
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,630
But I . . .

95
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,410
don't wish to be a hindrance to you.

96
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:22,420
Different from others, we entered into marriage with a plan for it to end.

97
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:28,210
For you, it's a boarding space and for me, it's the benefit of monthly rent.

98
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,010
Though we entered into a contract that was agreed to by both,

99
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,980
after the marriage ends

100
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:40,060
it's likely that you will suffer a bigger loss than me.

101
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,350
You're a woman,

102
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,500
and you're younger than me,

103
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:52,510
so the social judgment against you could be harsher.

104
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,320
Hence, all links to me should be kept to a minimum.

105
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,800
And any events shared by both of us . . .

106
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:05,030
I thought it would be right to avoid them as much as possible.

107
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:10,660
So you've been thinking those thoughts?

108
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,280
About the aftermath of our marriage end,

109
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,970
and also of the losses I might suffer?

110
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,310
Rather than that I've been thinking of them continuously.

111
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,970
It was that the thought occurred to me, right after our wedding.

112
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,490
Why?

113
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,650
Because I made a promise

114
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,990
that I would not be a hindrance to you.

115
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,270
I made a promise to your mother.

116
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,210
So I wanted to keep it.

117
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,810
And I want to continue to keep it in the future as well.

118
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,040
Though I still don't know Ji Ho that well either,

119
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,430
she's someone who would always choose the road to her own happiness on her own.

120
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,190
And during our marriage, that choice . . .

121
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,150
I will not be a hindrance to it.

122
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:19,030
What I can promise you is only this.

123
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,740
Landlord

124
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,240
Calling Landlord

125
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,100
He-ll-o?

126
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,520
It's me.

127
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,380
Yes, I know.

128
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,960
I . . .

129
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:58,530
After I graduated and got hired as an assistant writer,

130
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,480
I received 800 thousand won a month ($800).

131
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,180
Back then, my dad told me to quit right away and come down to Namhae.

132
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,020
He told me to harvest spinach.

133
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,020
At the field near our home,

134
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,650
if I picked spinach for just a week

135
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,800
I'd earn more than that, he said.

136
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,710
The job that no one could understand.

137
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:29,280
The reason that I could begin working was that

138
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,580
I had no thoughts.

139
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,970
Like becoming a great writer,

140
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,740
or becoming famous,

141
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,000
to succeed.

142
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,250
I had no such thoughts at all.

143
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,180
I just somehow ended up reading a script,

144
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,520
and it was crazily interesting to me.

145
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,500
So that's how I just started.

146
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,260
Because writing day after day was fun for me, that's why.

147
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,680
Through writing, to achieve something or become something,

148
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,530
I had no thoughts of such things.

149
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,990
That's why I,

150
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,920
regarding what might happen two years later,

151
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,020
I don't think of that.

152
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,730
If I had thought that far

153
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,540
I probably couldn't have done this, this marriage.

154
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,200
To me,

155
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,120
I just needed this room right now.

156
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,050
And I liked the safety of this home.

157
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,410
And I didn't want to part from Kitty.

158
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,710
And also,

159
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,280
the landlord seemed trustworthy.

160
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,300
So that's why I did it.

161
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,340
Because I liked the fact of belonging to this home now.

162
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:04,780
So the stuff that might happen after the marriage ends,

163
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,340
it doesn't matter to me and I don't think of it.

164
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,360
So now,

165
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,850
purposefully drawing a line...

166
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,860
Please don't.

167
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,610
Yes.

169
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,950
don't lock it.

170
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,390
Yes.

171
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,280
Then,

172
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,050
sleep well.

173
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,640
I have something to say, too.

174
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,250
Landlord. Please don't call me that.

175
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:48,420
You could be misunderstood as being alone.

176
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,350
In front of others, call me your husband.

177
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,910
A dangerous situation could happen again. So that you won't be misunderstood as being alone,

178
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,780
for two years along with me,

179
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,330
you belong to this home.

180
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,860
Yes.

181
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,940
Yes.

182
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,580
Then, goodnight.

183
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,490
But how did you know I was there?

184
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,010
You couldn't call me either.

Because It's My First Feeling of Belonging.

224
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,970
Hello?

225
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,830
Hello?

226
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,530
Hello?

227
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,920
So you were home. Then, why did you call again?

228
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,970
Oh. That's . . .

229
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,730
Oh.

230
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,970
I meant to turn off the alarm but I accidentally pushed call.

231
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,650
I see.

232
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,390
That's what happened.

233
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,680
Did you sleep well?

234
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,070
Yes. And you, Ji Ho?

235
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,800
Me too.

236
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,720
Oh.

237
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,910
Kitty. How are you here?

238
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,390
She took a cab and came by herself.

239
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,570
She was crying for me to open the door from outside so I did.

240
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:05,210
She's got that kind of skill?

241
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,080
She doesn't, of course.

242
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,110
Since that was a joke.

243
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,670
So it was joking that you did.

244
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,750
Yes.

245
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,940
Yup, it's Ji Ho. What's happened, this early on?

246
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,810
Yes, Bo Mi. News? I didn't see it.

247
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,780
Watch the news? Why? What?

248
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,740
Oh.

249
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,730
He's been caught?

250
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,230
The forced confinement incident that occurred at Namgang Station on October 30th.

251
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,650
The suspect in the case was arrested this morning by police.

252
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,190
The suspect stalked a woman he met in an online game and kidnapped her.

253
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,850
And he's been suspected of keeping her confined for 13 hours.

254
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:09,240
The police are conducting an investigation into additional suspected crimes upon his arrest.

255
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,630
I still can't believe it.

256
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,250
I never thought he would be this kind of a kid.

257
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:21,240
We ourselves don't even know ourselves, so how could we know about the dark sides of others?

258
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,640
Will you be alright to go to work today?

259
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,960
The police could come to the cafe, too.

260
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,890
It's alright. The suspect's been arrested so I need to go and work.

261
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,860
Then. See you later at home.

262
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,290
Will you be taking the bus home today?

263
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,050
Yes.

264
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,070
Then, see you later.

265
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,790
Yes.

266
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,380
Oh my world, that rascal Bok Nam. Ji Ho, are you hurt anywhere?

267
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,760
Nope, I'm fine. Before it got dangerous, the land—

268
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,370
I mean,

269
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,070
my husband

270
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,890
came to get me.

271
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,430
That's what I'm saying. I heard it from Soo Ji.

272
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,810
I mean, Brother-in-law is really awesome.

273
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:24,180
We all fell over for that smile but how did he gather all that data?

274
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,520
I know. At the time I didn't even know

275
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,580
he had gathered all the evidence.

276
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,940
He's really detailed and thorough.

277
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,660
Seok might be right after all. He said not anyone can solve the cube.

278
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,010
He's got the new record for the cube, I heard. At his company.

279
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,350
Yeah, he's capable of something like that.

280
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:47,160
He's someone very thorough who doesn't tolerate a mistake.

281
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,600
Daebak! Fifty-two seconds.

282
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,710
Wow!

283
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,310
Indeed. Se Hee. He's the god of the cube.

284
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,950
This is nonsense. This is amazing.

285
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,740
Wow. How did he do this?

286
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,660
I've never seen this before.

287
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,310
Wow, is he human?

288
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,340
I don't think he is.

289
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,340
Chief Nam, if you're done, could you see me for a sec? For work.

290
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,360
So did you do something to that kid yesterday?

291
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,910
Nothing too severe, right?

292
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,350
You didn't hit him, did you?

293
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,110
Do I seem like someone who would hit a person?

294
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,450
That's a relief.

295
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,210
Instead,

296
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,120
I hit his motorcycle.

297
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,840
- Hit what?
- The ₩40 million one?

298
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,740
Well, though it's ₩40 million, it was knocked down with one blow.

299
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:04,460
And furthermore, I didn't even put too much power into it.

300
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,370
Why are you looking at me with those eyes?

301
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,130
It's true. I didn't use my full power.

302
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,030
I called and told you this morning though, that they caught the suspect.

303
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,040
Yes. I saw the news, too.

304
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,550
Look at this.

305
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:32,830
I got this by asking my uncle the favor. The perpetrator's photo.

306
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,660
I looked at the account of the reported list and the account was under a stolen identity.

307
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,690
- What?
- You saw it too though.

308
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:46,020
Yeon Bok Nam is a very popular celebrity on Instragram.

309
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,550
You know how you can find out all sorts of information when you hack SNS?

310
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,130
The perpetrator opened new account and uploaded Yeon Bok Nam's photo as his.

311
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:02,220
He acted like he was Yeon Bok Nam and approached the women. He's a total repeat offender.

312
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:08,730
Then . . . He's what?

313
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,760
He's just a diligent part-timer.

314
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,350
And a good citizen, too.

315
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:31,800
You! Why are you not in jail and you're eating toast here?

316
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,820
Yesterday, your husband wrecked his motorcycle, I hear.

317
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:41,770
- What?
- He kicked the motorcycle that was nicely parked and broke it!

318
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,690
Well, Boss. That's because . . .

319
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,630
He's a stalker.

320
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,970
What? A stalker?

321
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,870
Yes. He's the suspect in the Namgang Station case.

322
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,520
Did he break out of jail so fast?

323
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,940
Boss. I think we need to call the police right away first.

324
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,830
Ji Ho? I think this is too much.

325
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,160
He's a good kid and you say he's a criminal? Stalker?

326
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,180
So that's the main point! He looks perfectly fine.

327
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,170
- Look here, seriously!
- It's alright. Stop, Dad.

328
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,800
Who is he to tell him to stop?

329
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,180
Dad?!

330
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,960
Call your husband. Immediately!

331
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,550
What? Namgang Station suspect?

332
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:45,150
I'm sorry. I think there's been an error.

333
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,540
If there's an error, you undo it by talking.

334
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:53,100
A grown-up adult goes and breaks the kid's bike? That expensive one?!

335
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,360
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

336
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,870
Do you know what motorcycle that is? It's the motorcycle that he took his rent deposit out to buy!

337
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,690
When you look perfectly normal.

338
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:12,710
Yes?

339
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:21,400
I was going to settle it quietly too, but once my dad's angry no one can stop him.

340
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,550
Oh. But I didn't tell him that—about the fake marriage.

341
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,830
How did you know?

342
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:35,530
Great Day Banquet Hall. You went there on the bus, right?

343
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:39,990
Usually, people don't go to their own wedding riding a bus.

344
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,010
I mean, a normal couple.

345
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:01,980
When I first saw you on the bus, I thought it was kind of funny and I just let it pass.

346
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,020
By chance, do you think you will need a handkerchief?

347
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,920
When the bride cries the groom should wipe it with a handkerchief.

348
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,760
What? Me, cry? Why? I'm not that kind of a character.

349
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,490
Yes, and that's such a relief.

350
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:22,680
Oh, and I will pay for half of your wedding wear cost.

351
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,120
Oh, no, it wasn't much anyway.

352
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,580
But the more I listened, the stranger your conversation became.

353
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:34,580
But different from me, you had to get wedding shoes and the bouquet, too, so I'll take it off on next month's rent.

354
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,880
Thank you.

355
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,180
Bus #4461

356
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:51,430
What? Today? I have an evening part-time job today.

357
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,250
But you got off right in front of the banquet hall where I work as a part-timer.

358
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,030
Bok Nam, can you get the announcement stand in the waiting lounge set up?

359
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,950
Yes.

360
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,190
Pardon me.

361
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,780
Yes.

362
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,330
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

363
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,820
So I had thought. "This bride and groom aren't ordinary."

364
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,290
For example, a contract marriage?

365
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,990
Thanks everyone.

366
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,100
Thank you.

367
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,100
Thank you, Bo Mi.

368
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,360
- Thank you.
- You should take one more picture.

369
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,340
- What?
- Our banquet hall offers a complimentary frame.

370
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,690
- You should take a picture for the frame.
- It's alright.

371
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,160
Complimentary? Then we should. Stand again. Hurry.

372
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:11,090
I think you should do a pose?

373
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,220
I saw that there weren't any tender ones.

374
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,820
Really?

375
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,200
Se Hee, put on a different pose.

376
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,780
By different pose, you mean?

377
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,250
- Like a kiss.
- What?

378
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,990
Or hugging the bride's waist.

379
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,000
It's a wedding photo. What is that? So weak.

380
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,480
In that case, they will blame the photographer every time they see their photos.

381
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:38,040
The two of you, put on some pose, whatever it is.

382
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,280
Just do some kind of physical contact.

383
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:53,990
Okay. It's much more tender. Right?

384
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:58,250
Sure. A hand-shake is physical contact.

385
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,310
I'm taking it now.

386
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,110
Then, how did you know about my signature?

387
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,200
You did it when you settled with the banquet bill.

388
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,780
Nam Se Hee.

389
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,970
- Oh.
- Right.

390
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:20,270
But what about the spanner then?

391
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,840
Yeah.

392
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,260
Wow.

393
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:45,820
I was going to open the beer bottle for you! Since I didn't have a bottle opener.

394
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:50,810
Maybe you should share a moment of daytime drinking. The fake husband and wife fraud team.

395
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,470
No. The kick threatening ring duo?

396
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,520
That . . .

397
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,810
And the motorcycle repair cost. I'll send it to you by tomorrow.

398
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:15,140
Yes. The motorcycle.

399
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,750
Um. Young Boy Bok Nam?

400
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:36,210
No, Mister Bok Nam. No, Dearest Son.

401
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,390
You came early today. You're only working in the morning?

402
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:50,170
Yeah, we need a day like this too.

403
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,460
Are you going to the persimmon and pear gathering today?

404
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,660
Persimmon and pear gathering?

405
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,710
Oh, the high school reunion meeting? Of course. Isn't it also a meeting for Soo Jin's invitation?

406
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,110
Yup. What about Ji Ho?

407
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,020
Ji Ho's coming too.

408
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,740
Unni. Something colorful today.

409
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,320
- Will it be alright?
- I'm off tomorrow, so it's fine.

410
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,830
- You're here?
- Sorry.

411
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,810
I'm sorry. You must have waited a long time.

412
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,320
It's alright. It's cold, right?

413
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,840
But how did it go? Is Bok Nam super mad? So Brother-in-law needs to sell the house to pay back the motorcycle?

414
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,390
Hey, take a breath when you ask questions.

415
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:36,040
Did you resolve it well?

416
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,210
He doesn't have to go as far as selling the home.

417
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:43,920
Thankfully, he talked to him well and it settled well.

418
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,410
But an expensive motorcycle is truly different after all.

419
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,610
But since other places are fine, we agreed for him to just pay for the side mirror.

420
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,690
In installments.

421
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:00,180
And I have to work harder now, too, since it's Bok Nam's shop.

422
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,670
I mean, that's what I'm saying. Who would've thought he was the store owner's son?

423
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:07,710
But we got to see your husband in a new light through this.

424
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:13,140
I mean, he's someone who did a triple somersault to avoid breaking the side mirror but he went and kicked that off.

425
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,220
We were totally shocked.

426
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,110
Well, I was kind of shocked too.

427
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:22,810
You don't tell us but I guess he really loves his wife a lot?

428
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:26,750
That's what's called the power of love. Though someone cold-blooded, like you, wouldn't know about it.

429
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,630
Don't be a brat.

430
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,920
Unni's condition isn't too great since we're heading to the persimmon and pear gathering.

431
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,750
- Persimmon and pear gathering?
- I know, right?

432
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:37,220
I was curious about that too, earlier. Why do you call it persimmon and pear gathering?

433
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,990
You'll know when you go there.

434
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,280
You cut her hair.

435
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,880
Looks so different.

436
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,140
Hey, you know the makeup I am using now.

437
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,250
Ji Ho, tell us about your married life.

438
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:57,810
Actually, we are quite hurt that you didn't tell us about it at all, no matter how much you're trying to do a small wedding.

439
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,380
I'm sorry. I didn't have the time.

440
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:05,680
So? Where's your newlywed home? Apartment? Full lease? Can't be an owned?

441
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,290
Yes, owned.

442
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:10,890
Wow, he's so capable.

443
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,690
Though, it's got a mortgage on it.

444
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,250
Hey, who can start without a loan these days. That's a given.

445
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:18,350
That's a great time. It was great for us during the newlywed time too.

446
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,130
So then? Do you like being married?

447
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,070
Yeah. Well.

448
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,320
It seems I do like it.

449
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,550
Ooh, what is it that you like so much?

450
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,810
When we were newlyweds, my husband would run to me as soon as he got off work.

451
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,660
He looks for you as soon as he gets home from work, right?

452
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:48,600
Well, yeah. He looks for me a lot.

453
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Kitty…

454
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,710
At the front door, he starts calling my name.

455
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,900
When I go to him,

456
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,480
You're home.

457
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,050
he'll abruptly lift me up.

458
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,590
Then.

459
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:17,580
- We go to the bedroom right away.
- Right away?

460
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,580
- Oh, I'm hot, it's hot.
- Hey, isn't that a little too hot?

461
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:26,870
Hey, even so, don't have a baby too quickly. The moment you have a baby your newlywed life is over.

462
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:30,670
Hey, that's advice for twenty-somethings! She has to consider her age now.

463
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,890
To be honest, it's easier to have a baby sooner, even if by one day.

464
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,660
But even when you think that, as soon as you visit your in-laws, such thoughts completely disappear.

465
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:43,350
But in-laws are probably better than company bosses who are sons of bitches, right?

466
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,390
Let's drink this and shake it all off.

467
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,860
Cheers!

468
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:52,350
Soo Ji, you still drink like a fish? You are pretty amazing.

469
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:57,840
When I was pregnant, I craved beer so much I would watch beer commercials every night.

470
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,900
Wasn't it to see Song Joong Ki in those beer commercials?

471
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,750
- Hey, these days instead of Song Joong Ki, it's Park Bo Gum—
- Hey…

472
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:08,130
Come on, how could you young ladies who haven't had kids relate to that feeling?

473
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,110
That's right, you wouldn't know.

474
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,560
You don't have a separate smoking room, do you?

475
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,630
You can smoke out in the parking lot.

476
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,730
Alright.

477
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,970
Why do you need a smoking room?

478
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,090
These days, you can't just smoke anywhere, or you will get fined.

479
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,780
Yeah, that's right. I think it costs about ₩100,000? ($100)

480
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,740
Soo Ji. Do you have no plans to get married?

481
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:32,210
Yeah. I am not interested in that.

482
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:35,350
But, um, later, if you change your mind, you could get married.

483
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,590
I guess, yeah. If I changed my mind, I could.

484
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:42,850
But shouldn't you quit smoking, then?

485
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,090
What?

486
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:49,700
You know, if you're going to have kids, I guess drinking now is alright,

487
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,210
but nicotine is not fully expelled from your body, and that is really bad for the baby. Isn't that right?

488
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,560
That is true.

489
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,590
Did you see that?

490
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,650
- Nag... (persimmons)
- Yes, your body is important if you plan to have babies.

491
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:08,150
... Nag (pears)... persimmons and pears gathering.
(A busybody is said to nag others about putting pears or persimmons on someone else's death memorial table.)

492
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,220
Hey, why does everyone become 'fruit peddlers' when they get married?

493
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,150
Nagging others to put persimmons or pears on the table?

494
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,210
That's why everyone gets married.

495
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:23,960
One of the fun parts of life is getting to nag people about persimmons and pears.

496
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,810
But, Ho Rang. Were you not able to eat much before? Are you hungry?

497
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:33,230
Yep, I'm hungry.

498
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:36,370
I couldn't really eat anything earlier. I had an upset stomach.

499
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:39,770
Hey, I'm the one who picked a fight. Why is your stomach upset?

500
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,250
I was jealous.

501
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:47,810
I was jealous of the married girls, and upset. I couldn't eat anything.

502
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:57,420
I have to admit since I turned 30 things are different for sure.

503
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,330
That's true. When I'm standing, even for a little bit, while serving, I get tired. My skin isn't the same as before, either.

504
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,660
The other day—

505
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,040
After I gave birth, my body changed. Was it like that for you, too?

506
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,660
You sent your kids to kindergarten already. You're pretty much done raising them.

507
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,230
What's the use of being done with the kids? There's the husband I have to raise for the rest of my life.

508
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:19,360
You know, hubby gained weight again...

509
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,360
These days, he requires so much more looking after.

510
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,570
I'm off.

511
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,310
Byeeee!

512
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:49,720
Ah, my belly is about to burst. I relaxed and ate like I was shooting a food porn video today.

513
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,700
Then should we walk a bit?

514
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,690
Should we?

515
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,940
Hee Joo and Yeong Ok became best friends after they got married, huh?

516
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:06,380
That's true. They used to be like water and oil in the past.

517
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,230
You too, Ji Ho.

518
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,340
What? Me?

519
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,610
The girls always found you difficult before.

520
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,310
But look how they are now that you're married, they've gotten so comfortable with you.

521
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,400
Now you all have something in common.

522
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,850
Ah, what of it? They were like that because we haven't seen each other in a while.

523
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:26,280
And after thinking about it, they haven't said anything that was wrong.

524
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,140
About what?

525
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,790
After all, it's the woman who has to have the baby.

526
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:34,160
It's better to have a kid while you're even just a year younger, when you're healthier.

527
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,390
If you want to do that, it makes sense to get married when you're a year younger.

528
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,810
Ho Rang…

529
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:46,240
Why do you want to get married?

530
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:58,130
You know, right? That ever since I was little, I had no interest in black clothes.

531
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,570
Of course.

532
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:03,400
Red, pink, yellow.

533
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,640
Whenever we would get together, I would make bets with Soo Ji about what bright color you would show up wearing.

534
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:16,080
But you know, these days, I open my closet and find myself drawn to clothes that don't stand out.

535
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,820
Whatever clothes you wear it with, it'll look good.

536
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,560
Wherever you go, you won't stick out.

537
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,670
That's why I like it.

538
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:31,670
You know, one of the ahjummas who was in the friend group with my mom

539
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:35,100
was a manager of some insurance company.

540
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,780
She took great care of herself, so she was slim, had no wrinkles,

541
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,190
and she earned well.

542
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:45,890
After they all went to the bathhouse together, she would always treat everyone to a meal afterward.

543
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:49,900
All the other ahjummas were envious of her, that she had a fabulous lifestyle.

544
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,810
I see.

545
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:58,340
But you know, when they all took a group trip, they would leave that ahjumma out.

546
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,040
Really?

547
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,080
Why?

548
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:06,750
That ahjumma was a red coat.

549
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,760
She was too busy working to get married.

550
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:21,290
Ji Ho, I just want to live an average life, like other people.

551
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:27,680
With a husband, with kids—that kind of ahjumma.

552
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:34,150
When I see the other friends, I want to talk about our in-laws together, and about raising our kids.

553
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:38,680
Now I just want to wear that kind of black coat.

554
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,350
So I don't stand out from other people, the same as other people.

555
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,350
Doing the same thing as other people,

556
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:53,470
talking together, laughing together,

557
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,260
that's my dream.

558
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:03,710
To me, marriage means that I am as good as everyone else,

559
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,740
that I have worth as a woman.

560
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,660
That's what a black coat says to me now.

561
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:19,410
Ho Rang was a kid for whom the color red was very well suited.

562
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,460
Gosh, why isn't she coming?

563
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,480
She'll probably come soon.

564
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,870
Ji Ho! Soo Ji!

565
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,320
Oh, I'm going home.

566
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,070
- No, wait!
- I'm leaving!

567
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,730
Hey, are you a stoplight?

568
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,740
What? It's pretty!

569
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,920
It's tacky, totally tacky.

570
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,730
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

571
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:47,800
A girl who was always confident even when she wore different colors than other people.

572
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,050
That's who Ho Rang was.

573
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,890
Kyung Hae Unni

574
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:25,870
When did we start being embarrassed to wear different colors than other people?

575
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:33,040
But what's even more upsetting…

576
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,800
One, two three!

577
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:42,060
is that for me, the feeling of wearing that black coat called marriage

578
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,620
was not bad after all.

579
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,330
No, if I were to be more honest...

580
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,570
Ji Ho, congratulations again on your marriage. Now that we're ahjummas together, let's see each other more often.

581
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,870
Yes, let's have a couples' gathering next time?

582
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,250
Welcome to married couple life!

583
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,320
I liked it,

584
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:10,230
that I somehow belonged now.

585
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:27,420
♫ Among so many hours ♫

586
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,770
♫ Those days that breezed us by ♫

587
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,420
What brings you here?

588
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,290
You said you were coming home on the bus in your text earlier.

589
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,760
It's really late,

590
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,810
and there was the situation with Bok Nam yesterday.

591
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:53,010
So, to be honest, I was a little worried—as a person who lives with you.

592
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:58,550
Ah, as a person who lives with me?

593
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,660
Yes.

594
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:09,210
A landlord's consideration? Something like that? Feeling protective of your tenant?

595
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:16,300
Well, more like a leader of a club taking care of its member, perhaps?

596
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,930
Ah.

597
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:20,760
Shall we go?

598
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,260
So you had a gathering with your former classmates?

599
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,300
Yes.

600
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:34,070
Honestly, it was a little strange, today.

601
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:39,290
They're not close friends,

602
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,240
but now that I'm married,

603
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:46,990
it feels like I've gotten closer to them,

604
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:51,260
the feeling of belonging to a group.

605
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:54,270
It's been a long time since I've felt that.

606
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,470
It feels…

607
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,670
It was nice, actually.

608
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:07,850
Now you're at the stage where you experience the sense of belonging.

609
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,350
- Huh?
- Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, a psychological theory.

610
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:15,290
When a human reaches one level of need, he naturally wants the next level.

611
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:17,400
Why suddenly?

612
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,620
Why would Maslow come up now?

613
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:21,970
It's not out of nowhere.

614
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:27,580
Ji Ho, your current state is when you're feeling your animalistic need most, as a human.

615
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:32,840
Ji Ho, through marriage, you have achieved the basic hierarchy of physiological needs.

616
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,830
Then through me, as your landlord, you've achieved the next hierarchy, safety needs.

617
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,880
Now the third hierarchy, social belonging.

618
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,910
You've naturally developed the need to belong somewhere.

619
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,200
So these feelings you are having,

620
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,660
they are nothing more than animalistic desires.

621
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,990
I only feel this every once in a while…

622
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:55,980
These are all instinctive, but ultimately futile desires of humans, of course.

623
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,630
He can be really obnoxious sometimes.

624
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,380
Why are you looking at me like that?

625
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:14,840
Stars in the sky tonight... There really aren't any.

626
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,680
Ah, I deposited my monthly rent today.

627
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,350
Yes, I've checked it.

628
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,180
Ho Rang, are you still sleeping?

629
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,860
Yeah.

630
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:14,610
Get up. It's already noon.

631
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:17,990
Just a little longer. I want to sleep in since today's my day off.

632
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:21,840
Hurry. It's sunny, so I want to hang up the blankets.

633
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,450
Why are you acting so busy since early this morning?

634
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:31,140
Stop scratching your head.

635
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,740
Rang, if you do that you'll get dandruff!

636
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,450
- What?
- Wow, these days

637
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:39,140
I guess since we've been together seven years now, you're really letting yourself go, huh?

638
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:45,100
You used to wash your hair as soon as you woke up, put on eyeliner, do it all. That's all gone now.

639
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:49,450
So now that it's been seven years, you're pretty full of yourself, huh?

640
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:54,020
Don't mess with me today! I'm not doing anything today, not even going to shower.

641
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,400
Wake up already.

642
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:05,150
Isn't that dirt under your nails? Oh, gross…

643
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,940
Rang! There's dirt under your fingernails, dirt!

644
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:13,120
Hey? I do not! How could I have dirt under my fingernails—

645
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,970
Where?

646
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,900
Just look at that.

647
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,260
What is this?

648
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,140
Ho Rang.

649
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,420
You know my favorite mathematician, Gödel?

650
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:35,970
His "incompleteness theorems" became the foundation for the development of today's computers.

651
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:43,800
What it says, among other things, is that there is truth that cannot be proven by mathematics.

652
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:51,660
I think that all this time, I wanted some sort of proof regarding you.

653
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,460
So what I realized is that

654
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:59,140
complete proof of our love is not possible.

655
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,660
Because it is such a perfect truth.

656
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,360
Do you know what I'm trying to say?

657
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:15,500
Do you think…

658
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,830
I would know?

659
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:23,340
Stop babbling crap and say it already.

660
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:31,320
From now on, I won't make you feel insecure and lonely anymore.

661
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:37,200
So, Ho Rang.

662
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,060
Will you please marry me?

663
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:49,350
♫ Though I endure a day like today ♫

664
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:56,530
♫ Living through each day that keeps coming back  ♫

665
00:50:56,530 --> 00:51:00,800
♫ The foolish things keep repeating ♫

666
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:08,360
♫ Alone I stand on one side ago for just in case  ♫

667
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:12,950
- Am I really getting married to you?
- Yes.

668
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:15,410
You really are.

669
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:20,400
How can this happen now? I have bedhead.

670
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,570
That's why I told you to shower, dummy.

671
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:31,210
♫ Like a movie, vain words  ♫

672
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,250
Huh?

673
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,750
Where is this water coming from?

674
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,120
What is this?

675
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:22,170
Alright, let's stop the meeting here.

676
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:27,420
Excuse me, Ms. Yoon Bo Mi! The CEO isn't finished talking. Please take a seat.

677
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:35,930
Everyone, I want to give you some great news.

678
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:39,660
I scouted a very talented developer.

679
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,350
- Daebak.
- Who is it?

680
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:46,610
Some of you may know him already. Who could it be?

681
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:49,690
Wake Alarm's CEO Sim Won Seok!

682
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:51,480
Applause!

683
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:56,200
What's with this atmosphere?

684
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:58,610
Follow me.

685
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:05,660
Alright, you all wrap up here.

686
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,660
Why on earth would they be against this?

687
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,260
Why would they?

688
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,960
Because Wake Alarm was a total failure.

689
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,880
If you're scouting him just because he is your friend,

690
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,960
then I concluded I should step up to represent all the employees.

691
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,990
Wow, Director Nam, do you think the CEO of your company is such a loser?

692
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:31,660
Won Seok may look plain on the outside, but he is a genius. Do you know about the incident of the '07 class?

693
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:35,300
You know, among the '07 freshman class,

694
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:41,940
someone made that site, "Find the Second Kim Tae Hee," and all the servers were overloaded and shut down?

695
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,070
- Ah.
- Right! That was none other than Won Seok.

696
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:47,730
Do you know how old he was that time? Eighteen.

697
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:52,800
Even though he started school early and was two years younger than the rest of his year,

698
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,770
he was the best of the best.

699
00:53:55,770 --> 00:54:01,940
Alright, Director Nam, I'll be honest. He's a bit weak when it comes to business sense.

700
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:05,040
But as a developer, he's really the best.

701
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,280
Director Nam. You believe me, right?

702
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:16,150
What is that expression? Like you're looking at a stray cat soaked by the rain?

703
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:17,880
It's not.

704
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,080
What's not?

705
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,250
I said it's not.

706
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:25,580
Do you know what the most annoying things in the world are?

707
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:30,020
Stopping shitting mid-shit. Or not wiping your shit completely. Or... someone who starts to say something, then stops.

708
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,780
Okay. Let's talk outside.

709
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,300
What do you mean, outside? It's cold outside.

710
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,520
Okay, then.

711
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:44,870
CEO Ma, you. Did you, by any chance,

712
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:46,620
cry?

713
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,890
Why would I cry?

714
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:57,540
What— Why would I cry?

715
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,140
After you cry, the rims of your eyes turn red.

716
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,160
The skin under your eyes is more sensitive than most people's.

717
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,670
What are you saying? It isn't red.

718
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:11,930
What do you know about my skin?

719
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:13,870
What do you know about me?

720
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:15,240
Sure.

721
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,410
Even if I've known you for 18 years,

722
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:21,100
I can't possibly say I know everything about you.

723
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,680
That's right. No matter how close we are, there's no way you could know everything about me.

724
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,920
Look. Because I have an allergy, it's always red here.

725
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,720
Why would I cry? It's just red.

726
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,150
You're right. No one completely knows even their own self.

727
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:38,050
Of course, we can't know everything about another person.

728
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,550
That's it.

729
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,640
But anyway.

730
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,700
What?

731
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:50,210
Why did you cry?

732
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:57,220
Wow, it looks like new.

733
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,430
Right?

734
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:03,980
But I still wanted to make sure it never got scratched until the day I parted with it.

735
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:06,250
Until the day you part with it?

736
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,290
What's this? Are you thinking of passing your bike on to someone else?

737
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:11,410
How much are you thinking of selling it for?

738
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,110
It's a secret.

739
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,670
He's ridiculously cute.

740
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:33,170
If we stay together, I might jump you.

741
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:37,590
It was Room 304, not Room 303. Our room.

742
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:40,910
I said I wanted to sleep with you. I never said I wanted to date you.

743
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:42,700
That's right.

744
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:47,870
I am very mean and bad. That is how I've made it this far.

745
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:04,330
CEO Ma.

746
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,130
Excuse me…

747
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:36,110
Are you crying?

748
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:39,420
Why...

749
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,040
Are you hurt somewhere?

750
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:53,040
CEO Ma!

751
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,810
Come here.

752
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:59,440
CEO! CEO!

753
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:02,050
He isn't here, either.

754
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,190
Then where did he go?

755
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,560
CEO?

756
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,690
If your employees find out that their CEO was crying,

757
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,470
that would be humiliating.

758
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:21,610
What's wrong? Are you really hurt somewhere?

759
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,730
Do you want me to take you to a hospital?

760
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,060
I thought about it.

761
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,520
My company, I can't do it.

762
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:32,840
What?

763
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,180
I really thought about it a lot.

764
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,960
I don't think I'll be able to sell my company.

765
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:49,700
But, if I don't sell my company,

766
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,140
that means I can't see you anymore.

767
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:01,100
My heart hurts so much.

768
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:07,940
If you really want to sleep with me, sell your company first.

769
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:10,680
Then I'll date you.

770
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:16,670
Then, because I said you should sell your company…

771
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:18,630
Really?

772
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:23,510
Love is important to me, but

773
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:27,830
my company is just as important to me as love is.

774
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:32,740
This is really embarrassing, but

775
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,600
when I think about not being able to see you...

776
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:51,480
You know what? Can I kiss you?

777
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:55,850
What?

778
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:58,080
Do what?

779
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,980
Can I kiss you?

780
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:06,250
Don't do it. I'm telling you I can't give my company up.

781
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,310
So, you don't want me to kiss you?

782
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:11,610
That's not what I mean, either.

783
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,910
Should I kiss you then?

784
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:18,430
Yeah.

785
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:23,440
♫ You are my everything ♫

786
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:29,140
♫ Be by my side every day, fall in love with me ♫

787
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:32,580
♫ Would you be my one love? ♫

788
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:37,080
We tend to misunderstand others most of the time.

789
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,360
♫ For all time ♫

790
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,120
"I know how you feel."

791
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,440
We must not say that.

792
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:53,240
♫ I’m in love with you ♫

793
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,300
Where did CEO Ma go?

794
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:01,440
Let's go to the café. I'll treat everyone to cake.

795
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:08,380
When I discover the limits of humans, such as in moments like this, that is when I feel hope.

796
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,830
Welcome!

797
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:16,180
♫ You are my everything ♫

798
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:19,170
If we don't make an effort,

799
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:23,200
then we can't understand each other.

800
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:28,910
♫ Just a little bit closer, put me in your warm embrace ♫

801
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:33,350
In such a world, this thing called love exists.

802
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:37,610
♫ I'm in love with you ♫

803
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:41,880
Hey CEO Sim, I heard you're going to work at Gyeolmalhae. Is that why you stopped our app project?

804
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,390
I'm the pathetic one for wasting two years believing in you.

805
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,570
We'll see how well you do.

806
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,510
Therefore, as long we love someone

807
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:54,340
we have to make that effort.
- Tada! I'm all ready!

808
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,830
How do I look? Pretty?

809
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:01,840
- Pretty.
- It's pretty, right?

810
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:07,540
Making that effort for someone else, that very act itself

811
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:11,710
is what makes our lives at all worth living.

812
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:25,290
Judging by how you keep reading that book, it must be fun to read.

813
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:28,900
Yeah. It's interesting.

814
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:34,040
You're still really angry, right?

815
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,410
About what?

816
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:41,760
Ah, because I thought a noona I worked with was cute, I wanted to YOLO with her, and nearly ended up going to prison?

817
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,680
I'm really sorry.

818
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,010
Still, just know that I took it easy on you because your fake husband was kind of cool.

819
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:53,440
To imagine I fell for those words. Noona, you found yourself a good landlord.

820
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,370
What words?

821
01:02:55,370 --> 01:03:00,140
I asked him, when he came to pay for the rearview mirror, why he married you.

822
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:03,350
And? What did he say?

823
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:23,740
♫ Let me briefly borrow your warm shoulder ♫

824
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:27,360
♫ Let me briefly borrow your warm shoulder ♫

825
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,370
♫ Please be a shelter for my tired soul ♫

826

♫ Please be a shelter for my tired soul ♫

827

♫ Let me briefly leave my wounded heart in your care ♫

828
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:45,070
Ah, why didn't CEO Ma come to the cafe today?

829
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:50,550
Ah, CEO Ma had another important matter to attend to.

830
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:55,640
I heard Won Seok is joining your company.

831
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,370
Yes, he'll probably be on my team.

832
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:01,580
I see.

833
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:08,340
Wow, there are a lot of stars in the sky.

834
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:16,150
Is that the Big Dipper?

835
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:29,280
♫ La la la la la la la, La la la la la la la ♫

836
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,580
♫ I quietly smile ♫

837
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,980
♫ Lalalala-lalala

838
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:58,170
What is that?

839
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:00,810
Our wedding pictures.

840
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:02,410
Oh!

841
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:09,510
They came out well! They totally slipped my mind.

842
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:13,910
My coworkers put it together as a wedding present.

843
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:21,850
It does look a bit empty, though.

844
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:24,510
You should have invited more friends.

845
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:29,010
In all honesty, I don't have a lot of friends.

846
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:30,740
Besides these two here.

847
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:33,150
Having two friends is still a lot.

848
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:37,040
It's not a lot.

849
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:40,610
I think that having even one is enough,

850
01:05:40,610 --> 01:05:42,950
a friend in your life.

851
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,130
That's how I think.

852
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:52,670
What about love?

853
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:59,120
What do you think about love?

854
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:01,920
For me,

855
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:07,690
I think that loving someone once in life would be enough.

856
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:16,910
Yes. I think like that, too.

857
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:22,110
In life, loving someone once…

858
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:25,580
would be enough.

859
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:33,760
Soo Ji said, when it comes to men and real estate agents, the more of them you meet, the better.

860
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,150
Ho Rang says the man you marry is your love

861
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:44,990
and destiny.

862
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:48,080
But, for me,

863
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:57,540
ever since I was little, I thought it would be nice, when it comes to love, to love just one person in this life.

864
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,540
That's how I thought.

What? Who?

874
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:01,710
My husband.

875
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:04,540
Hey, are you joking right now?

876
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:07,090
What's with you, Ji Ho, are you rubbing it in?

877
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:09,760
Then, I'm going to confess my love for Won Seok here.

This thing called marriage is so nice.

893
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:15,500
Having a one-sided crush on your husband probably isn't easy, Noona.

894
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,330
Is it that obvious?

895
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:21,030
- Is it because of this?
- Won Seok, your mentor is that person.

896
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:23,520
Will you be okay coming to this company?

897
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,190
I'm getting married!

898
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:28,360
You want a contract? For us to date?

899
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:30,570
I like you, CEO Ma. I want to date you.

900
01:09:30,570 --> 01:09:34,410
Hyung, you and Soo Ji? That is "unrecoverable application error," and a feeling like your life will be ruined.

901
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:37,530
- Sang Goo Oppa.
- How do you do all of this yourself?

902
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:39,930
My daughter-in-law is so precious. How can I ask her to work?

903
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:42,160
Ji Ho's starting her life with the in-law's too?

904
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:45,500
A way into that man's heart

905
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,660
does it even exist?
