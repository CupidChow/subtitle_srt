Because This Is My First Life

8
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,840
My family is having the annual kimchi-making ritual this week.

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,400
But your home is in Namhae. How could I . . .

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,990
That's not for me to figure out.

11
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,850
I'll text you the time and place.

12
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,560
You're up early.

13
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,790
Yes.

14
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,770
Red giseng extracts

15
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,760
That's my red ginseng.

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,940
This one's yours.

17
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,100
Oh.

18
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,600
Yes.

19
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,980
You're going out already?

20
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,490
Yes.

21
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,820
I've agreed to meet Bok Nam for breakfast. Together at the cafe.

22
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,030
I see.

23
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,970
Oh.

24
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,760
Our monthly rental agreement.

25
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,410
No.

26
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:01,090
Our monthly rental marriage contract. I am taking mine with me.

27
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,000
The other day your mother opened all the drawers here and there and everywhere.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,290
So I was going to keep mine at the cafe. It seems safer there.

29
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:13,010
Oh. She won't be coming anymore. I made it clear to her and I changed the passcode, too.

30
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:18,170
Yes. Conversations between mother and son aren't my business.

31
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,800
Just in case, I think it's best for you to leave yours at the company too, Landlord.

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,110
The contract, should it be seen by others, would be troublesome.

33
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,090
Yes.

34
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,520
Then...

35
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,490
Good job, Yoon Ji Ho. It was perfect.

36
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,500
I was completely emotionless.

37
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,900
Poker face.

38
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,690
She's properly pissed off. Right?

39
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,200
Huh?

40
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,010
Oh, why are you in there now?

41
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,250
Let's go out.

42
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,670
They are attacking us negatively outright.

43
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,110
They seemed to be playing off our "dating, not marriage" name.
New App Name: Never Mind Dating, Let's Marry

44
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,100
The issue is that it's working.

45
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,600
They're rated higher than us in the app store already. Barely a month after they launched.

46
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,410
So I saw that app,

47
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,690
and it even includes one's parent's jobs and yearly salaries.

48
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,390
That's working for the unexpectedly traditional children-conscious clientele.

49
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,740
Those who date with marriage in mind want a definitive relationship.

50
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,260
Chief Nam, what's your thought on this, regarding this urgent crisis?

51
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,740
The design concept

52
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,430
is excellent.

53
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,880
But if they had put that event banner on the bottom of the profile, it would've been much better.

54
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,400
Chief Nam?

55
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,150
We're not asking you to talk about your impression as a designer here.

56
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,910
Maybe it's time we also changed our main concept?

57
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,270
The premise of saying that the dating market and the marriage market are separate is in itself rather risky.

58
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,230
Uh-huh.

59
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,150
I think the app was named wrongly from the get-go. "Dating, not marriage?"

60
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,720
Who named this app?

61
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,360
The one who did that is the only one here who is married.

62
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,520
Then, let's continue the concept meeting tomorrow.

63
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,950
Whether we should continue to go with the current concept of dating only,

64
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,540
or if we should switch to a concept that includes marriage.

65
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,790
Let's meet again tomorrow after everyone has thought about it some more. Ok?

66
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,900
Yes.

67
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:46,620
Why did you come today? Then you should've refused after an appropriate amount of time.

68
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,590
Or said you had work.

69
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,570
Why, when you're someone who usually defends well?

70
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,460
Ji Ho, though this wasn't in our contract,

71
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,310
for today's unjustified labor you had to do,

72
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,380
I hope this can cover it.

73
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,610
Ha!

74
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,940
Is he Won Bin? What's with "how much will do?"
(Reference to drama, "Autumn's Tale.")

75
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,390
Did something happen with the landlord?

76
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,090
Hey, when did you...?

77
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,610
I read it, and it sounds pretty good. I think I should do a contract marriage too, later on.

78
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,630
You've got a house and you've got a motorcycle. Why would you?

79
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,220
Having a house and car is still completely different than having a person.

80
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,140
I feel lonely to be home alone nowadays.

81
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,190
You are at least less lonely since your husband is at home with you.

82
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,680
Hey, do you know why a husband is called 'nam-pyeon'?

83
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,800
It's because it means Nam (other's) Pyeon (side) that it's 'nampyeon'. There's an old saying, that goes like this:

84
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,130
"The porridge bowls, you have your daughter wash them."

85
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,570
"But you have your daughter-in-law wash the dishes that were used for mixing." (give daughter-in-law the more difficult task) Ha! Daughter-like daughter-in-law?

86
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:56,860
If that's what she wanted, then she should make me her foster daughter. Why did she take me as her daughter-in-law?

87
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,040
What's wrong?

88
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,740
Noona. You resemble someone I know so much right now.

89
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,910
Who?

90
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,420
My next-door ahjumma.

91
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,070
What?

92
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,510
That ahjumma, every day . . .

93
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,840
she speaks ill of her husband with that exact face.

94
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,450
How can your expression be exactly the same as hers?

95
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,720
You were so innocent when you first came to work here. But who would've thought I would end up seeing the ahjumma's face on you.

96
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,860
I think I'm just not going to get married.

97
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,430
I mean, the setup was wrong from the get-go.

98
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,040
Dating and not marriage? Even the name is so unaffectionate. It's too pessimistic.

99
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,460
- Yeah, that's true.
- I always thought that.

100
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,300
I said that before, too.

101
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,500
So, now,

102
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,140
I think it's right for our app to go with the concept of putting marriage front and center.

103
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,710
Yeah.

104
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,590
That's a good idea.

105
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,360
Everyone. Look at this.

106
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,160
Amidst this crisis, on a weekday, someone's applied for a day off.

107
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,440
Shall we try to guess who that was?

108
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,520
Not me.

109
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,940
Application for day off. Department? Design team.

110
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,070
Name? Nam Se Hee.

111
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,090
So it's Chief Nam.

112
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,350
I've got a personal reason. Inevitably, on a weekday.

113
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:38,020
Which company employee would have such personal, inevitable reason, on a weekday?

114
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,850
Kimjang. I need to go and do that.

115
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,240
Kimjang? (annual kimchi making ritual)

116
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,620
What's kimjang? Is it a newly developed program?

117
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,280
Do you mean kimjang as in making kimchi?

118
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,210
Yes. That kimjang.

119
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,590
How far are you going to make kimchi that you need a day off?

120
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,490
Namhae. My wife's home.

121
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,860
No, my in-laws' home. I need to go and make kimchi there.

122
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,070
I've never applied for a day off this year.

123
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,330
I request your speedy approval.

124
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,140
Our app name, I think it's best to leave it Dating, not Marriage, after all.

125
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,530
Yeah.

126
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,080
The name is just fine as is.

127
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,860
Yeah. Marriage sucks.

128
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,620
Getting married is something that scary. Won Seok-nim.

129
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,710
Episode 11
Because It's My First Time at Today's Ocean

130
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,820
Oh, Manager, you're on that app too? Gyeolmalrae?

131
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,710
No, my boyfriend works at this company, so I just installed it.

132
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,490
Really?

133
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,150
Oh. You got so many hearts.

134
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,070
Well, I'm on it just for fun anyway.

135
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,760
It's true. You'll be a married woman soon anyway.

136
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,430
Did you two set a date yet?

137
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,350
Huh?

138
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,030
We're still discussing that.

139
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,100
You guys all checked today's lunch reservations?

140
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,340
Yes.

141
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,070
Hello?

142
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,770
Yes, Mother.

143
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,240
Yes. Oh, you're here in Seoul?

144
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,550
What?

145
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,770
Right in front of my company? Yes, I'll come out now.

146
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,970
You should have dinner with Rang and I before you leave.

147
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,890
I need to go home and make dinner for her father. I've got some time before the bus leaves,

148
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,920
so I thought I'd come and look at my son-in-law's face instead of my daughter's.

149
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,240
Son-in-law?

150
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,320
I saw the picture and the rock on the ring is so big.

151
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,010
I think you overdid it?

152
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,990
No. I should get at least that much for Rang.

153
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,970
That's right.

154
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,020
She's my daughter, so I can say this.

155
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,940
These days, you can't find a girl like my Ho Rang.

156
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:34,790
Once you marry her, she's someone who'd manage your household and be a supportive wife to you. She learned it since she was little from watching me.

157
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,940
I know that.

158
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,010
Then . . .

159
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,430
About when do you plan to have the wedding?

160
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,290
What did your parents say?

161
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,990
That. Mother, I haven't told my family yet.

162
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,130
You should hurry and tell them. It's not so good to drag it out.

163
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:03,010
Rang, too. She can't live with Soo Ji in that apartment forever.

164
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,000
Right. Of course.

165
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,910
Seok, are you still living in that rooftop room?

166
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,100
Yes, I'm still staying there.

167
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,070
Does that place even have hot water? Is it wind-proof?

168
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,690
Yes, of course. It all works well.

169
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,710
Sim Wok Seok and Yang Ho Rang's bankbook

170
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,690
Rang, what do you mean getting married in a year or two? How can we marry in a year or two?

171
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,360
Why can't we get married in a year or two? We've saved up all this money, all this time.

172
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,100
I mean, the two of us saved up for two years at $500 each, every paycheck.

173
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,010
So that's $1,000 times 24 months. It's no less than . . .

174
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,610
Please take your bankbook.

175
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,300
It's no less than a lot!

176
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,940
Where did I take it off?

177
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,310
Maybe I didn't put one on at home at all?

178
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,300
Yes, Deputy Park.

179
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,590
Deputy Woo, what's taking so long? The food's coming out.

180
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,780
Yes, I'm coming.

181
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,380
I'll just leave on my coat.

182
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,740
This is good.

183
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,900
Eat a lot.

184
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,920
I'm sweating.

185
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,790
It's hot.

186
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,400
Deputy Woo, aren't you hot? You should take that off when you eat.

187
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,790
I'm alright.

188
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:07,310
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

189
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,310
It spilled. Wet wipe.

190
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,240
Give it to me. I'll wipe it.

191
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,530
I'm sorry. It was slippery.

192
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,800
I told you. She doesn't wear one. I told you so.

193
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,560
Give it. Give it. $50 each. Give it.

194
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,540
But how can she go around without a bra? Is that common for women these days?

195
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,400
She should be about a B cup, right?

196
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,380
B? B? No, no, no. A very full A.

197
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,310
- A very full A.
- How do you know that?

198
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:56,880
You just look and you know. I'm very accurate.

199
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,110
Seriously, if I just wasn't married,

200
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,100
Deputy Woo and I, together, huh!

201
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,170
I would . . .

202
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,610
Deputy Woo.

203
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,530
How long have you been there?

204
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,350
Can you give me a light?

205
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,430
So you do smoke.

206
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,720
Did you win a lot?

207
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,840
Your betting on me being a no-bra.

208
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,310
I'm a very full A cup, as you can see, so it was pretty obvious, huh?

209
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,250
Deputy Park, I think you're the same size as me.

210
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,160
Let me know if you don't plan to shed some weight by working out. I'll lend you mine.

211
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,670
Put that away. That gaze that doesn't reveal your intention.

212
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,550
You know I dislike that.

213
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,070
What exactly happens when you marry?

214
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,490
Your impenetrable IT world,

215
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,260
how did kimjang and aday-off penetrate it? Through what route?

216
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,870
Well, it's something that could be expected.

217
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:30,340
"Seaworld" (in-law-world) started and I plan to pay that back the same way with labor.

218
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:35,010
She was summoned to my family's memorial service. Ji Ho was.

219
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,270
I got it. You know Byeong Moon, right? Eom Byeong Moon?

220
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,570
After the Thanksgiving holiday, he needs to take care of his wife for a month like a slave.

221
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,300
Why? Because she says she doesn't even want to even look at anyone with the last name Eom.

222
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,580
So if he gets kicked out, then he will lie on the sofa in the living room.

223
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,360
Then, when his parents show up, he'll go, "Ehem," and put on the 'head of the household' act again.

224
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,880
I really don't know what that is.

225
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,780
That's nothing other than the social disease created by Korean parents.

226
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,740
Inflict physical labor upon other people's kids with 'family' as their pretext.

227
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,950
And also demand psychological labor, then in return, have that all come back to them as their children's spousal fights, then divorce.

228
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,810
For a rational-thinking human being

229
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,880
it's a system that they would never choose. That is marriage.

230
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,970
So, never...

231
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,690
But how come someone like you chose that system?

232
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,910
It's really very shocking, isn't it?

233
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,540
A left-brain-loan and right-brain-cat guy like you. Why would you choose such an irrational system?

234
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,710
I mean, is your wife the cat's butler? Or are you getting rent from your wife, maybe?

235
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,250
I mean, it's very questionable.

236
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,980
She's pretty.

237
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,240
No matter how pretty she is, still . . .

238
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,700
Did you forget? She's pretty, I said.

239
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,100
A man is an animal with what weakness?

240
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,570
- Sight?
- So if a pretty woman is in front of him,

241
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,000
- does he look at her or not?
- He does.

242
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,200
Then, if that man can see that pretty woman every day, does he marry or not marry?

243
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,670
He marries no matter what.

244
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,050
That's right. So you understand it.

245
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,420
I'm at Oppa's company's side entrance parking lot. Run here within twenty minutes.

246
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,040
I really need to work off my frustration today, so be prepared.

247
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,350
- Hey, you go in first. I'll see you tomorrow.
- CEO Ma, you said you had an important meeting today.

248
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:35,880
An even more important meeting came up. Is that the side entrance?

249
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,770
No. The side entrance is this way.

250
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,170
See you later.

251
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,370
Oh, sorry. I'm so busy, though.

252
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,430
Sorry. See you tomorrow. See you later.

253
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,680
Ta-da. Hello, my baby.

254
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,010
I got it. I got it, so let's eat first before we go on our date.

255
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,310
I told you. I need to work off my frustration today.

256
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,450
What?

257
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,980
Something must have happened at work today.

258
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,170
Nope. What happened?

259
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:33,160
What? Nothing happened. For real.

260
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:41,120
Tell me. I mean, please tell me. Something happened, right?

261
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,820
Just something irritating happened.

262
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,520
The male employees made bets on me.

263
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,970
- What kind of a bet?
- They bet on whether I'm no-bra or not. For $50.

264
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,620
What?

265
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,550
Those bastards.

266
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:03,840
Forget it. I already threw them a punch.

267
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,870
- How?
- I threw the my cigarette butt in that bastard Deputy Park's coffee cup, like this.

268
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,200
Oh, those bastards are making me crazy.

269
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,210
I will seriously earn lots of money and buy your company, so those employee bastards,

270
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,980
I'll enslave them for my entire life.

271
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,620
Those punks. Is that something to bet on? How can they take a person so lightly?

272
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,320
I mean, what woman goes to her work in a no-bra state?

273
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,440
Me.

274
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,880
- What?
- Me. I am no-bra today.

275
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,310
Really?

276
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,310
Yeah, what?

277
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,280
I'm on my way home already!

278
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,150
Did you eat dinner?

279
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,050
Would I have eaten? At this hour?

280
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:23,080
No. I'll eat at home.

281
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,550
I haven't either. Should we eat something out together?

282
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,910
What? Eat out?

283
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,840
Why eat out, when we're both tight on funds?

284
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,560
- I'll just eat at home . . .
- Just take out what's in the fridge and stuff yourself!

285
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,630
He should think about what he does before he suggests eating out!

286
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,110
Oh, he's not a husband, he's my mortal enemy.

287
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,780
Oh, why did I get married?

288
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,340
Noona, you resemble someone I know a lot right now.

289
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,450
- Who?
- My next door ahjumma. She is always speaking ill of her husband with that exact face.

290
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:05,010
How come even the expression is the same?

291
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,760
What? "Isn't it enough that I earn money for you?

292
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,520
That paltry little supplement to our living costs?

293
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,940
But he acts like a big shot about it all year long. Ah, he disgusts me.

294
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,720
Aigoo, he makes my skin crawl.

295
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,350
Oh. I took tomorrow off work.

296
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:54,440
Oh. Did you?

297
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,040
Yes. If you let me know the Namhae home address, I'll get there in time for kimchi making.

298
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,620
Yes. I'll send it to you. The address.

299
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:13,440
Oh, but I can't go tomorrow.

300
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,840
Yes, I know. You need to work at the cafe.

301
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:25,670
You went to my family's memorial rite alone so I should go to your family's kimchi-making alone too.

302
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,550
Six hours of labor. I'll fulfill the same time that you put in, and return home.

303
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:38,580
Oh. That contract. Did you take it and store it at work?

304
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,980
Oh. No. I will keep it in my bag.

305
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,290
CEO Ma tends to dig through my paperwork in the desk sometimes.

306
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,070
So it's safer this way, I think.

307
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,760
I see. Yes, we can't have CEO Ma know. That'll be bad.

308
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,120
Right. We can't.

309
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,280
Then, Soo Ji will know too.

310
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,400
What?

311
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,330
Did you not know?

312
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:07,320
That CEO Ma and Soo Ji are dating?

313
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,960
They're dating? I mean, how did CEO Ma and Soo Ji end up together?

314
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,260
That's what I mean. Human beings are really fascinating.

315
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:22,130
They do not suit each other at all. How can they be dating?

316
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,510
What is he saying?

317
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,160
We even got married.

318
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,320
No-bra? My girlfriend is a no-bra?

319
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,860
Other people would see them.

320
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,510
You think others don't know, right? But, when they look, they know right away.

321
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,330
If they look, it's their fault. Is it my fault?

322
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,600
The one who did the looking is the one at fault. Very bad! But!

323
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,980
Tell me honestly. Has this happened before when you went to work, too?

324
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,810
Yeah, a few times.

325
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,690
When I'm working away from the office, I take my bra off and there are times when I forgot to put it back on.

326
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,710
My God!

327
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,890
You're crazy!

328
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,470
If I were crazy I'd go around completely naked.

329
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,610
You can't help but talk back on everything!

330
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,320
I'm telling you to understand me! I don't like it! I don't!

331
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,760
Why are you this angry?

332
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,420
Woo Soo Ji, you don't hear the voice of my heart right now?

333
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,970
This honest heart that loves and worries for his girlfriend?

334
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,520
Not sure. It sounds to my ears like you're trying to wrap your own possessiveness as affection

335
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,560
to rationalize your behavior. Why is that?

336
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,870
Why? Why is this sounding like that to you?

337
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:03,120
This is different from what the contract said. Why are you intervening in my personal life?

338
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,020
Oh, you did well mentioning it. You know what you wrote in the contract, right?

339
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,530
Look. Is this personal life? Huh?

340
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,780
What's this contract? It's weird.

341
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,120
So now, where did you get that bad habit of trying to dodge out of it, huh?

342
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,820
Look here. Our two year term of tenancy marriage contract.

343
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,640
This, what is this?

344
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,880
What is this?

345
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,520
Dating Contract

346
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,240
Ji Ho. Oh.

347
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,920
You should look at this.

348
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,670
What is this? Dating contract?

349
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:13,260
Yes. It seems to be a dating contract between CEO Ma and Soo Ji.

350
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,640
What did I say? They're not a good match for each other.

351
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,680
And, look here.

352
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,580
Soo Ji is the owner, and CEO Ma is the contractor.

353
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,990
Oh, so it's true. Wow, this girl...

354
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:33,280
Why would anyone write a contract for dating?

355
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,740
I guess we're not in the position to comment on this, though.

356
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,600
But how did you end up getting this?

357
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,020
Oh, I bumped into CEO Ma earlier.

358
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,070
Our things got mixed up. So, I ended up bringing this.

359
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,770
Oh, they got mixed up.

360
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,980
It's not as if this was switched with our contract, though, right?

361
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,350
Yes, they did.

362
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,980
Two Year Tenancy Marriage Contract

363
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,800
It hasn't been that long, and already marriage?

364
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,850
There are a lot of people who get married after just two to three months.

365
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,620
Since earlier, why have you kept referring to your husband as your landlord?

366
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,440
- I did?
- A part-time job? Why?

367
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,250
Oh, I need to work for the monthly ren—

368
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,820
I have to pay off daily expenses and my phone bill.

369
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,910
Yoon Ji Ho, that nutcase!

370
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,580
What did you want to give me this late at night?

371
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:05,560
Last time, the marinated crab my mom sent.

372
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,870
She gave me this to share with others. I haven't given you yours yet.

373
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:16,270
Thanks. I better get in touch with your mom. She's doing well, right?

374
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,210
- Yeah, of course.
- She's not feeling unwell?

375
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:21,010
No, she's fine.

376
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,980
- She knows you married for housing, too?
- Yeah, of...

377
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,360
The monthly rent is ₩250,000.

378
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,140
Hey, you can't find a room that cheap these days.

379
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,650
Soo Ji, that...

380
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:38,670
Two years later, if you're okay with it, can I go in next, as your husband's next bride?

381
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,170
- Hey!
- What?

382
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,770
You're the one who did it.

383
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,660
Aiyoo, crazy girl.

384
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,020
You crazy punk.

385
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:59,680
Still. No matter what the case, how? Marriage?

386
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,110
Well, human beings have various ways

387
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,840
of living their lives.

388
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,450
But how, for a home? For rent, of all things?

389
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,310
For a home, you say?

390
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:23,960
For such a mere thing as rent? But that "home" is so important.

391
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,780
"Money"... can be such a scary thing.

392
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,340
To me, it was just a spare room that I had.

393
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,510
But to her, it was a room that she really needed. A desperate space.

394
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,010
So I just shared it using a suitable system.

395
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:52,480
Well, I also needed the money.

396
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,850
When you saw Ji Ho,

397
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,660
you thought of her?

398
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,240
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you that it was a fake marriage.

399
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,480
Of course, you wouldn't be able to tell me. How could you tell anyone?

400
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,750
And why are you sorry to me?

401
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,090
You're the one who has it tough.

402
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,480
Are you really okay?

403
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,350
Yeah. This is what I chose.

404
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:56,010
For me, it always take me a while to make the decision,

405
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:00,550
but once I choose, you know I don't usually regret it.

406
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,120
But it doesn't seem like simple business.

407
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:10,210
This marriage, to you I feel it's not just some work transaction.

408
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,590
Ji Ho, your husband, no...

409
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,590
I mean, your landlord, you like him.

410
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,910
There's someone I like.

411
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:27,440
- What are you saying?
- Huh? Who?

412
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,470
My husband.

413
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,660
I don't think you liked him from the beginning.

414
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,410
Did you start to like him while living with him?

415
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:42,410
♫ On the fading small paper I've written them ♫

416
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,310
No, that's not it.

417
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,870
Maybe I liked him from the beginning?

418
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,080
I don't know when, exactly.

419
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,950
What about him?

420
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,160
Does he like you, too?

421
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,200
♫ I can't even hide it ♫

422
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,010
♫ Like today ♫

423
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,110
No.

424
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,710
He doesn't know

425
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,210
that I like him.

426
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,430
♫ The foolish things keep repeating ♫

427
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:25,200
♫ And I am standing alone on a side alone again ♫

428
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,240
♫ Just in case tomorrow ♫

429
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,990
♫ might be different ♫

430
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,420
Even a heart should have a path to it.

431
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,510
♫ I can't ♫

432
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,520
If there's a path,

433
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:56,450
that path clearly should have a starting point.

434
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,120
Ho Rang!

435
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,050
Ho Rang! Tada!

436
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,610
Oh, you made it?

437
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,660
Wow, I'll deposit it right away too. $500.

438
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,100
Seok, let's really put in $500 each a month as we promised.

439
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,060
We will save up diligently and when we move out in three years, let's find a better place. Okay?

440
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,920
Okay.

441
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,480
But we've got $1,000 in there already!

442
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,200
At this point, we might end up buying a house with a yard.

443
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,930
I prefer an apartment.

444
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:29,270
If you want an apartment . . .

445
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,740
Okay, apartment it is!

446
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,910
Deposit records (Yang Ho Rang made most of the deposits)

447
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,390
I finally feel at ease.

448
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,930
Even now isn't too soon if you want to have kids and raise them.

449
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:14,150
So you can't make our Ho Rang suffer, okay?

450
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,280
Yes, Mother.

451
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:25,780
Your present for getting a job. Work hard and for a long time at the company.

452
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:30,820
Don't ever think about developing something by yourself again. Okay?

453
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,480
Yes. Thank you for this.

454
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,350
Alright.

455
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,490
If there's a place where emotions start,

456
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,010
then clearly somewhere

457
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:11,480
there must be a place for them to meet.

458
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,930
Rang, are you asleep?

459
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:33,350
You came? You're late.

460
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,180
You smell like soju.

461
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,220
I drank a little.

462
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:46,230
Rang, should we go on a date this weekend?

463
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,270
Date?

464
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:51,970
Yep, a date.

465
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:56,210
It's been a while since we've gone out, eaten delicious food,

466
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,920
and watched a movie.

467
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:04,700
Didn't you say there was a play that you wanted to see?

468
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,170
I'll reserve the tickets.

469
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,060
Okay. Let's do that.

470
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,060
Okay. Let's do that.

471
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,490
At the place where our hearts meet

472
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:44,240
will it be possible to start on another path?

473
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,300
But the thing I'm most afraid of

474
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,270
isn't that your path and mine are different

475
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:01,260
or that our paths will never meet.

476
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,160
It's that to your heart

477
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:10,590
I spoke with CEO Ma. I'll sleep first.

478
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,450
there is no path at all.

479
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:18,650
There might not be a way to your heart

480
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:25,270
in the first place. That's what I'm afraid of.

481
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,770
I received the address.

482
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,870
I will go make kimchi and return.

483
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,230
But for now,

484
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,830
I can't do anything about it.

485
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,490
Even if I don't know the path to his heart,

486
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:46,770
he knows the path to go make kimchi. And this man...

487
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:53,940
♫ please be a shelter for my tired soul ♫

488
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,100
I've ended up liking him.

489
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,860
For now,

490
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,880
that is enough.

491
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,110
♫ give it a quick glance as you pass by ♫

492
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:13,210
Oh, is that all? On kimchi-making day, will just a few bottles of rice wine be enough?

493
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,540
You need to buy a big barrel of it. Yes!

494
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,110
Okay, got it.

495
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:23,600
Ji Seok will be here with his wife soon.

496
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,290
Is making kimchi some national event? How can you tell your pregnant daughter-in-law to come?

497
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:31,000
When did Ji Ho say she will be here?

498
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,650
When would Ji Ho have the time to be doing this?

499
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,180
She's busy trying to make a living in Seoul.

500
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,050
She's a stay-at-home wife, why would she be busy?

501
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:42,100
And shouldn't she learn how to make kimchi since she is married?

502
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,910
Really! Well...

503
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,930
Ji Ho, what's going on?

504
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,340
Oh, you're coming?

505
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,380
Yeah, he's coming in a bit to help you.

506
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,970
How can you come here during a weekday?

507
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:03,540
No, I can't go. Wait, and he'll arrive soon.

508
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,810
Who are you saying is coming here?

509
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,970
It's cold, close the window!

510
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,860
♫ La la la. While thinking of you ♫

511
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:47,590
♫ La la la. I smile quietly. ♫

512
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:51,640
♫ Unknown to anyone, I, unknown to anyone ♫

513
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,850
♫ draw countless stars ♫
Your in-law's home is not this way.

514
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,090
Rerouting.

515
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:03,720
♫ Unknown to anyone, I, unknown to anyone ♫

516
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,780
Goodness, you sure have big hands (prepare or give out large amounts of food).

517
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,540
Why did you buy 100 heads of cabbage, anyway? You don't even have enough workers to go through it all!

518
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,510
Oh, don't worry.

519
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,130
It'll be done by the time your husbands come by to eat pork wraps.

520
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,600
But did Ji Ho say she's not coming?

521
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,330
- Ji Ho?
- Yes.

522
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,100
Right,

523
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,180
she said someone else was coming instead.
- Who?

524
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,660
- Excuse...
- I don't know, she told me to wait.

525
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,430
Excuse me! Hello.

526
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:45,450
Oh, Se Hee?

527
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:48,070
How come you're here, Son-in-law Nam?

528
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,900
- Yes.
- He's Ji Ho's husband!

529
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,880
- He's good-looking.
- Very good-looking.

530
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,540
He looks fine.

531
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,610
- Maybe he should be your groom.
- Sounds good to me!

532
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,820
Gosh, just work already.

533
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,610
The neighborhood became brighter!

534
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:08,040
I came to help with making kimchi.

535
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:12,150
Then when she said someone was coming—

536
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,750
- Yes, it was me.
- Who's here?!

537
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:19,050
Oh, our son-in-law! Wow!

538
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,000
Right, what brings you here?

539
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,280
I came to make kimchi.

540
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,270
Make kimchi?

541
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:28,940
Yes.

542
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:34,130
Good that you came. Come right in.

543
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:38,790
Come in. Once the kimchi is made, let's eat pork wraps.

544
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,950
- Sit.
- No,

545
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:44,930
I didn't come to eat pork wraps, but to help make kimchi.

546
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,390
I must make kimchi.

547
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,310
Truthfully, Ji Ho helped with the ancestral rites at

548
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:00,450
my parents' house a few days ago. So we settled on exchanging

549
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,440
the same amount of labor and effort.

550
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:07,140
What nonsense is that? It's expected for the daughter-in-law to help prepare the rites!

551
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,190
Did she? Ancestral rites?

552
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,170
Yes.

553
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:15,100
Don't speak nonsense and sit!

554
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,690
Have a drink with me.

555
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:20,720
Can you make kimchi wearing those clothes?

556
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,050
If you're going to do it, you need to change first.

557
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:25,270
Shall I give you my work clothes?

558
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,860
Yes, I would be grateful if you gave them to me.

559
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,380
Okay.

560
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,430
I arrived safely.

561
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:55,020
I will start to make kimchi now.

562
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,480
Anything the matter?

563
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,440
Nope.

564
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,090
It's Soo Ji Noona.

565
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:11,850
She's pretty today too. Totally my style.

566
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,530
What?

567
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:24,280
Nothing, you very quickly change

568
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,880
who your style is.

569
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,140
You used to tell me I was so pretty.

570
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,750
I just thought you were a little cute.

571
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,050
You're not my style originally.

572
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:49,280
What? He went to make kimchi?

573
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,510
Mhm.

574
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:55,480
Wow, you're something else, but your landlord husband is the real piece of work.

575
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,030
Well, that's probably why you two made a contract like that.

576
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,970
What if he gets so fatigued that he can't even come back?

577
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,950
Your mom probably bought at least 100 heads of cabbage, right?

578
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:09,470
Nah, my family would not make their son-in-law work that hard.

579
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:12,550
He'll probably eat some pork wraps and come back.

580
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:16,110
You already know she won't really make him make kimchi.

581
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:23,820
Timer: 6:00:00 hours

582
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,400
- Pretty stressful, huh?
- Yes.

583
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,030
These have been soaked in brine, so they're really salty.

584
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,250
- Soaked... in... brine?
- That's right.

585
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,800
Then, without letting the other seasonings touch them,

586
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,810
swish them several times in plain water,

587
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:28,380
shake off the water, and put them in there,

588
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,600
and it's done. Understand?

589
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,910
Do this in plain water,

590
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:36,910
after the water drips off, put it... in there?

591
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,980
Yeah, try it.

592
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:51,480
Don't do it limply like that.

593
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,010
With energy, like this, like this.

594
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,260
Yes, energy.

595
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,240
What will you do, when your son-in-law is so weak?

596
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,090
If he keeps this up, would you ever even see your grandchild?

597
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:08,460
Aigoo, don't you know that the skinny ones are better at those things?

598
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,470
Be quiet.

599
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:15,670
Watch what you say in front of my son-in-law.

600
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:34,270
Aigoo, please wipe it one more time. (dialect meaning"wipe" = homonym of "steal")

601
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:37,030
You want me to... steal it?

602
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:40,250
No, like this. She means to do it like this.

603
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:44,000
Ah, yes. Like this.

604
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,010
I mean, just one more time,

605
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:49,090
rinse it. With energy.

606
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:53,280
Oh, what will we do with him?

607
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,980
Why are you beating my son-in-law on his back like that?

608
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,460
Huh? What is this?

609
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,960
He's really making kimchi.

610
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,680
What is this? Why are they hitting him?

611
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,180
Ah, Psycho Ahjumma. This is no joke.

612
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,650
I'd like to order, please.

613
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,550
Yes.

614
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,410
I'll take the order, you can go.

615
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:39,000
- Go where?
- To your husband.

616
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,420
If you're so worried about him, hurry and go.

617
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,020
Instead, come in and work all weekend and cover my shifts, okay?

618
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,660
Aigoo, like this, we will be working all night.

619
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:03,190
Do it a little better, like this.

620
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:19,990
Huh?

621
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:22,270
Huh?!?

622
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,570
Son-in-law Nam!

623
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:54,660
- Yes!
- Come here and squeeze these cabbages.

624
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,380
Why's he squatting there next to the fire?

625
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,210
Wow, Brother-in-law really came to make kimchi, huh?

626
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:08,370
He is truly weird.

627
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:11,450
Squeeze it well.

628
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:19,100
I put food in Kitty's bowl...

629
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,530
but where is she?

630
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:25,730
Kitty? Kitty?

631
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:31,690
You were here?

632
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,870
You're here? When did you come in here?

633
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,390
Aigoo, you caused trouble, huh?

634
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:54,610
Oh, I really wanted to read this book.

635
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,930
It would be all right if I borrowed this, right?

636
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:05,020
I'll read it with great care and make sure to return it, okay?

637
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:17,180
To. My Everything. My love Se Hee. 2005.12.24
From: Your Everything

638
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:22,430
To. My Everything. My love Se Hee. 2005.12.24
From: Your Everything

639
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:31,740
So this book was a gift from someone.

640
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:50,460
That's enough now. You can go inside.

641
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:54,160
No, there is still time left before I fulfill my promise.

642
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,020
Since I took leave from work today, I have to finish it.

643
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,850
Son-in-law Nam, are you all right?

644
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,260
Yes.

645
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:06,420
Noona.

646
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:17,870
♫ You are my everything, be by my side everyday, fall in love ♫

647
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:26,080
♫ I'm in (love you, love you, love you) love with you, every day ♫

648
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:34,700
What's up? You were screaming and throwing fits last night.

649
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:42,690
What is this? Are you going to shut down your app and start selling underwear?

650
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:45,750
I bought the most comfortable design from all the brands around.

651
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:49,970
At least one of them should fit you, I hope. So just try it, please.

652
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:55,490
If it's still uncomfortable, I will do whatever I can to find another one for you.

653
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:57,650
Something that you find comfortable.

654
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:03,830
If it felt like I was giving you pressure, or that I was butting in,

655
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:06,970
I am really sorry. I'll do my best to fix that.

656
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:11,600
But please be a little more considerate towards me.

657
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,630
And to be honest, I can dislike it.

658
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:20,930
That someone would continue to stare at my woman, and think impure thoughts,

659
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:23,240
I can dislike that.

660
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:28,090
All right. I am sorry for only thinking of it as you butting in.

661
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:33,350
And so you just turn off your phone?!? Think about how anxious that would make me feel!

662
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,590
I turned it off because of a work meeting.

663
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,480
Wait just one hour. Then let's have dinner together.

664
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,110
- Dinner?
- Stay in this area, okay?

665
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,750
Aish, I'm so happy I can die.

666
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:11,270
Thank you.

667
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,380
Are you all right?

668
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:21,010
Your shoulders and your back, how do you feel?

669
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:25,850
Well, it aches a little, but I'm sure it will be fine in a little while.

670
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:32,490
No, before it gets worse, I'll go to the pharmacy and buy some medicine and pain relief patches.

671
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,960
Ji Ho.

672
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:40,070
Why did you come here? What about your job at the cafe?

673
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:45,570
Ah, I took care of it so there won't be problems. You don't have to worry.

674
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:53,320
Did you come... because you were worried about me?

675
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:58,090
Yes.

676
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,030
I see.

677
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:08,100
I was very glad to see you when you came.

678
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:13,530
Thank you.

679
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:31,150
Namhae Pharmacy

680
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,930
Book Title: Island

681
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,400
That someone is coming to visit
(Poem: "Guest" by Jun Hyeon Jong)

682
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,280
is a tremendous thing.

683
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:17,740
That person's past, his present,

684
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:21,890
and his future

685
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:24,130
are all coming along with him.

686
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:29,730
Because his entire life is coming with him.

687
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,400
Because it is fragile,

688
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,000
it may have already been broken before...

689
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,400
that heart of his is coming.

690
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,090
To your heart

691
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:50,270
what path is there?

692
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,500
I was curious.

693
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,600
Yoon Ji Ho!!!

694
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,800
And the moment I learned of the path
[Farewell. Return and live as if nothing has happened. Instead, never love again, because you do not have the right to love again.]

695
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:35,010
the reason my heart hurt so much

696
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:37,460
was not because of jealousy

697
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:43,030
or despair.

698
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:47,140
Twelve years ago, on this very same day

699
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,070
2005/12/24. It's Christmas Eve! To celebrate Christmas, we said our wishes for our futures. Soo Ji, president of her own company!!! Ho Rang, good wife, wise mother!!! And me ... Love? Heh heh heh.

700
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:51,670
I dreamed of love

701
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:52,840
Farewell. Return and live as if nothing has happened. Instead, never love again, because you do not have the right to love again.

702
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:59,600
and you ended your love. That truth

703
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:06,840
made me a bit sad.

704
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:13,340
All right, drink up! Yes.

705
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:22,040
Aigoo, my son-in-law. You worked hard today.

706
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,710
Accept a drink from me.

707
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,880
Have you seen such a son-in-law anywhere?

708
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,450
A son-in-law who comes all this way to his in-laws' home to help make kimchi?

709
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:38,950
Aigoo, you must be so henpecked by your wife.

710
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:42,250
How can a man come to his in-laws' home to make kimchi?

711
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,300
Henpecked? Goodness, no.

712
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,980
If a man has a pretty bride, he would even bow to a wooden post, they say.

713
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,330
So think about how pretty our Ji Ho is, that he would do this for her?

714
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:55,410
Aigoo, look at her, boasting about her daughter!

715
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:59,190
Is that right? You came all this way because your bride is so pretty to you?

716
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:00,910
Hurry and answer me!

717
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:06,450
Yes. She is so pretty. Yes, you are right.

718
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:08,330
Goodness, I like you, boy.

719
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:10,520
Accept another drink from me.

720
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:13,290
Uh... I already have some.

721
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:16,520
What are you doing? You should empty that quickly and accept a drink from me!

722
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,030
Yes.

723
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,520
Drink it.

724
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:31,260
Drink it!

725
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:33,910
Yes.

726
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,910
Drink it!

727
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:41,230
Brother-in-law! Come here please!

728
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:42,570
Yes!

729
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:45,720
- Is it urgent?
- Yes, yes, yes!

730
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:55,710
All right, let's drink up.

731
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:58,810
Are you all right? You drank a lot.

732
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:00,900
I wouldn't say I'm alright.

733
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,570
I am not. I'm only a few more drinks away from reaching my limit.

734
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:10,520
Where did this house's son-in-law go?

735
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,900
Hurry! Hurry!

736
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,050
If you get caught by that ajusshi then there's no way out.

737
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:24,910
If you just drink what he gives you, then you will die.

738
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:27,530
You should have given me that important information ahead of time.

739
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:30,150
What about Unni? Did she go somewhere?

740
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:34,400
Ah! She went to buy medicine for me and she still hasn't come back.

741
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,670
Then don't come right home. Go and take a walk.

742
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:41,930
That's right. Call Unni and enjoy a date together.

743
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:42,990
Yes.

744
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:46,680
Let's go.

745
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,400
Do you know this is the first time that we are eating together?

746
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,210
Is that so?

747
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,080
We ate together that last time, before we went elsewhere.

748
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,420
Ate what?

749
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:19,100
We just drank rice wine. You were the one who drank six bottles and got drunk. Aiyoo.

750
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,820
Rice wine is rice so isn't that considered eating?

751
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:26,160
From now on, let's eat together like this

752
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,970
at least three times a week. That's an order.

753
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:31,280
Why whine about eating?

754
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,500
You know how important a meal is, right?

755
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,950
Do you think people say stuff like "rice strength" and "rice affection" for nothing?

756
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:40,760
There's nothing like a meal to nourish mutual attachment.

757
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,440
Well...

758
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,350
That's why Ji Ho fell.

759
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:48,150
Huh? Where would sister-in-law fall?

760
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,990
That...

761
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:56,910
Ji Ho fell for her landlord.

762
01:01:56,910 --> 01:02:00,550
My friend likes your friend.

763
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:05,110
Don't tell your friend.

764
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:08,010
It seems like she likes him one-sidedly.

765
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,960
Is it really one-sided?

766
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:17,770
What?

767
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:20,970
Would Se Hee really not know

768
01:02:20,970 --> 01:02:23,490
that Ji Ho likes him?

769
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,830
Ms. Ji Ho!

770
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:39,520
Ms. Ji Ho!

771
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,890
Ms. Ji Ho!

772
01:03:23,770 --> 01:03:26,190
That Ji Ho likes him?

773
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:32,200
Then what about Mr. Se Hee? What does he feel towards Ji Ho?

774
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:41,480
This place tastes good. It must be newly harvested rice.

775
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:46,150
Jeez! Ji Ho is a mo-sol. She doesn't know anything!
(Mo-sol: abbrev. of Mo-tae Sol-o, or single since birth)

776
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:48,780
I'm so worried.

777
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:58,640
Se Hee must be scared since he knows.

778
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:04,470
Since he knows what love is...

779
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:09,140
maybe Se Hee could be more scared because of it?

780
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:22,060
You should have declined the rice wine.

781
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:27,100
Someone who is usually good at declining things, why can't you, in that situation?

782
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:33,200
Why?

783
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,650
This must be how you felt.

784
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:39,710
When I asked why you went to my family's memorial service.

785
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,450
This regrettable feeling.

786
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:56,550
It's nice, the sea. It's been a long time.

787
01:04:56,550 --> 01:05:00,470
Me too. The sea...

788
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:03,770
it's my first time.

789
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:09,560
Besides my family and friends,

790
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,670
coming to see the beach with someone else.

791
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:15,970
With a man...

792
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:20,620
It's my first time seeing it.

793
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:29,050
Unexpectedly, you have a lot of things you haven't done.

794
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:32,010
That's right.

795
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:36,810
I was constantly busy in my 20s.

796
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:40,020
That's why I...

797
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,930
have a lot of things I haven't done yet.

798
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:46,080
That's why I also have a lot of things I don't know.

799
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,620
I...

800
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:53,380
liked a poem when I was in my 20s.

801
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:56,980
In that poem, it says this.

802
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,920
When a person comes

803
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:04,120
that person's entire life comes with him.

804
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:09,140
It's fragile, so it may have already been broken,

805
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,320
that heart has come.

806
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:16,310
When I liked that poem

807
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:20,400
I didn't know what it meant.

808
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,890
When I found out what it meant,

809
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,940
I could no longer enjoy that poem.

810
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,250
Once you know something,

811
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:33,700
there are many things you can no longer do. That is life.

812
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,520
That's why I...

813
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,650
am envious of you, Ji Ho.

814
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:48,010
Not knowing

815
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,860
is a good thing.

816
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,730
That's why,

817
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:58,270
don't worry too much.

818
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,160
The same goes for you, Se Hee.

819
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:11,860
Even if it's the same ocean that I saw before,

820
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:16,870
today, this ocean, it's the first time for me.

821
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:21,490
Even things that I know, things that I have done,

822
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:26,580
in that moment, with that person, it's the first time, still.

823
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:33,750
Us... just like our marriage.

824
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:38,220
Like the kiss at the bus stop.

825
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:44,020
The things that happen after that moment...

826
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:49,280
I think they're not anyone's fault.

827
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,880
Just...

828
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,340
it happened like that.

829
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:59,850
Like how some waves just flow by,

830
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:04,100
and some waves break.

831
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:11,230
It just happens. That's why,

832
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,530
Se Hee, you too,

833
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:18,330
shouldn't worry too much.

834
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:23,520
Just because you have lived yesterday,

835
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:27,020
it doesn't mean

836
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,120
that you know everything about today.

837
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,830
A person coming

838
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:36,640
is in fact a tremendous thing.

839
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:40,270
It is because one person's

840
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:42,780
entire life is coming with her.

841
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:47,400
Because it is fragile,

842
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:49,960
and so

843
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:53,370
it may have been broken before

844
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:57,000
that heart

845
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:01,250
comes.

846
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:06,370
Now I understand why people come to see the ocean when they are frustrated.

847
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:12,510
Here, you are able to meet your own feelings.

848
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:14,320
Pardon?

849
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,020
But you know,

850
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:20,110
there is something I've wanted to correct since a while ago.

851
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:25,470
What you did at the bus stop was not a kiss. It was a peck.

852
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:30,110
Ahhh...

853
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,660
Did you really have to...?

854
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:35,630
Yes.

855
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,190
The truth is, you can't even call it a peck.

856
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:40,400
If one had to define it accurately,

857
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,570
it was just skin-to-skin contact, which just happened to be of lips.

858
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:46,150
Yes, that would be an accurate definition.

859
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,850
Yes. I understand.

860
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:55,830
You can't call that a kiss.

861
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:01,560
That is not how you do a kiss.

862
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,310
I understand, I said. I didn't do it well.

863
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:08,700
Yes. That's what I am saying. A kiss...

864
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,010
is done like this.

865
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:16,430
♫ A night sky full of ♫

866
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:20,510
♫ my dreams that I have filled ♫

867
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:24,970
♫ Each losing its meaning one sheet at a time ♫

868
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:31,680
♫ Telling me this. The past ♫

869
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:39,970
♫ in the fading small papers I've written them on ♫

870
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:44,040
Now... do you understand better?

871
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:46,790
If not...

872
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:50,010
do you need to know more?

873
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,440
More... I want to know more.

874
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,650
♫ I can't even touch it ♫

875
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:03,390
♫ Like today, even if I endure a day  ♫

876
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:10,540
♫ It keeps coming back, each day, living through it ♫

877
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:16,160
♫ Like a fool, I keep repeating it ♫

878
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:20,330
Because it is fragile

879
01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:26,020
that's why it may have been broken before,

880
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:32,680
that heart of his...

881
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,870
came to me.

882
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:39,150
♫ Living through each day  ♫

883
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:43,540
♫ Like a fool, repeating  ♫

884
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:47,240
♫ I stand alone again in one corner ♫

885
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:54,660
♫ Just in case tomorrow is actually different ♫

886
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:58,900
Because This Is My First Life

887
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:02,850
All the romance cells in my body have woken up.

888
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:04,820
This woman is pretty.

889
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:08,750
You don't want to do it with your landlord? You live in the same house, doesn't your body...

890
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,810
Go and shower first.

891
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:12,560
Why did I do that? Why?

892
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,040
In a day how many times

893
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:19,250
do I think about kissing? You mo-sol (single since birth)!

894
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:23,780
About our wedding, can you wait a little bit longer?

895
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:26,910
I am just curious about my girlfriend's house.

896
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,280
You came?

897
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,990
These days, what do people do when on a date?

898
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:32,780
Oh?

899
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:34,890
I... am scared of myself

900
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:39,270
in case I might hurt someone again.
