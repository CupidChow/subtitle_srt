Come to YOLO, 24

8
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,320
Reason for reporting: Stalking

9
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:53,420
Awaiting processing

10
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,500
Is something wrong?

11
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,880
You only love one.
♥ Bok Nam ♥

12
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,330
Are you going to work tomorrow?

13
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,790
What?

14
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,980
Of course. I have to.

15
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,790
I'm a new employee, so I should go in early.

16
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,120
How would you feel about not going?

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,110
If I don't I'll get fired.

18
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,200
Why do you ask?

19
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,310
Tomorrow, the cat...

20
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,120
Could you take her to the vet?

21
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,200
Ah, tomorrow?

22
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,720
- Yes, then, I will, tomorrow early afternoon—
- No, in the morning.

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,660
I'm really hoping you can go in the morning.

24
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,810
Ah. Okay. I'll do that.

25
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,270
I mean, when I offered to go, he adamantly said no.

26
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,500
Why is he like that all of a sudden?

27
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,390
The cube-formula like brains of those science majors.

28
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,870
How would a literature girl like me understand?

29
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,840
Could I change my hours for tomorrow?

30
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,050
"You only love one."

31
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,200
What a random English phrase.

32
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,860
This kid really didn't study much.

33
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,090
But he's seen a thing or two, I guess.

34
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,960
Yes, Bomi-nim. Excuse me for calling so late.

35
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,360
From the list of report incidents that you sent me, there is a Young Bok Nam.

36
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,760
The reason for the report is for stalking.

37
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,710
Where and how did that report come about?

38
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,660
I sent you the veterinary clinic address by text message.

39
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,890
It's the usual clinic I always take her to,

40
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,620
so she should be familiar with it.

41
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,950
Yes. I suppose it will be done by around lunchtime?

42
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,960
I'll tell you the result as I leave.

43
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,580
No. Depending on the condition,

44
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,140
there could be additional exams.

45
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,480
Please take care of those as well.

46
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,780
Use this to pay for the bill and for the transportation. Please take a taxi.

47
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,380
It's alright. There's a bus that goes straight there.

48
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,120
No, I mean I don't think it will be okay for Kitty.

49
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,000
She's never been to a place with lots of people.

50
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,560
Oh. About the examination . . .

51
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,700
How comprehensive an exam were you thinking of?

52
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,610
Some animal hospitals tend to add on this and that to incur additional costs, it seems.

53
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,540
Do all of them. Whatever the doctor says. All.

54
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,160
And pay in one single payment, please.

55
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,220
Okay.

56
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,370
Today… come back safely.

57
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,530
Then, see you later.

58
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,730
Nope. Because I feel like I will do something wrong.

59
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,580
If we continue to stay together, I might jump you.

60
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,550
- What?
- Oh, and it wasn't 303, it was 304.

61
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,400
Our hotel room.

62
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,180
- Good morning.
- Hello.

63
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,070
- Oh, hello!
- Hello!

64
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,930
Wow!

65
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,760
♫ It's lucky, lucky, lucky day ♫

66
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,860
♫ I want you every single day ♫

67
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,440
♫ Today too ♫

68
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,650
♫ I've been waiting for you ♫

69
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,300
- CEO?
- Oh, Bo Mi!

70
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,300
Drink up this fresh air of the morning!

71
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,400
This isn't the time for you to be filming "500 Days of Summer" in front of the office.

72
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,070
Let's go in.

73
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,080
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

74
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,730
Roster of members with reports.

75
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,000
Did you call the person who reported him?

76
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,860
They used our app's chatting function to chat.

77
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,730
They exchanged phone numbers and spoke and became closer.

78
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,400
It seems like when she stopped responding as much, that's when he started to text and call like crazy, I think.

79
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,990
So she blocked him, and then he called her at work.

80
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,860
If this is true, it's really serious,

81
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,920
though people do file false reports too.

82
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,300
We need to verify whether it's true and be accurate.

83
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,860
Could we get the blacklists from other apps?

84
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,690
I could get that through Won Seok, I think.

85
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,560
Bomi-nim, could you come with me?

86
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,050
Yes.

87
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,820
He's very dependable, right?

88
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,760
- What?
- Se Hee.

89
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,700
He's a very manly type.

90
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,470
Oh. Well, if I had to pick one thing to say about him, that wouldn't be it.

91
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,060
It's okay, you can brag about him in front of us!

92
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,730
There's no one in this hospital who doesn't know Se Hee is a macho man.

93
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,630
Macho man?

94
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,220
I mean, when he first brought her, he was so angry,

95
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,860
so our nurses gave him a nickname, "Macho Man."

96
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,130
He got angry? Really?

97
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,080
I guess you didn't know.

98
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,190
Back then, Kitty's condition was really bad.

99
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,000
I told him it's better to just prepare himself for the worst,

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,170
and he smacked the table here and was very angry.

101
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:24,570
He said that was a very irresponsible thing for me to say and that he didn't care how much it costs, but I had to cure her.

102
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,400
Back then he wasn't even the owner, I think.

103
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,040
Yup. Someone had thrown her away. Kitty was dying on the street when Se Hee brought her here.

104
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,860
He ran here in the middle of the night.

105
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,190
You married really well.

106
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,160
No man who loves animals is a bad guy. Right?

107
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,550
Right. Though the issue is when one only cares about animals.

108
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,570
You're not supposed to fall for those words before you marry him, huh?

109
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,130
Ah. You two are married to each other?

110
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,190
Oh, welcome!

111
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,040
It's not lunch time yet. You came early.

112
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,970
- Yes, to buy some snacks.
- Just in time since we've got a new menu out today.

113
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,630
- Please try it.
- Yes.

114
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:32,730
Oh, you're here? Ji Ho Noona said she will be coming a bit late today.

115
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,040
Yes, she will.

116
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,840
Have a taste.

117
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,400
Wow. Wrap up five of these for me.

118
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,870
Okay.

119
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,970
I guess you've got stuff that's dropping your sugar level since this early in the morning.

120
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,060
Maybe your boss is making you do too much work?

121
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,770
They're always giving me a lot of work.

122
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,690
Your bag looks like it would be heavy. You have a lot of hefty metal tools.

123
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,030
Well, those are must-haves for people who ride a motorcycle

124
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,730
since we need them to carry out the work.

125
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,490
What kind of work?

126
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,750
Well, fixing the motorcycle and fixing a woman's heart too.

127
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,250
I'll help you settle the bill.

128
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,860
It's $26 dollars.

129
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,330
Sign, please?

130
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,920
You changed your signature.

131
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,680
This is the first time I've signed here. Last time, I paid with cash.

132
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,060
Is that right? I guess I mixed you up with someone else.

133
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,540
Would you like to try that one, too?

134
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,750
Three years ago?

135
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,650
He ran, holding Kitty?

136
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,330
My landlord? That neocortex?

137
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,420
No.

138
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,480
- What's this?
- Ji Ho!

139
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,580
What? You didn't go to work at the cafe?

140
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,600
I had something to do so I'm just going to work now. What about you guys? Where are you going?

141
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Where else? To your cafe, of course.

142
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,370
Tada. Bok Nam gave us a ton of coupons so we can't waste them.

143
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,940
You're not busy? You're not going to your work?

144
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,880
I've got work outside the company today. I've got a lot of time this whole afternoon.

145
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,480
And I have a day off. Let's go.

146
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,020
Maybe it's just a false report. He just looks so nice.

147
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,110
You also look ordinary from afar.

148
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,030
That thing. I looked into how much it costs, and it's really expensive, they say.

149
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,020
You must be curious how much it costs, right?

150
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,420
Nope. Not really. It's not even my house price, so why?

151
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,960
That's true. You're not interested in stuff like this.

152
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,170
Well, since you troubled yourself to find out, let's hear it.

153
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,850
How much is it?

154
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,020
Hey, it's Brother-in-law!

155
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,300
- But who's that next to him?
- I know, right?

156
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,360
Who is that?

157
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,570
That bike is to die for.

158
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,290
I only saw it ever displayed in the stores, but I guess someone actually goes around riding it.

159
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,140
That's Bok Nam's.

160
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,860
Really? That's Bok Nam's, you say?

161
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,520
That's got to cost at least as much as a mid-sized car.

162
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Really?

163
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,770
It's daebak, right?

164
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,800
No. Well, not as much as I thought.

165
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,630
Shall we go back? I think we've been absent for too long.

166
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,510
Be careful, Se Hee. The side mirror is at least a week's worth of our overtime pay.

167
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,690
I think it's probably more than that even.

168
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,430
Be careful, or else you'll be paying until 2048,

169
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,650
along with your home loan.

170
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,470
I think you exaggerate a bit much.

171
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,550
To compare a side mirror and a home loan in the same category.

172
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,620
This little side mirror, how much could it actually cost?

173
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,740
My motorcycle.

174
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,630
Se Hee.

175
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:21,040
Ji Ho! Hey, what do we do about your husband?

176
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,100
Episode 8
Because This Is My First Husband

177
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,660
Oh my. Smells like poop.

178
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,130
What the!

179
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,790
So you sleep here. I'm sorry.

180
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,110
Oh, Won Seok.

181
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,190
How come you came all the way here

182
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,180
so this office without even a place to sit?

183
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,350
I should've come sooner. I'm sorry.

184
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,070
And put this somewhere in your office.

185
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,210
This is a plant that freshens the air.

186
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:16,330
It's the best for those bad people who don't let any fresh air in.

187
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,570
Thank you.

188
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,290
Let's see.

189
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,790
Byeong Tae, where should I put this? Byeong Tae!

190
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,620
Sang Hoon, where should I put this?

191
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,230
It's not even food. Put it where?

192
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,330
You just hold it and stand there, then.

193
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,180
Oh. Alright.

194
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,660
- Let's go out, Hyung.
- Yes, shall we?

195
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,110
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,950
Thanks.

197
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,100
But what's with the atmosphere in your office?

198
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,830
Sang Hoon is about to get dumped by his girlfriend of five years.

199
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,900
The scary looking kid who was sleeping on the sofa.

200
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,130
I see. That's why he had that look of death.

201
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,570
But why be so petty about it when young people meet and break up all the time?

202
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:12,940
The girlfriend's family told her to break up with him if he keeps on making the 'app' or 'opp' or whatever,

203
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,980
saying something like they won't consent to them marrying if he doesn't get a job by the end of the year.

204
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,310
I see.

205
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,920
I'm in a crisis too.

206
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,150
This is too cruel. Work, and my dating life, too.

207
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,790
I've been put on a forced abstinence.

208
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,710
- Rang said she doesn't want to do it with me.
- Won't do what?

209
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,900
- Why?
- She says she's uneasy about doing it with a man who isn't thinking of marriage.

210
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,420
She said if we do it . . . Ugh, this is so embarrassing.

211
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,500
She said to do it with two on.

212
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,760
It's not as if they are socks. Put two on? What a disaster.

213
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,320
So I'm pondering it seriously, this marriage thing.

214
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,360
Hey, I can see how it would be stressful for you.

215
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,820
It's not just a mountain that you can climb over.

216
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,660
The offer I made you before is still valid, so call me when you're interested.

217
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,570
Thank you, Hyung.

218
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,150
Show me the picture of the guy you mentioned.

219
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,170
It's him. Can you find out if he's been blacklisted on other matchmaking sites?

220
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,330
I will look into it. But what is your plan though?

221
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,090
You said he works with Ji Ho.

222
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:25,690
I know. I mean, if this was just a normal blacklist, I can just kick him out.

223
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,990
But I'm worried because it's Sister-in-law Ji Ho.

224
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,470
Since he works with her, I can't just make any moves too soon either.

225
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,490
But it's a relief anyway, the fact that her husband is involved.

226
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,530
He's the top 1% brain in the field, too.

227
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,650
That's true. Who's our Chief Nam?

228
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,560
He's cool-headed and meticulous and even if you poke him with a needle, he probably won't even shed a drop of blood.

229
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,560
I had to stitch more than I thought I needed to.

230
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,250
Be careful not to get water on it and come back again in a week.

231
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,200
- Yes.
- You hit the ground, right?

232
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,630
How did that happen?

233
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:03,230
Huh? Who's his guardian?

234
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,390
Oh, me. A motorcycle . . .

235
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,500
You did that riding a motorcycle?

236
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,860
So, we'll need a full-body x-ray then.

237
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,190
So you were a biker! No wonder.

238
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,170
Your eyes.Yep.

239
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:27,360
No, it wasn't that he was riding the motorcycle. He was trying to avoid it.

240
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,660
- He was trying to avoid it.
- A motorcycle that was coming towards him?

241
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,730
Then, wouldn't we need to get him a CT scan?

242
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,090
Well, it wasn't a motorcycle that was moving.

243
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:42,350
So, it happened while I tried to avoid a parked motorcycle by myself.

244
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,110
What? Why?

245
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,630
Why?

246
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,030
Nah. It couldn't be because the motorcycle is super expensive?

247
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,930
So you didn't want it getting scratched so you tried to avoid it and fell to the ground?

248
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,150
You're crazy!

249
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,330
It can't be something like that, right?

250
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:04,690
No matter how expensive a motorcycle is, what crazy punk would switch it with his own life?

251
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:12,370
Then, I'll see you in a week.

252
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:27,440
Brother-in-law is so athletic.

253
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,240
Yeah. How did he manage to fly like that?

254
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,300
I think he could totally be a diving athlete.

255
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,210
Athlete, my butt.

256
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,180
JI Ho must be so embarrassed. Wouldn't you say?

257
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,470
- Well...
- I don't think that's necessary.

258
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,370
She should be. How much can a motorcycle side mirror cost?

259
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,760
His wife's friends saw clearly how he tumbled on the ground trying to avoid it.

260
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,620
If it were me, I would've pretended like I didn't know him out of embarrassment.

261
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,090
But why did you get in this car? Don't you need to go to work?

262
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,420
I do. But I can't go pegged between a husband and wife

263
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,480
with the atmosphere already awkward between them.

264
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,110
Take a left up ahead and drop me off at the intersection, please.

265
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,320
Oh, sure. Since it's on our way.

266
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,780
What do you mean it's on the way?

267
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:17,050
Oh, but the two of you. By chance, do you know that Bok Nam well?

268
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,630
Well, not exactly well, but why? You're interested in him?

269
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:28,480
Can't be. You're one of the matchmaking app creators. You wouldn't not know about your own level.

270
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,730
But still, I'm sure my level is higher than yours.

271
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,960
You haven't done this, right? Getting your level on our app?

272
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,770
I don't need to, you see, since I've got a boyfriend.

273
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,600
Honestly, isn't that for people who are kind of lacking in self-esteem?

274
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,860
Oh. So you've got a boyfriend and you've got self-esteem.

275
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,680
It's just tactfulness that you lack.

276
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,130
What did you say?

277
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,760
What a funny person.

278
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,560
There you go.

279
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,110
It doesn't hurt?

280
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,690
No, it's fine.

281
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,130
Why did you do that?

282
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,920
If you'd just grabbed the motorcycle,

283
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,620
you wouldn't have gotten injured.

284
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,430
If I had grabbed the motorcycle, it would have fallen or broken.

285
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,420
But it's still better if the motorcycle gets broken.

286
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,970
Is it better to have a person get hurt, instead?

287
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,220
Well, it's not about which is right or wrong.

288
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:48,770
In the end, my treatment cost is less than the motorcycle repair cost.

289
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,810
Se Hee. He's a very manly type.

290
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,360
He smacked the table here and was very angry.

291
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,080
Our nurses gave him the nickname, "Macho Man."

292
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,960
"Macho man" my butt.

293
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,240
What?

294
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,840
Nothing. They said to come get Kitty in the evening.

295
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,060
They still have some exams left.

296
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,750
I see. Thank you.

297
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,380
Shall we go?

298
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,310
You're headed back to your work, right?

299
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:33,690
Yes. What about you, Ji Ho? Are you heading to that cafe?

300
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,900
Yes. If I skip the afternoon too, I think I might really get sacked,

301
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,870
so I should go in.

302
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,170
Did you have something to say to me?

303
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,350
That cafe . . .

304
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,290
Yes?

305
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:01,810
Until when were you planning on working at that cafe?

306
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,280
Well, as long as I don't get fired,

307
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,470
I think for now, I will continue to.

308
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,530
Why do you ask that?

309
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:16,000
No. I was wondering if there is a reason why it had to be that particular cafe.

310
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,170
There are lots of other places near home.

311
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,530
So I mean, there are lots of places you could just walk to.

312
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,850
So I was wondering if you had to go all the way there, I mean.

313
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,960
By chance, is it because it bothers you?

314
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,880
Are you that worried about your company people?

315
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,890
Their coming to the cafe?

316
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,850
- Well, it's—
- If it's that, don't worry.

317
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:52,460
As you said, situations where we have to act like husband and wife,

318
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,250
I'm avoiding them as much as I can, too.

319
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,120
And also, the cafes near home, I've been to them all.

320
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,300
None of them hired me.

321
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,690
And in my current situation, a part-time job I can get,

322
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,700
there aren't many.

323
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,510
And this cafe, it was thanks to Bok Nam that I got to work there at all.

324
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:19,860
So to me, it's actually a job that came to me with difficulty.

325
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,710
So please don't speak of it so lightly.

326
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,830
Im Jae Pharmacy

327
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,030
Then, see you at home.

328
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,650
Yes.

329
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:43,710
♫ I will entrust my heart in your care briefly. You may pass by ♫

330
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,870
♫ and look at it without feeling much ♫

331
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,730
By personal feelings, you mean, the fact that I like you?

332
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,720
When I'm with you, I'm concerned, and I'm curious about what you're doing then I miss you.

333
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,300
I just don't like it!

334
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,460
Those bastards harassing you.

335
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,960
Oh, Deputy Woo, coming back from Techno Valley?

336
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,730
Yes. I stopped by the M Portal main office nearby too.

337
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,940
Oh. Really?

338
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,220
Then...

339
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,230
Hey, did you see it? She didn't have one on.

340
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,550
No way.

341
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:07,520
I told you, I saw it more than once or twice. Want to bet?

342
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,990
Did you guys hear about Deputy Woo?

343
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,430
What about her?

344
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:21,390
Oh, how the CEO of Gold Venture tried to get close to her at the drink meeting?

345
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,670
Really? How?

346
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,770
- He did this, I heard.
- Oh! Is he crazy?

347
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:30,790
So then? What did Deputy Woo do?

348
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:34,690
From what's said on the chat, it wasn't what she did.

349
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,390
It was the startup CEO that pounced back in the end and totally cussed him out.

350
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,700
What? Why? I guess the two have something going on.

351
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,900
Honestly, unless it's not that, would he crush his own money lifeline?

352
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,010
You know how Deputy Woo, whenever she does business out of the office,

353
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,320
she goes around without a bra, the rumor says.

354
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,900
I guess he fell for that.

355
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,740
Really? No bra? What? It's like she's going out for a hook up.

356
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,800
Was that her style?

357
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,850
I liked Deputy Woo. I'm so disappointed.

358
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,210
Disappointed? Were you two even close?

359
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Wait for me.

360
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,740
CEO Ma: New Message

361
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,040
Mr. Shoe-lifts?

362
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,430
What? Who are you to call me . . .

363
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,360
The CEO and the guy with the shoe-lifts. Move to the bride's side.

364
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,920
- Oh.
- You brought the materials that the CEO asked for, right? Follow me.

365
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,450
Yes. Where's Sang Goo Hyung?

366
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:10,560
An urgent meeting with a VIP, so he went out. You can just talk with me.

367
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,800
VIP?

368
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:19,160
Call me when you're done working. Let's eat dinner together. I'm at the cafe in front of your company right now.

369
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:41,340
I didn't send the text to ask you to come out. I said I was going to wait until you were off work.

370
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,320
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean?

371
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,590
You saw my text.

372
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:52,100
I came here like this so I could buy dinner for Ms. Woo Soo Ji who's toiling away with work all day.

373
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,800
I'm working late today since I've got a lot to do.

374
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,760
Do you know what's nice about being the CEO?

375
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,680
No matter how much work there is, I have no reason to worry about what others think about where I do that work.

376
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,530
I'm really fine. I can just wait here while working.

377
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,600
It's true though. I brought my work.

378
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,440
See, the notebook,

379
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,200
and the earphones and the mouse

380
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,790
and the flower.

381
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,560
Since starting today, it's day one for us.

382
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:32,590
So just one stem today. You can be greedy about flowers from now on. Here you go.

383
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,490
What?

384
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,630
Hey.

385
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,790
- CEO Ma, come see me.
- I'm looking at you already.

386
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,590
Hurry and take the flower.

387
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,330
Follow me.

388
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,020
What's with this?

389
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,900
Huh? What is? I told you. I'm buying you dinner.

390
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,000
- Why are you like this, suddenly?
- That's what I mean.

391
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,900
Why is CEO Ma buying my dinner?

392
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,560
And after appearing suddenly in front of my workplace, at that.

393
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:14,560
Well... Oh, so you're the 'tsundere' type when you date, huh?

394
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,340
I said I wanted to sleep with you. Did I ever say I wanted to date you?

395
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:25,570
CEO Ma. Are you some youth in your 20s?

396
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,490
What?

397
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,640
I think you're misunderstanding something big time here.

398
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,840
That day, I just threw it out there

399
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,790
because my body was craving it.

400
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,060
And I thought,

401
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,140
I thought you and I were in the same category.

402
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,370
But you are more innocent than I thought, so this is really throwing me off.

403
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,740
Soo Ji.

404
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,790
You're really so mean and bad!

405
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,280
Yeah.

406
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,570
I'm mean and bad.

407
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,080
I'm so mean and bad and that's how I barely made it to today.

408
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,680
So please stop acting silly, CEO Ma.

409
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,680
Hey, Woo Soo Ji!

410
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,650
What did you just say?

411
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,550
Don't act silly?

412
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,920
Did I say I wanted to something else with you?

413
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,900
Let's eat a meal together.

414
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,810
We have a connection so let's see each other.

415
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:35,030
That's all I asked.

416
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,840
Is that something for you to throw such a fit about?

417
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,730
Look here.

418
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,610
I think you must think the workplace is like some college club.

419
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:48,430
No. School or club, once you date and break up, it's only the woman that loses out.

420
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:52,320
The woman is the one who gets dissed, and it's the woman who has to quit and leave too.

421
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,010
Do you get that?

422
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,510
Why are you so twisted?

423
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:01,300
I think it's you who's not very aware.

424
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,980
It seems like the world has changed, right?

425
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,800
But it's the same.

426
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,870
So if you want to sleep with me so badly,

427
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:19,210
go and sell off your company and come. Then I'll date you.

428
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,100
App: Shall We Meet? / YOLO Rider, (94) / Report: Stalking

429
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,640
So he was reported on this app, too?

430
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,100
Yes.

431
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,860
They exchanged numbers,

432
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,130
and they chatted before she blocked him.

433
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,600
But he started to stalk her with texts and calls and hacked her SNS too.

434
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,930
So it's the same as our report.

435
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,570
But . . .

436
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,650
You know about the Namgang Station confinement case, right? It's similar to that pattern.

437
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,400
No way. How in the world does that face look like a criminal?

438
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,820
Look here. If I sit still, people say that I look like a model too.

439
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,790
I think this case was also after meeting in an online game.

440
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,620
He got mad after getting blocked so he kept stalking her.

441
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,220
You know SNS? He went to the location tagged on it and he kidnapped her.

442
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,130
They haven't caught that criminal yet.

443
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,960
They haven't caught the criminal?

444
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,310
Right. They haven't. That is what I heard.

445
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:29,190
My friend works at that game company.

446
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,110
Ji Ho works with him, I heard.

447
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,830
Maybe you should hurry and go tell her?

448
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:39,680
There aren't many part-time jobs I can get in my current situation.

449
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,870
That cafe too, it was thanks to Bok Nam that I got to work there.

450
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,200
So it was actually a job that was difficult for me to get.

451
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,830
Please don't talk about it so lightly.

452
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:55,270
Even if I let her know, it should be after I confirm the facts.

453
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:59,910
If I rush to tell her and it's not true, it could be troubling for both parties.

454
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,790
Ji Ho could lose her job,

455
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,340
and this person could too.

456
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,980
It's just a part-time job, so she could just quit. There's no need to be so serious.

457
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,960
A part-time job is still an important job to some people.

458
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,380
I can't ruin that recklessly.

459
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,760
And I don't want that to be because of me either.

460
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,350
Your friend at the game company.

461
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:26,300
Could you ask him to find out more about the Namgang Station case?

462
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,260
- And information on the suspected member, too.
- Yes, I'll ask.

463
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,190
But how did you injure your forehead?

464
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,730
Oh. This is . . .

465
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,150
an accident.

466
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,960
A type of willful negligence.

467
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,110
Today's coffee, one cup, mild.

468
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,940
Yup.

469
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,010
Here you go.

470
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,580
You're finally having a day off. Why are you going around all day alone?

471
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,470
What about Won Seok? You're not going to see him?

472
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,880
He's got a lot to do today.

473
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,260
It's pretty, right?

474
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,300
This one is yours. It was on sale, so I bought an extra one.

475
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,550
Me?

476
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,150
Wear this?

477
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,030
Why? Don't you like it?

478
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:34,110
Then, do you want this one?

479
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:38,180
No, that one is yours. This one is for Ji Ho Noona.

480
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,820
Is that so?

481
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,360
Little boy, saying all kinds of things.

482
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,180
I know? I guess our Ji Ho looks so innocent and pure to men, huh?

483
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:55,020
She doesn't look just innocent, she is innocent. White looks so good on her.

484
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,770
Especially sleeveless looks. Her shoulders are so pretty, right?

485
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:03,540
What are you saying? It's so cold, why would I wear something sleeveless?

486
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,120
I know, right?

487
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,900
You sound like you saw her shoulders already.

488
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,840
Noona, you look prettier when you wear your hair up.

489
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,430
When did you ever see me with

490
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,980
my hair up? I haven't done that.

491
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,630
Ah, well...

492
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,010
I just meant that I think you would look pretty that way.

493
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,090
Do I have to see it? It's obviously for pretty people.

494
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,420
The cake is on me, Noona.

495
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,640
Should I toss Won Seok out and take him home to raise instead?

496
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,720
Aigoo, don't say things you don't mean.

497
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,130
You bought all this sexy lingerie for Won Seok.

498
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,030
Yes, I did buy it because of him.

499
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,880
Tonight, I'm going to wear nothing but this...

500
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,110
Oh, come on.

501
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:54,190
and not let him lay one finger on my body.

502
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,860
Huh?

503
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,490
When I learn more information, I will contact you.

504
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,320
Yes, we are grateful for all your help so far.

505
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,100
Oh, I haven't had a chance to properly greet you.

506
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,720
This is my business card.

507
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,640
I'm a CEO of a startup myself.

508
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,500
It's called "Awake Others." It's an alarm app.

509
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,680
Oh, Awake Others.

510
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,520
That app where you set alarms for your friends to wake them?

511
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,340
Yes, that one. I made that.

512
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,310
Oh, so you're the developer of Awake Others.

513
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,120
We all used that together the other day, right?

514
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,900
- You used my app?
- Of course.

515
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,540
We all used that app and we were surprised.

516
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,810
Really?

517
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:40,940
If we ever met the developer, we had something we really wanted to ask him.

518
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,560
What is it? Please ask me.

519
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,030
Why in the world did you make that app?

520
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,080
Huh? Well,

521
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,070
if you used it, you will know.

522
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,990
There are times when you can't hear your alarm, and you keep sleeping.

523
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,200
Then your friend will be awakened by your alarm.

524
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,350
Then the friend will call you and wake you.

525
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:07,130
Then can't you just set your alarm to repeat at a later time?

526
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,020
Oh.

527
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,820
That is true, but...

528
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,700
Yes, there is that solution,

529
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,560
but our company's motto is to connect people together.

530
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,480
It's not about a regular alarm. It's a social media alarm.

531
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,360
So between couples and close friends, they take care of each other's morning waking times,

532
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,770
and deepen their relationship with each other, shall I say?

533
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:31,770
But, does that make any money?

534
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,550
What are your monthly sales?

535
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,430
Ah, that...

536
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,690
We don't

537
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:42,450
make any sales.

538
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:56,330
Sim Won Seok, learn how great the sin of rejecting marriage is, feel it down to your bones.

539
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,520
Stab yourself in your thighs as you stare at this.

540
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,570
You're home?

541
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,440
What's wrong? What is it?

542
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:36,390
Hey, Sim Won Seok. Lift your head. What's up?

543
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,550
What? He asked why you made that app?

544
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,100
Why would you make an app? So you can sell it, obviously.

545
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,950
What a stupid question. Sheesh.

546
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,600
Rang.

547
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:06,870
I never knew that my app would be treated this way.

548
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:10,130
There are so many dumb apps in this world.

549
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:14,680
Hand-warmer apps, apps that confirm your wealth at birth,

550
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,580
even an app that makes your phone vibrate and scratch your back for you.

551
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,460
What's so wrong with my app?

552
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,970
I know. What is wrong with Awake Others?

553
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:28,230
Because they're ranked #1 in the app store, they dare to look down on #257?

554
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,890
I didn't think Brother-in-law was like this, but he is such a weird person.

555
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,650
He's the one who rolled on the ground so he wouldn't have to pay for a back mirror.

556
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,740
Huh?

557
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,970
Really?

558
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,450
This one is here and that is here.

559
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,710
That's right.

560
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,730
How many times do I have to teach you? You also broke a cup earlier.

561
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,110
That was because the customer—

562
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,800
If the customer drops a cup then the part-timer should go catch it before it hits the ground.

563
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,770
Isn't that right?

564
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,150
What?

565
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,550
I will keep what happened today a secret from the owner.

566
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,160
You owe me one. Pay me.

567
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,880
Hey!

568
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,000
Landlord.

569
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,920
You have a call.

570
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,420
Oh. Wait a sec.

571
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,820
Yes. What's the matter?

572
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,870
That is...

573
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:41,290
Today, what time will you be home?

574
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,240
I think I will be going home on time.

575
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,560
Why?

576
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,320
That is,

577
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:51,690
today, Arsenal will be playing. A derby match.

578
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:54,650
Ahhh. Yes.

579
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:59,260
But then, did you call because of that?

580
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,560
In case you didn't know.

581
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,850
Okay. Thank you.

582
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:09,970
And also today, are you going home on the bus?

583
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,180
Yes. Probably.

584
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,740
But then, why?

585
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,740
Going home by bus.

586
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,910
Why do you keep asking since yesterday?

587
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:22,210
That...

588
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,870
That...

589
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:27,260
I think it would be better for you to ride the bus.

590
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:32,420
So, the bus is efficient and safe.

591
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,260
So...

592
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:39,510
The bus stops in front of the house in just one ride.

593
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,060
Ahhh.

594
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:50,420
That... I am being very strange right now, right?

595
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,200
Yes.

596
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,050
Yes.

597
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,610
What about Kitty?

598
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,440
Did you go and get her?

599
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,930
No, I will be going later.

600
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,030
Is Kitty

601
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,240
coming home riding a taxi just like earlier?

602
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:19,000
Yes. Since it is the end of the work day, she would be startled if there are so many people.

603
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,290
Ahhh.

604
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:22,650
Yes.

605
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:27,310
Then, I will see you for the soccer match.

606
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,850
Yes.

607
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,000
What the? Kitty rides a taxi,

608
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,750
so why does he insist that I ride the bus and even calls me about it?

609
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,370
What's with him since yesterday?

610
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:57,730
You have to pick the cat up by 7.

611
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:02,730
Do well.

612
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:05,790
- Why did you practice?
- I saw this in the video.

613
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:09,140
I really can't solve this.

614
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,940
This is why you're useless.

615
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,880
Se Hee try solving this. You're good at this.

616
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,400
You even set a record before.

617
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,840
Mr. Se Hee, Mr. Se Hee.

618
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,650
Show us.

619
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:24,760
I can't do it. How do you do it?

620
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:15,590
You always leave first.

621
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,200
Get on.

622
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,940
Not today.

623
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:22,370
Why? Because your husband told you to ride the bus?

624
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,430
What?

625
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:28,260
I heard earlier. Don't you know that you can hear everything through the window if you talk over there?

626
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,580
Silly.

627
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,490
Ah. Is that so?

628
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,020
Go ahead. I will ride the bus today.

629
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:41,290
You listen to your husband really well.

630
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:43,500
A husband who doesn't even come to pick you up.

631
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:48,510
It's not even a far distance. It's just one bus stop away,

632
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:51,280
so how could he not come and pick you up even once?

633
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,560
He's busy.

634
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,310
What? He's picking up the cat?

635
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:02,330
To your husband, the cat ranks ahead of you then.

636
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,250
Get on, let's drink one beer.

637
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,950
You also have a debt today that you have to pay.

638
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,090
Should we? Should we go for a drink?

639
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:41,790
Private Best Seoul Driver

640
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:44,940
The animal hospital near the Sang-bong station, please.

641
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,260
Really?

642
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,390
He rolled on the ground to avoid the side mirror?

643
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,420
Wow. That's great.

644
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,910
So it's true. Like Hyung Sang Gu said, he's a "left-loan, right-cat" person.

645
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:20,940
Huh? "Left-loan, right-cat?"

646
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:26,090
Yeah. His left brain is filled only with his loan and his right brain is filled only with his cat. So that's what people in the company call him.

647
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,590
All his logic is taken up by his loan,

648
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:31,810
and what little emotion he has is poured into his cat.

649
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:34,860
Usually, he doesn't even ride taxis to save money to pay his loan.

650
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:40,840
But to take the cat to the vet he rides a taxi, pays all surgery fees, and he only buys the best cat food.

651
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,910
Brother-in-law is really strange.

652
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:44,280
I know, right?

653
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,960
People who work in this industry are all a little nuts.

654
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,020
But even among them, he is the top 1%. He even set a record.

655
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,940
Record? What record?

656
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:57,400
Rubik's Cube. He went to a cube competition at his company and set a record.

657
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,160
Cube?

658
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:04,610
Ahhh! The children's toy that the kid downstairs are playing with?

659
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:07,050
Don't you just twist and turn that thing?

660
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,540
What?

661
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,470
Rang!

662
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:21,630
Yes, Bo Mi.

663
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:26,130
Mr. Se Hee, I asked my uncle

664
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:28,510
about that Namgak station confinement case.

665
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:29,950
Yes, go ahead.

666
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:34,600
They still have not found the suspect but they have found an evidence that the culprit left behind.

667
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,650
What was that thing called? That thing that tightened bolts and nuts?

668
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,990
- "Spinner?"
- You mean, a spanner?

669
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:43,100
Yes, that thing. A spanner. ("wrench" in North America)

670
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,490
He just left that behind and fled. He used it as a weapon.

671
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,900
Rang, Rang.

672
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,390
This may seem easy but it is actually based on calculations.

673
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:54,890
Depending on the situation, there are 4000 possible moves you can make.

674
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,850
This has a lower probability of success than winning the lottery daily for two weeks straight.

675
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:01,530
Where did you get that? Perhaps is it from the kid downstairs?

676
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:02,930
Yeah. I borrowed it.

677
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:06,780
Keep quiet. That's not important. This isn't something that could be matched just by turning it willy-nilly, you know.

678
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,490
If you just recklessly touch this then you won't be able to solve it even if you die.

679
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:12,670
So someone who understands engineering must concentrate

680
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:16,610
and find the clue and turn it one by one, like this, to solve the puzzle.

681
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:19,520
You move every block, focus now. Listen.

682
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,610
Keep quiet! Stop it! We were talking about Se Hee!

683
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:27,900
You've been talking about that cube for 30 minutes. What did I tell you that I hate the most?

684
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:32,260
When I talk about games or engineering, or games and engineering.

685
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,880
I trained you for 7 years but how come you cannot quit?

686
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,750
In my next life, I will never date an engineer.

687
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:59,350
Why? Do you think I'm a dangerous person?

688
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,710
Your signature has changed.

689
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,490
You know the Namgak station confinement case, right? The pattern is the same as that case.

690
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:10,090
He got mad because he was blocked and kept stalking.

691
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:14,910
He went to the location tagged from her SNS and kidnapped her there.

692
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:17,730
Yes, that thing. A spanner.

693
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:20,210
I think he used it as a weapon.

694
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,260
And also fix a girl's heart.

695
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,100
I must have what I want.

696
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,230
Driver.

697
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,490
Today, Arsenal will be playing.

698
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,500
It's nice.

699
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:09,240
- Why did you marry your husband?
- Huh?

700
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,550
There must be a reason for you to marry him. What did you like about him?

701
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,530
He's frugal.

702
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:20,200
He has a strong sense of maintaining his livelihood.

703
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,580
You saw it too, the side mirror.

704
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,080
Is that all? The reason why you married him?

705
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,510
He has a stable job.

706
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,010
He has a house, too.

707
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:37,380
Is that why you saved your husband as "landlord" in your phone?

708
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:44,860
I saw when he called earlier, it showed "landlord."

709
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:51,090
It's kind of an affectionate nickname.

710
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:53,570
So he's not really your landlord?

711
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:57,280
Well, actually he is.

712
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,490
But I am also contributing.

713
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:02,840
I do part-time work, recycle,

714
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,680
and watch over the cat. And sometimes...

715
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,500
I prepare breakfast for my husband.

716
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:13,760
Well, even though it's not very often.

717
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,140
That's lame.

718
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:23,050
I thought marriage would be done for some other reason.

719
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:27,310
Like love, or fate.

720
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:31,340
I guess there isn't much to marriage, after all. It's just the same as part-time work.

721
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,500
An exchange between labor and capital.

722
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,040
Are you very mad, Ma'am?

723
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,740
Never mind. It's not like this is the first time.

724
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:04,550
I'm sorry. My know-it-all disease came back again.

725
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,750
Don't kneel, it doesn't look good.

726
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,810
I'm already upset as it is. Why go to someone else's company just to get beat up?

727
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,480
These people, they really are ridiculous.

728
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:22,790
What is it to them if someone makes an alarm app or a gong app?

729
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,910
Rang.

730
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,970
Why do you want to marry me?

731
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:34,650
- What?
- The truth is, come on.

732
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:39,000
I can't even get an investor and have been like this for the last three years.

733
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,470
I don't have money, car or a house. I don't have anything.

734
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,520
So why do you want to marry me?

735
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,780
What are you saying? I want to do it because it's you.

736
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:55,830
- Because it's me?
- That's right. Because it's you, Sim Won Seok. So I want to.

737
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:58,060
Do I need another reason?

738
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,110
Landlord

739
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,360
It's because it's that person.

740
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,250
Because it's him, that's why I married him.

741
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:46,580
His house or his job,

742
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,020
though I can't say those weren't contributing factors.

743
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,840
But even with those same conditions,

744
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:59,540
if it had not been him, I wouldn't have married.

745
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:04,340
So don't say it like that.

746
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:08,050
Marriage may not be so great,

747
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:12,980
but still, to hear a stranger speak of it that way,

748
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,300
it's not that insignificant.

749
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:24,320
So I am a stranger, to you, Noona.

750
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:27,630
So...

751
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:32,360
if something happens here, do you think your husband would come and get you?

752
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:36,780
- What?
- No, even if you think of him that way,

753
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:40,380
your husband goes to pick up his cat and tells you to ride the bus.

754
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,310
He doesn't care about you.

755
00:55:42,350 --> 00:55:43,950
Hey.

756
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:47,250
Why are you dissing him so much?

757
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:53,410
Why aren't you answering? I guess you are not confident that he will come and get you?

758
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:58,530
Yeah. I'm not confident. Satisfied?

759
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:05,110
That's why. Who told you to marry a fake husband?

760
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,310
What?

761
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,680
I drank all my beer.

762
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,420
Do you want another one?

763
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,410
What did you just...

764
00:56:21,730 --> 00:56:24,120
Why are you so startled?

765
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,710
Did you think I didn't know?

766
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:32,680
I am interested in you much more than you think, so I am not a stranger.

767
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:32,440
Let's go and watch soccer.

768
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:35,010
What are you doing now?

769
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,580
Let go!

770
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,080
What if I don't let go? Will you hit me?

771
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,640
No. I don't hit people.

772
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,630
It costs a lot of money.

773
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:00,510
I researched this earlier. Yes, it's expensive.

774
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:04,680
I will pay for it along with my house loan until 2048.

775
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,470
My motorcycle!

776
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,980
Hurry and come.

777
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:48,240
So that we can go to our home.

778
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,640
Without effort

779
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,010
we won't be able to understand each other.

780
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,740
In such a world...

781
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:12,460
this thing called love...

782
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,650
exists.

783
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:23,850
♫ Even if I don't want love ♫

784
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:27,140
♫ When you're before me ♫

785
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:32,370
♫ Oh, I want to hold your hands and everything's fine ♫

786
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,100
♫ And it makes me want to love ♫

787
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:44,720
You were at home. But why call?

788
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,770
Because you are a trustworthy person, that's why I did it.

789
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:50,100
You think they know about our contract?

790
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,940
So why did you have to save me as "Landlord" on your phone?

791
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:56,540
He just doesn't say it, but I guess he cherishes his wife a lot?

792
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:00,820
In front of others, call me "Husband," please.

793
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,780
Why are you looking at me with those eyes?

794
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:05,840
That... how... ?

795
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,110
Get yourself together! Erase it! You must!

796
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,680
What's wrong?

797
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,810
Your nails have dirt on them, so dirty.

798
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:14,510
Look properly! What dirt... ?

799
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,250
Will you marry me?

800
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:21,910
I... have a person that I like. My husband.
