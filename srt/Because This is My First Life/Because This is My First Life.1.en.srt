♫ Happy birthday to you

13
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,530
When I was nine years old,

14
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,640
- I learned about this for the first time.
- Seo Yoon.

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,330
- Yes?
- You have to make a wish.
- Oh, right.

16
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,520
Before you blew out your birthday candles,

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,930
you had to make a wish.

18
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,450
♫ Our dear Ji Ho,

19
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,270

♫ Happy birthday to you!

29
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,120
I was able to make the first birthday wish of my life on my 20th birthday.

30
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,770
My wish was always the same.

31
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,210
Please make me a successful writer.

32
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,560
And ten years later,
[Oska]

33
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,070
I really became a writer.

34
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,920
Let's divorce.

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,270
What are you talking about, Soo Hee? Please.

36
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,690
That's all I have to say. I'm leaving.

37
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,420
Assistant writer of a melodrama.

38
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,430
This is my fifth year as an assistant writer.

39
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,740
Though I am seasoned enough to write a subplot now...

40
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,650
Ahjumma!

41
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,160
What are you trying to do right now?

42
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,350
The CEO told me to clean up all of the baby clothes.

43
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,560
Why?

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,170
Leave! Don't come into my room again!

45
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,000
My baby.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,200
I won't forgive you... Oska.

[Used by the main actress twice, one gift scene, used by the main actor]

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,220
Chairman, what brings you here at this time—

50
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,260
- Wait why?
- How dare you disobey me, Park Jun Ha? Leave my company this instant!
[Dork's Love]

51
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,720
Yes.

52
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,850
I will leave. And I will make you regret it forever.

53
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,560
Finally, I'm done!

54
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,720
Is it solely my fault that the PPL (product placement) came out merely like that?

55
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,750
I mean, if the director gave it to me regularly each time, would I have had to squeeze them in like that?

56
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,550
I don't know! Don't call me!

57
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,190
I already feel like dying.

58
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,500
Ah, they should kiss and then she should slap him.

59
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,700
- Or should she slap him first?
- Writer.

60
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,380
Yeah?

61
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,830
I submitted the final draft.

62
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,300
I included the red ginseng and the perfume sponsors in the other episodes, too.

63
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,560
Okay, I got it.

64
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,380
Seriously.

65
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,030
Writer, I'm leaving now.

66
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,300
Where?

67
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,800
- Are you going home?
- Yes.

68
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,310
Okay. You worked hard.

69
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,090
It's been a month, right?

70
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,120
It's been three months.

71
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,700
Has it been that long really? All right. So you said you lived on the east side of the river, right?

72
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,130
No, west of the river.

73
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,560
West side?

74
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,300
Oh right. You said you lived with your older sister, right?

75
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,600
I live with my younger brother.

76
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,630
Who is that? Oh, go ahead.

77
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,120

00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,110
I'm going home.

Ah, as soon as I get home,

88
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,690
I want to take a warm shower,

89
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,620
and I want to jump into my bed with my blanket.

What is Ji Seok doing? That punk.

92
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,670
He mooches off of his sister, but he doesn't come to help.

93
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,370
Aigoo, let's have some realistic expectations.

94
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,620
If he hasn't burned the house down,

95
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,840
then that's a relief.

96
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,520
When you get home, sleep right away.

97
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,380
Don't do any cleaning or laundry.

98
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,430
- And don't answer any calls from Yang Ho Rang.
- Why?

99
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,720
They got into another fight. If you take her call, it'll be at least two hours.

100
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,610
- Ah, okay.
- Yeah.

101
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,540
I'm here.

102
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,330
Underwear! Really.

103
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,550
Yoon Ji Seok, I'm here.

Ho Rang

105
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,390
Uh huh, Ji Ho.

106
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,360
Let's be honest. Seven years ago, the way he was,

107
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,450
did he have the looks to mix words with someone like me?

108
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,720
I put all that effort into him and made him human and what?

109
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,810
He's living with a granny?

110
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,590
Granny was too much.

111
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,610
You just suppressed a laugh, right?

112
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,600
No, I didn't.

113
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,800
It's not.

114
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,210
Ji Ho, Ji Ho. I'm leaving. I'll tell you the details when we meet later.

115
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,900
Okay.

Ho Rang
Call duration: 41:54

117
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,430
She will tell me the details when we meet?

118
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,720
Did I have one of this color?

119
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,930
It's not my size.

120
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,040
Hey, Yoon Ji Seok!

121
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,540
Wow, his sister is here but he doesn't even come out of his room?

122
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,170
Can you listen to music when the house is a mess?

123
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,530
How many times do I have to tell you to wash the towels and underwear regularly—

124
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,950
You're playing games again, aren't you?

125
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,030
Aish, Noona!

126
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:50,190
- Ah, my eyes!
- No, no, wait! Wait a second!

127
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,400
Noona! Noona! Wait a second!

128
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,410
- Noona! Oh!
- Don't come! I said don't come!

129
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,160
Don't come near me!

130
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,400
Ah, just stop for a second!

131
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,880
- Hey! Leave!
- Wait, wait!

132
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,580
Noona, are you okay?

133
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,590
Did you twist your foot?

134
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,860
Oh, hey. Ji Seok. I'm okay.

135
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,410
Noona really has... really wants to be alone right now. So just go back and finish what you were doing.

136
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,420
What are you saying?

137
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,410
Let's go in. You have to say hi.

138
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,040
With who? The girl before?

139
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,070
The naked girl and me? No, no.

140
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,660
No, no.

141
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,880
I had an appointment today, but I forgot.

142
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,010
I'm a bit out of my mind.

143
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,450
I think I'll be really late coming home today, so

144
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,230
tell that girl to have a good time before going.

145
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,910
Right.

146
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,880
Noona's leaving.

147
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,250
Ah, really!

148
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,210
She's not leaving, she lives here.

149
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,700
Why?

150
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,690
She's... She's my wife.

151
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,590
Since when?

152
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,390
Uh, well it's been four months.

153
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,320
You're becoming an aunt.

154
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,190
You have a nephew! My girlfriend is pregnant.

155
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,090
It seems as though no one knows.

156
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,040
Today is my...

157
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,580
It's my 30th birthday.

158
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:32,290
- Episode 1 -
Because it's my first time being 30

159

It was hard coming up here, right Father-in-law?

160
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,060
Father-in-law?

161
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,930
No.

162
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,460
Isn't it hard for you, child (Daughter-in-law)?

163
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,360
Child (Daughter-in-law)?

164
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:08,790
You should've heard it from Ji Seok, but this happened while you were working outside, so he couldn't tell you.

165
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:14,450
Anyway, since you guys are family, share the bathrooms.

166
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,360
Be nice since we are living together.

167
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,370
- We're living together?
- We're living together? The three of us?

168
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,940
Why? You can't?

169
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,320
- No!
- Of course not!

170
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,000
- They're newlyweds, how could I—
- We're newlyweds, we can't live with Noona!

171
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,730
Then what can you do?

172
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,730
Hey, of course, Ji Seok has to leave.

173
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,690
You paid all of the bills and living expenses so far.

174
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,990
He's a student that mooches off of his sister. How dare he?

175
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:45,180
Hey, and that house is in your name. There won't be any problem legally.

176
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,690
That house is under Ji Seok's name.

177
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,780
What? Why?

178
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,650
You paid the provisional deposit when your dad bought that house!

179
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:59,390
Where did you come from? In Korea, if parents buy a house for their children living apart from them, of course, they will leave it in the son's name.

180
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,690
The family's future breeding expense and the expense for those offspring to take care of their memorials are all included.

181
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,780
The breeding of his father's seed depends on Ji Seok right now.

182
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,890
Do you think he would remember that tiny paycheck his daughter gave him?

183
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,110
Hey! Keep up with the times, that's so old-fashioned.

184
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,330
Ji Ho, you should go out and get pregnant tonight.

185
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:22,820
Get up. We're going to the club. Like them, you should get pregnant today and propagate.

186
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,690
Sure.

187
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,480
Are you still playing games—

188
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,350
Wait, wait.

189
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,610
Don't say suggestive words in front of me for a while.

190
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,520
I... To be honest...

191
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,710
I saw Ji Seok doing it with his wife, getting her pregnant.

192
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,920
- What?
- Ew!
- That's what I'm saying.

193
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,520
I wished that I'd never seen it.

194
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,030
I can't ever live with them.

195
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,250
But how?

196
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,830
I was on the veranda for a long time because I was calling you. So he must've thought I wasn't home.

197
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,410
Wait, how long was your phone call?

198
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,750
About forty minutes?

199
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,740
Then Ji Seok did that for forty minutes?

200
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,540
I didn't expect that from him.

201
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,470
Hey!

202
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,380
What? Leave right this instant?

203
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:30,190
Excuse me. I really thought of you as a little brother.

204
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:35,040
I, with the heart of an older brother, huh? Huh?

205
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,100
Two drops of vinegar here, please.

206
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,560
I thought of you as my biological brother!

207
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:48,460
I am your real brother! We're brothers! With this kind of mind. Do you understand?

208
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,840
I don't. I'm an only child.

209
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,870
This is the contract we signed in the beginning.

210
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,060
Our contract clauses were the following.

211
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,380
The tenant will carry out the clauses, A, B and C, while living in the landlord's home.

212
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,940
Your fulfillment of Clause A, none. Clause B, none. Clause C, none.
[A: Will take full responsibility of maintaining the house, B: Is in charge of recycling, C: Will care for the landlord's cat]

213
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,290
Then give me back this month's rent.

214
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,250
Last Friday night, you came home in a totally drunk state.

215
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,300
You forgot the password, so you kicked the door for ten minutes.

216
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,720
You thought they were tuna cans, so you ate five cans of cat food.

217
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,280
And you opened the refrigerator and did your business.

218
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,370
You were home?

219
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,230
- You said you were leaving for a business trip that da—
- The police even came.

220
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,350
Oh, right. Someone had reported it.

221
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,960
I was the one who reported you because you disturbed my sleep.

222
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,090
This bastard! You're crazy! Hey, you punk!

223
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,390
If you were home, then you could've come out and helped me!

224
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,970
This punk! Grab him!

225
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,720
Housemate Contract

226
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,820
How could you call the police on your own housemate?

227
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,430
Tell him he should consider himself lucky I didn't ask him for to pay for the fridge.

228
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,470
That sunbae is a really good person.

229
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,920
Chief Nam, you might not know about this, but there's something called "human touch" among humanity. Do you know what that 'touch' here means?

230
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,850
The 'touch' as in uncivilized?

231
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,420
No. As in flavor.

232
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,030
The flavor of human warmth!

233
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,960
You remind me of this, now that you mentioned 'flavor,' but that canned tuna cat food that jerk ate.

234
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,600
It's a lot more expensive than ordinary canned tuna since it's imported.

235
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,590
- Where are you going?
- Home.

236
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,830
What do you mean by home?

237
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:36,390
You have to complete the stabilization process by today. The new updated version is supposed to come out by next week.

238
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,030
The recycling is due by today, also,

239
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,000
I have to feed my cat, like a human being.

240
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,280
No!

241
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,400
I'm sorry. Go back to what you were doing.

242
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,620
Okay.

243
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:30,440
For five years, I was the one who took care of this house. It was me.

244
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:38,930
Despite that, this current situation overnight, where I'm being degraded to some freeloader.

245
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,380
Clearly...

246
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,110
It's a clear violation of basic rights.

247
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,510
It was you who supplemented the provisional contract money. It was you who bought the two-door fridge with your first salary.

248
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,670
And it was also none other than you, who switched out the broken boiler last year!

249
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:56,520
Say this to your father and protect your rights.

250
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,320
Father.

251
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,110
I have something to tell you.

252
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:14,560
I have something to tell you, Father.

253
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,210
Okay, go ahead child. What is it?

254
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,070
I went to the hospital today.

255
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,850
- Wait, wait!
- It's a boy.

256
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,300
- Really?
- The game...

257
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,190
Is over.

258
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,920
Hey! What is this luck!

259
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,690
Do you think Ji Ho is doing well?

260
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,650
There's a smell of screw up coming from somewhere.

261
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,600
I get a bad feeling.

262
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,560
Woo Soo, shall we have another glass of beer?

263
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,920
I'm full.

264
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,190
Then should we take a taxi and go to Itaewon? There are a lot of clubs there.

265
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,010
Don't do things you never used to do and just call Won Seok.

266
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,860
How many times have I told you I'm going to break up with him—

267
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,800
Did you not wear a bra again?

268
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,480
It's so frustrating. I can't digest anything when I drink.

269
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,960
Cover up. It's obvious.

270
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,590
Hey. Are you really going to break up with him?

271
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,260
Yeah. It's for real this time.

272
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,850
No contact for three days means that we should break up.

273
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:36,860
Waiting for each other and going to each other's house and clinging on like that. It's time to stop that.

274
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,430
Hey. She's going to a club.

275
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,020
Geez...

276
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,230
Mapo district - Sangahm Neighborhood
Rentals

277
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,010
Eat up.

278
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,890
Why seaweed soup this late at night?

279
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,520
You need to eat seaweed soup on your birthday (tradition).

280
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,950
Oh right. It was my birthday today.

281
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,970
I forgot.

282
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,700
Wow, it's so pretty!

283
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,350
What is that punk so happy about that he's laughing so much?

284
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:53,360
I told him to get a job and not a son.

285
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:00,030
What can we do though? It's already made and we can't return it.

286
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,520
What is it?

287
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,370
If you're going to look for a room, then you need a deposit.

288
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,120
You can't be squeezing a living between a newlywed couple either.

289
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,200
Mom.

290
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,840
Keep it a secret from Dad.

291
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,840
If he knew I secretly saved up a rainy day fund, he would make a fuss about it.

292
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:43,330
In my 30 years of life living in a patriarchy , my mom was always on my side.

293
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,350
The problem is...
(500,000 won, about $500)

294
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:03,280
She's too oblivious as to how this world works.

295
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,810
Loan

296
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,070
I'm sorry, Customer. I think it's going to be hard.

297
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,390
It's not possible at all?

298
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:21,890
Yes, you're currently a freelancer, and your yearly earning is less than $20K USD.

299
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,320
You don't have any insurance accounts either.

300
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,200
And your credit rating is in the 5th ranking too.

301
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,860
I'm sorry.

302
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,900
Excuse me.

303
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,160
This is a drama that I wrote. It was really popular last year.

304
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:40,300
Though it was a morning drama.

305
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,830
My identity is assured though. This here is my name, you see.

306
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,460
You can see my name here, Yoon Ji Ho.

307
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,100
Oh and just a second. I wrote this drama too.

308
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,610
Customer, I'm sorry.

309
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,010
Yes.

310
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,340
You must've not seen it.

311
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,640
Real Estate

312
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,800
Excuse me.

313
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,250
Yes, welcome.

314
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,250
I'm looking for a room.

315
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,600
How much do you have for your deposit?

316
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,590
About this much.

317
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,330
Oh, 3,000.

318
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,060
No.

319
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,510
Miss, know that you're in luck. If it weren't for me, you wouldn't be able to find a room like this.

320
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,020
Yes, I really wouldn't be able to.

321
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,510
Ahjussi, did someone draw this window?

322
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,520
Yes, it looks like a real window, right?

323
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:19,790
♫ All day long, you are on my mind. ♫

324
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,330
Threat of collapsing.

325
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,510
Frequent leaking and no soundproofing.

326
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,660
0.9 pyeong (32 sqft)
No kitchen
No bathroom

327
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,180
♫ I put on a quiet smile ♫

328
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,660
We've got a week left before we finish the new app update. Should we go over the checkpoints​?

329
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:52,060
Chief Nam, you said you would finish up the first round of security. Have you finished?

330
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,200
No. It is currently in progress.

331
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,440
Chief Nam. You need to at least give us the initial draft before the end of the day so we can—

332
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,980
It's impossible today.

333
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,770
It is not something that can be completed by the time we get off work at 6 pm.

334
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,410
No. What do you mean get off work?

335
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,330
That's why such a productive and romantic term like 'night shift'—

336
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,900
It would be hard to work overtime. Aside from the things that I must be the one to develop, I have made a list of the things that each could work on.

337
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:27,020
- Please, each do it on his own.
- Did you perhaps get an offer from another company?

338
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,250
Ah. That's not it.

339
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,670
I need to feed my cat in the evenings.

340
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,890
I also need to segregate the trash.

341
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,250
Right. I acknowledge that you are having it hard because of the housemate that I introduced.

342
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:55,000
But a grown adult acting up this way at work is bad. The deadline is next week.

343
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,700
CEO Ma. What was the first condition I had for entering this company?

344
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,490
Salary.

345
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,450
You should know.

346
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,230
Ah. It was so rhythm. It's not orgasm.

347
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,490
Ahhh! Algorithm.

348
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,100
In your life, the algorithm is—

349
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,890
The company should not break my life's algorithm.

350
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,570
Because of you, I lost my housemate. So this interrupted my algorithm.

351
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:26,640
Until my life pattern returns to normal, I can't work overtime.

352
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,800
Okay.

353
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:38,820
I will find that bastard a housemate and tie that bastard to the company.

354
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,060
You still don't know how scary of a person I am.

355
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:04,090
How many red ginseng scenes do I need to write to be able to live in a place like that?

356
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,770
Ho Rang

357
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,870
- Yes, It's Ji Ho.
 - Did you find a room yet?

358
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,210
Room? Not yet.

359
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,130
What? No deposit?

360
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,890
Just the monthly rent of 30 ($300).
- Thirty?!

361
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,230
Where is it? I can go right now.

362
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,150
But then there is a condition.

363
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,940
Ji Ho! Do you want to drink anything?

364
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,400
No, I'm okay.

365
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,200
Who is it? Someone Won Seok knows?

366
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,890
Yeah, it's a school sunbae's friend named Nam Se Hee.

367
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,680
There is a small room left in a 2-room townhouse so I think she wants to rent it out.

368
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,150
So it would be kind of a housemate.

369
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,650
Townhouse?

370
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,700
But then, she wanted a lot.

371
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,050
- She wants someone to move in right away.
- I can move in right away!

372
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,160
- And she wants a one-week adjustment period.
- Hey, I can even do one month!

373
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,440
She seems kind of crazy, but would that still be okay?

374
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:10,960
Hey, Ho Ran! I am an assistant writer who served the top 1% of the crazies of Korea for five years.

375
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,660
I can match with anything.

376
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,070
Okay. Then I will give your number to Won Seok right away.

377
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,320
You made up with Won Seok.

378
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,730
What do you mean make up? It's more like I was generous enough to to forgive him.

379
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,220
This worked out easily this time.

380
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,680
Won Seok has improved in placating you.

381
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,990
It did improve.

382
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,570
Another skill.

383
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,730
Okay. I won't hear the rest of it. I kind of got a hunch.

384
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,230
No... Last night, Won Seok—

385
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,740
Last night...

386
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,790
I can't hear! Please give me some water!

387
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:01,630
♫ Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you!

388
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:07,540
♫ To Noona whom we love, happy birthday to you.

389
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:12,170
Eun Sol bought a cake to celebrate your birthday. Make a wish.

390
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,280
Unni, what did you wish for?

391
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,090
I wished to be born as a snail in my next life.

392
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,030
- Why?
- Because they would never get chased out of their houses.

393
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,890
You're too much. Are you giving a pregnant woman hard time as an in-law?

394
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:41,160
We even bought you cake. This is why I can't live with you, huh!

395
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,800
Unni. If you leave like this... Unni please come by often.

396
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,390
But then, I am really okay with living with you.

397
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,680
Should I really live with you?

398
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:04,450
If Ji Seok goes to school, then both of us would need to stay together for the whole day.

399
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:09,230
Would I be able to leave all the housework to you who are pregnant?

400
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:16,270
Ji Seok, he'll end up asking me to babysit often.

401
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:22,370
Then I would work and do housework and watch the kid too?

402
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,570
I know it's because you're young and you don't know.

403
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,310
So don't make me the bad person.

404
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,770
I heard you like meat.

405
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:42,800
Go and buy meat, and if you have some left over

406
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,400
then add it to your father's hospital bill.

407
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:03,800
It's Matinum Town House, room 401. I sent you a map of it.

408
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,950
You can use this number to get in.

409
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,030
Excuse me.

410
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,350
Lately, I've been working overtime so I won't be at home early.

411
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,670
You see two rooms, right?

412
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:38,450
The room with the open door is yours.

413
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:48,650
My room's door will always be closed, so you don't need to worry about it.

414
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,030
I need to ask you a favor for three things.

415
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,890
First thing is to do the house chores.

416
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,550
Second thing is to empty the recycling once a week.

417
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,740
Last thing is to take care of my cat...

418
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,950
Hello.

419
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,870
...while I work overtime.

420
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:15,260
You have heard this already, but how about you try this for a week. What do you think about it?

421
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,680
Okay. It sounds good.

422
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,300
Geesh, nowadays we've got an intern period for renters, too? Seriously!

423
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,040
I heard her last housemate gave her a hard time.

424
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,380
I need to do my best. I like it.

425
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,100
The owner, what kind of job does she do?

426
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,100
I think she is a designer.

427
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,300
It's something with computer designing?

428
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:39,120
I didn't even get to meet her yet because she's been working overtime for couple days in a row. She must be really busy.

429
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,000
Ho Rang sent me a picture of her. Do you want to see it?

430
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,750
Here.

431
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,120
The one in the pink? She looks nice.

432
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,880
Hey, she was born in 1980. Doesn't she look young?

433
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,050
This unni takes care of herself really well.

434
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,460
What's her name?

435
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,060
Se Hee. Nam Se Hee.

436
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,750
Se Hee.

437
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,440
Yes, Bo Mi.

438
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,000
As you can see, the current registration process is too long, so people would leave,

439
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,400
especially on the profile edit page. In the new version, we should take this into consideration so we can have more success in membership registration.

440
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,980
Okay. I understand.

441
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,670
But, Bo Mi, isn't that uncomfortable?

442
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:35,630
That dress. It seems like you're wearing it every deadline.

443
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:40,010
I felt like I had to at least wear this in order to maintain my identity as a woman.

444
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,910
I guess you are working overtime. I have moved in as agreed.

445
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,460
Yoon Ji Ho

446
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,810
Did you have a good day? It's too late, so I am leaving a note.

447
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:35,250
Since today happens to be the recycling day, I emptied the recycling this morning.

448
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:42,940
Scheduled fumigation was completed at 11:00 am, and gas inspection was completed at 3:00 pm.

449
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:48,450
I fed the cat half a can of tuna and two cups of cat food.

450
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:54,820
Ah! There was chicken breast that was past 2 days in the refrigerator, so I cooked it and gave it to the cat as a snack.

451
00:33:54,820 --> 00:34:00,920
♫ There's that story of whatever ♫

452
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:07,800
♫ But only an aftertaste that's too long remains ♫

453
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,490
I guess you must be feeling good for the first time in a while.

454
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:19,890
♫  Stay with me.  ♫

455
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,300
P.S. What's the cat's name?

456
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,690
♫ Come with me  ♫

457
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:37,900
- 9:00 am
- 5:00 am

458
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:42,050
♫ In those lots of times  ♫

459
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:49,180
♫ Those who just pass each other by  ♫

460
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:56,300
♫ Please stay still as you are  ♫

461
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:03,390
♫ Am I going to travel another road all alone?  ♫

462
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,850
♫ Come with me ♫

463
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,730
Good morning to you too.

464
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:25,700
♫ Please just stay still for me without a sound  ♫

465
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,600
♫ Like we're sitting quietly  ♫

466
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:39,130
I would like to write a contract. What about today at lunch?

467
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,840
Okay! Then I'll visit you at your company today.

468
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,420
Oh, did you already decide on your roommate?

469
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,470
Everyone! Have you seen a CEO and company such as this?

470
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:07,430
I even thought of the living conditions for my employee, personally finding him a housemate. ♫ Have you ever seen a CEO like me?

471
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,130
How do you know this person?

472
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,590
That person is my school entrepreneurs club hoobae (junior), Won Seok's, friend.

473
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:19,970
Why? Do you not like him? Do you think you'll have to call the police on him again? Should I just find another person?

474
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,720
No. I love him so much.

475
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,130
So much?

476
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:34,060
Yes. I'm on the way to her office right now with the contract.

477
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,480
She's really busy.

478
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,820
That's really good to hear.

479
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:42,250
Since she's an unni Ho Rang knows, her personality should be fine, right?

480
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,990
Personality?

481
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,100
- I would like to write a contract. What about today at lunch?
- Oh, the cat's name is Kitty.

482
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,710
She might be a fun person.

483
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,300
Don't go with empty hands, get some snacks.

484
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,720
Don't worry about that. I was going to buy them something anyway.

485
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,170
He really loves the roommate very much.

486
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,560
In my entire life, this is the first time I've heard him use an adverb to describe a human.

487
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,180
He occasionally uses them.

488
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:22,160
CEO Ma is  freakin  late. CEO Ma's jokes are totally  not funny.

489
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,670
It's your concept, right? Trying to get attention.

490
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,500
If not, then are you trying to make me upset?

491
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,090
CEO, where are the sandwiches? It's been a while since we ordered them.

492
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:35,480
I know they are busy, but why are they always late?

493
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,930
It's just better if we go there and get it. It's five minutes away.

494
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:42,570
You are too nice. Should I go and get it myself?

495
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,720
Yes.

496
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,710
I understand.

497
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,910
I will go now.

498
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,160
Hello.

499
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,220
Well... I... the house...

500
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,780
The cat...

501
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,400
This...

502
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,000
Nam Se Hee

503
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,900
Ah, how can you be this late? Lunch is almost over.

504
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,900
Ah, I'm sorry.

505
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,850
I left when I got the message.

506
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:25,200
From what era is that excuse? Always saying I am on my way.

507
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,880
Yes. I'm sorry.

508
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,650
But, you look really young.

509
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,720
What? We never saw each other before.

510
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,700
This is our first time meeting in person.

511
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,860
- Thank you. Hurry up and give it to me.
- Okay.

512
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:45,620
I don't know how to thank you. This is a great opportunity for me.

513
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:49,530
You don't need to go as far as to call it an opportunity. It's just a fair trade in a capitalist society.

514
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,150
Ah, well you're right.

515
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:55,610
Please take care of me from now on.

516
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,720
Unni.

517
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,130
Can I call you unni?

518
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,890
No.

519
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,990
Okay. I'm sorry.

520
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,470
Then.

521
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,290
Oh, excuse me.

522
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,880
Perhaps, can I see you later at dinner time?

523
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,450
Well, we'll see.

524
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:22,470
She wants me to eat sandwiches for dinner too?

525
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:27,390
I guess she doesn't want me to call her unni.

526
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:34,190
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

527
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,740
Yoon Ji Ho

528
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,670
- This is really good. Where is this from?
- Eat a lot, so you can work harder.

529
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,600
That shop from earlier?

530
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,260
Housemate Contract

531
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,520
Se Hee. Come eat lunch. Sandwiches.

532
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,240
Who put this...?

533
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,870
I found it here. There's only one left.

534
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,090
Did you read the contract?

535
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,160
Yes.

536
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:19,340
I didn't tell you because you looked really busy.

537
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,110
I think I'll be late today.

538
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:37,370
Okay. From now on, you don't need to say these things to me.

539
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:40,550
She's really cool about these things.

540
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,710
How should I do it today? Like usual, the same cut?

541
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:52,000
No, today I'd like my hair to be curled and styled.

542
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,460
Ah, maybe something like this.

543
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,470
Where are you going? Blind date?

544
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,710
No. It's not a blind date.

545
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,950
Miss, later can you also fix my eyebrows?

546
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,510
I understand.

547
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,480
New Housemate (Yoon Ji Ho)

548
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,180
D-Day! Let's go, Arsenal F.C.!

549
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,880
Who is that?

550
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,800
It's the new housemate.

551
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,300
I guess he's into soccer.

552
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,290
Most guys like soccer.

553
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,820
That should be extent enough.

554
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,270
Thank you for the opportunity. Yoon Ji Ho.

555
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,450
You must like the color pink.

556
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,100
Yes. It's my signature color.

557
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,310
These days, do guys also use pink?

558
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:51,390
Your artistic sense is lacking, so you might not know.

559
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:55,020
Pink is a color that doesn't suit everybody.

560
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,080
My skin color is the right color for pink.

561
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,750
How can a man, pink . . .

562
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,140
I'm tired.

563
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,480
Why? Go back to work.

564
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,720
The times have changed

565
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,310
where you can find a boy or girl in pink.

566
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,980
Yes, it's the progressive era.

567
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:24,040
Excuse me!

568
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,800
Writer!

569
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,870
Come quickly.

570
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,250
- Welcome.
- Why are you late?

571
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,000
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

572
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,100
Look at your nice outfit.

573
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,900
So you have been a writer for couple years now, is that it?

574
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,290
Writer, is it okay for an assistant writer to be late to the wrap party?

575
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:51,430
You are being like that for no reason again.

576
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:56,070
You stop everyone from sitting next to you saying that it was for Writer Yoon.

577
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,150
Really?

578
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:01,350
You must have waited for me a lot!

579
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,560
I just felt hot,

580
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,620
so the seat here was empty.

581
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,630
Hey, I really hate to see you two.

582
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,970
If you want to date then date. If you want to sleep then go. Hurry and do it!

583
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,490
You guys have been just flirting for the past 3 years.

584
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,090
Who is the one resisting?

585
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,770
It's nothing like that.

586
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,930
Who you do think it is?

587
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,880
It's not me.

588
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,600
What.

589
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:32,560
Then... did Writer Yoon reject you?

590
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,830
Why? Do you not like him?

591
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,830
What do you mean reject, Director? Is Assistant Director some man?

592
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:42,070
He's a brother. Young Seok who didn't know anything,

593
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:45,010
I raised him for 3 years.

594
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:49,300
Hey! You are like her biological brother. I guess you really are not her type.

595
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,990
My pride is so hurt.

596
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:55,200
Writer Yoon, if you continue to be like this then I might go ahead and seduce you.

597
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,090
Really?

598
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:00,300
For you to do that, you can't pass out before I do.

599
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,470
- Come to me.
- Have a glass, Noona.

600
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,740
Right! One shot!

601
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,610
- How's the splash screen?
- No issues.

602
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,960
Okay. How's the app shutting-down issue at log-in?

603
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,240
I caught the bug.

604
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,140
The profile video upload?

605
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,800
Yes, it's working.

606
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,500
Good job!

607
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,650
Gyeolmalae, the 2.0 update.

608
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,630
It's updating. Please wait.

609
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,460
The update is complete.

610
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,270
It's done.

611
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:48,210
Yes!

612
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:51,940
For the past three weeks, in order to finish the 2.0 update,

613
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,200
everyone, for toiling through the hard work without complaint,

614
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,140
the thankfulness I feel for your hard work

615
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,460
I will repay through a generous end-of-the-year bonus!

616
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,350
Once a company Gyeolmalae that used to make less than 50,000₩ ($50) a month in sales,

617
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:12,960
for allowing the company to grow by more than 200% each year,

618
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,600
thank you, everyone, for your hard work.

619
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,150
Thank you.

620
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,180
This is a bit embarrassing, but let's shout out our motto.

621
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,960
- We are!
- Strangers!

622
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,910
- Let's get paid.
- For the work we put in!

623
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,850
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

624
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,450
- Drink up!
- Drink!

625
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:38,850
- That's hot!
- Why is the beer so hot?

626
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:43,210
I think you should change your clothes now.

627
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:46,360
I already changed my clothes.

628
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,800
Yesterday's were darker. Today's lighter.

629
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:57,010
Okay.

630
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,330
Daebak! We just saw Yoon So Hee in this restaurant!

631
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,810
- Really?
- Yoon So Hee?

632
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:09,300
Yoon So Hee? Who's that?

633
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,780
What? Is she an investor?

634
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,080
That's right.

635
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,520
Writer Yoon.

636
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:33,770
- Hello.
- Hello.

637
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:36,000
Writer, thank you for your hard work.

638
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,100
What did I do? So Hee, you're the one who did all the hard work.

639
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,220
Oh, not at all. Then, I'll head in first.

640
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,610
Yes.

641
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:53,270
Wow, so sensible.

642
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,340
I'm sorry, Writer. You had to do a lot of work on the last episode to cover for me.

643
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:04,330
What's with the sudden mention after working hard for three years?

644
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:09,460
I know, right? We've already known each other for three years.

645
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,860
Hey, Writer.

646
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:21,100
I have something to say to you, Writer.

647
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,160
Excuse me. I'm going through.

648
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,390
-Oh.
-Okay.

649
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:39,330
- I'm going to go... go for a walk
- Okay.

650
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,060
- Uhhh... Come back quickly.

651
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,510
Oh, shoot!

652
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:03,170
Sanchez.

653
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:10,910
I'm sorry.

654
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:13,650
I really wanted to watch that soccer game.

655
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,150
Shoot!

656
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,920
It's amazing!

657
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:36,530
Are you okay? Sorry.

658
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:39,220
Ah... so... It's just...

659
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:43,630
Last... Last game too,

660
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,820
Sanchez made an upset goal,

661
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,120
but they ruled it as an offside.

662
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:54,220
But it wasn't an offside. I rewatched the game at least 3 times.

663
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:57,740
If that goal were counted, Arsenal would've won.

664
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,030
Of course, I don't mean Wenger's strategy was all that great.

665
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,300
I'm sorry.

666
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,790
Arsenal.

667
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,250
Are you a fan?

668
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:28,460
Hey, Yoon Bo Mi, where's Nam Se Hee?

669
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:32,340
Hey, the CEO is talking to you, you rascal! Oh!

670
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,780
What?

671
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,810
Director Park, have you seen Writer Yoon?

672
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:37,470
I didn't see her.

673
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:39,440
Where did she go?

674
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:42,020
So, if you look at the real numbers,

675
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,770
Arsenal ranked fourth place seven times after the English Premier League was founded.

676
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:48,980
That's the same count as Liverpool has.

677
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,800
But those records, you personally...

678
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,860
Yes, I ran the statistics personally.

679
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:02,080
Honey, I'm out here. Parking lot.

680
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,390
You should go to your boyfriend.

681
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:14,610
No, he's not my boyfriend.

682
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:17,340
Not yet, for now.

683
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:22,800
For now, it's some. (some interest, some flirtation)

684
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:27,500
Actually earlier, I was almost about to get a love confession.

685
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,950
I was so nervous and then I ran away.

686
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:36,840
I was actually going to confess first if Arsenal won today.

687
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,870
I was going to . . .

688
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:47,060
Why am I here

689
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,290
confessing this to someone I never met until now?

690
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:54,230
He's handsome. His face and his height, too.

691
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,730
Right?

692
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:57,790
He's good looking, right?

693
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:06,220
I think he would score a 7 on a 10-point scale.

694
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,060
That's too stingy.

695
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,350
He's at least 9 points with his looks.

696
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:16,460
He's tall. His eyebrows are thick.

697
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,950
He's got shoulders, and he's got a profession—

698
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,990
- Aigoo.
- I miss you.

699
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:31,910
A girlfriend, also.

700
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:37,470
Shoot

701
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:42,900
GOAL

702
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,930
When I think about it, not once

703
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:49,170
have I ever played the attacking forward in my life.

704
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,160
- Thank you.
- You worked so hard.

705
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:54,220
No, Writer, thank you.

706
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,970
Writer.

707
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:57,890
Oh Writer, come sit here.

708
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:00,310
Where did you go? I missed you.

709
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:02,030
Me too.

710
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:04,790
Drink up. I'm tired of this.

711
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:06,100
Let's work together again.

712
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,310
Thank you.

713
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,920
Always, I would play adequate defense and back off In a timely way.

714
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:21,620
From Assistant Director: Writer, I'm dating. I was going to tell you in front of the bathroom earlier.

715
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:26,000
Neither the courage to take on the ball if it came to me,

716
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,720
nor a little ability to evade it either.

717
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,380
Just a garden variety defender.

718
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,490
Really? Daebak! Congrats!

719
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,040
CEO Ma?

720
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:46,310
Do you know you're bullying me right now?

721
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,040
I believe it was in our working condition agreement that I only do one round of after work engagement.

722
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,700
I'll take you home. I'll call a driver.

723
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,060
It's fine. I'm taking the bus.

724
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:57,340
The bus is faster than your car.

725
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,600
I said that I'm going to take the bus. The bus!

726
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:05,980
Oh, right. There's a subway, too.

727
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,340
Just take the bus.

728
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:17,170
Can't you just take the bus?

729
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:21,960
I think that will make me feel less embarrassed.

730
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,080
That's why.

731
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,280
Are you sure you will feel less embarrassed?

732
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,480
No.

733
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,730
This is my first time in this neighborhood.

734
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:49,970
I don't go out often, and I dislike traveling too.

735
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:52,170
If I'm not at home, then I'm in the office.

736
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:56,790
So, we will never see each other again.

737
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:00,390
It will take more than ten minutes until the bus comes.

738
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,080
You don't have to feel uncomfortable.

739
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,050
You don't have to feel embarrassed either.

740
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:11,540
To me,

741
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,870
I just feel embarrassed.

742
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:19,450
Not to you, but to me.

743
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:24,280
At age 30 already, I can't even decipher what a man's kindness means.

744
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:30,080
All by myself for three years, getting my heart frozen then melted

745
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,990
at 30 years old, in that state of torment.

746
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,680
I'm embarrassed in front of my own heart.

747
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,230
Not even a 20-year-old.

748
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:45,490
At my age of 30, I don't even know what I'm doing.

749
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,360
So that's why

750
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,640
you needn't be bothered by it.

751
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:00,610
You used "30 years old" three times in that short sentence.

752
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:02,900
So, it's a disaster of the neocortex.

753
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,190
What?

754
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,540
Twenty years old, 30, the part in charge of those time-related concepts.

755
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,320
It's the neocortex on the outer layer of the head.

756
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,880
Cats don't have a neocortex, unlike humans.

757
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,570
So even though they eat the same cat food every day, in the same house every day, living each day the same,

758
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:22,240
they don't feel depressed or bored.

759
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,470
To them, time is only the current moment.

760
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:31,310
Because I'm 20. Since I'm 30. Because I'm 40 soon.

761
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:35,490
The species that confines themselves into partitions of time like that.

762
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:38,260
It's only humans who do that.

763
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:41,620
Only humans attack age as a weakness, to spend money,

764
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:44,270
and it causes them to spend emotions.

765
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,250
It's the price we humans pay for

766
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,710
having an evolved neocortex.

767
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,020
Thirty years, 40 years.

768
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,760
For cats, it's the same thing every day.

769
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:03,150
It was strange.

770
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,740
His strange words.

771
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:11,120
That day, more than any other words, I was comforted by those words.

772
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:16,120
I...

773
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,300
What's your name?

774
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:27,050
Perhaps, is it better if I don't know your name?

775
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,460
Yes.

776
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:30,740
Okay.

777
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,900
By a person I'll never see again,

778
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,750
I was comforted.

779
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,830
You were comforted because I'm a person you won't see again.

780
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:49,560
Thinking about not seeing him again,

781
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,140
I felt really sad.

782
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:57,320
Thank you for telling me about the neocortex.

783
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:02,450
I think this life is a bit of a failure,

784
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,920
but I'll try my best.

785
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,730
I wish you the best of luck.

786
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:15,800
Anyway, this life is the first for everyone.

787
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:20,370
For a moment, I had forgotten.

788
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:24,630
This life.

789
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,530
This moment.

790
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:35,930
You only get one chance.

791
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:53,650
♫ I'm in love. To you.  ♫

792
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:57,380
♫ The moment I fall for you.  ♫

793
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:03,430
♫ So in love. It's strange. ♫

794
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:07,240
♫ I am not myself.  ♫

795
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,400
It was such a long day.

796
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:18,060
I moved out from the house I had lived in for five years.

797
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:22,140
I ended a 'some' relationship of three years.

798
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:25,500
I kissed a man whom I had just met.

799
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,540
You are amazing, Yoon Ji Ho.

800
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,800
♫ You are my everything.  ♫

801
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,920
♫ Open up my closed heart.  ♫

802
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,270
♫ Loving you, to me,  ♫

803
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:42,690
♫ come closer more.  ♫

804
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:46,570
♫ Come embrace me  ♫

805
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,450
♫ Until forever  ♫

806
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:52,350
♫ I want to be a special person to you ♫

807
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:58,240
♫ Will you tell me? If I wait  ♫

808
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,850
♫ I'm in loving, loving  ♫

809
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:03,860
It's not what I imagined my life would be at 30,

810
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:07,220
but for a 30th year I had never lived before,

811
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:09,310
it's not that bad.

812
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:17,260
Just like what he told me, the person I will never get to meet again,

813
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,350
we are living this life for the first time.

814
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:33,560
♫ Thinking of you  ♫

815
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,450
♫ I put on a quiet smile  ♫

816
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:46,350
Because This Is My First Life

817
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:48,950
Should I just live with her if she scores this high?

818
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:51,450
Is this score possible?

819
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:54,100
Does that man also live here?

820
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,270
How on earth did you get in here?

821
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:57,980
Why is your housemate...

822
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:00,280
The house owner is a man?

823
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:05,570
Let's pretend that I didn't hear it.

824
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,770
Did that rascal make a move on you?

825
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,770
This place is my son's house.

826
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:11,490
What?

827
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:13,660
I can't hear anything.

828
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:17,870
This place is the only place where I can sleep.

829
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:19,200
I'm sorry.

830
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,540
You were the one to kick me out, did you know that?

831
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:30,380
♫ Drawing out the many stars  ♫
