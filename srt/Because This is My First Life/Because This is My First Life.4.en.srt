1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,270
Because This Is My First Life

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,230
Lee Min Ki

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,200
Jung So Min

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,310
- Esom
- Park Byeong Eun

5
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,010
- Kim Ga Eun
- Kim Min Seok

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,120
Because This Is My First Life

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,470
Guys, it's burning. Flip it.

8
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,190
When does her bus leave?

9
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,330
Seven o'clock.

10
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,930
She should be on the bus now.

11
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,190
Come on now. It's not like she immigrated to North Europe or something, right?

12
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,340
She went back to her own home, right?

13
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,130
Namhae is just 4 hours away. Only 3 if you race over.

14
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,260
It's not that.

15
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,270
It took a lot for Ji Ho to come up to Seoul.

16
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,800
What do you mean it took a lot. She didn't even need to resit her entrance exams. She got accepted in one blow and came up immediately.

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,660
Hey, let's say you got accepted into Harvard.

18
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,250
It's tough if your house doesn't allow you to attend.

19
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,120
What about her household?

20
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,130
Ji Ho's father told her that they wouldn't support her college education if she didn't go to Namhae School of Education, saying that going to Seoul cost more.

21
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,560
Is that right? Then how did she make it up here?

22
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,160
You see, Ji Ho...

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,100
is a little...

24
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,400
crazy.

25
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,710
Ji Ho? No way. She's the world's softest heart.

26
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,490
I see you don't quite know her yet.

27
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,360
10 years ago

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,820
Hey, these grades are decent.

29
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,080
Ji Ho's dad's values were unwavering.

30
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,400
If she's not going to be a judge or prosecutor, becoming a teacher was the way to go for women.

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,590
But her grades didn't meet the bar to be admitted into Seoul National University's School of Law.

32
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,400
Seoul National University's School of Law - 124 minimum.

33
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,110
But Ji Ho's dream has always been to become a writer, so she decided to go to the School of Korean Literature & Korean Studies.

34
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,330
So in the middle of their meal, she began to utter the word "literature," and then...

35
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,220
Father. The School of Lit—

36
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,230
Argh!

37
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,350
Her father really flipped over the soup ("guk" means soup & is also the first syllable for the Literature & Korean Studies major).

38
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,990
Heol. Then how did she convince him?

39
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,320
Convince him, my butt. We told you. She's a psycho.

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,400
She secretly finished registration, and on the day before the matriculation ceremony...

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,170
Namhae to Seoul

42
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,210
...she ran away in the middle of the night.

43
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,430
Where are you? Dad's in front of your school. Come out.

44
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,130
Ji Ho's dad thought that Ji Ho was attending the Namhae University School of Education all the way to the end of the first semester.

45
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,240
Wow. Ji Ho really has some craziness in her.

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,150
I thought that she was the craziest one out of you three.

47
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,060
Nope. Soo Ji just has a bad temper.

48
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,550
Yoon Ji Ho has a tendency to come out when you least expect it and smack you on the back of your head.

49
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,220
The driver ahjussi is mad at me, so I can't linger here for too long.

50
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,540
So you need to answer me quickly.

51
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,710
I can.

52
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,720
Will you... marry me?

53
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,470
Hurry. He's waiting.

54
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,920
I will.

55
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,600
Then, I'll bring out my luggage first.

56
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,690
The driver ahjussi is really mad, you see.

57
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,430
Wait.

58
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,720
I have one question to ask you first.

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,550
Yes, go ahead.

60
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,700
Do you perhaps...

61
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,030
like me?

62
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,470
No.

63
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,730
Bring your luggage over. I'll head in first.

64
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,590
I saw that you washed the cup the cup noodles came in.

65
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,160
Oh, yes. It's a habit of mine.

66
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,270
You really have a great habit.

67
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,220
Thank you.

68
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,370
- Oh! There's an open seat. You sit down, honey.
- No, you can sit down dear.

69
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,300
No, you sit down Honey.

70
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,030
Give me your bag.

71
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,710
- Your hair turned out great!
- Right?

72
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,250
- It's hot.
- Is it?

73
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,550
Have a seat.

74
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,260
Oh, you take a seat first.

75
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,950
No, no.

76
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:05,590
I am about to get married to my landlord.

77
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,310
My conditions are the same as before.

78
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,480
Do you have anything to say on that?

79
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:28,420
Well... I don't have any other opinions on your conditions.

80
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,500
Then perhaps is there something you would like?

81
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,760
As you know, I quit my job.

82
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:47,340
So until I can find a new job, I may need to tweak my budget for living costs.

83
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:53,110
If you could discount the rent a little.

84
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,020
By how much do you have in mind?

85
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,780
If you can give just $50 off,

86
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,880
I wouldn't struggle as much either.

87
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,460
Sure, let's do that then.

88
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,210
Then we can re-sign the contract at $250 per month.

89
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,490
Yes.

90
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,440
Thank you.

91
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,720
Aren't you overdoing it?

92
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,790
The marriage.

93
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,610
Considering your situation, isn't it more economical for you to head home?

94
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,110
No.

95
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,250
Even if I head home, I need to find a job anyway.

96
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,970
And on top of that, it's clear as day that I will butt heads with my father on a daily basis.

97
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,550
Sure, I won't need to pay rent,

98
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,400
but nothing else will be better compared to how things are in Seoul.

99
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,590
There aren't as many employment opportunities there either.

100
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,240
So it seems you have stressors that surpass those that come from paying rent.

101
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,540
Even so, I was a little surprised.

102
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,770
I thought that your concept of marriage was based on a foundation of love.

103
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,520
So when you chose marriage as a tenant,

104
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,320
it was actually very unexpected.

105
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,180
I just... as you said already,

106
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:29,970
affection or love...

107
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,240
I felt I wouldn't be needing those things for at least 2 years.

108
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,900
What I need now is that room over there.

109
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,130
Today, I decided to marry my tenant.

110
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,950
I know. It's an abnormal decision, unlike other people.

111
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,920
To be honest,

112
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,670
for at least once in my lifetime,

113
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,150
I wanted to do it.

114
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,460
Marriage.

115
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,470
Even more than I had anticipated...

116
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,610
Oh! Did you recycle this week?

117
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,490
I have met a unique wife.

118
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,960
- Episode 4 -
Because This Is My First Marriage.

119
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,270
Wow.

120
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,560
I slept...

121
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,960
really well.

122
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,830
Did you have a good sleep?

123
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,380
Yes.

124
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,690
Do you want to have some? I was just thinking that I might have made too much for breakfast.

125
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:42,700
No, I'm fine with just a cup of Americano for breakfast.

126
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,290
Okay.

127
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,810
♫ Everything I have come to believe for such a long time ♫

128
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:01,860
♫ One by one and slowly, they are changing ♫

129
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:09,600
♫ I don't know anymore
Even today is unknown to me  ♫

130
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,810
It's great, the food and sleep.

131
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,700
I don't remember the last time my morning was honey-like like today.

132
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,380
Messerer was right. It's tough enough eating and sleeping.

133
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,710
How can I date and love in this state?

134
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:31,920
I, who can't even come up with $5K in deposit money got to haggle down to $50 dollars off of rent.

135
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,000
How much would that add up to in 2 years?

136
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,560
You made a great decision, Yoon Ji Ho.

137
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,200
I'm comfortable. Both Kitty and I.

138
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,100
It's been so long since I had such a peaceful weekend.

139
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,780
I no longer have to suffer through blind dates

140
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,210
and stress about recycling.
[Ji Eon]

141
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,220
I got to reclaim this priceless peace for just a $50 dollar discount on rent.

142
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,640
Uhm, I used an egg today. I'll refill it later.

143
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,130
Yes.

144
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:28,100
As expected. Marrying my tenant was the answer.

145
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,610
Yes, it's Ji Ho.

146
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,970
What? Was it today?

147
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,710
Oh. Okay.

148
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,700
Okay, I'll call you later.

149
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,830
Have a safe trip. Okay.

150
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,340
Was that your parents?

151
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,620
Ah, yes. They're coming to Seoul for a wedding.

152
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,950
I think I need to go to my brother's later.

153
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,270
Then, should I go today too?

154
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,610
What? Why?

155
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,980
If we're going to get married, I should at least give my greetings to them.

156
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:12,450
Ah, that's right. That's a must do if we're getting married.

157
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,990
Honestly, I already planned out the process last night.

158
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,850
Ah, then...
Process of 2-year Marriage with the Tenant

159
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,960
1. Family introductions; 2. Book venue; 3. Shop for wedding photographer, dress, and makeup

160
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,500
4. Wedding photoshoot; 5. Newlywed home/furnishings; 6. Dowry and wedding gifts; 7. Honeymoon; 8. Wedding ceremony

161
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,450
We're doing everything?

162
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,070
As you can see, this is a normal wedding.

163
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,020
For a wedding based on love for one another, this is the normal process one goes through.

164
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,860
For us, we can just skip all of these.

165
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,630
This part. We can just carry it out to this part.

166
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,880
Yes. Then are you coming over to my household today to give your greetings?

167
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,690
In my opinion, that is most efficient.

168
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,230
However, if it's too fast then...

169
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,330
No. Let's go today.

170
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,550
Yes.

171
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,020
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

172
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,260
- Seul Gi.
- Yes, Manager.

173
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,950
You took the wrong order to Table 13, didn't you?

174
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:19,180
Oh, yes. I'm sorry. I won't repeat the same mistake next time.

175
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,170
That wouldn't make sense then.

176
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,320
- Yes?
- How can you not make mistakes when you're still in the second month of training?

177
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,210
Just whenever you make a mistake, tell me so I can quickly take care of it.

178
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,170
Yes, Manager.

179
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,670
- There's a reservation for Table 3, so go set it up.
- Yes.

180
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,200
What the heck? Why didn't you tell me?

181
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,280
I'm seriously going to get mad at you! We had 5 bottles of rice wine because of you yesterday.

182
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,400
That's why I came here immediately.

183
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,170
So what? Are you moving back in as his housemate again?

184
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,110
Yeah, I'm his housemate, but

185
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,780
honestly it's a long story. I'll tell you when all 3 of us are together this weekend.

186
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,440
Did you tell Soo Ji? What did you she say?

187
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,240
Well, when I called her, she just said we should go out for a drink.

188
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,420
She already drank that much, but she can still have more?

189
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,720
I think she's a rabbit. She gets her liver sucked empty somewhere all the time, I think.

190
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,240
However, what is this? Meat? Beef?

191
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,220
Ah! I have to go somewhere later.

192
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,550
Now that I'm taking a closer look, you dressed up today.

193
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,760
Oh, what's got you putting on a purse too?

194
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,510
What is this?

195
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:41,050
This feels like you're going to meet someone important.

196
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,440
- Hey, you.
- Yeah?

197
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,410
You must be meeting a new writer, right?!

198
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,730
- Yes!
- That's right. You thought it out well.

199
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,280
It's not like there are no other writers or directors in this world. It would've been a waste if you quit because of them.

200
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,630
- I have something to ask you, Ho Rang.
- What is it?

201
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:12,390
When a man goes to a girl's house to give his greetings,

202
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,930
what type of things should he say to the parents?

203
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:22,570
You see, like if you want to get their approval for marriage.

204
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,040
Why are you curious about that?

205
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,100
N-No... well...

206
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,480
That must be for a script.

207
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,510
Is the new writer testing you? Well, I'm pretty skilled in that field.

208
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,290
Right?

209
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,620
♫ Even if you say no to love and it passes by  ♫

210
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,860
♫  When you're in front of me  ♫

211
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:09,320
♫ And I want to hold your hand and anything is fine  ♫

212
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,600
♫ I become wanting to love you
Even if I say no to love and it passes by  ♫

213
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,870
♫  When your'e in front of me  ♫

214
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,880
- You're here early.
- Yes!

215
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,180
♫ It's still okay and I want to be in love  ♫

216
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,080
Get up. The bus is coming. Let's go.

217
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,450
Ah, yes.

218
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,760
♫ I become wanting to love  ♫

219
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:51,570
Then are there any other things I need to worry about besides those three?

220
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:58,170
There is one more variable. My younger brother can get a little bit out of control.

221
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,370
What is he like exactly when he gets out of control?

222
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,480
No, forget it. I'll take care of that.

223
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,680
I think if you take extra caution around my dad, then you'll be fine.

224
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,970
Yes. I'll remember those three methods.

225
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,120
If those three methods don't work,

226
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,810
then I'm afraid you might have to use another special method.

227
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,010
What other method would that be?

228
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,740
This can be something that you might not be a fond of, but

229
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,740
I asked for advice from my friend since

230
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,710
she's an expert in marriage.

231
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,280
The most important phrase to say to your father-in-law to win his favor.

232
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,410
First, "I will make it so that your daughter's hand won't have to touch water." (won't let her have a hard time e.g., wash dishes, do laundry, clean)

233
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,340
Second, "I will have your daughter be called Mrs. of the Boss or Madam."

234
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,480
Third, "I'll treat your daughter like a princess for the rest of my life."

235
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,290
Fourth, "I will love her until the day I die."

236
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,510
This? This works?

237
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,940
Yes. Probably.

238
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,610
No. I'll try my best to prevent this situation from happening.

239
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:24,460
Noona! You look better after moving out now.

240
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,010
These are all new clothes.

241
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,950
- No, they're not. I always had these.
- No, this is a bag I've never seen before either.

242
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,640
- I always had...
- I think not.

243
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,440
It's a man I've never seen before.

244
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,370
Oh, he's my boyfriend. Give him your greetings.

245
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,170
It's nice to meet you. I'm Nam Se Hee.

246
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,470
Yes. I'm Yoon Ji Seok.

247
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,640
- Are Mom and Dad home?
- Yeah.

248
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,310
Oh, you didn't eat dinner yet, right? Come on in!

249
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,690
Please, come on in!

250
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,530
He doesn't seem that bad.

251
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,460
- He doesn't seem to get that out of contro—
- Mom! Dad!

252
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,140
Noona brought over a man and he has both arms and legs! Come here!

253
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,210
- What did you say?
- Mom! Mom! Hurry and come out! I'm serious!

254
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,560
I'm serious. For real. One-hundred percent the truth!

255
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,800
Hurry up and come here.

256
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,230
Don't you like the crab soybean stew?

257
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,030
She put in a big crab and boiled it so much.

258
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,740
It's so precious that you can't even eat this in Seoul.

259
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,190
Pardon?

260
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,830
It means for you to eat a lot.

261
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,880
Ah! Yes, I will eat it deliciously.

262
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,810
Have a glass.

263
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,300
Okay.

264
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:24,400
Because my family is so patriarchal you can just focus on my father.

265
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,660
You just need to remember three things. First, the first glass, you must drink it in one go.

266
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,210
Pour me a glass too.

267
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,980
What do you do?

268
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:48,030
In a startup that develops social networking applications, I work as a lead developer and CTO.

269
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,830
Second, you should give a direct reply. He can't hear if it's more than two words.

270
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,220
I work in the IT industry.

271
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,040
Oh. IT.

272
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,990
Right. What IT?

273
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,060
Yes, it concerns developing apps for cellphones.

274
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,570
Oh, app.

275
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,350
That. - Is it a subcontractor that manufactures electronics?

276
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,140
Third, if you have to explain, use examples.

277
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,040
And one that is famous.

278
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:27,830
So, these days, the one that's used widely, like KakaoTalk.

279
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,840
Oh. All right.

280
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,310
Where is the company located?

281
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:35,160
Yes, at co-working space in which many startups are located—

282
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,220
It's the building in between Samsung and LG.

283
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,380
Ohh! That's good. That's great.

284
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:50,180
Right, the heyday of corporations is over.

285
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,570
Katalk and Facebook. Making those is the fourth Industrial Revolution.

286
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:00,160
If he gets excited and talks by himself then it's almost mission clear.

287
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,300
Even if you don't do anything, the car drives itself.

288
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,780
This is called the fourth Industrial Revolution.

289
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,880
It drives itself.

290
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,180
That's enough. Eat.

291
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,190
Didn't you put too much amberjack in this dish?

292
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,110
Dad.

293
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,300
So... We...

294
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,820
want to get married.

295
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,510
Oh my gosh.

296
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,870
Daebak!

297
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,570
Marriage?

298
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,180
I know it's sudden.

299
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:48,870
We both are of age already. And if we're doing it, then we should do it as fast as possible.

300
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,790
Noona, do you have a baby in your belly?

301
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,480
Baby in belly?

302
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,930
No.

303
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,550
I'm not pregnant.

304
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,600
But then, why did that come up here?

305
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,880
So, a baby in be...

306
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,720
He asked if I was pregnant.

307
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,390
What?

308
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,780
No. Of course not. That never happened.

309
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,340
Even though we do share a living space, we have never crossed personal—

310
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,050
You two are living together?

311
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:27,370
So the person that you were living with was your boyfriend?

312
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,510
What did you say?

313
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,410
Living together?

314
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,280
You are living together!

315
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,810
- That's not it!
- Is that how I taught you?!

316
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:44,760
Why are you only doing bad things since coming to Seoul!

317
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,630
- Cohabitating?
- Stop it and sit down.

318
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,720
Wench! Are you crazy? Have you gone mad?

319
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,000
Should I shave your head and lock you up in the room?

320
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,710
Wait. There's a misunderstanding.

321
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,270
Our cohabitating right now is not that kind.

322
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,700
What? Cohabitating?

323
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,270
Did you just say cohabitating?

324
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,060
I am working hard to straighten out the misunderstanding right now.

325
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,250
If you listen to what I have to say—

326
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,460
Looking like a broom, how would you dare open your mouth and talk back to me?

327
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,090
Oh! Should I just!

328
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:37,300
Your d-daughter...

329
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,350
I will make it so that your daughter's hand won't have to touch water!

330
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,660
Aigoo. So comfy.

331
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,930
Manager, won't you get sick of that sofa even before you buy it?

332
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:03,480
What do you mean, get sick? I even planned out the interior with this sofa in mind.

333
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,780
I was wondering why you're not coming today.

334
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,160
The sofa will be delivered next week.

335
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,610
Ah. Yes.

336
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,890
Seul Gi, did you buy this?

337
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,920
Yes.

338
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,850
Didn't you say you live in a studio?

339
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,910
Is there space for the sofa to fit in?

340
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,640
I... will be moving.

341
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,970
Honestly, I'll be getting married next month.

342
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,000
- What?
- Congrats!

343
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,350
Congrats!

344
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,360
Manager, I'm sorry.

345
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,420
Huh? About what?

346
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,940
Why to me?

347
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,890
Because you wanted to buy this sofa so badly,

348
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,470
and they said there was only one left.

349
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:49,760
I was going to buy something else but Oppa said he liked it too.

350
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,390
What's with the atmosphere?

351
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:00,160
Never mind. I can just buy a different one. What's the problem?

352
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,070
Unni, I'm leaving.

353
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,200
See you tomorrow.

354
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,450
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

355
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,350
Have a safe trip.

356
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,750
- That's good news.
- Where did you meet him?

357
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,910
Park Grocery Store

358
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,400
- Ho Rang.
- Seok.

359
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,990
Come out and pick me up.

360
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,750
It's so loud. Where are you?

361
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,380
I'm out, I'm with Hyung Sang Goo.

362
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,990
What? Why are you only telling me that now?

363
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,980
I thought you were going to a company dinner tonight?

364
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,730
I just came to have dinner with you.

365
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,550
Really?

366
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,510
Then can you wait for a while? I'll be done in about 30 minutes.

367
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,180
I'm very hungry. What 30 minutes?

368
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,590
Forget it. I'll eat alone.

369
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,140
Rang. Rang!

370
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,930
Did you fight again with your girlfriend?

371
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,540
What's wrong with her these days?

372
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,490
Tell me what it's about.

373
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,740
I don't know. That's why I'm flipping out.

374
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,850
Give it to me.

375
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,510
What?

376
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,680
Your phone. The expert will analyze the data for free.

377
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,310
Never mind. I know my Rang best.

378
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,100
Fine if you don't.

379
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,430
Now, I'll be analyzing the data.

380
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,250
"I love you. What are you doing?"

381
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,980
"I want to eat baby octopus. Let's eat baby octopus tomorrow."

382
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,360
Hey, hey.

383
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:34,420
This is the contentious picture.

384
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,810
Our restaurant's youngest bought that sofa as a wedding gift.

385
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,250
There was only one left.

386
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,870
Seul Gi got a good deal. Congrats congrats!

387
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:46,700
Seul Gi got a good deal, Congrats congrats? Are you crazy?

388
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,770
What about that?

389
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:52,370
You. You are not able to comprehend the metaphor in this message for real now, right?

390
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,910
She sent the photo, so I said that she's pretty. She said her coworker is getting married so, I congratulated her.

391
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,950
If it's not that, is there something else?

392
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,430
Oh my god.

393
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,140
Here. Look at this.

394
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,910
This photo, did she send this as her photo?

395
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,620
And does it seem like a message to congratulate her coworker?

396
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:15,910
You can't comprehend what both signals have in common? You fool?

397
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,330
Sofa?

398
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,900
Wait. How could she mention the sofa that way?

399
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,430
If she wants to buy it, then she can.

400
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,660
If you buy it, do you have space for it in that cramped rooftop room?

401
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,600
How could a woman bring it up herself?

402
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,810
Ah. Ah!

403
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,250
Ah, oh my.

404
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,460
Here. Ah.

405
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:46,390
So that's why she always mentioned a newlywed house and the sofa.

406
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,340
I'm feeling good, so I will tell you something important.

407
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:55,350
Women never say with their own mouth what they want to a man.

408
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,610
Never.

409
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:01,250
They hope to hear what they want from the man.

410
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:06,420
So, in order to hear what they want from the man they keep on saying it.

411
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:09,430
They keep on talking in twists and turns.

412
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:14,410
They shoot out like lightning, then thump thump like thunder, then all cutesy in twists and turns, then

413
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,770
they turn and turn.

414
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,420
Then.

415
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,650
You understand.

416
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:25,030
That's why someone like you, who is not an expert, always has a hard time.

417
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,170
Ah! As expected. Hyungnim.

418
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,600
You don't do dating with your face but with skill.

419
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,730
Well, you can do dating with your face, too.

420
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,490
Who am I? I'm Ma Sang Goo.

421
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,380
Sang Goo with devilish charms.

422
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,140
I'm that kind of man.

423
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,660
Sang Goo with devilish charms. Sang Goo with devilish charms.

424
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,510
Here, have some water.

425
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,640
Okay.

426
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,810
Your d-daughter's hands...

427
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:26,940
I will make sure your daughter's hand does not touch water!

428
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,990
Water... it is.

429
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,950
Is your knee okay?

430
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:43,310
I also wanted to avoid kneeling at all cost.

431
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:47,960
If my dad flips the table over, it's game over. So I didn't have a choice.

432
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,520
But thanks to that you got my father's trust.

433
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,020
Who on earth made that saying?

434
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,470
Not having water touch the hands?

435
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:02,350
Could that be realistically possible?

436
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,810
There were a lot of nominees too.

437
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,750
I chose the best out of those!

438
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,430
Good night.

439
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,270
The most important phrase to say to your father-in-law to win his favor. Second, "I will have your daughter be called Mrs. of the Boss or Madam." Third, "I'll treat your daughter like a princess for the rest of my life." Fourth, "I will love her until—

440
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,920
He did choose the best out of them.

441
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,340
How did the meeting go?

442
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,080
Okay. Thanks to you.

443
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,090
Ji Ho, I'm so upset.

444
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,750
I fought with Won Seok again.

445
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,710
Huh? Why?

446
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:44,450
I don't know. I'm tired of it. I want to give up.

447
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,300
Let's meet tomorrow and eat.

448
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,870
My honey

449
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,530
Rang, you sleeping?

450
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,280
I'm sorry.

451
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,930
All this time, you had a hard time because of me, right?

452
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,270
I should have understood sooner.

453
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,560
What?

454
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,410
I'm sorry I made you wait for so long.

455
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,840
I understand it all now,

456
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,890
so I will take care of it.

457
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,690
You couldn't even tell me outright all this time.

458
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,880
Don't cry.

459
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,370
Come here.

460
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:15,000
I don't know, you dummy.

461
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,150
Even the last sofa has been sold to my youngest co-worker.

462
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,430
Forgive me just this time.

463
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,400
Just this time.

464
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,640
Will you forgive me?

465
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,400
Are you heading to work?

466
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,650
Yes.

467
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,040
It's the fee for the gift set that was given yesterday.

468
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,780
I thought it would be right to split it.

469
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,580
No, it's okay. It's on me for that.

470
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,780
You work hard too.

471
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,670
Is your knee okay?

472
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:05,100
Now when I think about it...

473
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,850
I think you made a wise decision.

474
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,420
In the process, greeting the parents of each side is the most important.

475
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,940
Since your side has been settled neatly with your decisiveness,

476
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,110
compared to the input, it was an efficient process.

477
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,470
It's a relief that you think about it that way.

478
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,110
Yes.

479
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:29,510
I also plan on telling my family today.

480
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,020
Today?

481
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,420
Yes.

482
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,200
Our family is patriarchal too,

483
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,460
but my family has a strong assist in tow. So it's more like it has two leaders.

484
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,260
Ahh, is your mom the one who is the assist?

485
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,360
So before I introduce you, I plan to pass the ball to my mother.

486
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,970
Okay. I understand.

487
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:53,190
Then, one selfie.

488
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,650
Why a selfie?

489
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,850
I think an image rather than a text would create a better effect.

490
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,410
Ah. Okay.

491
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,860
Shall we take it again?

492
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,090
If you put it this way.

493
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,770
Then I can't press the button.

494
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:27,570
You can do it with this hand.

495
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,080
This is the women I'm marrying.

496
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,060
Aren't you going to eat lunch?

497
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,880
I'm waiting for a phone call.

498
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,090
There's no call though.

499
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,440
There will soon be a call.

500
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,100
Mother

501
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:06,770
Oh, I ate so much. As I live, I even get to be treated by you.

502
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,460
You're my teacher, so I should treat you.

503
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,790
You even introduced me to an investor.

504
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,350
Your outfit is good today.

505
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,780
You made up with your girlfriend?

506
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,730
I'm going to buy it today.

507
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,760
Good job! Good! How could you live your life like that?

508
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,610
If you don't then you don't, but if you do you live with it, that's life.

509
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,090
Your tip has been so much help!

510
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:33,140
I would have been a dummy and didn't know.

511
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,050
When it comes to relationship questions, you're the best Mavely (meaning lovely Ma).

512
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,320
Wait.

513
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,150
I am in 303. When are you coming?

514
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:47,010
Did you get a girlfriend? Cigarette light? What's with the name?

515
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,270
She's not my girlfriend.

516
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,010
She's a girl I met while giving a light last year.

517
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,040
That day, the two of us entered 303 for a good time.

518
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,660
Oh! Motel good time?

519
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:00,990
We met the day before, and she just ignored me. She doesn't remember me.

520
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:04,690
- And so?
- Just like a pro, I dropped some bait.

521
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,890
A reply will soon come.

522
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,930
"303? What do you mean?"

523
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,630
Then what will you say?

524
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:15,000
"Oh isn't this Ji Eun's number?

525
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,750
"Aigoo, I'm sorry. It was saved as 303, so I thought it was Ji Eun."

526
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,920
Ohhh! Are you going to get revenge like this?

527
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,620
I am. Does she think she's the only 303?

528
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:28,630
Seon Yeong, Mi Ja, Sook Hee are all 303. How dare she mess with me!

529
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,210
Hyung! This woman would be so mad.

530
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,040
Look, she will be so mad up to here

531
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,360
that she would lose her sanity and reply.

532
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,310
I'm learning one more thing.

533
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,580
- Let's go.
- Yes, teacher.

534
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,790
There's a message.

535
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,280
I'm in 303, when are you coming?

536
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,820
What is this? Dumbass.

537
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:57,220
I drank so much.

538
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,490
Oh. Ace!

539
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,630
Are you getting off of work?

540
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,750
We were going to have a drink with CEO Lee.

541
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,640
Is that so. There was nothing on the messenger.

542
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,830
We just got the call.

543
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,570
Then, you can just come for the first round.

544
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:15,130
I have an important appointment today, so it will be hard. I'm sorry.

545
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:18,260
Important promise? Who are you meeting?

546
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,860
Ah. Date?

547
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,800
No.

548
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,820
What do you mean no? Looking at your make up and outfit it seems like you paid a lot of attention to it.

549
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,860
She got herself a boyfriend.

550
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,640
I will make sure to attend next time.

551
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,990
Then, see you tomorrow.

552
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,720
Okay, I understand.

553
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,490
Don't be late. Don't drink so much.

554
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,800
Your mom will be worried.

555
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:06,420
Hey! Does the company know that you go around like that?

556
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,770
What do you need to shop for to ask me to meet all the way here? There's so much traffic.

557
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,440
You have to come with me.

558
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,310
This is Rang's workplace, so you could just go with her.

559
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,680
No! I need to buy it without Rang knowing.

560
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,830
- What is it?
- There's something. Let's go.

561
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:35,440
Why is Seok here at this time? Is he here to pick me up?

562
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,350
What is this? What are the two together without even calling me?

563
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,730
- Yes.
- Seok, where are you?

564
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,950
Huh? I'm in the office.

565
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,240
- Really?
- Why? Is something wrong?

566
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,890
Nothing. Just saying how I'm going after I'm done with work.

567
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,780
Okay. See you later.

568
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,150
What is this?

569
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,480
Perhaps?

570
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,760
Could it be?

571
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:26,520
I saw you guys. Tell me honestly, Won Seok bought something, right?

572
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,060
Hey, pretend you don't know.

573
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,990
Won Seok prepared so much just to surprise you.

574
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:41,050
You'll know when you get home later.

575
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,460
Okay. I'll go home early.

576
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,610
So this is why you called me.

577
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:56,270
Of course. How could I do something difficult all by myself?

578
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:01,200
Hey, won't Rang's eyes pop out when she sees this? She already has big eyes.

579
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,300
Hey! If they fall out, pick them up and put them back.

580
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,330
But how many months are you paying for this?

581
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,960
Twelve months. I really made a big decision in buying this.

582
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,190
Hey! You really did make a big decision.

583
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,300
She waited for so long, so I should at least do this.

584
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,950
What is it? Dumbass?

585
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,630
Who is it exactly for you to give him this ID?

586
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,230
There's someone.

587
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,770
- You're going to block him?
- I already did.

588
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,150
Ji Eun, my shirt, please, when you come.
Yeong Yun,

589
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:51,160
I'm in 303.

590
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,490
She's not even reading the messages.

591
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,400
We received an e-mail from HK.

592
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,320
The final report from the Demo Day.

593
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:03,130
- From who?
- It was from some deputy.

594
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,420
Deputy Woo?

595
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:09,750
No, Deputy Park Jin Oh.

596
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:14,150
Park Jin Oh.

597
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,270
Unni, hello!

598
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,130
You're here?

599
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,740
I guess the sofa is already sold.

600
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,280
Someone wanted to buy it even if it's the floor model, so it was sold today.

601
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,820
What should we do? You probably won't be able to get the same one anywhere.

602
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,910
It's okay. If I moved, I would probably need a bigger one.

603
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,260
Manager, are you moving?

604
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:42,060
You still have a lot of time left on the contract.

605
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,550
Well, I think there might be something that would make me move before that.

606
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:48,330
Perhaps, are you also getting married?

607
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:52,920
Nothing has been decided, but I think it won't be far off.

608
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,230
- Really?
- Congrats.

609
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:59,220
That's good. At my wedding, you could be the one to catch the bouquet.

610
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,490
Okay.

611
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,590
- Ji Ho!
- You startled me!

612
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,640
I was about to call you anyway.

613
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,760
What is that? Why a cake?

614
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,320
Won Seok told me to buy it. He said there's something to congratulate about.

615
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,260
Is today some special day?

616
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,180
Won Seok?

617
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:28,290
Won Seok. Fool, dummy. How could he plan a surprise this clumsily?

618
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:32,190
Ji Ho, you see today...

619
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,130
I think he will propose.

620
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,190
Then you two are really?

621
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,090
But it's a secret that I know, okay?

622
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:44,420
My surprised expression can't be awkward.

623
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,580
How is it? Isn't it awkward?

624
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,560
It seems like your eyes are going to pop out.

625
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,430
Wait.

626
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:55,230
Landlord

627
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,330
Rang, I will go in after getting this call.

628
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,860
Okay. Hurry in.

629
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,550
Yes.

630
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:26,950
Seok? Why did you turn off the lights?

631
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:30,030
Seok? Are you home?

632
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,790
Hey, her eyes are about to pop out.

633
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:42,970
What is this?

634
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:46,590
My Rang is so surprised that she has nothing to say!

635
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:50,070
I told you her eyes are going to pop out.

636
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:54,800
Ahh, that's a relief. I was worried about what to do if your mother did not believe it.

637
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,950
Yes. It was worth it to take the selfie numerous times.

638
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:02,580
I also am planning to tell my friends today.

639
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,190
Ah, you're talking about the friends you had in the girls high school, right?

640
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,620
Yes. There was a friend I was worried about,

641
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,740
but thankfully I think she's going to get married first.

642
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:13,870
That's great.

643
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:17,360
But then, my news is going to be so out of the blue.

644
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,230
I'm not sure if they will believe it.

645
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:24,000
I will send the couple selfie that we took this morning.

646
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,020
Try using that.

647
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:30,750
Yeah, okay. Then good night.

648
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,880
What... How am I supposed to use this?

649
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,380
Hey! Sim Won Seok!

650
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,390
Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind?

651
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:56,560
What are you planning by putting a sofa in here!

652
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,340
No... You said you wanted the sofa.

653
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:03,590
I made space to be able to fit the sofa and bought the last one.

654
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:06,940
What's the problem? What's wrong again?

655
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,790
Are you playing Tetris right now?

656
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:11,660
Look with your eyes! Is there even a space to eat?

657
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,460
Are you going to eat on the sofa!

658
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,530
We can, why can't we?

659
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,120
What can I even say to you?

660
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,730
So embarrassing.

661
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:25,220
Embarrassing? Am I embarrassing?

662
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:28,870
Hey, Yang Ho Rang, are you going to say it like that?

663
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:32,070
- Hey, don't.
- If I don't, would you even understand?

664
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:35,070
What's the use of graduating from Seoul National University when you can't even understand what a person is saying?

665
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,830
What! Are you done!

666
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:43,230
Then you should tell me in a way I would understand and not just some crap!

667
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:49,730
You... To me...

668
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,160
Did you just say crap?

669
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,400
- Hey!
- Why?

670
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,100
You're going to cry again? Then do I have to beg again?

671
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,600
You...

672
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,290
Why does it always have to be me that's sorry?

673
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:09,460
Why does it have to be me to adjust to you?

674
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,470
I'm sick of it. So sick of it.

675
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:18,310
Jeez...

676
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,260
Don't go out.

677
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,500
If you go out it's over, Sim Won Seok.

678
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,800
Stop drinking.

679
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,500
I heard you said you wanted the sofa.

680
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,600
Won Seok bought that with much difficulty.

681
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:12,660
You guys. Earlier, why did you go to the jewelry shop?

682
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,660
Huh? To fix my watch.

683
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,870
Hey, Won Seok was the one who paid for it

684
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:22,320
because he was thankful for helping him move the sofa.

685
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,330
Where could you find a guy like Won Seok? He treats you so well.

686
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,590
- Propose...
- You were a bit too much today.

687
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:33,630
No matter how angry you were, it was in front of us.

688
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:37,020
Do you know how much he went around just to buy that?

689
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,670
Pro...

690
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:44,430
I thought I was going to get a proposal!

691
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,290
Who... Who said I really wanted the sofa?!

692
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:53,360
I meant I wanted to go home to where a sofa could sit!

693
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,770
Because he told me that he was sorry for making me wait a lot,

694
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,600
I thought, today...

695
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:06,760
Today, I thought I would get a proposal!

696
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:19,170
Ho Rang's dream was unchanging since we were 17.

697
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,200
We have been together for 7 years.

698
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,260
Even the youngest in our store is getting married.

699
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:32,770
I... Until when will I be just dating at 30?

700
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:39,200
It's becoming a good mom.

701
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:45,080
There's not much to my fallopian tubes.

702
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,780
My womb is getting old!

703
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:54,710
Seriously, I can't hear this anymore.

704
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,660
Hey! Stop crying. That's enough.

705
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,040
What the heck's getting married anyway?

706
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:04,740
What? Getting married?

707
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,090
That? Yeah.

708
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:13,110
Getting married is laughable to a woman like you who lives the world tasting all the greatness by yourself.

709
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:18,800
But you know! To a wench like me who's got nothing, getting married is everything. That's why!

710
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,730
It's my life's goal. So what!!

711
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:29,760
That's not what I was talking about though. Your life is fallopian tubes?

712
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,730
Your identity is merely your uterus?

713
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,900
I mean why are you switching your self-esteem with marriage!

714
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,140
It's because, for the likes of me, our self-esteem is glued to our uterus too. So what!

715
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,160
Hey, Yang Ho Rang! Stop twisting things!

716
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:46,140
- Why do you keep on twisting my words!
- Stop acting so great cuz it's hapless!

717
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:49,380
Crazy wench. She's got her shitty craziness triggered again.

718
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,110
Ack, seriously.

719
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,150
Hey, where are you going?

720
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:57,030
I really can't stay here anymore.

721
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,670
- I'm going to go first.
- Hey! Soo Ji! Hey, Soo Ji!

722
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:02,000
Hey, Soo Ji!

723
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,970
Oh, seriously. Wait a moment.

724
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,920
Come on, Soo Ji...

725
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,720
Ji Ho. Do you know what my day was like today?

726
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,430
I finally got to take off from work on time today.

727
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:32,810
But I followed around her boyfriend to buy that hell of a sofa, and I even cleaned their room.

728
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:35,310
But now I need to listen to her telling me I'm hapless too?

729
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:39,900
I know. Rang was in the wrong today.

730
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:46,890
So look at her face-to-face, and get angry at her and fight, and work it out before you go.

731
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,640
If you go like this today too,

732
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,730
Rang will be just too lonely today.

733
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:57,090
Loneliness takes time too.

734
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,640
To her friend who's so tired that she doesn't even have time to sleep,

735
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:03,500
for her to throw her tantrum and unleash her grumpiness at me is what really hurts me.

736
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:12,460
- Ji Ho, hold on.
- Yup, take it.

737
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,670
Yes, CEO.

738
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:22,820
Oh, really? You were looking for me?

739
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:27,330
In high school, Soo Ji's dream was to become the boss.

740
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:32,280
No matter what line of work she'd end up in, she wanted to be the boss for sure.

741
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,510
Of course not. What would be more important to me than you, CEO?

742
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:41,010
She was that dashing girl who was always the main character in her life.

743
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:43,740
That was Soo Ji.

744
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:47,300
Yes, yes. I'll see you soon then. Yup.

745
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,700
I think I need to go back to the company.

746
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,700
At this hour? So late?

747
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,050
There's no day or night for a salary-employee.

748
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:04,620
It's an important client and if I miss the drink meeting, he'd hold a huge grudge.

749
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:16,970
Soo Ji, who wanted to become a boss.

750
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:25,760
She became the one that had to run to the summoning of a boss.

751
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,260
She became a company employee.

752
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:41,950
And Ho Rang whose only dream was to get married...

753
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:51,570
she dated for five years, and she's in her second year of cohabitation.

754
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:03,110
And me. In order to live in Seoul,

755
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:14,260
I've decided to marry my landlord.

756
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:22,000
He's headed right in front of the keeper.

757
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,780
Did the talk go well?

758
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,010
Did your friends understand?

759
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:33,260
Nope. I didn't get to talk about it. Some things came up.

760
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:43,510
By chance, what do your friends do?

761
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:47,340
So what I mean is...

762
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:53,440
what kind of work and what kind of life they all live.

763
00:55:54,550 --> 00:56:00,670
Well, they work in a company, or they are married, or they have their own business.

764
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:03,780
That's how they all live, like others.

765
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,110
Right? Like others.

766
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:15,090
No, I suddenly,

767
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:19,860
whereabout we are standing right now,

768
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,560
that thought occurred to me.

769
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:26,890
Everyone is running towards something.

770
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:30,210
If this now is getting closer to the dream

771
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:32,810
or if it's getting farther.

772
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:36,250
I can't seem to get a feel of it clearly.

773
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:40,540
So I was wondering how the ones who already went through it first are living.

774
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,850
I was just curious and that's why I asked you.

775
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:49,260
If that's the case, even more reason you shouldn't ask others

776
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,170
since it's a different situation than before.

777
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:57,280
As you already know well, everything's already at the state of oversaturation or depletion.

778
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,980
So the world will probably not get better.

779
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:05,020
So all the standards need to be reset.

780
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,490
For example—

781
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:11,640
Getting married. Like that, you mean?

782
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,460
Yes.

783
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,380
Since the world won't get better,

784
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:32,680
of course my life will not get better either.

785
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:37,630
Not for a better tomorrow,

786
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:40,760
but in order to evade a worse tomorrow,

787
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,400
it's possible that that's what I'm living for.

788
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,670
Then.

789
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,540
Wait.

790
00:57:54,770 --> 00:58:00,860
I thought about our standards of marriage.

791
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:06,300
Um, I think the #1 standard of this marriage is most likely efficiency and economy.

792
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,330
Yes. I agree completely.

793
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:15,210
That's why I say this, but I'd be inclined to have us omit as many expense-incurring events as we can.

794
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:18,540
Such as a wedding ceremony. Things like that, of course.

795
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,820
Of course, we would omit it.

796
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:25,400
All procedures and expenditures end at the meeting of the families.

797
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,610
Yes. I think that's absolutely how we should do it.

798
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:31,380
Yes. Certainly.

799
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,920
Like before,

800
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,840
Ho Rang, let's wake up.

801
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:41,410
Marrying out of love

802
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,540
is a ritual done only by the rich.

803
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:55,780
♫ Just briefly, I will borrow your warm shoulders ♫

804
00:58:55,780 --> 00:59:00,910
♫ Please be my forever resting place for when I'm tired and weary ♫

805
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:05,010
Now, we are . . .

806
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:12,740
♫ Just briefly, I will entrust my injured heart to your care  ♫

807
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:16,780
♫ You may just pass by  ♫

808
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:21,700
♫ and carelessly look at it  ♫

809
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:27,780
But didn't we decide we wouldn't do anything?

810
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:34,090
Yes, I think we did.

811
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:39,980
Just for the sake of an ordinary life,

812
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:44,430
I need to do something.

813
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:57,340
♫ I'm in love
The moment I fell for you  ♫

814
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,500
♫ So in love
It seems like I'm not myself anymore
 ♫

815
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:13,050
Those who made bets that I was homosexual. That I am heterosexual.

816
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,910
Asexual.

817
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:17,300
I am getting married.

818
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:19,240
- When did you guys start dating?
- Date?

819
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,420
Requests beyond the landlord and tenant relationship.

820
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:24,280
To ask for that, it's actually very uncomfortable for me.

821
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:28,150
"What's the use of talk just to make our mouths ache since we're already broken up?" Please tell him that.

822
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:30,220
It's because it was the floor model.

823
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:31,740
So it was that!

824
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:34,820
I think you don't need to worry about my father.

825
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,720
Our soft-hearted girl. I worry that perhaps she's fallen for the wrong person?

826
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,880
It's my wedding. So I must go.

827
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,110
We'll do a very short and common wedding.
