Because This Is My First Life

7
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,940
I'm a melodrama
♫  All day  ♫

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,490
From the shelf . . .

9
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,870
assistant writer.

10
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,110
The amount due from your loan amount of ₩187,259,000.

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,630
₩864,000.93.

12
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,170
You're becoming an aunt.

13
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,890
- Dad! Dad! Dad!
- It's a son.

14
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,260
The game's over.

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,200
- Townhouse?
- The owner wants you to move in immediately.
- I can go right now.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,280
♫  Again today, I walk without knowing ♫

17

Yoon Ji Ho
♫  Lalalalalalala lalalalalalala  ♫

18
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,610
♫  Do you remember those times?  ♫

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,270
It's because I was so embarrassed.
♫  Lalalalalalala lalalalalalala  ♫

20
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,370
I'm 30 years of age, and I can't even decipher what a man's kindness means.

21
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,090
Twenty years old, thirty years, the part in charge of those time-related concepts

22
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,270
is the neocortex on the outer layer of the brain.

23
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,600
Thirty years, forty years, it's the same thing every day.

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,130
That day, more than other words, I was comforted by his strange words.

25
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,420
Hello! You were hom—

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,160
I... Because of your name, I thought you were a woman.

27
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,620
Did you, by any chance, redo the grout on the bathroom tiles?

28
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,490
Did you also clean the living room windows?

29
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,870
Yes, when I write, I have a habit of cleaning.

30
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,860
I see.

31
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,210
I left without saying goodbye.

32
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,950
Who is it?

33
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,820
When I made the decision to making a living off of my dream, I knew my life now

34
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,680
was like walking alone in a dark tunnel.

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,210
Still, I didn't know it would be this dark.

36
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:28,310
I also didn't know it would be this lonely.

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,630
Excuse me, I have something to say.

38
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,510
Yes.

39
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,890
Perhaps, if you have some time...

40
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,450
Yes.

41
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,240
Would you marry me?

42
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,870
Yes.

43
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,280
What?!

44
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,420
D-Do what?

45
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,340
Marriage.

46
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,510
Why would I... Marry...

47
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:10,460
Why would we marry each other? No, why would a house owner and their tenant do that

48
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,450
type of thing?!

49
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,660
Never mind. Just pretend you didn't hear it.

50
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,730
- What?
- I misspoke. Please don't worry about it.

51
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,220
Then, good night.

52
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,480
I left the sheets in the room the way they were.

53
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,420
Since I'm washing the pillow cover, I'll give you a new—

54
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,470
No. It's fine.

55
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,220
It's not very sanitary to sleep without a cover.

56
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,190
No! I'm about to leave.

57
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,060
I told you that I was just out for a walk.

58
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,390
Then, I'll be leaving now. Thank you for the beer.

59
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,220
Car taxi

60
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,770
Gayang-dong

61
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,830
Mangwon-dong

62
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,970
There's seriously no place for me to go.

63
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,860
House owner

64
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,890
I wanted to tell you that taxis don't run at this hour.

65
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,460
The passcode is still the same.

66
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,790
Perhaps, if you have some time...

67
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,750
Would you marry me?

68
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,590
He definitely

69
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,220
said the word marriage.

70
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:50,460
Why does he always lock the door? Just who should be the one locking their own door? Is he joking with me right now? Seriously?

71
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,080
Marriage? We just met each other. How can he say such things and still lock the door?

72
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,690
Ah, seriously. I'm leaving immediately on the first subway tomorrow.

73
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:28,290
Yes, it's Unit 401. I think my neighbor is getting a renovation done without informing me.

74
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,390
Yes.

75
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,650
I guess it wasn't the sound of construction.

76
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,030
I will leave when the subway starts running.

77
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,360
I won't be there when you wake up, so I'm saying my goodbye in advance.

78
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,760
Let's just pretend I didn't hear anything.

79
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:47,320
The customer cannot be reached. After the beep please—

80
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,460
Oh, it's me. Why isn't Ji Ho not picking up? She's not even checking my messages.

81
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,410
Really? Did she go to a meeting?

82
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,780
Ho Rang, I'm hanging up first.

83
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,080
- So what if that happens?
- Still, that shouldn't.

84
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,700
- That's right...

85
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,340
Oh? Deputy Woo!

86
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,430
- Did you come out to get some fresh air?
- Yes.

87
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,010
Since you're here, why don't you smoke a cigarette with us too?

88
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,420
Deputy, you can't be saying that stuff.

89
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,960
It's fine. It's Deputy Woo.

90
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,000
- It's really fine.
- Yes, she'll be fine.

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,900
The customer cannot be reached. After the beep please—

92
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,190
She really isn't picking up.

93
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,550
I was just wondering why you aren't coming today.

94
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,060
There isn't much time left for this.

95
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,500
Instead of touching it every day, just buy it.

96
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,000
Really? This can't be happening. I really wanted to buy this to put in my house when I get married.

97
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,100
- Will it not be out again next year?
- Next year?

98
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,700
Just tell your boyfriend to quickly get married.

99
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,730
You should do it before all your beauty fades.

100
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,050
It's just that he's such a busy person. He graduated from Seoul National University.

101
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,620
Really? What does he do?

102
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,430
Even if I tell you, you won't know. He works a very complicated job.

103
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,740
Ah, you're bragging.

104
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,340
5:00 pm

105
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,120
Ah, that scared me.

106
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,820
I barely got two hours of sleep, and yet I feel so very refreshed.

107
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,780
How are you eating at 5 am?

108
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,820
No, no, no. Shhh. Your owner will wake up.

109
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,160
Eat quietly please.

110
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,400
Where are you coming from?

111
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,890
- The company.
- At this time?

112
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,480
Yes.

113
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,320
Perhaps, did you wake up just now?

114
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,400
Yes.

115
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,280
- At this time?
- Yes.

116
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,680
I'm sure that I told you last night that I'd take the first bus out.

117
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,940
Not the last bus?

118
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,160
The last bus?

119
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,500
Your words are a bit harsh. How could you tell me take the last bus?

120
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,290
What in the world did you think of me to say that?

121
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,010
You're being a bit harsh since last night.

122
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,240
I was so upset that I tossed and turned all last night, barely sleeping two hours.

123
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,840
How could you say that to someone who woke up at the crack of dawn to take the first bus?

124
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,540
Were you always such a rude person?

125
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,440
I merely told you the facts.

126
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,900
Right now, the first bus is not running.

127
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,480
- What?
- Right now...

128
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:43,810
It's 5 pm. You cannot take the first bus. You would take the last.

129
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:53,090
It's not 5 am, but 5 pm?

130
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,740
- Yes.
- So I

131
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,050
didn't sleep two hours—

132
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,280
To be exact, you slept for fourteen hours.

133
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,500
Is this...for real?

134
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,280
Yes, this is for real.

135
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,270
I set the alarm incorrectly.

136
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,460
I was really going to take the first bus out.

137
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:01,410
Yes, you were so deeply asleep, I wasn't able to wake you.

138
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,990
You must not have been able to sleep lately.

139
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:10,100
The place you're staying at right now must not be comfortable.

140
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,870
Why are you...

141
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,590
like that to me?

142
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,350
Why are you so nice to me?

143
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,420
- Me?
- Yes.

144
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,520
You gave me the bigger ramen and gave me a new pillowcase.

145
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,460
- That's because—
- You even asked me to marry you.

146
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,950
I told you to pretend not to hear that yester—

147
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,220
But I heard you.

148
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,810
- Just, don't trouble yourself with—
- But it does trouble me.

149
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,300
The noodles are going to be overcooked. Let's eat.

150
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,310
Do you perhaps... like me?

151
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,720
- Episode 3 -
Because this is my first proposal.

152
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,040
Do you perhaps like me?

153
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,560
No.

154
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,920
I gave you that cup ramen because I can't eat spicy things.

155
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,740
The reason why I gave you new pillow covers is because it is unhygienic for the bedding if you slept without it.

156
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,800
And marriage...

157
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,390
I asked you because it's something I need.

158
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,870
- You need it?
- Yes.

159
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:56,590
If I had to get married, I thought that you would be the best person.

160
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:02,660
I mean, what about me? How did you reach that conclusion?

161
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,030
I need someone who will stay at home to take care of the house, and you need a home.

162
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,760
I need monthly rent, and you need a room without a deposit.

163
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,690
Aren't these the best conditions for living together?

164
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,250
So that's why I asked. There was no other meaning.

165
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,620
I mean still, how could you bring up marriage?

166
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,860
How could you get married for an apartment?

167
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,290
Then why do you think people get married?

168
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,300
I mean... Affection, love,

169
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,890
those kinds of things.

170
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,060
That's right. That's what people normally think.

171
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,760
However, affection, love, and those things,

172
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,600
do you need them right now

173
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,280
more than a house?

174
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,510
Right now...

175
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:04,450
Not right now, but it's something I'll need someday,

176
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,340
even for someone like me.

177
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,500
I see.

178
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:19,020
I thought you were a person in a similar category as me.

179
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,360
It was my error in judgement.

180
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:28,090
Please pretend you didn't hear what I said today.

181
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,440
Then, take your time eating before you leave.

182
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,830
Deputy Oh! I see you haven't gone home for the day yet?

183
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,370
Ah, no. I have to wrap this up.

184
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,990
Ahhhh. That's tomorrow.

185
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:00,400
You should make the newbies do this kind of thing. You're on a higher level than this.

186
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,530
Don't be too nice to the newbies just because you're a woman. When you make them do errands, go hard.

187
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,910
Are you not getting off work?

188
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,860
I mean, I have some work left to do,

189
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,260
but since you're here, it looks like I can leave earlier.

190
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,850
Sorry? What does my being here have to do with you leaving early?

191
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:22,360
Ahhh so that's... Though it doesn't have to do anything specifically with you, the way people see this...

192
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,080
- Sorry?
- The other day, our department manager said something like this.

193
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:30,030
He said to make an effort not to work alone late at night with an unmarried female coworker.

194
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,560
It's a bit weird. Of course, since you're not married you wouldn't know,

195
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,230
but married men, like myself, have to be careful.

196
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,350
If I get tangled up in a web of rumors with a female coworker—

197
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,270
Well then, I'll get off work first.

198
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,160
Wait, you don't have to leave so early just because I said that.

199
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,390
****ing bastard.

200
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,260
Thank you. Have a nice day!

201
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,790
Closed

202
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,540
- Okay, let's clean up the restaurant in ten minutes and get off work on time.
- Yes.

203
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,970
- Wipe this down one more time, please.
- Yes.
- Seulgi?

204
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,460
Yes.

205
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,450
- Let's go there.
- Sounds tasty!

206
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,430
Hey, hey, hey. Isn't that guy so cute?

207
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,850
Yes, he's totally my style.

208
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,920
He's so good looking.

209
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,000
Wait, isn't that the manager's boyfriend?

210
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,600
- Daebak.
- Sorry, I didn't know.

211
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,200
Isn't he good looking? I'm going to go first. See you tomorrow!

212
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,500
- Bye.
- Bye!

213
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,300
- Won Seok!
- Aigoo. You worked hard.

214
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,640
So cute.

215
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,170
Wait, didn't the manager say she's been in a really long-term relationship?

216
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,620
I think it was seven years?

217
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,250
But he comes to pick her up every time she gets off work late.

218
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,660
- Isn't that amazing?
- I'm so jealous.

219
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,630
- I'm so jealous!
- He's cool.

220
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,790
What did you do today?

221
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:32,180
Today? I had incredible results today.

222
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,930
Did you find investors? Is someone interested in investing?

223
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:39,660
Here, look at this. It's a graph I finished making yesterday. Isn't it really pretty?

224
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,240
See? It kind of looks like a constellation.

225
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:48,180
I think what Carl Sagan said is really true. In the end, humans and space are connected.

226
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,150
Isn't it really beautiful?

227
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,330
Yup. It looks like the neighborhood leek pancake.

228
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,680
Seok, the sofa that I told you before...

229
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,690
What? Oh, that new one at the shop?

230
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,160
Yeah. They said there are not many left.

231
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,190
That's why they all say—the usual buyers will buy.

232
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,940
Even if the economy is in a recession, those who usually buy things like that end up buying them in the end.

233
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,620
They said a lot of newlywed couples buy that. It's the perfect size for a newlywed house.

234
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,730
Rang. That's why they also say—the usual doers will always do.

235
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,020
Even if they say we're at a dip in birth rates, the usual doers will end up doing it all in the end.

236
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,370
Geez, South Korea still has a long way to go. Really.

237
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,480
Rang, did something bad happen at the store today?

238
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,260
No. It was a totally productive day.

239
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,530
Why did she get mad? I didn't do anything though.

240
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,660
Did I do something wrong? I'm going crazy.

241
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,200
- Seok!
- Yes, ma'am!
- Do you know the address of the house where Ji Ho lives?

242
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,130
Soo Ji's asking because she just can't get a hold of Ji Ho.

243
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,370
Oh, Ji Ho? She left that house last week.

244
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,520
- What?!
- You guys didn't know?

245
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,790
Then, where has she been sleeping all this time then?

246
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:16,770
I thought that you were in the same category as me.

247
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,280
What in the world does that even mean?

248
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,910
Same category?

249
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,850
- Wow, daebak.
- Pajamas!

250
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,870
Hey, Soo Ji. It's me.

251
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,220
Hey! Where are you? Ignored my calls and my texts!

252
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,570
Sorry, sorry. I'll tell you what's going on in greater detail later.

253
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:02,780
I am in the neighborhood of the house where I used to live.

254
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,250
We're around there already. Whereabout in the neighborhood?

255
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,460
Really? I'm at the bus stop.

256
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,080
Oh, I see a bus stop. Some crazy chick is sitting there in pajamas.

257
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,970
Where are you?

258
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,850
Oh.

259
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,800
Well...that's me.

260
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,000
Ji Ho! Did you sleep out on the streets?

261
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,710
Hey, hey!

262
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,020
Gosh!!!

263
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,090
So you left wearing just your pj's?

264
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:56,250
This ******* bastard! We should ****** eat him for breakfast.

265
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,670
Do your lead writer and director know about what happened?

266
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,510
That crazy ****. That guy doesn't even deserve to be chopped to pieces, ****.

267
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,140
Hey! What's his number?

268
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,620
Oh my gosh, let's listen to her first!

269
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:11,070
No one knows. I just up and left everything behind and got out of there.

270
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,220
You should have at least told us.

271
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,750
We didn't even know you were eating and sleeping at your studio.

272
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:21,900
You should have called me. Why did you go to that home owner's place at that time of the night anyway?

273
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,700
Oh, you know. Just after I had walked a while.

274
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,940
What do you mean "after I had walked a while"? It's miles and miles away from your studio.

275
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,040
Ji Ho. You have something going on with him, don't you?

276
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,420
Something lovey-dovey?

277
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,880
It's not like that. Lovey-dovey? Whatever...

278
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,880
Nah. Something's up.

279
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,430
No, really. Nothing's going on.

280
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,630
Aye! Your eyes are flickering though!

281
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,870
I told you no!

282
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:59,130
Okay, okay. Don't get mad at me about it.

283
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,870
Hey, head in first. Won Seok is probably worrying about you.

284
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,890
Ji Ho. I'm heading to my place, okay?

285
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:36,010
Hello. My name is Hwang Jae Hyun, the person Mr. Nam is introducing you to.

286
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:39,350
Yes. Hello. Nice to meet you.

287
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,680
"I believe in fate."

288
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,850
Ah...darn it.

289
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,510
How does some time tomorrow work for you?

290
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,940
Why are you working on the floor? The bed's right there.

291
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,650
No, no. How could a guest even attempt to sleep on the floor?

292
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,570
Don't you know I like the floor?

293
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,820
- Ji Ho. I can work, right?
- Yep!

294
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,640
I have a big event coming up.

295
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,800
- Demo day?
- Yeah.

296
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,400
It's an event where we're organizing an opportunity for startups and investors to meet.

297
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,300
It's like blind dating, but for startups.

298
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,570
"Dating, Not Marriage." That's a unique name for a company.

299
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,160
It's a blind dating app. Haven't you tried it before?

300
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,340
So if you upload your picture, people can score you.

301
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,830
A score?

302
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:44,240
According to the score, you're assigned a level. And then you're matched with a guy at the same level as you.

303
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,380
- So you mean I can't meet a guy that is a higher level than me?
- Nope.

304
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,060
If you want to, you need to pay up.

305
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,950
Amazing, huh?

306
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,840
What in the world? It's not like it's a caste system or anything.

307
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,430
This seems like an offensive thing to do though.

308
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:04,330
They have a ton of users already. Our most anticipated start up, out of the companies attending the event, is this one too.

309
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,570
The investors are all eyeing them.

310
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:09,370
People these days. They're so tough.

311
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:14,800
Of course. In Hell-Joseon (what young South Koreans call Korea due to the difficult lifestyle) you have to be tough to date. Otherwise you just can't.

312
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,030
Now mating has even become a competitive playing field. You know what I'm sayin' baby?

313
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,330
Yeah, baby.

314
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,400
Wow, do you have a hole in your chin or something? Why are you dropping so much food?

315
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,160
People are simpler than we think. Our app honed in on that notion.

316
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,050
Why do so many people fail at blind dates?

317
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:37,190
"I have a feeling" or "I can really talk to them." Aren't such things much too subjective?

318
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,000
We decided to be a bit more honest.

319
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,300
We wanted to strike at mankind's most basic instincts and created an app around them.

320
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:48,590
The fact that men look first at a woman's physical appearance, and women look first at a man's competence.

321
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,320
Of course, we also factored in physical distance.

322
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,580
We introduce you to people in order of increasing physical distance.

323
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:02,870
As a result, we have seen 350,000 new users in the past 5 months and have hit ₩380,000,000 of income per month.

324
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,440
One thing.

325
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,940
Yes?

326
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,680
Why is the name of the app, "Dating, Not Marriage"?

327
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,940
Wouldn't it be better to emphasize marriage as it is the pinnacle of successful love?

328
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,570
Why is marriage the pinnacle of successful love?

329
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:25,090
Well the purpose of dating is to get married. So why wouldn't it be the result of successful love?

330
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:30,450
Marriage is restricting. Especially in modern times, marriage is but a social construct that exists for the purpose of preserving one's DNA.

331
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,290
Nothing more, nothing less.

332
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:37,180
The result of love? That the false hope of fools who are falling behind the times

333
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,310
and want to perpetuate the construct of marriage in the name of love.

334
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,980
What the heck? Why is he being like that?

335
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:54,600
So you're saying that I, or my generation, are falling behind the times?

336
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,560
Well, no. No.

337
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,770
The name of our app and the direction we want this to go is, "Dating, Not Marriage."

338
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,610
Marriage is something that can change in purpose and process according to each individual's values.

339
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:11,710
However, dating will always share one thing,

340
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,470
and that is love.

341
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,010
Love is also a science. No calls, no "feelings." Let's date with data. Dating, not Marriage!

342
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,190
So he knows how to sell a drug or two.

343
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,370
I told you not to take questions.

344
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,590
You just have to show the investors your perfectly normal face. Is that so much to ask of you?

345
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:43,450
For one moment and second, is it so hard for you to pretend to be a normal human being and—

346
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:48,430
Nam Se Hee, your presentation was awesome. Simply the best.

347
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,670
Hey. Where are you going? You need to be at the networking event.

348
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:58,770
I don't know all that, so why doesn't a normal person like you go to it?

349
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,770
He's the type that holds grudges. He's like attractive sandpaper.

350
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:09,030
I'm going to sand that sandpaper down.

351
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,960
The door is locked. I came to pick up my things.

352
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,350
The door is locked. Please hand me my things.

353
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,660
Hand me back my things, you bastard.

354
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,630
Writer Yoon, here's some coffee. You just drink this, right?

355
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,100
Thank you.

356
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,810
Drink up.

357
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,230
- Are you still mad?
- Sorry?

358
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,310
No.

359
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,530
- It's not that I'm mad but—
- I know.

360
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,040
I'm sorry.

361
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,280
I've thought about it, and I think what you said is right.

362
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,910
I always say I want something new and creative, but

363
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,830
in the end, we do what we always do.

364
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:48,130
That rice with that vegetable, mixing them, blending them.

365
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,380
However, when I first debuted, I wasn't like this.

366
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,920
But because I wanted to try to survive, I ended up like this.

367
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:07,950
It isn't like we just started working with each other. It's already five years.

368
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,370
You know that more than anyone, I'm the one that wants you to succeed the most.

369
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,380
It's me. Do you know that?

370
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:20,730
I know, and I'm very appreciative of it.

371
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,570
You know, but you still do that?

372
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,910
You're smiling. Get up. Let's go somewhere and have a drink today.

373
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,370
- Just you and me?
- Yeah, do you not want to?

374
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:36,880
Oh, no. It's not that, but you don't drink very often.

375
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,920
So what? I'll only drink today.

376
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,570
Let's go.

377
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:47,820
Writer, thank you.

378
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,520
What's wrong with you?

379
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,160
Let's go. You still have some left.

380
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:05,590
Match meeting by rating level. That's some new caste system.

381
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,190
What are your projected sales?

382
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:13,310
Last week we had the version update, so probably a rise of 300% or higher.

383
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,180
That's my prediction, which I say with modesty and embarrassment.

384
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,740
Wow. Then you won't need venture capitalists like us.

385
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:24,840
Absolutely not true. You are as precious to our growth as a mother's breast milk.

386
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,770
Please continue to give us a good push until we go IPO.

387
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,530
CEO Ma's attitude is just so great.

388
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,890
He's not like the young CEOs these days.

389
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:39,020
- Oh, Deputy Park.
- Oh, CEO!

390
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,190
- You've worked hard.
- Nice to meet you.

391
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:48,670
- Your investor relations work was pretty impressive.
- Ah, it's nothing.
- Don't you agree, Deputy Woo?

392
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:52,370
Yes. I love the clear message from it.

393
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,360
Deputy Woo, have you used this app before?

394
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,990
Someone like you should get at least a diamond grade.

395
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,520
Sadly, it didn't happen.

396
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,520
No way. Is it because you only upload pictures of your face?

397
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,310
You should have uploaded a full-shot picture of yourself.

398
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,060
Oh yeah? Our Deputy Woo's full-shot was that incredible?

399
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,750
I'm learning this for the first time.

400
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:19,460
Of course. Not only is she smart, she also has a great figure. She's an ace.

401
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,180
- She's also—
- Deputy Park.

402
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,050
I'm sorry, but do you have a cigarette?

403
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,490
- I left mine in the car.
- Cigarette.

404
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,230
- Do you want to come out and smoke with us?
- Should I?
- That would be great.

405
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,130
This way then. This way.

406
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:38,260
Wait a second. Wait. Deputy Woo, you should also go with us.

407
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,760
Goodbye.

408
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,390
Smoking is best done on the rooftop.

409
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,750
By any chance, do you remember me?

410
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,630
Ah, at the wedding?

411
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:21,570
Yes, that's right. We met each other at the wedding, right?

412
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,720
- The world's a small place.
- I know, right?

413
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:30,410
Besides the wedding, do you remember anything else?

414
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,900
The rooftop party last year.

415
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:44,520
I lit your cigarette for you like I did now, and we chatted and had beer together.

416
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,600
Ah, at that time you drank cocktails, and afterward, we—

417
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:57,270
Oh, okay, okay. It looks like you'd rather not be acknowledged. I shouldn't—

418
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:02,530
No, it's one thing if you didn't mention anything, but since you brought it up, it's courtesy to finish it.

419
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,960
We slept together that day.

420
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:11,470
I was going to pretend like I didn't know you for your sake, but since you insist . . .

421
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,560
Last year, I

422
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,190
slept with you?

423
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,570
No, you really don't remember? Okay, here.

424
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,560
No. 303. The room we stayed in.

425
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,280
Ah, how can you forget about that?!

426
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,520
We were totally into it at that time. Do you not remember?

427
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:39,800
I'm sorry. Normally, I remember the guys I sleep with, but

428
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,560
if I don't have a single memory of you.

429
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,800
I guess you didn't leave that great of an impression.

430
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:56,110
She can't remember me? Where did all the great memories go?

431
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:00,450
Were all my highly impressionable actions forgotten?

432
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,430
- This place has great ambiance, right?
- Yes, it's really great.

433
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,580
- Cheers.
- There.

434
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:32,630
I heard Yong Seok found a place for Writer Yoon.

435
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,070
Looking at you two, you really share a special relationship. It's a great sight.

436
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:40,460
That's right. I like how kids nowadays can befriend opposite genders.

437
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,130
You know during our time, there was no way that happened. There was no way a girl and a guy could be friends.

438
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:47,300
Even spending a night together in one place— Oh, the rumors. Don't even mention it.

439
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,090
Yup, rumors back then. For that, we really had some serious heartache, too.

440
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,180
Omo. I don't know about me but not in your case.

441
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,810
You really liked me back then.

442
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:02,150
Why are you being like this? Stop it. Why are you bringing that up now? Stop.

443
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,560
How can you change so much?

444
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,030
Hey, Writer Yoon. Do you want to receive a glass from me?

445
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,430
Here.

446
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,140
It's like that when you look at places where youngsters work.

447
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:23,860
All sorts of stuff happens. It's all the same everywhere you go. Such a common thing.

448
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,690
You little rascal.

449
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,570
Hurry and apologize to Writer Yoon.

450
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:31,690
I heard he made a big mistake towards you.

451
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:36,360
That's why I chastised him good yesterday.

452
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,820
Yong Seok said he wanted to apologize to you,

453
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,000
- so I brought him here.
- Yup, good job.

454
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:50,160
Writer, because I was so drunk, I must've gone crazy.

455
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,040
I'm really sorry.

456
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,770
Yong Seok! I was really going to kill you, you know.

457
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,880
But because of Director Park, I held it in. Do you know that?

458
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,460
What. . .

459
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:07,040
are you all doing right now?

460
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,870
Why. . .

461
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:17,940
are you yelling at your assistant director, Director?

462
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,820
What are you holding in, Writer?

463
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,590
I'm obviously. . .

464
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,280
the victim here.

465
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:37,340
Victim? Your words are a bit too much.

466
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:43,440
I was sexually harassed. No, it was attempted sexual assault,

467
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,780
so I should be called a victim. What else is more appropriate to say?

468
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,700
What do you mean sexually assaulted?

469
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,690
- Writer Yoon, why are you using such harsh words?
- Just shut up, before I send you to prison.

470
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:54,100
Writer Yoon, your words are too harsh.

471
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:58,560
Huh? We're all like family here, so is there a need to do this?

472
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,320
We're all gathered here together because of you, to apologize.

473
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,620
Right? Why did you make me come here?

474
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,760
Why do I have to...

475
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,560
accept his apology like this?

476
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,260
Wait. Writer Yoon,

477
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,170
It's because we're all too precious to each other.

478
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,050
We don't want to ruin this teamwork, so we're trying our best here.

479
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,290
Your best work?

480
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,390
Is this trying your best?

481
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,160
I got hit by a rock as I was walking on the street and I'm bleeding.

482
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:39,400
Trying hard is to carry me on your back to run to the hospital, no?

483
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,990
"You're not bleeding. You're fine. Just keep walking."

484
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:47,530
Just dragging me forcibly is what you call trying hard?

485
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,150
When the actual person is in so much pain from all the bleeding?

486
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:59,070
Writer Yoon, do you think this is some college club meeting?

487
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:04,140
If you are so whiny about such a small thing, how are you going to make any dramas?

488
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,520
Drama? This is teamwork.

489
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,520
You coming to where you are now and in the future as well,

490
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,490
without us, it would be hard for your script to secure even a single air slot. Do you know that?

491
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,040
Yes.

492
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,430
I know.

493
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:28,780
So I'm not going to do drama anymore.

494
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,230
I won't do it again.

495
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:36,570
So, please don't contact me.

496
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,470
Yoon Ji Ho—

497
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:53,000
- Good day.
- Hyeon Jin Geon

498
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,350
You did well.

499
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,960
You really did well, Yoon Ji Ho.

500
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,590
You didn't cry and held it in well.

501
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,540
Here. One more glass.

502
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,140
Huh? I already had five glasses though.

503
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,360
What do you mean already? You mean you've only had five so far.

504
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,860
Usually, on the day that you quit, you should be drinking all night.

505
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:54,310
That's right. You can just drink and vomit, drink and vomit again. We'll take care of everything else.

506
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,200
You guys are scary. I thought you were going to comfort me!

507
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,370
That's why! Now, for comfort!

508
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,750
Cheers!

509
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,560
I really can't drink anymore. I feel like my stomach is about to burst.

510
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,650
Really? Then now that we've filled our bellies, should we head out?

511
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,800
- Where?
- We need to go to the karaoke!

512
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,820
No, no, no! Wait. I really can't.

513
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,900
We'll only sing ballad songs.

514
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,510
Let's go!

515
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:23,140
Soo Ji and Ho Rang have always been like this.

516
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:29,630
If I'm going through something very difficult, they don't ask why it happened or how it happened

517
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,560
like other people usually would.

518
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,680
We just laughed hard and talked like usual.

519
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,940
The truth is, is there anything more comforting than that?

520
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,980
What?

521
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,200
Did you really send the email?

522
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,060
Why would you do it like that?

523
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,540
Okay. I will look into it.

524
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,800
Why? Do you need to go?

525
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,740
It's an important client, and things just got twisted.

526
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,330
This is why I was going to have my phone turned off.

527
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,310
No, no. Hurry and go. It's okay.

528
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,370
I'm sorry.

529
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,020
Yes, Manager.

530
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,910
I'm sorry.

531
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:28,670
You said we were going to drink all night.

532
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:31,450
Honey

533
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,170
Hey, Won Seok.

534
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,120
So heavy.

535
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,660
You were the one who quit, so why is she the one knocked out?

536
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,780
I know. She can't even drink.

537
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,050
It's so late, so how will you go? Sleep at our place.

538
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:51,480
Hey, we are not twenty, but thirty.

539
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,870
Hey, a taxi is here.

540
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,580
Thank you, thank you.

541
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,970
Thank you.

542
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:09,370
But still, everyone has a place to return to.

543
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:17,340
The day's bus operations have terminated.

544
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,440
Except me.

545
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:32,820
Why am I always like this on the streets?

546
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:39,280
Mom

547
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,570
Yeah, it's Ji Ho.

548
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:46,540
Where are you? Aren't you sleeping?

549
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:49,570
Yeah. I'm still out.

550
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:50,950
Something happened.

551
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:55,650
Go home early. Living with someone and going home late is a nuisance.

552
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,000
I am on my way.

553
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,140
Clean your room, too. And wash the cups that you use.

554
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,160
Okay.

555
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,340
Even after you have dried your hair, don't just come out.

556
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,130
Be it morning or night, clean—

557
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,780
Okay! I said okay already!

558
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:15,890
Why are you getting annoyed? I'm only saying this for your own good.

559
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:18,090
What more could I do better?

560
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:21,680
If I do well, do you think that's all?

561
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:29,400
You don't even know.

562
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,160
Okay.

563
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,400
Hurry and go. Eat too.

564
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,500
I'm hanging up.

565
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,610
Ji Ho.

566
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:43,770
Yeah.

567
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:48,280
If Seoul is so cold, you can come down here.

568
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:53,440
Here, your room is still the same.

569
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,190
You can come any time, okay?

570
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:04,400
♫ Please be my house forever ♫

571
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:12,200
♫ Just briefly, I will entrust my injured heart in your care ♫

572
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:21,630
♫ When you pass by, you may carelessly look at it  ♫

573
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,740
Oh. One second.

574
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,870
Please take this with you.

575
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:41,250
Did it come for me?

576
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:44,100
Yes. Some man left it here for room 401.

577
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,010
Yes.

578
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,220
Because you told me not to contact you, I'm leaving the bag here. I'm sorry. - Yong Seok

579
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,840
My bag.

580
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,020
Your luggage was in the security office, so I took it.

581
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,680
Ahh.

582
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,470
My workplace must have sent it to the address on my contract.

583
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:20,530
I'm sorry. Can I get it today?

584
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:29,980
Yes. Come when it's comfortable for you.

585
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,430
What is this? What is this? How long has it been since I've had breakfast?

586
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:41,950
Eat at least a little every day. How could everything Ahjumma sends be left just as is?

587
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:45,900
Hey, my mom has big hands (generous portions).

588
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,680
Should we have a day drink on the weekend?

589
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,440
Soo Ji.

590
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:54,940
Today, I will be heading down to Namhae.

591
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,970
Right. Go and rest, then come back.

592
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:00,650
No. I will be staying there

593
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:03,130
after I settle things here in Seoul.

594
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:04,060
Huh?

595
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:08,450
The project is down the drain, and there's nothing to do here.

596
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:16,180
If it's about the house, you can stay here. I'm really fine with it.

597
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,330
It's not about the house.

598
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:22,770
It's just... Seoul's weather

599
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:25,960
is so cold. I'm tired of it.

600
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,810
I'm heading down.

601
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,560
Your call cannot be connected.

602
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,890
Is he not in?

603
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:06,350
Kitty, how are you?

604
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,440
Did you eat? Come here.

605
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,270
Because you said not to contact you, I'm just leaving your bag.

606
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,150
I'm sorry.

607
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:50,500
I don't dare to throw it out with my own hands,

608
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,970
so I will leave these here.

609
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:59,590
Please recycle it for me.

610
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,220
Hello.

611
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,090
Why did you do that?

612
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:15,990
No. How could you cause that trouble in someone else's house?

613
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,330
What did you say that you would receive?

614
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,700
- Rent.
- Are you in your right mind?

615
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,350
Why would you receive rent from a woman you would be getting married to?

616
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,380
Because I need rent.

617
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:32,810
That woman brought up first how she's going to quit her job after getting married, have a child, and go on trips together.

618
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:35,570
I want to receive rent from the person I live with,

619
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:39,950
would like her to recycle, and want her to clean the cat's poop. I told her that.

620
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:41,900
- What about that?
- What do you mean?

621
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,550
No, no matter how much you didn't like her,

622
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:48,030
is that something normal to say in a marriage meeting?

623
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:50,340
Yup, certainly not normal.

624
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,750
What's "normal" then?

625
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,430
Just like others, give out love and receive love.

626
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:58,250
Live like that, then have babies, and live happily and ordinarily.

627
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,680
- How's that ordinary?
- It is ordinary!

628
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,010
That's how everyone else lives. What's so hard about that?

629
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:08,170
Do you know how much the average cost of getting married is in the Republic of Korea?

630
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:11,130
Well, with this and that, maybe some ₩50 million or ₩60 million?

631
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,920
₩270 million. And raising a kid costs ₩300 million.

632
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,560
Something that costs such an enormous amount, to someone who can't even tell if ramen cups are made of plastic

633
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,190
or styrofoam, how can I do that with such a woman?

634
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:22,400
What are you talking about?

635
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,560
Are you trying to hire a patrol guard?

636
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,470
She's young and pretty.

637
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:29,480
Men get all weak over women like that. How come you're—

638
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,300
Young and pretty? This one's plenty for me.

639
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:39,390
Son . . . Um, by chance, is there a problem?

640
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,070
Problem?

641
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,780
I mean, due to hormones in our environment these days, men in their thirties start having difficulty in their penis function.

642
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,410
- Mother!
- Oh, I don't know.

643
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:53,990
You've been branded by the matchmakers now.

644
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:56,710
We won't be getting any more matches.

645
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:01,510
So go to Teacher Hwang and beg. I think she's still fond of you.

646
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:04,430
- Why would I?
- If I end up being divorced because of you,

647
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:06,010
I'll move in here and live.

648
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,930
- What?
- You know your father better than anyone.

649
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:10,500
I won't make a long explanation.

650
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,830
Whether it's better to live your life serving an elderly mother,

651
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:15,860
or whether it's better to keep a young and pretty wife with you and live.

652
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,720
Think that through.

653
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,150
Um...

654
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,860
I'm really sorry.

655
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,980
I thought I shouldn't get caught by your mother.

656
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,340
No, I'm very grateful about that.

657
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,880
But, your belongings. Why...

658
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,390
Did you move out of where you were staying then?

659
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:03,430
Yes. Actually, I'm going down to Namhae.

660
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:05,660
But your writing work?

661
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,730
It's been wrapped up.

662
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:14,920
Thank you for everything, for giving me such a great room.

663
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:20,440
Thanks to you, I was able to write my first project here, too.

664
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:23,700
Well, though it failed.

665
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,550
Things will go well for you, no matter what you do, or wherever you are,

666
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:29,650
since you're a person with a strong sense of responsibility.

667
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:34,290
Didn't you also score the highest among the tenants I've had?

668
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:38,240
Yes, things will work out well for you too, Landlord.

669
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,690
For marriage too. Soon a good person will show up.

670
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:47,660
I don't know about that. Whether she appears and whether I could actually marry.

671
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:51,330
Why not? You proposed to me too like that.

672
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,400
There's no reason you couldn't.

673
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,490
That was because it was you, Ji Ho.

674
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:00,560
It's because it was you, that I did that.

675
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,930
Because you're the tenant with the highest score.

676
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:08,980
What I need isn't marriage, but you, and that's why I made that proposition to you.

677
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,860
I knew that it wasn't exactly the moment where my heart should skip a beat.

678
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:22,330
Because what I need isn't a good woman, but an outstanding tenant who can guarantee a monthly income.

679
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,030
Nevertheless...

680
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,860
It was my first time

681
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:39,180
to hear someone tell me I was needed.

682
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,100
- Where are you headed?
- To Namhae. The quickest available.

683
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,570
All throughout my twenties,

684
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:58,700
I worked hard in order to become someone needed somewhere.

685
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,550
Whenever things were hard, I would cross the Han River bridge.

686
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:17,560
Crossing over the Han River, in this wide Seoul,

687
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:23,350
regardless, at least one place would need me,

688
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:34,520
is what I would think.

689
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:57,650
For ten years, you've really been hit and injured a lot too.

690
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:02,600
When you came up, you were sparkling.

691
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,160
Seoul to Namhae

692
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,780
♫ Stay with me  ♫

693
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:19,370
Why did I try so hard to live so diligently?

694
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:24,940
when in the end, I'd just go down without achieving anything.

695
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:29,180
The likelihood of having a place that's mine here,

696
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:32,800
it never existed in the first place.

697
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:57,020
How are you—

698
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:00,880
- How?
- Why aren't you answering your phone?

699
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,290
Oh. My cell phone ran out of battery, so it's off.

700
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:09,400
You left this in the room.

701
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,670
You came because of this?

702
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:16,330
I was heading out anyway.

703
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:19,600
I remembered you said the evening 7 o'clock bus.

704
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,350
They seemed like items you need.

705
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,530
I do need them.

706
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:33,290
We're leaving now.

707
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:36,170
Well then.
♫ Just briefly  ♫

708
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:40,840
Yes.

709
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:45,120
♫ In weary of hardship  ♫

710
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,690
♫ Please be my forever resting place ♫

711
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,800
♫ Just briefly  ♫

712
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,900
♫ My injured heart  ♫

713
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,450
♫ I will entrust it to you  ♫

714
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:01,720
♫ As you pass by  ♫

715
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,860
♫ You can look at it  ♫

716
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:08,820
Because it was you, Ji Ho.

717
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:12,480
It was because it's you that I did that.

718
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:20,000
That I am needed.

719
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,530
The person who first said that to me.

720
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,460
The ahjussi is angry right now, so he can't wait long.

721
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,770
I need you to answer quickly.

722
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,340
Yes.

723
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:38,530
Will you marry me?

724
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:44,370
I . . . quickly. He's waiting.

725
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,710
Yes.

726
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:49,280
Then I'll go and get my luggage first.

727
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,270
Ahjussi's very angry.

728
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:54,080
Wait.

729
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:57,440
Before that, I have something to ask you.

730
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,280
Yes, go ahead.

731
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,350
By chance, do you . . .

732
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,910
like me?

733
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:09,380
♫ When the two of us are together ♫

734
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,340
Nope.

735
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:14,650
♫ I can't help but smile  ♫

736
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:20,210
♫ Sometimes with our eyes evading awkwardly.  ♫

737
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,970
Our proposal

738
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,010
has begun.

739
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:30,380
♫ You are my everything  ♫

740
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:36,270
♫ Open my injured heart, loving you  ♫

741
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:40,290
♫ Come just a bit closer to me ♫

742
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:44,180
♫ Embrace me snugly  ♫

743
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,800
♫ Tell me I will always be special to you  ♫

744
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:54,700
I decided to marry my tenant today.

745
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,860
Really marry? Marrying with a woman?

746
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:01,350
Though we only knew each other for a short period of time, since he's someone I feel that I really need in life.

747
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:04,420
- Need?
- Now I know why you want to marry!

748
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,520
Punk! You can fool everyone in the world, but you can't fool me!

749
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:09,110
- She's pretty.
- Oh, she's pretty?

750
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:11,950
My family is absolutely patriarchal.

751
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:15,290
Shall I just sweep everything!

752
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:16,820
Tada!

753
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:20,440
I thought he was going to propose to me!

754
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,410
Will you be alright?

755
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:24,650
Why do you ask about why we're getting married?

756
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:27,900
I love Oppa.

757
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:35,040
Indeed. Marrying the tenant was the right answer.
