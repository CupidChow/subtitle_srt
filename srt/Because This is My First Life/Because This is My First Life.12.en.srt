00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,720
That's not how you do a kiss.

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,460
I said, I understand. I did it wrong.

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,500
Yes. That's what I mean. Kiss . . .

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,110
It's done like this.

11
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,900
♫ Like today, though I endure a day ♫

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:03,020
♫ It keeps coming back, living through each day  ♫

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,360
♫ And the foolish things keep repeating ♫

♫ Just in case somehow ♫

16
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,600
♫ tomorrow might be different ♫

17
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:23,500
Do you think you know it now?

18
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,350
Or . . . do you need to know more?

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,740
More. I want to know more.

20
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:41,650
♫ Like today though I endure a day ♫

21
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:48,870
♫ It keeps coming back living through each day ♫

Ji Ho?

29
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,430
You've got a call.

30
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,760
Ji Ho? Ji Ho?

31
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,570
Your phone.

32
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,210
Yeah, Mom. What?

33
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,650
What do you mean what? Where are you two and what are you doing? Why aren't you coming back?

34
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,800
Where else? By the ocean.

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,380
What else would I do by the ocean? I'm watching the ocean.

36
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,580
Yeah. Alright. I'm coming. Okay.

37
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,440
Should we go back?

38
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,070
Yes.

39
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,160
But don't you think you were too angry at your mother?

40
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,930
I was? When was I angry?

41
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,970
Oh. When you speak in dialect, you usually talk louder.

42
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:39,180
Back when I was in college too. When I would be on the phone with my mom, the girls thought I was mad at Mom.

43
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,300
I see how that's possible.

44
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,220
From what I experienced today, here,

45
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,460
people change the lax consonants to hard consonants or to aspirated consonants.

46
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,210
For example, handal (one month) to handaru.

47
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,730
Haebeorinda (did it) to haebbundaru.

48
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,040
So you analyzed that in that short time?

49
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,940
Yes. I needed to understand them to make kimchi.

50
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:11,300
Oh, yeppuda (pretty) is said as yibbida.

51
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,770
When did you . . .

52
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,770
Why? Did the ahjummas tease you, saying you're pretty because you're a Seoul man?

53
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:22,010
Nope. Not me, but you.

54
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,020
They asked me if you were pretty to me.

55
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,060
Let's go. Before she calls again.

56
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,650
What? Why won't he finish his sentence?

57
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,010
Then, we'll be going. And thank you.

58
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,870
Yeah. Always!

59
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,050
Careful of cars. Careful of people. Careful of war.

60
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,110
In case something happens, come straight here. Alright?

61
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,000
If a war breaks out, Seoul is the first target.

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,110
So don't linger there and come straight down here.

63
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,120
Go now. You've got to work tomorrow.

64
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,480
Hey, this family's son-in-law. Where are you going?

65
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,360
Yes, I need to get going now.

66
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,510
Hey, stop already. They are busy.

67
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,540
Are you the only one busy? I'm busy too.

68
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,060
If you're going to leave, then accept a drink from me first, or else you can't go.

69
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,960
No. I think I shouldn't drink anymore.

70
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,230
So you're refusing a drink from an elder right now?

71
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,670
Oh...

72
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,480
Here. Happy?

73
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,420
Hey, did I say for you to drink it?

74
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,610
Ajae, if you try to bully my groom again,

75
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:14,640
Ajae, when your son-in-law comes down, I'll just!

76
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,230
drown him in a barrel of wine.

77
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,170
Got that?!

78
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,610
When did I ever bully him?

79
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,870
Go in now.

80
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,910
- We're going.
- We'll be going.

81
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,500
- Go now. Being careful is Number One.
- I'll drop them off.

82
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,360
- I'll be back.
- Go.

83
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,870
Bye.

84
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,290
Mister Ddo Ri got a punch from you after a long absence.

85
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,500
What? Did this happen before?

86
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,710
Yeah. Before, there was a wandering dog in the neighborhood that Noona would look after.

87
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,850
But that mister took it away saying he was going to eat it.

88
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,840
What? Can't be. Dog stew?

89
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,850
Yea, that's it.

90
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,710
So then? What happened?

91
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,420
What else? So Noona dragged their tiller out.

92
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:14,040
And she turned on the engine right at the wharf.

93
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,290
She said if he didn't give the dog back alive, she would sink the tiller in the water.

94
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,720
Unni, daebak!

95
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,310
Why are you talking about the past?

96
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,430
My noona goes all the way once she's gives her heart to someone.

97
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,830
Now you've got yourself shackled for life, Brother-in-law.

98
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,050
Drive looking forward, punk.

99
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,890
Alright.

100
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,370
Thank you. And take care of yourself. Bye.

101
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,780
Yeah. Go carefully, Brother-in-law.

102
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,200
Yes. Good bye.

103
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,750
Then...

104
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,050
Shall our baby go now too?

105
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,940
What?

106
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,190
Unni and Brother-in-law are a little strange.

107
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,700
What is?

108
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,510
They are too ... 'fresh' (new love).

109
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,180
Of course they are, since they're newlyweds.

110
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,110
No, not that new feel among newlyweds.

111
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,180
The flirting atmosphere from when you and I were just starting to have feelings for each other.

112
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,780
What are you talking about? They are married. Why would they flirt?

113
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,240
Let's go. It's cold.

114
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,480
That expression couldn't happen between husband and wife, though.

115
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,380
I'm here. You're in the back, right?

116
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,130
Yes.

117
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,480
It's over there.

118
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,300
Um. Should I ask the person next to my seat

119
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,280
to switch for us?

120
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,640
No. I think it's best to just sit in our assigned seats.

121
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,110
Asking someone to switch seats could be a discourtesy.

122
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,840
Though it seems like nothing, it's requesting something that's difficult to say no to.

123
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,440
Yes. Now that I think about it, it's true.

124
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,940
In the dramas or movies that filled my early childhood,

125
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,370
a kiss was always the symbol of a happy ending.

126
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,280
However, the reason why a kiss had to be the ending,

127
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,530
now I finally know.

128
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:18,650
Because reality starts after that.

129
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:28,110
Be well. Go back and act like nothing happened. But instead, don't ever love again. You don't deserve it.

130
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,340
And people . . .

131
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,110
they don't want to see reality.

132
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:45,090
Because reality could be very painful,

133
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,910
or very dark.

134
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,590
A kiss or marriage,

135
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,410
in reality, neither

136
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,210
means a happy ending.

137
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,150
The drama between that man and me,

138
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,750
it's only barely just started. And also . . .

139
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,840
♫ Let me briefly borrow your warm shoulder ♫

140
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,380
♫ Let me briefly borrow your warm shoulder ♫

141
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,360
♫ please be a shelter for my tired soul ♫

142
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,450
My desire, too, it's only just started.

143
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:40,080
♫ I'll leave my wounded heart in your care ♫

144
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,260
♫ a quick glance as you pass by ♫

145
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,530
This isn't good.

146
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,700
All the romantic cells inside me

147
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,520
have been awakened.

148
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,280
Episode 12
Because It's My First Time with Desire

149
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,440
- Hello.
- Hello!

150
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,560
Aigoo, where are you coming from at this hour?

151
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,270
Ah, we just came back from visiting my family.

152
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,440
Ah, I see. Oh, go on in.

153
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,670
- Work hard.
- Work hard.

154
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:28,100
Were you well? Still, came back pretty early, right?

155
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,760
Maybe you should've stayed there overnight? It was a first visit home in a long time.

156
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,330
No, I need to go to work. Bok Nam switched the weekend shift with me.

157
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,270
But still, you should hurry and get some sleep, even just a few hours.

158
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,910
Yes.

159
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,110
I enjoyed making kimchi.

160
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,940
The trip to the ocean too.

161
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,200
Yes, me too.

162
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,800
You should head in first.

163
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,510
No. You should head in first.

164
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,500
No, still, I'll go after I see you go in.

165
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,450
Then...

166
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,670
Ah...

167
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,840
Now that I think about it, we don't have any proper pictures together.

168
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,540
Husband

169
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,890
Are you asleep?

170
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,400
No. Not yet.

171
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,250
I have something I want to ask you.

172
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,630
Ah, why did you do that? Why would you ask him that?

173
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,260
Ah...

174
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,960
When all the ahjummas asked if I was pretty...

175
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,380
What did you say?

176
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,130
Oh.

177
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,700
I said that you were pretty.

178
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,810
♫ The things I need to do are overfilling ♫

179
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:15,680
♫ And I don't want to spend emotion ♫

180
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:23,810
♫ To someone like me love is an emotion that is useless ♫

181
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,910
♫ Though love passes by and I say no ♫

182
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,220
♫ when you are in front of me ♫

183
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:40,870
♫ I become wanting to hold your hands and everything's fine ♫

184
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,820
It would be nice if we could sleep together.

185
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,550
In the same bed.

186
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,380
What did I just say? What's wrong with me?

187
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,120
I am trash.

188
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,880
I need to go to work. Heat the soup before you eat.

189
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,070
Here! Where are you going?

190
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,770
Zoo.

191
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,040
Say, "I'm going to the zoo."

192
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,340
I'm going to the zoo.

193
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,890
Thank you. Say thank you.

194
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,900
Thank you.

195
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,890
Hello, Teacher.

196
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,650
Hello.

197
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,420
Have fun.

198
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,810
Listen to the teacher well.

199
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,870
Bye.

200
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,470
Yoona.

201
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,340
Have fun! Play well.

202
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,950
My honey honey

203
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,280
- Yeah.
- Are you on the way?

204
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,050
Yeah. I'm on the bus.

205
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,000
You're working the early shift today, right?

206
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,580
Yup.

207
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,740
Where should I go later?

208
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,130
It's a seven o'clock performance,

209
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,050
so let's meet at Daehakro then.

210
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,110
Okay, see you later.

211
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,200
Rang.

212
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,850
Huh?

213
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,490
I love you.

214
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,300
Yeah. Me too.

215
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,340
I love you.

216
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,850
Okay.

217
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,570
Comfortable, my foot.

218
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,600
And what's with his taste? Bleh.

219
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,310
Tailor-made underwear

220
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,980
Tailor-made underwear

221
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,620
How did you go around wearing it with it being so uncomfortable?

222
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,580
Well, half the time I wore it and half the time I took it off.

223
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,670
Strangely, it's always uncomfortable around the armpits.

224
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,920
It's because the shape of your chest is different than others.

225
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,840
- It is?
- Yes.

226
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,290
Just like facial appearance are different from individual to individual, chest shapes are different as well.

227
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,300
In terms of size and in terms of volume and position.

228
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,820
Everyone's different in how narrow or wide but people tend to not know that.

229
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,750
They just put on ready-to-wear underwear based on size only so of course, it can't be comfortable.

230
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,430
So I guess a lot of people come and get theirs tailor-made?

231
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,110
Yes.

232
00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:00,580
I just do this as a side job after I got married, but somehow people find their way here.

233
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,840
Yes and you have quite a lot of materials.

234
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,250
These materials.

235
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:19,590
How about making them into a database and make them different patterns according to chest shapes?

236
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,200
A database?

237
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,600
Yes. Well, for example . . .

238
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,980
Bird chest type, flat type, drooping type. Make these various patterns,

239
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,880
and recommend the underwear that fits that pattern.

240
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,470
So people could do this online without coming here,

241
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,810
and you could get the transaction done like that.

242
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,310
I don't know that stuff well.

243
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,970
I just didn't want my skills I learned before I got married go to waste.

244
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:51,510
And I like meeting people like this and making them one stitch at a time.

245
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,250
That's why I do this.

246
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,490
I see. I think I was too materialistic sounding. I'm ashamed.

247
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,320
No, you gave me good advice.

248
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,470
It's just that I'm not really talented for business.

249
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,520
How much is it?

250
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,480
Yes. It's $250 dollars.

251
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,710
Se Hee-nim?

252
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,850
Se Hee-nim?

253
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,020
I fell asleep briefly.

254
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,930
What are you doing here at the company on a weekend?

255
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:52,130
Oh. I came to get a massage.

256
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,840
I see. You went to do kimjang yesterday, right? Ji Ho's.

257
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,910
Yes. It turns out that this isn't something that can be fixed with pain relieving patches.

258
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:07,520
But what are you doing here at the company on a weekend?

259
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,650
Oh. For massage?

260
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,450
No, nope. I came out to go on a date but I just stopped by briefly for some work.

261
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:20,340
I see. Then, enjoy your date.

262
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,860
Yes.

263
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,650
Um, Se Hee-nim.

264
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,890
Se Hee-nim, you must love Ji Ho a lot.

265
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:40,000
Well, that's . . . No, I shouldn't have asked that question.

266
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,960
Then, enjoy your massage.

267
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,220
Would you like to have

268
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,310
a cup of coffee with me?

269
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:12,260
Getting married isn't working out well?

270
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,820
I don't know whether this is about marriage not working out well,

271
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,900
or if it's the dating that's not going well.

272
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,000
If it's not that either, then is it love that's not working out?

273
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,300
It seems like you're fighting more often.

274
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,270
We've always fought often.

275
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,670
We've fought shouting at each other on the roadside.

276
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:36,620
We've even thrown ribs at each other in a restaurant.

277
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,490
For 7 years, we fought as if we were MMA fighters, basically.

278
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,470
But now...

279
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,740
Do you know what we're like?

280
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,160
We don't fight.

281
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,530
We know that our thoughts differ,

282
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,460
but we still don't fight.

283
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,160
- If we fight...
- You think you might not be able to go back.

284
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,520
That's right.

285
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:17,560
Truthfully, Ji Ho and I

286
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,500
didn't get married because we loved each other.

287
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:28,460
We just got married because everything was compatible.

288
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:33,280
We decided to live together because there were no uncomfortable aspects.

289
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,780
- But then...
- Did you develop feelings?

290
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,290
Yes.

291
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:49,410
Because I became comfortable as myself, in my heart

292
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:55,160
there was room. I learned that through this marriage.

293
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,760
It seems that love and marriage are two separate problems, indeed.

294
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,200
That isn't what I meant, exactly. I just meant that you two need to be more honest with yourselves.

295
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,320
Humans naturally want what is best for themselves. And marriage is

296
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,770
one of the institutions in which that desire expresses itself most clearly.

297
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,050
Desire?

298
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,510
Se Hee-nim, I don't have that sort of thing.

299
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,290
I just like to see Rang smile.

300
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,890
I want to make Rang happy.

301
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:33,410
And most of all, without Rang,

302
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,830
it just won't do. I can't live.

303
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:41,050
We already both know that. How much more honest can we get?

304
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:52,100
'I... like to see you smile.'

305
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,000
'I... want to make you happy.'

306
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:01,190
'I... can't live without you.'

307
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,130
The subjects of your sentences

308
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,710
are all Won Seok, yourself.

309
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,200
There are no sentences in which she is the subject.

310
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,750
Well then, have a good date.

311
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:36,370
But, what do young people nowadays do

312
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,060
on a date?

313
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,080
Why are you like this?

314
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,320
What?

315
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,140
Dirty. The table

316
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,980
is so dirty.

317
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,510
Are you coming back from somewhere?

318
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,700
Yeah, I got fitted for a bra.

319
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,810
Ahh. The custom place you mentioned last time?

320
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:54,760
That's interesting. Should I try it, too?

321
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,200
It's expensive though, right?

322
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,630
Yes, it's stupidly expensive.

323
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,310
Hey, show me your chest.

324
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:07,270
What? Show you what?

325
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,810
- Online business?
- Yeah.

326
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:22,290
If we just build a system that people can use to figure out their chest type,

327
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:26,510
I think we can make customized lingerie popularized. Don't you think so?

328
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:30,620
That's right. There's no reason it wouldn't work.

329
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,610
But are you planning to do that yourself?

330
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:36,150
How would I do that? I have to go to work at the company.

331
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:40,020
I just think it might be fun, so I want to try it as a hobby.

332
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,900
I can give the idea to the designer lady, too.

333
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,450
You should try it yourself.

334
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:51,520
You've always wanted to run your own business.

335
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,530
What do you think about just going for it?

336
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:59,450
Hey, how can I quit such a prestigious company?

337
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:02,690
Even if it's terrible, they pay the best in my industry.

338
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:09,150
Also, as you know, my life isn't just mine.

339
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,930
I...

340
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:17,270
This unni has a different situation than you guys.

341
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,910
Sorry, I just...

342
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:28,040
I noticed that your eyes were sparkling when you were telling me your idea.

343
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,710
My eyes sparkled?

344
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,250
Yes.

345
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:37,590
Did they sparkle as much as your eyes sparkled when you talk about your landlord.

346
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,520
Why change the subject to that?

347
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,200
I have something that I'm really curious about.

348
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,560
You don't want to do it with your landlord?

349
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,780
- Do what?
- What do you mean? He's a man you like

350
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:56,310
whom you live with in one house. Is your body... okay?

351
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,100
You don't get hot and bothered when he's in the room right next to yours?

352
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:04,440
I don't get hot and bothered. What gets heated? It's not like that. No way. What are you saying?

353
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,420
For real? This is fascinating.

354
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,290
Is it because you've been single since birth? Because you don't know anything?

355
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,790
But be careful, Ji Ho. If you're not planning to sleep with him, don't even touch him.

356
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,340
- Why?
- What do you mean why?

357
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,180
Don't you remember my first boyfriend in college?

358
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,810
Ahhh. The boyfriend you only held hands with for six months?

359
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:34,880
Yes, I became depressed because he didn't move things along.

360
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,810
So, if you're not planning to go all the way, don't even start skin contact.

361
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:45,720
The first feelings of desire are the scariest, especially for people who've been single their whole life, like you.

362
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,610
It's like opening Pandora's box. Got it?

363
00:31:55,550 --> 00:32:00,270
That's right. In this contract marriage,

364
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:05,240
I had overlooked a very important truth.

365
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,540
I went to all-girl's middle and high schools

366
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,810
and never got to date in college.

367
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:16,020
The fact that I've been single since birth. (mo-tae solo)
[mo-tae = since the womb] + [solo]

368
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:21,650
I can't believe that such a person like me ended up living together with a man.

369
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,610
- Hey, it started.
- She really did it.
- Oh, daebak!

370
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,510
Wow, you're so good!

371
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:31,040
And with the man that opened my Pandora's box, of all people.

372
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,480
Why are you so good? Isn't this your first time?

373
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,120
Hey, the beginners are the scariest because they don't know anything.

374
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,140
I know, right? Beginners are scary.

375
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,770
Ahhh, how many times a day are you thinking of the kiss, you mo-sol (single since birth)!

376
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,480
Does your head hurt?

377
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,690
No, but how are you here?

378
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:08,210
Ah, I was at the company for a bit and decided to drop by.

379
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,550
I thought it was about time you got off work, Ji Ho.

380
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,910
It's the weekend. Is there anything you want to do?

381
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,150
What I want to do?

382
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,380
What I want to do.

383
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:33,470
Yes, is there anything you want to do?

384
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,180
No, there's nothing.

385
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:52,270
There's nothing at all I want to do!

386
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:03,710
Then, shall we do something I want to do?

387
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,330
Cats can choose what is important to them

388
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:42,130
and can choose to only remember those things.

389
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:45,790
That means they can easily forget what they don't need to remember.

390
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:49,250
That is the reason why I like cats.

391
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,480
- What about you, Ji Ho?
- Pardon?

392
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,480
Do you have an animal you like?

393
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,770
Oh, an animal I like?

394
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,660
For me, snails.

395
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,580
Snails?

396
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:12,240
Yes, snails. They carry around their home for their whole life.

397
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,630
Oh, that's very true.

398
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,120
Snails have their own home from birth.

399
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,580
Well, that is a new interpretation for me.

400
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,900
Should we go do that?

401
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,490
Pardon? Where now?

402
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,790
That.

403
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,800
Okay.

404
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:55,150
♫ I want to date, and whatever happens, I'm happy,
you make me want to love ♫

405
00:35:55,150 --> 00:36:00,660
♫ you make me want to love ♫

406
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,050
- Ho Rang.
- Oh, you're here?

407
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,940
There's still a lot of time left.

408
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,640
Yeah, there is.

409
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,570
Do you want me to hold your bag?

410
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,430
No, it's okay.

411
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,430
Wow, that man's really bad at that.

412
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,370
- Ji Ho!
- Oh! You guys.

413
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:03,240
Oh, you guys said you were watching a performance today, right?

414
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,060
But why is Brother-in-law doing this? This isn't like him.

415
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,340
I'm not sure. He suddenly asked me to come here.

416
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,880
Oh, a dating course.  (T/N: Similar to a date schedule.)

417
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,700
- Huh?
- He asked me earlier what people these days do on dates.

418
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,710
So, I told him our dating course.

419
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,600
A date?

420
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,780
I'll do another round, ₩10,000 ($10) worth.

421
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,310
- He must be a chaebol. (very rich)
- Again?

422
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:52,270
Oh, this time, I'll try it.

423
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,510
Oh, yes. Please do.

424
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:07,980
♫ all the things that I've believed in for so long ♫

425
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:14,280
♫ are changing, little by little ♫

426
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:27,120
♫ La la la la, la la la la ♫

427
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,650
Sang Goo Oppa♡

428
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:11,510
You spent ₩20,000 ($20) on that balloon-popping game.

429
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:14,760
Did you really want that stuffed animal that much?

430
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,580
This is for you, Ji Ho.

431
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,680
It's for me?

432
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,100
Yes. That's why it's a snail and not a cat.

433
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,780
You should carry it, since it's yours.

434
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,930
You could carry it for me. It's heavy.

435
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,580
- And, this, too.
- What else do you want me to carry? I don't have a free hand.

436
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:44,150
No, this is yours, so you have to hold onto it.

437
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:58,080
Gosh, why isn't she picking her phone up?

438
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,550
Oh, I'm sorry! Did you wait a long time?

439
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,330
- Yeah.
- I'm really sorry.

440
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:08,440
I was working at home and I lost track of time.

441
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,980
Why was your phone turned off?

442
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,940
You called me?

443
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,870
Oh, I left it at home.

444
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:24,110
I told you that I'd go to the front of your home. Why do we keep coming here?

445
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,150
I'm sorry.

446
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:31,140
Are you, by any chance, not wearing a bra today?

447
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:36,230
No, not today. It's not "no bra," but "no panty."

448
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,160
You really...

449
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,570
Is it true?

450
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,110
You can check for yourself.

451
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,330
Woo Soo Ji, you bad girl.

452
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,370
If it's true, you'll be punished by me!

453
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:57,840
It is cold today. If possible, you should try to wear one more layer. I must check!

454
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,840
Come here! I'm going to check if it's really a lie or not.

455
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,330
What's this? Do you carry a hair dryer around?

456
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:17,200
Yeah, the one here is pretty weak. I like using mine better.

457
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,220
So, why are we meeting outside our homes and going through all of this trouble?

458
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,910
If we meet at home, you don't have to carry these things around.

459
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:27,010
In all honesty, is there anyone who hasn't visited their girlfriend's home?

460
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:30,740
Why are we here instead of your home?

461
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,340
Oh, just give me that. You can't dry it like that.

462
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,860
I'm an expert.

463
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
- Hey, do it properly.
- I am.

464
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,110
Your hair's just weird. It's getting tangled up. Is it a wig?

465
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,510
It's pretty.

466
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,350
Really?

467
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:17,840
Yes. It's so pretty.

468
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:28,470
But, why'd you suddenly get me this?

469
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:32,480
Oh, after thinking about it,

470
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,580
I realized I never gave you a gift.

471
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,910
Even for our wedding, there were no rings.

472
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:43,220
So, I always wanted to do something for you, at least once.

473
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,850
Although it may be obvious and banal, but still, like what others do.

474
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,530
That kind of gift.

475
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,840
Yes, I see.

476
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:59,370
So is that why we had a date that was also obvious and banal, like what others do?

477
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,050
What we did today?

478
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:06,890
Ah, well...

479
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:12,360
I heard you asked Won Seok

480
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,420
what people these days do for dates.

481
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:20,150
Yes. I thought about it and realized our generations are quite different.

482
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,870
I didn't really know what to do for the date.

483
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:28,110
That's true. After thinking about it,

484
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:32,950
you're really a lot older than me. You were born in 1980, so,

485
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:38,280
when I entered elementary school, you were a middle schooler.

486
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,330
When I was in middle school,

487
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,810
you were a soldier ahjussi.

488
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:48,640
I wouldn't go as far as to say soldier ahjussi.

489
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,540
Just, soldier.

490
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,000
Okay.

491
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,410
I asked CEO Ma once

492
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:04,210
where I would have to go with an '80er on a date.

493
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:08,620
You came here a lot while you attended school, he said.

494
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,430
Yes.

495
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:27,080
Oh, we should order. What would you want?

496
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:31,380
Oh, I'll have this.

497
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,280
I'll use the restroom really quick.

498
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,980
Okay. I'll order this first.

499
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:45,280
Oh, I'll put these on.

500
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,850
Okay.

501
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,950
Why is he being so cute? Sheesh.

502
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,790
Thank you.

503
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,330
Excuse me. I'll do it for you.

504
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,630
All done.

505
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,960
Thank you.

506
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,580
It's pretty.

507
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,940
Ah, I'm sorry.

508
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:53,660
You can see the sky best from this seat.

509
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:00,390
I'm sorry for bothering you.

510
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,450
Excuse me...

511
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,310
Goodbye.

512
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,810
Yes.

513
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:31,390
Our order hasn't come out yet.

514
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,700
They suit you well.

515
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,490
Don't they?

516
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:44,330
Rang, Ji Ho's husband has a funny personality, doesn't he?

517
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:47,480
I mean, how could he do exactly what I told him to do?

518
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,100
I know. They both seem so 'fresh' (like a new love).

519
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,720
Maybe we should have played the balloon-popping game, too? It's been a while.

520
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,700
- No, it's a waste of money.
- Right?

521
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,000
Dolls also take up space, too.

522
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,760
I think we ordered too much.

523
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,670
Ah. Your mother bought this for me since I got a job.

524
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,910
Did she?

525
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:13,830
What did she say? What did you two talk about?

526
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:17,260
Oh, your mother just...

527
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,700
You need to be more honest with each other.

528
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,320
Humans are just people who do things that only benefits themselves

529
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,810
and marriage is one of the institutions that expresses

530
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:29,210
that desire most clearly.

531
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:36,150
Rang. About our marriage.

532
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:42,200
- Yeah?
- Do you think you could wait a little bit more?

533
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,970
How much longer?

534
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:50,720
About five years?

535
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,390
Five years?

536
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,490
Yeah.

537
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:00,840
No matter how much I think about it, I think it's going to take that long.

538
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:09,470
Won Seok, if we wait for five more years, I'll be 35 then.

539
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,730
Are you saying we should date for 12 years?

540
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,770
Rang, if you're tired, do you just want to go home and rest?

541
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:29,840
It's fine. You said you reserved it, so we should watch it.

542
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,510
Looking for Kim Jong Min

543
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:44,670
Let's go.

544
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:47,030
What is this?

545
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,870
Weren't we watching, "Looking for Kim Jong Wook"?

546
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,950
"Looking for Kim Jong Wook"?

547
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,170
Wasn't it "Looking for Kim Jong Min"?

548
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:07,250
No, I...

549
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:10,240
I never imagined there would be a "Looking for Kim Jong Wook" and also "Looking for Kim Jong Min."

550
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,720
It's fine. We can still cancel it and reserve it again.

551
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,680
It's fine. The other show would already be sold out.

552
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,600
Let's just watch this.

553
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,440
Have you seen Kim Jong Min?

554
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,710
They said there was someone who've seen him here.

555
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:36,870
Ah. You must not know him.

556
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:39,570
Was there a girl looking for me? Where is she?

557
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,800
Where is she right now?!

558
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,080
It looks like I just missed her, again.

559
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,810
- Yang Ho Rang, are you crazy? What's wrong with you?!
- Marriage!!!

560
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,550
I want to get married, you stupid idiot.

561
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:08,640
However, I'm still not sure what marriage is.

562
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:14,880
Are love and marriage the same thing?

563
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,530
Just how much longer do I have to go to find her?

564
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:27,510
Even if it's not next year, but in two years, it's better to be prepared.

565
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:32,460
When will I be able to see him again?

566
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,160
Rang, what do you mean in two years?

567
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,440
How can we get married in two years?

568
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,680
Do you think you could wait a little bit more?

569
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,980
Five more years.

570
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:49,740
Won Seok, if I have to wait five more years, I'll be 35 then.

571
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:53,340
Are you saying we should date for 12 years?

572
00:51:54,370 --> 00:52:00,520
Why are we always out of step with each other?

573
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,240
You should take a shower first.

574
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,490
What? Take a shower first?!

575
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:38,970
Yes. Since I took a shower first yesterday,

576
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:42,570
you should take it first today.

577
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:47,020
Ah. That's what you meant.

578
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,700
What? What...

579
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,550
Is there something else it could mean?

580
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:55,000
No.

581
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,470
No, how could it mean anything else?

582
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:01,040
When someone says to shower first, it just means to shower first, of course.

583
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,550
Ah, you should take a shower first.

584
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:11,570
I need to erase my makeup, so...

585
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:15,810
You put on makeup?

586
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:19,610
Yes. Why?

587
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:24,650
Nothing. I thought you don't use makeup.

588
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:28,580
Since your bare face after you wash it looks the exact same as you do, always.

589
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:35,030
What the heck? I put makeup on today.

590
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:55,550
What the heck? He's making my heart skip a beat in such unexpected ways.

591
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:04,550
But how much longer will my heart just continue to skip a beat?

592
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:09,180
Love is not platonic, you 1980 ahjussi.

593
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:23,980
It's pretty.

594
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,410
What's wrong with me?

595
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:29,910
Are you crazy?

596
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:32,810
Now you're getting excited over a woman's touch?

597
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:35,200
Are you obscene or something?

598
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,410
I will drive you to your home, Oppa.

599
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,210
I don't want to.

600
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:44,700
I just wanted to take you home.

601
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,640
Do you know how dangerous underground parking lots are these days?

602
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,680
You are stubborn about such weird things.

603
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,670
Excuse me, Ms. Woo Soo Ji, do you have any thoughts of marriage?

604
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,930
Marriage?

605
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,510
Not at all.

606
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:01,120
- Not at all?
- Yeah.

607
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,110
Do you plan on doing it, CEO Ma? Marriage?

608
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,020
Me? Well,

609
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:10,680
if there is a chance, then sure, I may.

610
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,650
But eating together, and going grocery shopping together,

611
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:19,050
and fighting and making up, and sharing our daily lives,

612
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,040
I think it could be pretty nice.

613
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,170
That's why I don't want to.

614
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:28,590
How can you share such plain daily life stuff with someone and still have sex? It totally ruins the fantasy.

615
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:29,670
What?

616
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:34,410
Marriage is the grave of a man-woman relationship. It's the end of sexuality.

617
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:39,090
Think about it. A man and woman are always fighting about loans or the Thanksgiving holiday.

618
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:42,020
How can they sleep together? Am I wrong?

619
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:47,050
Soo Ji, that is how regular people live.

620
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:51,120
They may bicker and fight, but they also comfort each other at times.

621
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,890
That's how everyone lives their lives.

622
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:56,980
I don't want to do the same things that others do.

623
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,680
My life is burdensome enough, and I know my place in the world.

624
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:05,090
I have no intention of ruining someone else's life.

625
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,120
Sexless, Your Health is in Danger!

626
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:23,640
That's right.

627
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,170
First, insomnia. Second, sensitive.

628
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:27,720
Third, feeling helpless and having headaches.

629
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:31,180
Indeed,

630
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:35,530
I am deeply frustrated right now.

631
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,780
This is dangerous.

632
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:25,510
I enjoyed reading the book.

633
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:29,790
I didn't know it was a special memory, but I ended up borrowing it.

634
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,630
I'm sorry.

635
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:33,910
Island

636
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:45,750
How are you going to get home? Bus?

637
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:49,070
I don't want to. I'll take the subway. Chugga-chugga-choo-choo.

638
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:52,390
If I didn't have to work, I would've taken you home.

639
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:56,320
Aigoo, it's fine, Woo Soo Ji.

640
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:03,070
No, if you really feel bad, then you should treat me to a cup of coffee in your house.

641
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:08,290
Come on, I came all the way here, so how could you not give me at least a cup of coffee?

642
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:11,970
So you had ulterior motives? I didn't think you were like this, but you are very cunning.

643
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:13,900
I'm not cunning.

644
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,730
I just want to take a look around my girlfriend's house.

645
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:19,140
I'm just curious about your room's smell.

646
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:22,040
I'm also curious about your pajamas. Okay, fine.

647
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,710
I'm even curious about your messy bathroom.

648
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:27,250
But why would you be curious about that?

649
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,650
I really can't understand you.

650
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:33,630
No, I just want to share our daily life with each other.

651
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:36,340
Go, before the subway stops running for the night.

652
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:38,260
I need to go and work.

653
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:41,840
Ah, that's right. Do you want to take some freshly-made kimchi home with you? Ji Ho gave me some.

654
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,240
No thanks. I quit eating kimchi.

655
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:57,240
Oh, what are you doing there?

656
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,000
Hey, don't you think your mother is a bit strange?

657
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,170
What? Is she hiding a chunk of gold at home or something?

658
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:10,220
My Love ♡
Where are you? I just got home. Hurry up!

659
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:17,240
What are you doing? Let's go.

660
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,900
Okay.

661
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,170
Go home safely. Text me when you get home.

662
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,510
Okay.

663
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:46,850
Soo Ji.

664
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:50,340
Perhaps, did you invite a friend over to your house?

665
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,840
No. Who would come over at this hour?

666
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,840
All the girls are busy.

667
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:58,740
- Oh...
- What is it?

668
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,030
You want a cup of coffee?

669
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:05,850
I'm tired. I just want to go home and rest.

670
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,860
Goodbye!
The door is closing.

671
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,470
Number one, we only meet outside

672
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:27,410
whether it's the holidays or weekend. Number two, don't ever ask questions about my personal life.

673
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:39,010
Give me that. That. It's mine.

674
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,270
I'm sorry, I usually remember all the guys I sleep with.

675
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:50,270
I just said I wanted to sleep with you. When did I say I wanted to go out with you?

676
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:53,510
That day, I was just messing around

677
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:56,330
because my body craved it.

678
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:59,960
Marriage? Not at all.

679
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:04,200
You were out?

680
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,710
Be well.

681
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:03,700
Go back and live on like nothing happened. Don't ever love someone. You have no right to.

682
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:10,610
♫ please stay, quietly, without a sound, still ♫

683
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:12,500
It's cold, so why did you come out?

684
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:16,180
I just came back from the supermarket to buy ingredients for barley tea.

685
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:19,110
It's cold, Mom. Let's go in.

686
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,250
♫ not even a scent remains ♫

687
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,740
Did you eat anything yet?

688
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:28,410
I wanted to eat with you, so I didn't eat anything yet.
♫ but your image lingers on ♫

689
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,910
♫ but your image lingers on ♫

690
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:38,750
That someone is coming

691
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:42,640
is a tremendous thing.

692
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:58,550
♫ ah, come with me ♫

693
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:06,840
That's because his past,

694
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:10,680
his present, and

695
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:19,870
his future, they are all coming with him.

696
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:25,270
♫ I am slowly getting used to it ♫

697
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,980
Let's go.

698
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:31,980
Rang.

699
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,620
What is it?

700
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:37,970
Just what is it?

701
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:42,590
Let's break up.

702
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:50,650
It's because their entire life is coming.

703
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,510
Be well. Live on like nothing happened. Don't ever love someone. You have no right to.

704
01:03:58,470 --> 01:03:59,830
Book: Island
Wedding registration application

705
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:03,870
Jung Min...

706
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,780
I moved out all of my stuff.

707
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:12,180
You just need to get yours.

708
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:17,940
I... I was wrong. I'll explain everything.

709
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:21,210
- Because of my father's phone call—
- In front of me,

710
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:25,780
don't talk about your father.

711
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:30,450
In front of me,

712
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,410
don't say anything

713
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:39,150
about your family.

714
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:45,780
Let us talk, please?

715
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,810
In front of me!

716
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:51,940
Don't ever say, "us."

717
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,470
Don't become happy.

718
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:21,750
Like you told me to, I did not become happy.

719
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,140
Like you told me to,

720
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:33,170
I didn't love anyone.

721
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:38,850
However, today, in that place,

722
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:45,270
for a moment

723
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:47,730
I was happy.

724
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:52,020
For a moment,

725
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:54,170
I had forgotten.

726
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:03,810
Do you want to watch it together?

727
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:19,880
♫ without even taking a breath, I passed by so many things ♫

728
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:23,680
To me, this woman

729
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,850
is pretty.
♫ after wandering here and there ♫

730
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:30,510
♫ I forgot where I was headed to ♫

731
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:38,950
To me, her heart is adorable.

732
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,980
However...

733
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:53,140
Goodnight.

734
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:57,450
Yes. Goodnight.

735
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:08,910
... at the same time, I am scared.

736
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:13,710
I am afraid of myself.

737
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,010
That I might

738
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:20,910
hurt someone else again.

739
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:26,500
However...

740
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:32,540
Now, I also...

741
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:40,410
Should we

742
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:47,300
sleep together tonight?

743
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:55,540
...want to be happy.

744
01:07:55,540 --> 01:08:01,720
♫ even when I don't want to love ♫

745
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,980
♫ when you are in front of me ♫

746
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:10,240
♫ oh, I want to hold your hand, and whatever happens,
I am happy ♫

747
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:14,170
♫ you make me want to love ♫

748
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:18,590
Because This is My First Life

749
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:22,310
You must've been uncomfortable.

750
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:26,040
When you're in love, there are more things you must protect.
11/5: She looked at me weirdly... 11/10: Because today's sea is my first.

751
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,340
How nice, such a relationship.

752
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:33,750
A CEO from a production company came to find me today.

753
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:37,350
Have you heard about her, after that time?

754
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:39,510
Was this the relationship you wanted with me, CEO Ma?

755
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:42,720
Intruding into parts of my private life that I don't want to show you?

756
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:46,410
I want to make a good story that I can share.

757
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:48,980
I've done it once before. Something like marriage.

758
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:54,550
Both he and I each have Room Nineteen (referring to "To Room Nineteen" by Doris Lessing)
