Is this not showing well?

8
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,550
- I....
- Should we..

9
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,110
Ah...

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,620
You go first.

11
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,500
Yes.

12
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,770
So,

13
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,680
From now on should we...

14
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,440
No, Ji Ho, you go first.

15
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,000
Should we...

16
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,030
Our contract.

17
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,450
I would like to terminate it.

18
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,870
♫ tThose dreams that filled this room ♫

19
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,080
♫ Those dreams that filled this room ♫

20
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,400
♫ Have lost their meaning, one sheet at a time ♫

21
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,780
The contract...

22
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,230
♫ and faded ♫

23
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,410
So, you want to terminate our contract.

24
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,040
Yes.

25
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,850
♫ just like today, I endure another day ♫

26
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,380
♫ but a another day keeps coming ♫

27
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,500
Because of you, I had a good time today.

28
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,720
I laughed so much because of you Ho Rang.

29
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,460
It seems like I will collapse from exhaustion.

30
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,970
I'll admit to that.

31
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,760
Oh? You admit it?

32
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,420
Oh, right.

33
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,320
You go first.

34
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,500
Then I will go first.

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,400
Oh!

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,640
Isn't that Ho Rang?

37
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,410
♫ I can't walk even one step ♫

38
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,460
- Go home safely.
- Yes.

39
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,460
I've never seen him before.

40
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,570
Goodbye.

41
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,620
Oh, he's the head of accounting at my company.

42
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,080
Huh?! Really?

43
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,890
Yeah.

44
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,790
♫ even one step ♫

45
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,860
The contract...

46
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,600
You said you wanted to end it?

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,400
Yes.

48
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:15,570
My contract with the production company is going to happen sooner than I thought,

49
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,710
so I'll be able to rent my own place.

50
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,780
And once I find my own place...

51
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,730
And if you find your own place,

52
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,780
then you will no longer have reason to pay rent to me.

53
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,440
Yes.

54
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,490
And in that case,

55
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,110
there won't be a reason to maintain our contract.

56
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,690
I had that thought.

57
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,290
Since we got married because of rent, after all.

58
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,560
That's true.

59
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,940
It's a good thing this happened.

60
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,190
You can write again,

61
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,080
and your financial problems are solved, so it is a very good thing.

62
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,430
Then

63
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,900
please rest. Let's continue our conversation at a later time.

64
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,360
Se Hee.

65
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,660
What you were going to say earlier,

66
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,860
you haven't said it yet.

67
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,510
It wasn't anything important.

68
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,800
That our

69
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,510
recycling, I would take care of it. That's what I was going to say.

70
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,370
When you began working, I thought you would become busier.

71
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,490
The wife taking care of these things behind the scenes is important, too.

72
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,330
Let's get going.

73
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,350
Excuse me, Father.

74
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,130
There is something I have to tell you.

75
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,150
What is it?

76
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,910
I'm sorry, but...

77
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,450
This...

78
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,590
I cannot accept it.

79
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,300
There is something I need to be honest with you about.

80
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,180
The reason I married Se Hee

81
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,490
was because of his house.

82
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,590
From the beginning it was not a marriage based on love.

83
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,890
Our conditions were satisfactory to each other,

84
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,650
and we had similar values.

85
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,970
That is why we married.

86
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,240
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,200
So what about it? Why is that a problem?

88
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,150
What?

89
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,370
What are you sorry for? All marriages are like that.

90
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,810
Who marries only because of love? They marry because the conditions are compatible.

91
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,640
This is an obvious thing so why are you explaining yourself all of a sudden?

92
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,760
Father,

93
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,090
why did you give us your blessing?

94
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,970
It was such a sudden marriage.

95
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,930
When it comes to marriage, there is a right time.

96
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,850
And you happened to appear at the right time as Se Hee's spouse.

97
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,670
And you were pleasant, kind, and well-behaved.

98
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,340
There was no reason to object.

99
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:41,120
But then you added that you loved each other, so that was fortunate.

100
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,930
So it's fortunate

101
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,860
that it exists in marriage.

102
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,640
Love.

103
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,470
You're being odd today. What a question.

104
00:07:54,470 --> 00:08:00,010
At that time, when you asked me why I was marrying Se Hee,

105
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,750
I replied that I loved him.

106
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,380
That has been bothering me lately,

107
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,810
that I lied to you.

108
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,100
But why, suddenly?

109
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,210
Because

110
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,340
I came to love Se Hee,

111
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,410
for real.

112
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,380
Well, that is indeed fortunate.

113
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,640
And that is how love appears within marriage, you know. As you live together as a couple.

114
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,900
No matter how much they say the world has changed

115
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:44,450
it is still proper for the man's family to pay for the house. And things will get harder when you have to keep house after having babies later. So keep it.

116
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,830
Let's go now.

117
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,970
Your husband will calm down about this later. So you keep it.

118
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,600
You can work on convincing him.

119
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,140
It's cold, so go home safely.

120
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,400
♫ I am becoming more accustomed to it ♫

121
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:23,030
♫ this moment that feels like time has come to a stop ♫

122
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:29,160
♫ only that faraway flickering light remains ♫

123
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,720
♫ Ah, ah ♫

124
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,650
♫ Ah, ah ♫

125
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,960
♫ Stay with me ♫

126
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:49,800
♫ Ah, ah ♫

127
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,880
"Woori" (us/our)

128
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,800
♫ Come with me ♫

129
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,610
Yes, Ji Ho.

130
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,980
Se Hee.

131
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,940
Yes.

132
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,700
I have a question.

133
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,950
Not as someone who signed a contract with you as the payor and payee

134
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,340
and not as a man and a woman,

135
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,460
but as your 'junior' in life,

136
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,100
I have something I am curious about.

137
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,770
Yes,

138
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,110
please go ahead.

139
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,670
What is

140
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,640
marriage?

141
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,200
Do you know

142
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,500
what marriage is, Se Hee?

143
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,820
Oh, oh Honey!

144
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,180
What did you say? Marriage? Are you in your right mind?

145
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,230
What? She is pregnant? What?!?

146
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,250
Oh, Honey, please use your words, please.

147
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,130
I can

148
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,490
take responsibility.

149
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,800
I love her

150
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,110
so I will take responsibility.

151
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,090
What? Love?

152
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,240
Fine, so are you going to eat that love to survive?

153
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,280
What about her family's debt?

154
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,100
Is marriage some sort of game kids play?

155
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,700
What if there are rumors at school?

156
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,450
The person suffering the most right now is her.

157
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,870
How can you only be concerned with your reputation? Rumors about you?

158
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,920
As an educator, aren't you ashamed of yourself?

159
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,020
Get out. Get out right now!

160
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,900
Get out of my house! Never return! Get out!

161
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,950
Get out right now!

162
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,050
Ji Ho.

163
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,150
Marriage must be...

164
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,330
So that it...

165
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,730
Real marriage...

166
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,510
Her voice

167
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,380
is trembling.

168
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,010
Marriage that people enter into because of love...

169
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,410
Her eyes

170
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,500
are tearing up.

171
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,340
... is a happy marriage, isn't that right?

172
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,200
Ji Ho is

173
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,370
crying...

174
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,860
Because of me.

175
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,490
Episode 15
Because It's My First Intermission

176
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,770
Did you sleep well?

177
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,380
I'm making a trip home.

178
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,740
If there are any requests you'd like to add to our contract termination

179
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,040
please let me know.

180
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,620
Two Year Tenancy Marriage Contract

181
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,870
Ack!

182
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,240
Bomi-nim, how are you here?

183
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,670
Why else?

184
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,530
You don't remember? What happened yesterday?

185
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,440
What happened yesterday? What . . . Oh! What's this, boxers.

186
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,780
Why am I in my underwear?

187
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,480
Why are you acting like you're embarrassed?

188
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,930
Yesterday, you were stripping your clothes off just fine.

189
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,830
You really don't remember, it seems, what happened last night.

190
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,450
I've got a sour tummy.

191
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,500
Is there something to help me sober up?

192
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,430
Why are you hugging this pillow though?

193
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,070
Who are you to take someone else's pillow and sleep with it?

194
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:53,820
Do you know what this pillow is? Why are you just taking it carelessly without asking first—

195
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,840
Obnoxious.

196
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,900
You almost died at the club and I carried you home on my back.

197
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,380
What? Carelessly?

198
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,140
You took off your own clothes while you were sleeping.

199
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,530
Bomi-nim.

200
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,240
I'm sorry. I really misunderstood.

201
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,140
It's because I'm quite a loser at the moment.

202
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,200
I was mad at myself but I took it out on you instead.

203
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,280
I'm really sorry.

204
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,150
You don't want to get sobered up?

205
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,460
Ho Rang, you eat this stuff well too?

206
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,010
Yes. I have to eat hangover soup here the day after I drink alcohol to feel sobered up.

207
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,160
You are truly my ideal type.

208
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,970
What?

209
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,400
Deputy Sim.

210
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,520
Oh, Bomi, you're here to eat?

211
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,120
Yes.

212
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,250
Come sit over here.

213
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,980
That's regrettable. Thanks to you we got some new regulars.

214
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,320
It's regrettable for me as well.

215
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,780
Thank you so much

216
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,210
for giving me a great job.

217
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,130
It's not much.

218
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,270
Think of it as retirement pension and congratulatory gift.

219
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,890
But where's Bok Nam?

220
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,660
Bok Nam? Bok Nam—

221
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,650
Where did that kid go again?

222
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,940
Ack!

223
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,670
Oh, you startled me!

224
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,980
What?

225
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,520
I ran here thinking I missed the chance to say bye to you.

226
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,820
So startled. Why did you run here?

227
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,190
Where's your motorcycle?

228
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,550
I parted ways with it after a teary farewell ceremony.

229
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,410
I put it up for sale so I can go study at the academy.

230
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:30,520
Academy? Oh, that one you talked about before? So you could immigrate as a skilled worker?

231
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,790
I think I will croak if I continue to live my lifestyle.

232
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,690
What is this? A frame?

233
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:44,060
You don't remember? The wedding picture I directed for you two.

234
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,590
Oh.

235
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,190
I went to the ceremony hall for part-time work and I got it. You're grateful, right?

236
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,250
Thank you, Bok Nam.

237
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,820
We've decided to divorce.

238
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,730
What?

239
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,450
Our marriage. We've decided to end it.

240
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,550
What are you talking about?

241
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,930
You guys fought? Did you fight?

242
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,990
No.

243
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:16,240
It seems it will be hard to live together due to personality differences,

244
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,630
so we mutually agreed to end it.

245
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,000
What are you talking about?

246
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,210
If you disagree, you just try to adjust to each other. That's what married life is.

247
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,940
What is this?!

248
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,730
Honey. Say something to him.

249
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,010
Ji Ho's friend. How do you and the accountant know each other?

250
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,380
Well, that's . . .

251
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,530
We met on the app. On Gyeolmalrae.

252
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,530
Our app? Heol!

253
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,300
You kept asking me for pointers. So it was because of her.

254
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,710
This is all thanks to you, Bomi, and Won Seok.

255
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,200
Thanks to such capable developers,

256
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,900
I got to meet my ideal woman. I thought I wouldn't be able to, not in this life.

257
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,330
Your ideal type?

258
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,260
Yes, my wish was to marry someone like Ho Rang.

259
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,010
Positive and meticulous and easy-going.

260
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,220
I was totally shocked when I first met her. There's nothing I dislike about her, at all.

261
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,350
So you're getting married?

262
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,930
Did you two set a date yet?

263
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,830
No. It's not like that.

264
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,880
It's true. It's not like that.

265
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,520
We just in the 'some' (flirting) phase.

266
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,320
But this is something I must put in all my 'best touch' towards the done proposal.

267
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,160
Until Sam Okyere is so shocked he says 'h' (celebrity reference). Agree (said with an aspirated 'h' sound)?

268
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,170
Agree back.

269
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,900
Oh. Alright.

270
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,560
It's going to get cold. Hurry and eat.

271
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,290
He's still using teen slang.

272
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,780
- Totally ruins it.
- Teen slang?

273
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,690
Did he study abroad?

274
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,280
Ho Rang!

275
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,600
- You need to put this in to make it taste good. Put lots of --
- No, perilla . . .

276
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,060
No, Rang doesn't like perilla seeds.

277
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,670
I'm sorry.

278
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:59,290
It's me. If it's alright, would you like to go on a date with me?

279
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,010
So you're going to part ways?

280
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,630
Yes.

281
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,560
Alright. Since you always live life just as you please.

282
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,340
Getting married as you please, and divorce as you please, too.

283
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,260
Do you really think that way?

284
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,970
That I've been living life as I please?

285
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,900
Do you really think that?

286
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,000
What is this then, if it's not living as you please?

287
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,740
Father.

288
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:54,300
Father, as for me, after that day,

289
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,030
I have not once, even for a second, lived as I pleased.

290
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,360
Do you know why?

291
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,390
Because the person I chose for the first time since I was born,

292
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,660
was rejected.

293
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,640
And by the person I trusted the most,

294
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,950
the person I loved the most.

295
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,860
I liked you so much, Father.

296
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,190
I loved you so much.

297
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,800
But that person I loved

298
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,490
wholly disregarded the life that I chose.

299
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,960
Do you know how that had wounded my heart?

300
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,870
But what about you, then?

301
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,110
Do you know with what mindset I've lived my life, since then?

302
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:55,230
Even if I go back to that time, my choice is the same.

303
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,930
What parent, when their child says he will go into a fire pit,

304
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:02,100
just sits and watches? If you had married her, back then,

305
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,640
think about just how miserable your life would be now.

306
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,360
So in order to save your own child,

307
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,940
you push another's child into that fire pit?

308
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,230
Because she's a woman, because she was poor,

309
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,430
you left her to carry all the baggage on her own?

310
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,000
Because my own child is more important to me.

311
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:28,200
Even if it's childish and loathesome, that is the heart of a parent.

312
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,240
That is love.

313
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:41,750
So... so... How could I let anyone be with me?

314
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,160
How do I have the right?

315
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,890
When I should just be miserable alone.

316
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:38,190
Wow. CEO. I really thought you were some bat.

317
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:46,020
Thank you, Writer. Using that expression.

318
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,160
So you really won't sign with us?

319
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:07,380
Because of Se Hee? Because you don't want to be involved with me?

320
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,450
If I said it's not, then it would be a lie, right?

321
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,670
I am divorcing.

322
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,360
What?

323
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,980
To be more precise,

324
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,790
our contract, we've decided to end it.

325
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,610
What?

326
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,600
Because it feels like it's because of you?

327
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,450
Yes.

328
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:55,580
You don't have quite that much influence in our relationship.

329
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,600
I see.

330
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,020
I went overboard, then.

331
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,510
I could see things more clearly, actually, thanks to you.

332
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,850
That I truly

333
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,920
love Se Hee,

334
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,010
I came to know that more clearly.

335
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,840
But . . . why . . .

336
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,030
I want to love.

337
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,260
I want to love to my heart's content, with him.

338
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,240
But I don't know how to do that.

339
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,970
Just...

340
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,200
What about kids then? When will you have a kid then?

341
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,680
That's what all marriages are like.

342
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,990
Who only gets married for love?

343
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,010
The conditions have to be suitable.

344
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:02,140
It feels like being holed up in Room #19 called marriage, should I say?

345
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,750
It's a bit strange, right? And complicated.

346
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,000
No.

347
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:20,180
To be honest, I can understand you so well.

348
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:29,960
Marriage is too many people's

349
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,300
love getting tangled up, it seems.

350
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:50,050
The issue is that those loves,

351
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,440
each and all

352
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,760
are all sincere.

353
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,750
When you get to know it, each and all

354
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,570
have such beautiful hearts.

355
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,520
But even the beautiful hearts, when you tangle them up and mix them,

356
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,670
the original beautiful image it once was

357
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,440
becomes unidentifiable.

358
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,770
What kind of a love was it, originally?

359
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,380
That becomes unknowable.

360
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:43,540
That's why they say husband and wife stay together for attachment. They are zero degree kin. They are family.

361
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,610
I suppose they become all of those various relationships.

362
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,020
It's very amazing

363
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,880
and a very scary thing, I think, becoming spouses.

364
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,080
But I had still wished that you and Se Hee

365
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,310
would have a happy ending.

366
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,440
Why do you think we have

367
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,680
a sad ending?

368
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,750
What?

369
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,440
Because we're divorcing?

370
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,370
Oh...

371
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,410
That's—

372
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:37,760
You can't believe maintaining a marriage equals happy ending

373
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,450
and divorce is a failure of that happiness?

374
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,200
The production company CEO who is spearheading 21st-century media content.

375
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:54,390
The person who said she was looking forward to a project that exceeds even the experimental, from me.

376
00:31:54,390 --> 00:32:01,070
That person couldn't be someone with such an old-fashioned mindset, right?

377
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,740
I am not, of course.

378
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,360
Definitely not.

379
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,620
Definitely not, Writer.

380
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,430
We are definitely not that kind of a production company.

381
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,640
Signing the contract,

382
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,760
I really should reconsider it.

383
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,570
Did she just f*ck with me?

384
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,740
Who is it, at this hour?

385
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,660
What are you doing here without telling me?

386
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,530
What else? I came because I missed Mom, of course!

387
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,350
Wow, this tastes so bad.

388
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:14,870
Jjajjang noodle tastes the best when I eat with my Soo Ji.

389
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,480
But on a golden Sunday, I am here

390
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,060
eating this cozily with you so I really feel like

391
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,090
I will puke.

392
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,030
But she should tell me if she arrived,

393
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,450
or whatever. I mean, why won't she write back?

394
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,980
Hey.

395
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,140
This isn't the kind of liquor you drink like that. At that rate, your liver will melt.

396
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,290
Then what about you? Have you been living life without a liver since college days?

397
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,010
I've been living life while laundering my liver, of course.

398
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,440
Here, give it. Stop drinking it.

399
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,660
You're not someone who even drinks alcohol. What's with you, suddenly?

400
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,550
Did you confess?

401
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,890
You said you were going to confess to Ji Ho.

402
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,630
You were going to choose one out of the three.

403
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,290
CEO Ma, when you're confessing, which sentence is the least cheesy?

404
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:20,420
First, now, should we really marry for real?

405
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:24,350
Second, should we be a real husband and wife now?

406
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:28,580
Third, should we really be together now?

407
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,240
Hey, you prepared three so earnestly, unlike your usual self.

408
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:37,170
So which did you go with, among the three?

409
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,560
All three . . . .

410
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,480
I couldn't do it.

411
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,990
You said all three were cheesy.

412
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,950
You couldn't, or you didn't?

413
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,110
So you didn't do it.

414
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,900
Sleep well warmly.

415
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,910
And I love you.

416
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,180
What are you looking at?

417
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,250
How do you like him? He's totally my style.

418
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,880
Who?

419
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,720
The foreigner?

420
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,110
Why is he so white?

421
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,320
Not my style.

422
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,690
Your oppa isn't my style either.

423
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,050
By looks.

424
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,780
How is your leg so tense?

425
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,150
Hey, Woo Soo.

426
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,030
Why do you hide your oppa from me?

427
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,390
I didn't hide anything.

428
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,220
It's just that there isn't much to say.

429
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,920
So how come there's nothing to say?

430
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,020
The day your oppa came,

431
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,370
I felt really betrayed by you.

432
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,870
Do you know that?

433
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:23,160
Betrayed? You did?

434
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,070
Yea! I thought you were "mo-sol" (single since birth)

435
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,220
since you never talk about men.

436
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,310
That's why I felt betrayed.

437
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,700
I worried so much that my daughter was cursed, since you never dated for 30 years.

438
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,150
So I felt cheated for worrying about you daily.

439
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,720
Where did you learn to use those words?

440
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,520
You. You and your boyfriend. Why are you making us compete?

441
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,470
What?

442
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,460
You are.

443
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,220
If Mom says she felt betrayed,

444
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,900
you should be mad and saying, "Why would you feel betrayed?"

445
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,320
But instead, saying, "You did?" and

446
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,780
why are you putting on that guilty look?

447
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,830
Do you feel guilty towards me?

448
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:19,650
Because my leg is a guilt to you?

449
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,390
No. What are you talking about?

450
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,230
Then why?

451
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,800
How come I feel like my leg is holding you back?

452
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,600
I said it's not!

453
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,280
Why do you keep on saying strange stuff?

454
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,090
Then why aren't you leaving the company?

455
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,830
When you have to take medicine all the time from the stress.

456
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,590
Last time you even had a hair loss spot from stress.

457
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,800
How can I quit the company when there's so much stuff I need to pay for?

458
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,800
Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up.

459
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,290
Your money. Are you spending your money on yourself?

460
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,560
You're shooting it all towards the apartment parcel.

461
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,390
That's for you and me to live in together, later on!

462
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,720
I'm not going to live there though!

463
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,000
Then?

464
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,760
How are you going to live alone with that leg?

465
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,250
See?

466
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,840
My leg is the obstacle to you.

467
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,590
I told you to stand on my leg to take on the world. Instead,

468
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:33,180
my leg, you've been carrying it all alone

469
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,230
and have pinned yourself under it.

470
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,270
#1. Should we really marry now?

471
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,730
#2. Should we be real husband and wife now?

472
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:11,640
#3. Should we really be together now?

473
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,220
I need your help, Soo Ji!

474
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,700
What is the least cheesy line for proposing?

475
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,760
I'm asking because my friend's friend's friend is confessing and asked my opinion.

476
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,280
Excuse me, Mrs. Writer. Would you look at these and tell me what line is the least cheesy?

477
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,760
I'm not sure. I think they're all about the same.

478
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,000
Still, you should choose one.

479
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,720
Since you're going to be the person who will get proposed to.

480
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,830
What?

481
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,640
Who could CEO Ma's friend's friend's friend be?

482
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,720
Your husband.

483
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,630
Ah...

484
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,510
Are you not happy?

485
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,280
What?

486
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,770
Why was I not happy?

487
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:16,020
At times, they were the words I waited for.

488
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,580
At times, they were the words I wanted to hear.

489
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,780
But why was I

490
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,090
scared?

491
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,370
Hey! Come to your senses, Nam Se Hee! We're almost to your house.

492
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,560
- Let's go.
- Let's go in.

493
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,030
- Let's go.
- Hey, we are in front of your place. Come to your senses. Let's go in.

494
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,920
Hey! Hey! Come to your senses!

495
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,120
- Hey!
- Let's go. What's wrong with you?

496
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,060
Oh, Ji Ho.

497
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,190
- Ji Ho?!!
- Be quiet.

498
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,400
Oh my, Se Hee!

499
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,020
- Let's go to your house, Ji Ho.
- Yeah.

500
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,810
Hey! Hey! Come to your senses!

501
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,660
We arrived at home now. Hey, put in your pass code.

502
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,410
Put your pass code in properly.

503
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,160
Aigoo, seriously...

504
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,550
Let's go in.

505
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:08,200
Aigoo. We're here.

506
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,640
Hey! Take off your shoes!

507
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,570
Ah, leave it!

508
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:17,770
- Don't speak.
- I am a person who is capable of taking off my own shoes.

509
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,800
Aigoo, put some strength in your body!

510
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,810
Are you a squid or what?

511
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,880
Get up! Go in.

512
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,330
- I'll be getting off here, sir.
- Where's his room, Ji Ho?

513
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:30,600
- Ji Ho?!!
- Ah, just go on in!

514
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,270
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

515
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:36,390
What do you mean? This is your home. Lie down!

516
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:41,560
Please come to your senses. Go to sleep now.

517
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,690
- Aigoo, give him some blanket.
- Yes.

518
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:50,290
Aigoo, why did you drink so much?

519
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,320
Did he drink a lot?

520
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,290
He drank the entire bottle of second head liquor.

521
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,310
Second head liquor (50% alcohol by content)?

522
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,520
That liquor can get you drunk just by smelling it.

523
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:09,390
I know, right? Like some sparrow, he just kept gulping it down his throat.

524
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,230
Wow, when he drinks it like that, how can a person not—

525
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,260
Aigoo, that scared me!!

526
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,670
Are you sleeping?

527
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,670
What are you doing now?

528
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,620
Nam Se Hee? Are you okay?

529
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,890
Wow, you're really amazing.

530
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:33,960
In his complete drunk state, he still has his sanity together.

531
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,040
This is indeed an amazing and weird man. That's what I think.

532
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,660
I know, right?

533
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,470
By any chance, are you dead?

534
00:42:53,290 --> 00:43:00,090
One should drink liquor to a proper extent. Second head liquor is over 40% alcohol by content. It burns you in the throat.

535
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:06,700
Ah, yes. Thank you.

536
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,740
Honestly, Se Hee

537
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,800
was going to confess to you.

538
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,960
Yes. I know.

539
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:29,230
Ah, so you heard from my baby— I mean Soo Ji.

540
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,350
Yes.

541
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:35,750
I see, Soo Ji is your baby.

542
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:40,070
He probably was too shy to tell you.

543
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:45,550
He's someone who's never said those words with his own mouth.

544
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:50,790
It's not that he didn't say it?

545
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:59,640
Have you ever seen Se Hee getting angry?

546
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,250
Of course, I have.

547
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,270
At times, I can tell he's spitting at me with his eyes.

548
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:08,630
He really hates anything that disrupts him while he's working.

549
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,390
Then, do you know what he's afraid of?

550
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:19,580
Ah, for him, besides cats, he's scared of all animals.

551
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:28,050
Then, you must've seen him cry before.

552
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:31,750
Ah, about that...

553
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,700
Yes, honestly, I have seen that, too.

554
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,600
I'm jealous of you.

555
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,370
I've never seen that before.

556
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:43,760
Se Hee's Room #19.

557
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,140
But... Room #19?

558
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:53,220
I need to see that in order to know what I should do.

559
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,480
However, whatever is in there,

560
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,630
perhaps he himself doesn't know.

561
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:06,350
Or...

562
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:13,220
maybe he doesn't know how to open that door. If not, then

563
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:18,790
he might be afraid to let me see it.

564
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,570
I'm probably saying some weird things right now, correct?

565
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:27,330
No. I understood everything.

566
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,360
Really?

567
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,730
Of course. That "Room 19."

568
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:36,230
The fact that he named his (porn) folder, "Room 19."
(X-rated materials are called "Forbidden 19" in Korean)

569
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:39,350
That is unique and brave of him.

570
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:43,130
What? Folder?

571
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:47,690
Don't worry. So that he stops watching such videos,

572
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:50,850
I will properly scold him.

573
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,920
Ah, this is embarrassing.

574
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,780
Ah, that punk should've been careful with those things.

575
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:02,000
He's an adult already. Ah, if he keeps it on the external hard drive. No.

576
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,610
Having it on an external hard drive, it is easier to carry around, though.

577
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:07,040
That's not what I'm talking about.

578
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,460
There is no need to deny it. Ah, I'm sorry.

579
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,480
Ji Ho.

580
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,590
That's hot.

581
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:17,600
The cup of tea is pretty hot.

582
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,270
Ah seriously, that's amazing.

583
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:27,220
Ah, if your friend didn't tell me you don't like perilla seed powder, I would've never known.

584
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,500
I will make sure to use all my power to remember this.

585
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,930
Perilla. Seed. Powder.

586
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:42,730
Are you cold, Ho Rang?

587
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:45,230
Ah. No. I'm fine.

588
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:50,730
You don't seem fine. You've been curling your toes since earlier.

589
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:55,480
I turned on the butt warmer, so you should warm up soon.

590
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,760
Seok!

591
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,570
- Did you wait long?
- No, it wasn't long.

592
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:05,910
- Let's hurry up and go.
- No. Sit down first.

593
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:11,590
Let's change this and then leave.

594
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:12,930
You brought that with you?

595
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:17,130
Of course I brought it, your hands and feet are always cold.

596
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:18,730
Give it to me.

597
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:22,320
Let's hurry and wear these before your feet freeze.

598
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,290
I also brought you sneakers.

599
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:29,930
What do you think about it, Ho Rang?

600
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,160
- What?
- My car.

601
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,630
Don't you think it's best to change it to a SUV?

602
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:39,760
Once I get a bigger family, I think that would be nice.

603
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,680
Also, especially for raising babies.

604
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:52,230
Ah, I must've made you uncomfortable again.

605
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:56,150
I'm sorry. What's wrong with me today?

606
00:47:56,150 --> 00:48:01,490
I don't have a girlfriend right now because I keep going too fast. I'm sorry, Ho Rang.

607
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:26,630
When I saw her, I was so surprised. There was nothing about her that I didn't like.

608
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:29,740
She's positive, meticulous, and easy going.

609
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,900
Rang. What's wrong?

610
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,800
Are you crying?

611
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,360
No. Did I do something wrong?

612
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,690
You turned away first.

613
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,500
What do you mean?

614
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:04,430
When I was leaving just now and waving goodbye,

615
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:07,820
you didn't even turn back and just left.

616
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,130
You can't do that even when you're dating?

617
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:13,940
It's not that you can't,

618
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,730
it just makes me sad.

619
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:21,020
I don't want to be like this either, but the more I start to like you,

620
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:24,290
I don't know why there are more things that make me sad.

621
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:28,200
I got it. I'm really sorry. I won't do it again.

622
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,720
So, don't cry anymore, Rang. You'll catch a cold.

623
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,460
Tears, stop flowing.

624
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:41,230
Easy going, my ass. Do you know how easy it is to make her mad?

625
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,720
Ah, this punk should've been more careful.

626
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,580
Why does he like watching those types of movies so much?

627
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:55,740
What is my baby doing?

628
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:57,830
What is it again?

629
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:02,870
What message is the most natural to send at this time, Hyung?

630
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:07,670
Asleep? Are you asleep? Are you sleeping?

631
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:12,100
"Are you sleeping?" What the heck is this?

632
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,130
Ah, this punk still has a lot of learn from me.

633
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:19,600
What's wrong with that guy and this guy?

634
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,790
Maybe the property where the company is isn't good (lucky)?

635
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:25,340
Hey, I need to something about it.

636
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:29,100
Don't do it. Just sleep.

637
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,170
Are you sleeping?

638
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,200
He read it.

639
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:59,830
He read it. What should I do?

640
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:02,830
I shouldn't have sent it at all.

641
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,030
Won Seok

642
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,770
Hello?

643
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:23,990
Yeah, it's me.

644
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:28,450
Yeah. I didn't wake you up, right?

645
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:31,100
Since this is around the time you go to bed.

646
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,410
No, I haven't gone to bed yet.

647
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:37,900
I see. It's a relief.

648
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:44,100
Is it manageable to stay with Soo Ji? She tends to grind her teeth a lot in her sleep.

649
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:49,340
She wears a mouthpiece, so it's alright.

650
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,630
That person seemed like a good guy.

651
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:00,880
Umm.

652
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,700
It seems that way.

653
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,880
I'm still getting to know him.

654
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,170
The same with my heart.

655
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,890
Like you said,

656
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:20,720
it's possible that there are some things in my heart that I wasn't aware of.

657
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,080
Yeah, you did well. That's possible.

658
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,730
That person of yours seems very cool too.

659
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,870
And honest.

660
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,880
Yeah it seems so.

661
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,800
Seok.

662
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:40,930
Hmm?

663
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:44,450
I've given it some thought

664
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,260
and my entire twenties,

665
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:53,550
a quarter of my life was spent with you.

666
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,710
I'm sorry,

667
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:00,490
that I couldn't take responsibility for those times we spent together.

668
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:05,350
No that's not what I'm saying.

669
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:08,590
I didn't say that to get an apology.

670
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,120
What I'm saying is...

671
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:16,730
It's...

672
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:20,660
That is was fortunate.

673
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,770
The best times of my life

674
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:31,230
were spent with you.

675
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:37,150
So,

676
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:42,580
if you're having a tough time and need some help, call me.

677
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,760
We were lovers but

678
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,950
we've also been friends for a long time.

679
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,400
I called you too late.

680
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,250
You must be tired. Go to sleep. I'll hang up now.

681
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:02,700
Ho Rang.

682
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,490
Yeah?

683
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:08,860
Be happy.

684
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,120
You must!

685
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,870
Okay?

686
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:20,400
It was a beautiful heart.

687
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:40,350
Soo Ji.

688
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:42,080
You really don't know

689
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,250
your mom's heart, you rascal.

690
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,890
You have to happy

691
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,670
so that I can be happy too.

692
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:05,060
My daughter who has the kindest heart in the world.

693
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:15,580
Now, go fly up and up.

694
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,450
Fly for Mom's share too.

695
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:32,860
In the end, it was all to wish for your happiness.

696
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,280
Those beautiful hearts.

697
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,290
Ho Rang I am sorry about today.

698
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,720
I'll come closer to you more slowly.

699
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,480
Good night.

700
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:56,490
The hearts that have passed too.

701
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:58,860
The new hearts too.

702
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,710
Someone's clumsy heart too.

703
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:09,710
And also, this aching heart as well.

704
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,110
In the end, it's all

705
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:23,700
hearts that wish for you to be happy.

706
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:36,290
Those beautiful hearts. All of them.

707
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:44,380
Could they be all safeguarded as they are, by me?

708
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:51,560
♫ Please just stay as is quietly ♫

709
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:56,160
♫ As though we are together by coincidence ♫

710
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,080
Yes, Mom. What happened, at this late night?

711
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,810
Really?

712
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:40,500
Please don't drink cold water.

713
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:45,020
The soup in the pot. Warm it first.

714
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,730
Go Jeong Min

715
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,120
Hello?

716
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:29,260
Did you guys fight?

717
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:31,280
You fought?

718
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:35,460
Se Hee did something wrong?

719
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,390
No.

720
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:39,890
It's not like that.

721
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:43,960
Yes, it's due to personality differences, right?

722
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:51,250
Se Hee is very taciturn, right? And hard to read.

723
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,120
Right?

724
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,620
So it's very upsetting, right?

725
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,210
Yes.

726
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:59,830
It's true.

727
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:06,030
There are times when I don't know what he's thinking.

728
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:08,360
Yes, it would be so.

729
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,000
Husbands are all like that.

730
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,630
Even when they are old, they are kids.

731
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:20,460
So the women need to coax them and pacify them, or else it's tough.

732
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:23,470
No.

733
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,460
Not that.

734
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,030
Huh?

735
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:34,860
Marriage is between an adult and another adult.

736
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:38,860
Se Hee is already a very accomplished adult.

737
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,870
Just that . . .

738
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:46,200
He's an adult with rather a lot of wounds.

739
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:52,670
Father-in-law said something similar to what you said too.

740
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:58,820
He said it's important for the wife to play the middle role well.

741
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:02,790
I had thought so at first as well.

742
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:09,920
Since Se Hee was my landlord,

743
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:14,080
the reason for me to live in that house

744
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:18,430
included me carrying out some tasks.

745
01:00:18,430 --> 01:00:21,760
So I had thought it was right to do so.

746
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,560
But...

747
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:31,020
As my love grew deeper, my disarray became bigger.

748
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:36,190
How much longer could I continue with this disarray?

749
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:39,290
Distribute labor with labor.

750
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:46,480
Pay back memorial ceremony with kimchi making.

751
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,050
Whether making up for this disarray is the right thing.

752
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:53,750
What are you talking about?

753
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,320
Kimchi making?

754
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:00,670
Can't be. Se Hee went to make kimchi?

755
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:02,520
Mother-in-law.

756
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:11,660
I do not wish to live a married life coaxing and pacifying Se Hee.

757
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:17,620
I do not wish to play the middle role for you and Father-in-law.

758
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:26,670
For Se Hee's wounds that haven't healed, I do not wish to remain in the role of a cushion.

759
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:36,120
You've given Se Hee wounds once.

760
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:41,180
You too. Father too.

761
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:45,830
How long ago was that though?

762
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:52,200
No matter how long ago it was, it happened.

763
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,740
And there are people who got hurt by it.

764
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,210
And also,

765
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:04,220
Iit is something that can happen again through a different method as well.

766
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,080
Today...

767
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:13,220
We should've had a meal together instead, maybe.

768
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:18,510
You and I never once ate a meal together alone, it seems,

769
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:22,690
other than during the memorial ceremony and the formal meeting of the families.

770
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:25,790
Hey. You're seriously . . .

771
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:31,670
I mean, I know kids these days do as they please.

772
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:35,020
But how can you guys just quit a marriage like that, to your liking?

773
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,830
Marriage isn't a joke.

774
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:40,490
Marriage is something sacred.

775
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,190
I'm very sorry, Mother-in-law.

776
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:48,960
But as for me,

777
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,790
I do not regard marriage as something sacred.

778
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:56,650
It's love

779
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:58,910
that is sacred.

780
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,690
I'm sorry.

781
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,670
You should know,

782
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,840
I thought.

783
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:03,350
So she knew everything already?

784
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,800
Yeah.

785
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:14,090
The two of had rice liquor together and that's what happened.

786
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:16,660
I see.

787
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:21,460
So she knew about everything.

788
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,450
The two of you are close, it seems.

789
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:35,100
A bit, it seems.

790
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:39,640
A bit strange, is it?

791
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,930
The two of us being close?

792
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:46,740
Well, it doesn't seem ordinary.

793
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:49,300
Yeah.

794
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:52,110
I thought so too at first.

795
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:54,510
But Writer said this.

796
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:58,000
Why can't we, exactly?

797
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:03,460
But then it seems like she's messing with me too somehow.

798
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:08,720
She's a bit of a psycho, Writer-nim is.

799
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:14,660
In a good way.

800
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:21,340
She has that unexpected side to her, Ji Ho.

801
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:30,190
Se Hee.

802
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:37,290
That my words would go into your heart

803
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:41,020
and remain in there like a last will and testament, I had no idea.

804
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,740
I'm sorry.

805
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:53,930
That time, I was having a hard time with my feelings alone—

806
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:58,180
You don't have to say it.

807
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:02,940
It was no one's fault.

808
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:04,710
That time...

809
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,840
It just happened that way.

810
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:21,120
Be happy.

811
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:30,090
Be happy, Se Hee.

812
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:10,130
What about your family?

813
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:12,180
I should go and see them.

814
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:14,940
I already told them yesterday.

815
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:19,010
My mom and dad came up to Seoul, briefly, yesterday.

816
01:07:19,970 --> 01:07:25,080
So they came up here, Mother and Father.

817
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:29,940
If you'd told me, I would have gone with you.

818
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:33,260
No, it's okay.

819
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:35,860
I told them well.

820
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:42,380
Did you get your own place?

821
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:52,760
First, I will go traveling.

822
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,490
I have never traveled alone,

823
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:58,880
I realized.

824
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,030
That's right.

825
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:03,270
You were very busy.

826
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:09,420
I am very happy for you,

827
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,260
that you have found the road that you were looking for.

828
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:16,800
Is that so?

829
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,270
Yes.

830
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,340
You found what you wanted to do,

831
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:25,240
and you are able to do the things you weren't able to, before.

832
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:31,250
Because you have found the road that makes you happy,

833
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:33,060
so I am happy for you.

834
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:36,900
Then what about you?

835
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,530
Yes?

836
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:41,640
Se Hee,

837
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:44,930
how will you live now?

838
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:49,570
Well, do you have any plans?

839
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:55,500
For me, it will be the same.

840
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:59,120
Going to work, getting off work, watching soccer

841
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,130
and being with kitty, just like that.

842
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:06,810
Just like you were, peacefully.

843
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:08,350
Yes.

844
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:15,080
Are you going to get a new tenant?

845
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:18,750
Well...

846
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:24,030
Perhaps.

847
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:33,630
Then, should we destroy this?

848
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:37,190
Contracts are usually destroyed to avoid leaving any loose ends.

849
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:40,420
Yes, if you want to.

850
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,480
Yes.

851
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:50,740
♫ Those dreams that filled this room ♫

852
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:54,930
♫ Have lost their meaning, one sheet at a time ♫

853
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:57,690
Our contract,

854
01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:00,470
it's really come to an end, like this.

855
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:04,220
Do you have

856
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:13,630
anything more to say?

857
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:20,720
That I have a gift that I bought for you,

858
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,970
I wanted to say that.

859
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:33,530
The soccer matches that you and I should watch together,

860
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:37,080
that there were so many left, still.

861
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,840
That is what I wanted to say.

862
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:43,900
However...

863
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:49,830
No.

864
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:57,540
♫ and hope again that tomorrow will be different ♫

865
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:01,430
♫ I can't walk even one step ♫

866
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:07,680
♫ For a brief moment, I imagine a day that is fine ♫

867
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:14,570
I bought it as I was passing by. You said you wanted to read this book, right? 
♫ That day that is like a movie ♫

868
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:17,810
If I say these words now...

869
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:20,270
Those words, too...

870
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:23,050
they will go into her heart

871
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,830
and like a heavy last will and testament

872
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:29,950
they will probably remain.

873
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:35,480
I will be going.

874
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,470
Don't see me out.

875
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:39,760
Yes.

876
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:49,460
When you watch a soccer match

877
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:53,150
have you ever been curious about this?

878
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,760
During the intermission in the halftime,

879
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,610
what do the players do?

880
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:07,300
They evaluate their performance in the first half or plan their play in the last half,

881
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:12,030
or perhaps eat some bananas, I imagine.

882
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:13,440
Hmm.

883
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,510
If you think about it, there is a lot they could be doing.

884
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:19,660
Yes.

885
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:21,450
It seems so.

886
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,700
Yes, indeed.

887
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:28,400
Should we shake hands?

888
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:38,800
I wish you the best.

889
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:42,710
For the both of us...

890
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:46,570
Because it's our first time getting divorced.

891
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,820
Yes.

892
01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:00,780
I wish you the best.

893
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,670
You too.

894
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,820
Again,

895
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:41,400
I am

896
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,300
alone.

897
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:08,300
To the middle, a shot

898
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,270
It went off to the side.

899
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:13,210
Now, Sanchez. Sanchez!

900
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:17,790
Yes, good! So good!

901
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,540
Sanchez.

902
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:26,740
Cahill made a big mistake here.

903
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:30,530
It seems Sanchez was ready. Here is the replay.

904
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:35,650
Cahill wasn't prepared for this pass.

905
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:38,900
On the other hand, Sanchez had a clear view and was able to speed up.

906
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:52,930
Kitty.

907
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:56,390
Kitty.

908
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,760
Kitty?

909
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:51,600
Where did you go?

910
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:01,050
Woori

911
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:06,190
I named her. It's Woori.

912
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:12,080
Aside from ramyeon, this is the first meal.

913
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,820
Us, together.

914
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:21,450
I also think loving once is enough

915
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:22,920
in life.

916
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:26,260
Even if it's a sea that you've seen in the past,

917
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:30,410
today, this sea is the first

918
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:34,570
just like our marriage.

919
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:38,990
Like the kiss at the bus stop.

920
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:49,330
Can I kiss you?

921
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:53,420
Yes.

922
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:14,600
♫ Just like today, I endure another day ♫

923
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:21,750
♫ But a another day keeps coming, so I continue to live ♫

924
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:26,060
♫ And repeat more foolish things ♫

925
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:29,870
♫ And I stand alone again on one side ♫

926
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:32,280
♫ and hope again that tomorrow will be different ♫

927
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:37,270
What should I do?

928
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,500
I miss her.

929
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:01,460
I miss her.

930
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:04,300
♫ but a another day keeps coming, so I continue to live ♫

931
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:07,340
Today, I...

932
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:10,240
lost what could have been

933
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:14,980
my only love.

934
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:23,640
♫ And hoping again that tomorrow will be different ♫

935
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:29,780
♫ I can't move one step away  ♫
