00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,080
Because This Is My First Life

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,070
Lee Min Ki

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,640
Jeong So Min

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,110
Lee Som
Park Byeong Eun

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,640
Kim Ga Eun
Kim Min Seok

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,980
Because This Is My First Life

7
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,810
Hello.

8
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,900
Hi.

9
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,320
I'm Yang Ho Rang. We were in the same class in middle school. In second year.

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,140
Yeah. I know.

11
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,120
Actually, I wanted to be in the same class as you.

12
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,270
You got the highest scores in our whole grade.

13
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,900
Starting today I'll be your desk partner. Help me out so I can get my grades up, so I could be admitted to a university in Seoul, okay?

14
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,500
But, how come

15
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,650
you speak in Seoul dialect?

16
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,030
What?

17
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,370
I transferred here from Seoul. You didn't know?

18
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,560
I know, but didn't you come when you were in kindergarten?

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,680
Hey, teacher! Teacher's here.

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,760
Look here, you girls, let's get our wits together here.

21
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,360
You guys are 18 now, okay? Juniors!

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,910
And as you can see, we've got a transfer student. Woo Soo Ji.

23
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,130
She just transferred today from Jinju. Say hi.

24
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,910
That's the end?

25
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,750
Yes.

26
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,130
Go and sit in that empty seat.

27
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,710
What the heck? Is she a volleyball player?

28
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,260
Make sure to get your parent's signature on your report cards.

29
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,910
Oh no!

30
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,770
Ji Ho, you are first in our grade again, of course?

31
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,670
2 out of 147

32
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,590
You're second?

33
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,070
If you're second, then who's first?

34
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,270
Wow, she's ranked first.

35
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,040
What? Is this true?

36
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,830
- Soo Ji, teach us how to study.
- Me, too.

37
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,880
- Teach me, too.
- Get in line, I asked her first.

38
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,960
Why get in line? Let's all do it together.

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,680
Wow, that volleyball is ranked first in our grade?

40
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,700
She only looks like she'd be good in volleyball. How can she be first in our grade?

41
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,960
Looks like she always ranked first back in Jinju, too.

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,470
Hey, do you know why Volleyball transferred here to Namhae?

43
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,140
I don't know. Why?

44
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:36,190
Her mom ran a fancy restaurant in Jinju, but with a married man...

45
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,580
I hear that she doesn't even have a dad.

46
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,500
Or she has one, but she doesn't know who he is, some people say.

47
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,300
Don't say such things to anyone, okay?

48
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,680
Of course not. Why would I?

49
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,570
Aish, look at these stars.

50
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,790
So many, like a pack of dogs.

51
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,580
This place sucks. Out in the boonies.

52
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,310
What's your problem?

53
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,710
Do you want to die?

54
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,750
No, why would I?

55
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,010
What's wrong?

56
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,900
I heard that you said my mom had a fancy restaurant?

57
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,450
That's just what I heard.

58
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,280
Oh, really?

59
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,310
So saying my mom had an affair with a married man and ran away here? You just heard that, too?

60
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,280
Let's go. Let's see who wins.

61
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,030
Let go of her and talk.

62
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,150
Jinju, let me go!

63
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,410
Hey, let go!

64
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,560
I was boasting so much that the first and second ranked students were both in my class.

65
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,710
This is so embarrassing. Come to your senses already.

66
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,610
Oh, what happened, Ji Ho?

67
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,950
Hey, you're the one who picked the fight, huh?

68
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,990
Look at this mess. Aigoo!

69
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,600
Can't you do better?

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,700
Hey, aiyoo.

71
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,920
Why were they only hitting me? Why only me?!?

72
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,800
So I don't study well. Does that mean I'm not human?

73
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,520
What's so great about you two?

74
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,270
You guys look like stuffed pancakes!

75
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,810
You ugly girls!

76
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,530
Ho Rang, don't cry.

77
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,280
What's with that?

78
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,720
You're great at the local dialect.

79
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,630
If you think it's so unfair, then do better studying.

80
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,660
If I could be good at studying just by wanting to do it,

81
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,600
then I would be already good at it!

82
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,850
What is she saying?

83
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,410
Stop acting like you're so great! It's obnoxious!

84
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,610
Yang Ho Rang, I heard you came to my house?

85
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,070
What is this pathetic thing?

86
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,500
Huh?

87
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,730
Thanks for the apples. (apple = sa-gwa, is an homonym for apology)

88
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,110
The ones I circled in red, solve those problems three times.

89
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,290
Those will be in the mid term exams.

90
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,460
By the way, stop using Seoul dialect in front of me.

91
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,230
It's obnoxious.

92
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,210
You're ridiculous, really.

93
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,240
And just like that, we became friends.

94
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,020
Look at this. I got a 70 on the math test.

95
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,010
How's that?

96
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,830
- Is that right? Your scores went up by a lot.
- You did well.

97
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,490
You only got three problems wrong.

98
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,900
♫ I smile quietly ♫

99
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,300
♫ So no one knows, no one at all ♫

100
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,060
Woo Soo and Ji Ho
♫ I draw so many stars ♫

101
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,090
♫ So no one knows, no one at all ♫

102
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,120
I will get you girls this time! How dare you?

103
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,330
- Oh, I got one. I hooked one!
- What is it?

104
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,950
- I got one!
- What is it?

105
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,950
Wow, it's huge! A Black Porgy!

106
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,080
Wow!

107
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,240
I'm going to be president of my own company.

108
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,870
You study so well, why would you become a merchant?

109
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,220
Become a professor, or go work at a huge conglomerate and become a career woman.

110
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,930
Hey, I could do that for 100 years, but I'd still be nothing but a wage-worker.

111
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,300
We only live once. Why spend it working under someone else?

112
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,260
I want plenty of money, to my heart's content.

113
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,990
Of course, with that personality, how could you work for anyone else?

114
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:11,470
I want to marry a self-made rich man and become a homemaker.

115
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,370
A self-made rich man?

116
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,950
Why? Why not just marry a rich man?

117
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:22,250
No way. If he inherits the wealth, I will have to be a slave to my in-laws. It's part of the price.

118
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,900
But if a man is a self-made success, then it all becomes ours.

119
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,090
Then among us, there will be a madam with a "-sa?"

120
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:32,240
Doctor or lawyer's wife? (eui-SA = doctor, byeon-ho-SA = lawyer)

121
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,050
These days, the trend is engineering. An engineering major turned venture capitalist.

122
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,320
That is the perfect self-made rich man I'm dreaming of.

123
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,480
What about you, Ji Ho?

124
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,610
It's obvious. Becoming a writer, right?

125
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,750
No.

126
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,080
Then, what is it?

127
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:58,300
It's true that I want to become a writer because I like to write, but

128
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,260
that isn't my dream.

129
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,430
My dream

130
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,920
- is love.
- Love?

131
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,730
What kind of dream is love?

132
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,550
Min Kook who lives next door to you, he likes you. Go date him.

133
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,500
No, he's ugly. Date Seung Won instead.

134
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,010
No, I don't mean that sort of thing.

135
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,160
That once-in-a-lifetime love.

136
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:30,050
Meeting a man who is my fate,

137
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,690
that is my dream.

138
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,470
I have someone I like.

139
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,630
What are you saying?

140
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,930
What? Who?

141
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,530
My husband.

142
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,160
Hey, are you joking around?

143
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,790
What's with you, Ji Ho? Are you rubbing it in?

144
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,440
Then, I'm going to confess my love for Won Seok here.

145
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,950
You guys... Just sleep!

146
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:04,510
♫ please be a shelter for my tired soul ♫

147
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,990
Actually what marriage really is,

148
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,300
I'm still not sure.

149
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,830
But liking someone...

150
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,490
♫ all you have to do is to give it a quick glance as you pass by ♫

151
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,850
♫ all you have to do is to give it a quick glance as you pass by ♫

152
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,600
♫ in the midst of the morning fog, it stopped ♫

153
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,330
Love, if you have just one in life,

154
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,500
it is plenty.

155
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,870
That one comment of his circled all around my heart.

156
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:44,720
♫ The little petal that is blossoming again ♫

157
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,940
♫ Shall we go looking for the morning sun? ♫

158
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,900
Even the back of his head

159
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,930
looks dashing to me.

160
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,590
Oh, you're up.

161
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,620
Yes.

162
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,990
Is Kitty better?

163
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:16,190
Yes. I think it's like the clinic said, just temporary.

164
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,570
What?

165
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,210
Is something on my face?

166
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:33,240
Yes. Handsomeness.

167
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,130
Is something on the window?

168
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,590
Maybe I need to do some cleaning.

169
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,570
♫ Even if you don't want love ♫

170
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,740
To be able to see the person you like every day.

171
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,880
Marriage is something

172
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,520
that is so nice.

173
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,940
♫ it makes me want to be in love ♫

174
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,840
So you guys were home.

175
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,800
Mother!

176
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,470
Episode 10
- Because It's My First Time In "Sea" (In-Law's) World

177
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,610
This is pickled deodeok roots, and this is braised mackerel.

178
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,220
He really loves braised fish.

179
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,640
I see.

180
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,440
What brings you here without even calling first.

181
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,560
It's my son's home. Why would I call first?

182
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,780
I came because I thought you guys would be home for sure since it's the weekend.

183
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,200
Let's put these in the fridge.

184
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,620
Oh, yes.

185
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,700
Let me do it.

186
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,850
It's alright. Like you know anything about kitchen stuff.

187
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,620
Homemaking is done by the experts.

188
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,200
Right, Ji Ho?

189
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,700
Yes.

190
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,150
- This.
- Yes, give to me, please.

191
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,090
You remember Vice Principal Hwang, right? He sent a box of apples.

192
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,090
I tried them with your father-in-law and they're so delicious.

193
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:28,790
Yes.

194
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,490
Does our daughter-in-law like apples too?

195
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,110
Yes, I like them.

196
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,520
Well, actually, I'm not picky about any food.

197
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,300
That's great.

198
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,630
Let me take it, plea--

199
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,430
Give to me. I'll do it.

200
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,830
I hear our Ji Ho works at a cafe?

201
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,280
Yes. I thought I should do some work.

202
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,560
In case it's hard for Oppa to have to do all the work?

203
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,840
Oh, you're so lovely.

204
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,670
Where did he find such a nice girl to bring home?

205
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,950
You know tomorrow's the memorial, right?

206
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,960
- If you get off work early--
- I don't get off early.

207
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,420
And did I ever go to the memorial before? Why suddenly--

208
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,510
Alright. I know you're busy.

209
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:28,800
I mean, if you have time, try to come, that's all I'm saying.

210
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,970
Let me have that.

211
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,060
Like you're really going to peel an apple.

212
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,620
This is also for people who have experience doing it.

213
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,620
Right?

214
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,150
Yes.

215
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,680
Please give it to me. I'll do it.

216
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,800
Will you?

217
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:55,330
Ji Ho, we're here already. When are you coming?

218
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,860
You said you had an appointment, right? With your friends.

219
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,310
Oh.

220
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,700
Yes.

221
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,450
Go on. Hurry before you're late.

222
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,400
Is that right? You should hurry and go.

223
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,120
Then.

224
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,930
I'll peel it, I suppose.

225
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,080
So so sorry.

226
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,790
- You're here.
- You waited a long time, huh?

227
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,340
Nope. It's fine.

228
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,280
My mother-in-law came over suddenly.

229
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,590
It's alright, I said.

230
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,760
Oh, why do I have this sudden headache?

231
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,370
Your head hurts? Suddenly, why?

232
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,660
What's the ring for?

233
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,850
Won Seok gave it to you?

234
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,090
Getting married?

235
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,570
Yes, Ji Ho! I'm getting married!

236
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,510
Ah! I'm getting married.

237
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:10,290
- What do we do?
- Ji Ho, I'm getting married.

238
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,740
You're not going to make a trip home?

239
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,410
We'll see.

240
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:27,400
Your father says he will pay off your mortgage.

241
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,320
No, thanks.

242
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,370
How long are you going to keep that up with your father?

243
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:39,060
You're married now too, and it's time you bury it and forget it.

244
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,400
Bury it and forget it?

245
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,030
About what? Bury what and forget what?

246
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,720
And what's this marriage got to do with Father?

247
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,340
Se Hee. Your father's very sorry too.

248
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,530
Your father's getting old too now.

249
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,820
Please go. I have things to do.

250
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,940
And please don't come like this again without calling first.

251
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,840
It's not proper courtesy to the person I live with.

252
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,660
And go home in a cab.

253
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,010
A person he lives with?

254
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,390
He's talking about his wife like she's some tenant.

255
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,760
So, I said, "Where the heck is dirt on my nails?"

256
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,020
I looked at my hand and instead of dirt, I see this! Ta-da!

257
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,690
Wow, I guess you grind Won Seok (raw stone) enough, you can turn it into a jewel too.

258
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,890
I guess you finally got rewarded for the work you put in for seven years, Yang Ho Rang.

259
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:45,520
Yeah, even seven years ago, Won Seok would buy her a flashlight if she said the road home was scary at night.

260
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,460
What did I say? I would make my Won Seok a 'Mark Jukebox.' (Mark Zuckerberg)

261
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,440
He's working at Brother-in-law's company now so all that's left is all the good things to come.

262
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,100
Hey, it's not Mark Jukebox. It's Mark--

263
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,680
But what do you mean your mother-in-law came suddenly? Why?

264
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,690
She came to drop off food.

265
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,500
To the newlywed's home on a weekend morning?

266
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,440
Huh? Yeah.

267
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,280
Hey, it's not like she pressed the security code and went, 'surprise,' right?

268
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Can't be.

269
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,360
Ji Ho, now your life in the "sea" (in-law's) world is starting, too?

270
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,700
She just came to the home once.

271
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,390
Yeah, from the mother-in-law's perspective, it could be a given.

272
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,780
It's the home her son bought so of course she's got the right to come and go, too.

273
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,690
Hey! Why does she have any right to the home her son bought?

274
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,780
Once he's an adult and on his own, he's independent.

275
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,200
If there's any right to speak of, that should belong to the partner that the son himself chooses.

276
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,860
Yeah, that's right.

277
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,060
But that's true for 'Tom' or 'James,' Unni, and we're not in America.

278
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:54,160
To a Korean mother, a home paid for all with her son's money, would she think Ji Ho has any rights?

279
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,790
It's not like Ji Ho pays rent to live there.

280
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,930
Right? If the wife paid rent, then I guess she couldn't barge in.

281
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,550
Rent?

282
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,780
Hey, you are too much.

283
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,580
And that mother-in-law. She's not someone so scary.

284
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,720
She's nice to me too.

285
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,870
So I am nice to her too and I want to look favorable to her too.

286
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:25,320
We've got another newbie daughter-in-law about to get the disease here.

287
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,360
- What disease?
- 'Good daughter-in-law' disease.

288
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,050
Was it because of this?

289
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,620
Just trim like your usual style?

290
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,490
Yes.

291
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,260
But do I look strange somewhere?

292
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,350
Where?

293
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,810
Nope. You look the same.

294
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,690
This discount coupon. Can it still be used?

295
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,190
Yes.

296
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,430
'Good daughter-in-law' disease?

297
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,680
The disease that newbie daughter-in-laws tend to get easily after they are married.

298
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,120
The disease that gets them to overwork for the sake of looking like a good and well-mannered daughter-in-law.

299
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,900
But I get it.

300
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,860
A bride would want to look lovable to the husband and to his family.

301
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,180
Lots of people get that disease after they get married. That good daughter-in-law disease.

302
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:52,160
Do I have early onset 'good daughter-in-law' disease? How come I just can't say no to my in-laws?

303
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,930
That's not it.

304
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,830
Why can't she say no? I would just...

305
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:14,170
It's that man, who I can't say no to.

306
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:25,720
♫ So in love. I feel like I am not myself ♫

307
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,850
♫ When we are together ♫

308
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,200
You changed your hairstyle.

309
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,540
Oh, yes.

310
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,140
It was bothering me for this and that reason.

311
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,330
Does it look strange?

312
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,470
No, I like it.

313
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,220
Your hair.

314
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,910
I like your hairstyle.

315
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,180
Yes.

316
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:05,020
♫ I'm in love in love in love with you. Every day.  ♫

317
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,940
Your mother left safely?

318
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,360
Yes.

319
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,480
I'm really sorry about my mother.

320
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,640
I already told her firmly, many times.

321
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,680
It's alright. It's just a parent coming to her child's home.

322
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,800
No. That's still not okay. Suddenly, like that.

323
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,910
I think it's best I change the security code.

324
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,720
You don't have to go that far.

325
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,790
If it's because of me, I'm okay.

326
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:36,670
I'm the one who's not okay.

327
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,730
Oh, okay.

328
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,170
It's complete.

329
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,610
Just know that I am taking it easy on you because your fake husband was dashing. To think I'd fall for those words!

330
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,720
You got yourself a good landlord, Noona.

331
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,290
What words?

332
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,310
I asked him when he came to settle the side mirror cost, why he married you.

333
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,790
And? What did he say?

334
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:10,300
What else? He said to get monthly rent.

335
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,170
And he said he respected you.

336
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,020
He said what?

337
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,940
He said he respected you as a defender.

338
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,620
I'm what...?

339
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,410
Respects me as a defender?

340
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,730
It gets deflected by the defense and the ball is kicked off.

341
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,460
That was a great chance for Arsenal.

342
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,680
Respect me as a defender?

343
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,920
What does that mean?

344
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,380
Is it a re-broadcast?

345
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,260
Yes. I think so.

346
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:21,220
It's on the left. Rose is going in. Koscielny on the low.

347
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,970
Arsenal deflects.

348
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:27,410
Arsenal's iron wall is Koscielny indeed, right?

349
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,910
Yes. He's an excellent defender.

350
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:38,770
Then, since it's the weekend, I'll make a trip to the market.

351
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,000
I'll come too.

352
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,390
I need to get some groceries too.

353
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,500
Yes. Sure.

354
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:57,920
I am curious about something.

355
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,010
I heard from Bok Nam

356
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:06,980
that you respected me as a defender, he said.

357
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,580
Oh. Yes.

358
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,240
He asked me why I married you.

359
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,520
What does that mean? May I ask you that?

360
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,040
Well, just as the words mean.

361
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,350
You were the first tenant I respected.

362
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,860
You never missed recycling day, even once.

363
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,000
And of course, you never missed giving Kitty food.

364
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,220
And more than anything, no matter the circumstance,

365
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,490
you are someone who knows how to play proper defense.

366
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,290
Shall I flip this over then?!

367
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,730
Oppa.

368
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,330
I love him.

369
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,840
So that was the meaning of me as a defender?

370
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,330
Since marriage isn't an issue for just two people.

371
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:11,620
It's a system where the surrounding interests are more important than the feelings of the two.

372
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:16,110
Even this morning, you defended my mother perfectly.

373
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,780
So we were able to get through it well, I think.

374
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,510
I am getting a lot of benefits, due to you.

375
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,740
I am grateful.

376
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:31,690
I need to go buy Kitty's snacks.

377
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,210
Yes. I need to buy rice.

378
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,750
Yes.

379
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,830
Ji Ho, do you know what Brother-in-law's nickname at work is?

380
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,400
Nope. What is it?

381
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,860
Mortgage-Left, Kitty-Right. Since Brother-in-law's left brain is filled only with the loan, and his right brain is filled only with his cat.

382
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,310
Really?

383
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,550
Hey, is this something to laugh about?

384
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,100
Then where are you?

385
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:05,830
I mean, if he's only got the loan on his left brain and the cat in his right brain, where in his brain are you?

386
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,900
Well I guess--

387
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,350
Oh. His heart?

388
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,490
Thank you.

389
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,830
I know that it cannot be.

390
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:31,910
That in that man's heart

391
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,290
I am not there. I know that.

392
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,780
Oh, I didn't enter my rewards card information.

393
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,460
Yes, I'll help you enter it.

394
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,080
I am just

395
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,730
a stable tenant that guarantees a monthly income.

396
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:59,120
I am just

397
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,070
an excellent defender who can maintain his anti-marriage.

398
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,810
In this man's heart,

399
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,420
what exists there?

400
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:29,200
Um. Se Hee.

401
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,070
Do you have a dream?

402
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,650
What?

403
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,660
I mean, like a goal in life?

404
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,780
Goal?

405
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,540
I...

406
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:56,120
I just want nothing to happen in my life.

407
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,550
What?

408
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,240
Nothing?

409
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,730
Yes.

410
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:07,130
I would like every day to be the same, just like this.

411
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,540
Go to work and pay back the loan.

412
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,840
Get off work and watch soccer while drinking beer and fall sleep.

413
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,540
That's your dream?

414
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,020
Yes.

415
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,270
Living like that and dying in my home is my goal.

416
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,800
Dream...

417
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,450
I suppose that is my dream.

418
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:44,800
A road into that man's heart.

419
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,440
Does it actually exist?

420
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:03,480
Why the tie, too? It's casual attire there. I don't need to dress like this.

421
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,430
Still. It's your first day at work so you should do this much. Don't you know the first impression is everything?

422
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:11,200
Now, it's done.

423
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,960
But you know, Sang Won quit being my facebook friend.

424
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,650
Oh, he did?

425
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:21,390
By chance, did the Wake Alarm app not end on good terms?

426
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,950
No, it was settled nicely.

427
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,820
Really?

428
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,730
Of course. Sang Won and the boys even told me congrats, for getting the job.

429
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,420
Really?

430
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:36,330
With our Seok dressed like this, he really looks like Mark Jukebox.

431
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,460
Rang.

432
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,510
Are you happy?

433
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:43,430
Yeah, very very happy.

434
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,870
That's all that matters then, if you're happy.

435
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,230
- I'm going to work.
- Bye. Have a good day at work.

436
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,530
I need you do that for me. The peck.

437
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,710
- Bye.
- Bye.

438
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,250
So I don't need to sell the company?

439
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,560
So we're dating now?

440
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,080
Sure, let's do it.

441
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,480
If you keep a few conditions.

442
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,720
Conditions?

443
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,140
Dating Contract

444
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,660
What is this?

445
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,030
Keep our relationship a secret.

446
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:47,480
This. Is this sane?

447
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,170
What is this, really?

448
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,390
What else? A contract

449
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,060
for our dating.

450
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,860
We're going to make a contract? On what?

451
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,140
Our dating?

452
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,740
Okay. I've got the diagnosis.

453
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:08,030
So my Soo Ji has watched too many dramas, that's why. What this contract dating is, you see,

454
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:13,190
this is something done by those next generation chaebeols with nothing else to do or those Hallyu stars.

455
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,520
Why would we do contract dating when we are just regular salary-earners?

456
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,400
It's because it's us. That's why we need a contract all the more.

457
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,660
People like us, who don't have a lot of time

458
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:25,640
from working so hard, shouldn't we use our time and energy resourcefully?

459
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,120
That's right, that is correct. However,

460
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,910
dating is not some kind of business to write a contract about.

461
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,900
So? You don't want to?

462
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,430
What? Who said I didn't want to?

463
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,610
Right, then look. First,

464
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,140
we only meet outside our homes, be it weekends or weekdays.
- I'm okay with that.

465
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,430
I also like going out. And in order to get some vitamin D, sunlight is the best thing.

466
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,920
Second, we should never ask about each other's personal lives.

467
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,800
Personal lives? How could we not ask?

468
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,120
Us dating is personal life in itself.

469
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,970
Well... Just because we are dating, sharing trivial information and being nosy,

470
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,630
I think it's a a form of violence.

471
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,750
Don't you think so?

472
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,890
Just... If you don't want to date me then say so!

473
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:19,260
Why do you keep on beating around the bush? Darn it. Aigoo.

474
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:24,900
No... I like you, CEO Ma. I want to date you.

475
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,240
That's why I'm talking about this.

476
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,390
My usual rule is to not sleep with guys I work with.

477
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:35,570
So to even consider dating you, it is a big deal for me.

478
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,590
Oh, is that so?

479
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:43,720
No. I understand now, about everything.

480
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,910
But considering this is between lovers, this contract lacks affection.

481
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:51,700
The last item, if we meet once...

482
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,850
we do it twice.

483
00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:00,750
Hey, this is a contract overflowing with affection, after all.

484
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:06,220
Twice? Three times? Four times? I can do it. I can do it all.

485
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,470
And we should renegotiate the contract every 100 days.

486
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,180
- Why every 100 days?
- Why?

487
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,470
Is it hard?

488
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,720
Dating Contract

489
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,450
She's totally bad. She's a wild fox (vixen).

490
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,610
Right. If we came this far then that's it. Let's end it here.

491
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:54,890
Ma Sang Goo, your mother always warned you. You should never date a bad woman.

492
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:59,170
Before I sink lower than this, it ends here. Stop.

493
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,090
Can I kiss you?

494
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:16,130
What am I doing now? Is there a lag my right brain?

495
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,740
Erase it! Erase!

496
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,850
Erase. Delete. I should delete it.

497
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:28,760
And the last item, when we meet once, we do it twice.

498
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:35,960
Ma Sang Goo! Is your mind controlled by your body? What is wrong with you?

499
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,800
Get yourself together! She's bad! Ouch! I hit myself too hard!

500
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,770
- Hello.
These days, the world is a scary place. Get a grip.

501
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,710
No! But still no! You can't!

502
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,690
Oh, my goodness? Why...?

503
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,220
What's wrong with him?

504
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,220
I wouldn't know.

505
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:57,650
Coming to this company, are you sure you will be okay?

506
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,390
This can't be happening unless my brain has left my body! Get yourself together Ma Sang Goo!

507
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:06,420
You should listen to your mom! Oh, shut the... ugh!

508
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,840
This is the meeting room and that is the CEO's room.

509
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,850
And that is the employee's break area.

510
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,380
- Yes.
- And this...

511
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,710
is Won Seok-nim's work desk.

512
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,310
Yes.

513
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,950
Then, Hyungnim are you going to be my supervisor?

514
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:31,300
No. First, it's not hyungnim but Se Hee-nim.

515
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,620
Ahhh. Yes.

516
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,790
And your supervisor will be

517
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,610
that person.

518
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,400
First, your desk has been set-up with the basics.

519
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,130
But that thing is missing.

520
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,770
Perhaps, do you have a test earphone you have been using?

521
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,830
- Yes.
- Then do you have the mechanical keyboard too?

522
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,350
Yes. I also have one.

523
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,630
- Then what about a girlfriend?
- Pardon?

524
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,570
Yeah, I do have a girlfriend too.

525
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:17,400
Oh, so you have one. How long have you been using Slack?

526
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,860
Slack, I used that since it was launched. So for about four years?

527
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,300
Then how long have you been with your girlfriend?

528
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,500
I have been dating her for 7 years.

529
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,930
No, but why do you keep on asking those things?

530
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,790
It's necessary for our business, that's why.

531
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:36,610
If you have anything you are curious about then ask me right away. Then...

532
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:03,230
Delete. But wait.

533
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:11,740
Do I have indigestion?

534
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:15,980
So refreshing.

535
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,630
Won Seok, can you see me for a bit?

536
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,160
Yes.

537
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,440
Who was that? Woo Ji Soo? Oh Soo Soo? Who was it?

538
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,320
- Soo Ji?
- Ah, Soo Ji.

539
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,100
- So her name was Soo Ji. Did you say you were college friends?
- Yes.

540
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,970
The truth is, I met Rang because of Soo Ji and Ji Ho.

541
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:48,700
Rang came to our school more than her own school, to see them.

542
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,010
Ah, so that's how it was.

543
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:55,130
Was she popular back in school and such?

544
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,470
- Well, there were a lot of guys who made a move on her.
- Is that so?

545
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,060
What about you? Didn't you?

546
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,630
What? Me?

547
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,030
How can you put me with her? No way.

548
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,800
Why not? You are college friends

549
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,790
and you met her before your girlfriend. I saw her and she's kind of pretty and looks cool.

550
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:17,600
She is. But I can't tame a scary program like her.

551
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,300
She's not a source code that a dummy nerd like me can handle.

552
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,390
She's on a different level.

553
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:29,130
Then, what about me? Will I do? Will we match?

554
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,500
Hyung and Soo Ji?

555
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,330
It would be like being hit with ransomware (malicious software), shall I say?

556
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:39,960
Total "unrecoverable application error," and a feeling like your life will be ruined.

557
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,320
Thanks. Go ahead and work.

558
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,030
My life will be ruined?

559
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,690
Excuse me.

560
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,240
Yes, Ma'am.

561
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,000
This one. It's too bland. It doesn't taste like anything.

562
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,980
Can I give it a try?

563
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,180
I think it's okay.

564
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,600
I think you don't understand what I'm saying.

565
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,490
How am I supposed to eat this? I said it's not tasty to me.

566
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:47,940
Huh? So either make me a new one or give me a refund.

567
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,200
I can do that, Ma'am.

568
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,670
But I think you eat food that is too salty.

569
00:41:54,670 --> 00:42:00,420
What? No, who do you think you are? Blabbering like that?

570
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:05,540
Manager Yang, what kind of attitude is that towards a customer?

571
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,390
- I'm sorry.
- You usually don't do this. What happened?

572
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,110
Is it that time of the month?

573
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,210
- Manager.
- What?

574
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:19,900
I really wanted to tell you this.

575
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:24,890
Why do you always ask if it's that time of the month and diss my innocent uterus whenever something goes wrong?

576
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,630
- What?
- Well,

577
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:33,630
I was the one who did wrong and not my uterus. And that goes for all the other girls, too.

578
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,170
Manager Yang, did you drink in broad daylight?

579
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:43,100
No. I didn't and my period has ended, too.

580
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:47,810
Break time is almost over so I will go and rest for a bit.

581
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,500
Aigoo.

582
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,460
Manager, why did you do that?

583
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,200
What if you get fired?

584
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,860
It's okay. I will quit before I get fired.

585
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:14,230
What? Are you perhaps going somewhere?

586
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,200
Yeah. I will go to a new place one of these days.

587
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,630
Really? Where?

588
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:24,330
- Hyeon-Mo-Yang-Chuh (good wife and wise mother).
- Hyeon-Mo-Yang-Chuh ?

589
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:28,600
Ahh, you are moving to some traditional Korean cuisine restaurant?

590
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,000
Rang, I'm here.

591
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,090
Oh my, you're here Honey? Give it to me.

592
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,490
Huh?

593
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,290
What was that? It's weird.

594
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,780
What's weird about it? We have to practice it now so that it won't be awkward when we're married.

595
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,040
What's all of this?

596
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,080
I took half a day off and went to the wedding fair.

597
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,090
Getting ready for the wedding, booking a venue, and wedding photoshoot, wedding dress and make up, there is so much to do.

598
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:04,310
Sit down, I'll explain everything. Come here.

599
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,870
We should register for wedding mileage.

600
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,540
Wedding mileage?

601
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:15,610
To pay for our wedding attire and gifts, we will spend a bundle, so we should sign up for that.

602
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:20,210
But we have to reserve the wedding hall before they will do it.

603
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,200
A wedding hall?

604
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:26,430
Then, we have to reserve a wedding hall quickly. Right?

605
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:30,770
Oh no, the good ones will be booked until next year.

606
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,480
Next year?

607
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,750
If not next year, then if we do it the year after that, it's nice to prepare everything early on.

608
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,920
Ho Rang, what do you mean the year after next year?

609
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,040
How could we get married two years from now?

610
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,200
Huh?

611
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,090
The door's open, come in.

612
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,520
What's this reaction?

613
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,400
Is it a rejection?

614
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:35,670
I bought this while coming here.

615
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:38,280
It's a bling-bling newest model.

616
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,960
Like you.

617
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,160
My phone's fine, though.

618
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,990
Use that for official matters.

619
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:51,850
Use this one only with me. Okay?

620
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:59,970
Okay, I got it. Let's date.

621
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:04,020
I'll listen to all three of your conditions!

622
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,100
Instead, you can't give this number to anyone else.

623
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,820
This phone is for contacting me only.

624
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,530
This is my condition.

625
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,560
As expected, you know how to negotiate.

626
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,520
Did you save your number already?

627
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,080
Oppa Sang Goo♡

628
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,300
This is you.

629
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,970
My baby♡

630
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,570
What's with that laugh?

631
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,370
Sang Goo Oppa,

632
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,260
why aren't you showering already, wasting time?

633
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,370
We have a lot to do.

634
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,620
You punk, I ought to punish you properly today.

635
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,520
As the adult, I will properly educate you! You just wait!

636
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,790
I'll shower and return in 10 minutes, no 5 minutes.

637
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,700
Yirgacheffe coffee, two cups.

638
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,300
Okay.

639
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:37,020
Unrequited love is tough, right?

640
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,400
What?

641
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,520
Unrequited love with your husband must not be easy, Noona.

642
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,850
What are you saying? Who said anything about unrequited love?

643
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,980
Is it obvious?

644
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,520
Of course it is.

645
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,130
Your gaze is different from your husband's.

646
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:58,830
What's mine like, and what's his like?

647
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:05,560
Your gaze says, "I'll do everything for you,"

648
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,330
and your husband's gaze says,

649
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,190
"Whatever."

650
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,970
Good impression of him, right?

651
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,990
Don't worry too much. You'll strain and wear yourself out.

652
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:23,690
A heart should be given and taken, not just given away.

653
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:37,050
Hello?

654
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,400
Oh, yes.

655
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,520
Yes, Mother-in-law.

656
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,550
Come in! You had a rough day, right?

657
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:10,880
No, I'm fine.

658
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,320
I thought that you coming here would be nice so I called you.

659
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,480
If both of you miss this, it's a bit sad.

660
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,280
This is your first ancestral rite after your wedding, after all.

661
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,150
Yeah.

662
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:22,560
What about Father-in-law?

663
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,940
He'll come soon.

664
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,910
Come in.

665
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,700
This way.

666
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,390
How do you cook all of this by yourself?

667
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,740
Oh, I'm an expert.

668
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,200
I've been the wife of the oldest son for 40 years.

669
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,810
Wow, you're amazing.

670
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:46,260
My daughter-in-law is so precious, how can I make her work?

671
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,750
Wow, this has always been a wish of mine,

672
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:52,610
matching clothes with my daughter.

673
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:57,470
- Daughter?
- Of course. My daughter-in-law is like my child. She's my daughter.

674
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:03,990
Having been around curt men until now, I love that you're here, Ji Ho.

675
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,820
What should I start with, Mother-in-law?

676
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:11,450
Oh, all of this.

677
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:39,150
Have you not left work yet?

678
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,470
I came to your family's ancestral rites.

679
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,520
Like last time.

680
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,430
Seriously. Oppa.

681
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,200
Come back next year for the ancestral rites.

682
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,630
Okay.

683
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:14,010
Ah, that brother of mine.

684
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,420
Should I give you more apples?

685
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,650
Yeah, the apples are really good.

686
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,640
Ah, yes.

687
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,490
Come here, Sang Mi.

688
00:51:26,490 --> 00:51:29,850
She really grew, didn't she?

689
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,950
Aww.

690
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:36,210
Your hands are really skilled.

691
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:39,060
Sang Mi, watch Aunt carefully.

692
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:42,060
She graduated from Seoul National University.

693
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:45,200
You should grow up smart and skilled like her, okay?

694
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:45,950
Yes.

695
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:49,930
Ah, you speak well.

696
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:55,000
Now it finally feels like I'm at our family home. You always make me do all the work.

697
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,730
Oh Auntie, I never did that.

698
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:01,130
It's a joke, Unni.

699
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:06,320
If I had sons, I could have fun having a daughter-in-law, like this.

700
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,690
I'm so jealous.

701
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:09,660
Fun?

702
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:15,650
I was so jealous that you have a daughter, but not anymore.

703
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:19,540
I have a daughter-like daughter-in-law.

704
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:24,140
Your mother-in-law must really be happy to have you.

705
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,950
Of course. I got a daughter for free.

706
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,710
Dear, take care of this, too.

707
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:32,210
Yes.

708
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:35,360
Oh, right. You also have to wash the dishes used for the ancestral rites.

709
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,010
Where did they go? Let's go find them.

710
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,950
Se Hee, how did you get here?

711
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,640
Oh, Se Hee, I thought I wasn't going to see you today.

712
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:00,090
But how did you get a wife like that?

713
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,950
Really.

714
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,980
Let's do this.

715
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:42,940
Father, isn't the food offering more delicious today?

716
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:48,470
Your granddaughter-in-law is very good with her hands.

717
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,310
You should also bow.

718
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:53,870
You should leave now.

719
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:12,370
Be careful of the dishes, Sang Mi.

720
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:15,400
Get along well.

721
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,810
I'll take care of these.

722
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,980
Oh, you're just in the way. Stay out of here.

723
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,050
I will do this.

724
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:36,970
Yes, I know. Everyone knows you adore her.

725
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:39,070
I appreciate your willingness to help

726
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:41,740
but you're just making things complicated, Mister.

727
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:46,330
Yeah, if you do that for Ji Ho, she'll get embarrassed.

728
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:49,500
- What does that mean...?
- Please stay outside.

729
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,580
Eat well.

730
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:21,660
There you go.

731
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:26,720
The house loan,

732
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:32,850
did you pay it back?

733
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:34,920
I am paying it back.

734
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:43,050
I'll pay it back the rest for you as I promised.

735
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:45,620
Why would you pay back my loan?

736
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,220
I heard your wife has a part-time job.

737
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:50,970
That's not something your in-laws would like.

738
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:56,460
And I promised to buy you a home when you married.

739
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,460
A promise.

740
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:03,270
A promise is between two people.

741
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:07,620
A promise made by one party isn't a promise, it's a notification or a delusion.

742
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:12,000
A father wants to pay for his married son's house.

743
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,500
How is that a notification or a delusion?

744
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:20,150
Did we have a father-and-son relationship?

745
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,730
I thought we had a landlord-and-tenant relationship.

746
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:31,390
Twelve years ago, you said, "Get out my house."

747
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:34,330
"Don't step into my house again."

748
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:38,450
Whose fault was it that I had to buy a house?

749
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:44,840
That's because I'm a parent.

750
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:48,640
You should try becoming a parent. That time, as a parent, I had no other choice.

751
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,820
No. You weren't a parent at that time. You were a landlord.

752
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,840
You said, "my house."

753
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:01,130
Then, do you not have parents now?

754
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:08,280
Even as a parent, if you act like a landlord, you can only be treated as one.

755
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,330
Have this.

756
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:22,570
Oh, why'd you pack so much food?

757
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:25,080
It's just us two in my house.

758
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,450
Thank you for the food, I'll eat it well.

759
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:33,930
Why did you come today?

760
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:38,190
Why are you asking?

761
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,940
Mother-in-law called me, so I went.

762
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,210
You should've called me first.

763
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:52,020
I mean, you were too busy to come.

764
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:55,080
So, she was asking me, at least, to come.

765
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,260
How could I call you?

766
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:02,550
Then you should have made some excuse. Say you have work or something.

767
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:07,000
Why would a person who's good at defending...

768
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,700
The 'good daughter-in-law' disease.

769
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:21,840
I didn't think it would happen to me.
[Dear wives, when both you and your husband work, do you go to the in-laws family memorial ritual by yourself?]

770
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:26,240
I thought to myself, "I'm not going to be like this."

771
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:31,510
But, today,

772
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,620
why did I do that?

773
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,290
Do you know

774
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:58,060
the saying,

775
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:00,870
good daughter-in-law disease?

776
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:04,500
Pardon? What disease?

777
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:08,290
After marriage, girls

778
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:12,910
want to be nice and pleasant to their in-laws.

779
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:19,260
They want to become an obedient daughter-in-law, and they overdo it.

780
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:28,540
That's what they call it good daughter-in-law disease.

781
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:33,260
A type of need to be acknowledged, then.

782
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:37,880
Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs that I mentioned before.

783
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,510
If the low-ranking needs are fulfilled,

784
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,640
the next level needs will naturally appear.

785
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,610
Through marriage, your sense of belonging was fulfilled

786
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:51,350
so the next level of needing to be acknowledged has appeared.

787
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,180
It is a natural psychological phenomenon.

788
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:59,040
Especially, wanting to be acknowledged by others is

789
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,750
the most basic need of a human.

790
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:04,640
Is this the only way

791
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,780
you can interpret this?

792
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,120
Pardon?

793
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:15,750
That it's not about a hierarchy of human's animalistic needs,

794
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,940
it could be one's feelings.

795
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:26,010
Because it's the family of the person you like,

796
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:33,640
you feel like being good to them. To the person you like,

797
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:40,140
you want to make him comfortable and happy. That feeling.

798
01:00:42,730 --> 01:00:46,140
Have you never thought about

799
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,810
how it could be due to such feelings?

800
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:59,120
I'll shower first today.

801
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,700
Wait...

802
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,420
Ji Ho.

803
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:16,890
Even though it wasn't in our contract,

804
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:23,890
the unfair labor you endured today, I hope that this takes care of it.

805
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:32,220
I'm sorry for making a tenant endure such an event.

806
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:57,650
I know that it cannot be.

Auntie, isn't my daughter pretty?

821
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:55,270
Oh yes, she is so pretty to us.

822
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:57,260
Imagine how pretty she is to Se Hee.

823
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:59,280
She is such an amiable wife.

824
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,010
So true.

825
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:06,810
Unni, you must be really happy.

826
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:10,210
However my labor

827
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:14,240
didn't signify this.

828
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,080
My defense

829
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:22,080
was not for this.

830
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:26,560
♫ that is difficult for me ♫

831
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,190
It's me.

832
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:41,080
- Yes.
- The share of money you gave me,

833
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:44,130
how did you calculate it?

834
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:47,820
By any chance, is it not enough?

835
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:53,010
I calculated what you earn at the cafe, and added some overtime, too.

836
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:57,880
Yes. It is not enough. Not nearly enough.

837
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:02,210
Ah, I see. Then how much more...?

838
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:06,390
I don't need the money, but I want something else.

839
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:08,450
Something else?

840
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:12,680
You can pay me back by doing physical labor like I did.

841
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:13,950
What?

842
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:19,590
You can pay for it by doing physical labor at my family's home, just like I did.

843
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:24,080
This week, at my family's home,

844
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,020
we're doing gimjang (winter kimchi preparation).

845
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:34,020
In my life,

846
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:37,580
there is no more defense.

847
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:59,290
At least when it comes to my heart,

848
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:08,750
I'm protecting it through offense.

853

That left-brain-loan, right-brain-cat guy. Why would he have chosen such an illogical institution?

854
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:40,780
- She is pretty.
- Imagine that you can see that pretty girl every day.

855
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:43,590
- Then I will do it no matter what.
- You've caused trouble, huh?

856
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:46,410
But I won't fight now. If we fight...

857
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:48,650
Then there will be no going back.

858
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:50,600
Who did you say is coming?

859
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,550
Hey, it's cold. Close the window.

860
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:55,550
I'm starting  gimjang  now.

861
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:57,820
Wow. He is very weird.

862
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:04,210
That even in my heart, there is a space. I realized it due to this marriage.
To: My Everything, my love Se Hee. 12/24/2005. From Your Everything.

863
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,120
Ji Ho!

864
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:11,120
His heart came to me.

865
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:17,490
♫ that tiny little longing in my heart ♫
