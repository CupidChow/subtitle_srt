Lee Min Ki

00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,440
Jeong So Min

Lee Som
Park Byeong Eun

Kim Ga Eun
Kim Min Seok

6
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,800
Because This Is My First Life

7
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,550
Oh, Mom, why are you calling so late at night?

8
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,450
What?

9
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,310
Really?

10
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,440
- Oh, you came. Good.
- Not yet?

11
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,600
It's very cold out, huh? They've been in there for a long time.

12
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,820
I think they will come out soon.

13
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,650
Oh, goodness.

14
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,660
Patient Lee In Seol's child was born.

15
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,810
Aigoo.

16
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,580
So happy to meet you.

17
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,770
It is really so nice to meet you.

18
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,840
So it was you.

19
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,460
You worked hard to come here.

20
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,600
He's a son. Yes, a son.

21
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,740
Father, your eyes...

22
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,980
Why...?

23
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,090
What is this?

24
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,130
Are you crying, Honey?

25
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,790
What are you saying?

26
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,010
Who is crying?

27
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,940
Such useless words...

28
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,970
My mom became a grandma.

29
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,370
Yes.

30
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,870
I became a grandma.

31
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,940
I think it is such a good thing

32
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,300
getting a new family member.

33
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,550
It is a good thing, of course.

34
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,590
It is the biggest gift in the world.

35
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,060
Mom,

36
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,470
I'm getting a divorce.

37
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:53,820
I think we took that gift too lightly,

38
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,520
both he and I.

39
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,700
Why won't you say anything?

40
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,640
Is there any need for me to say anything?

41
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,330
You never change your mind after you make a decision.

42
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,200
You have the hardest time before making a decision

43
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,640
and you also have the hardest time after making that decision.

44
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,070
So what would I have to say to you?

45
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,940
Mom.

46
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,040
Mom,

47
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:56,150
why didn't you divorce Dad, back then?

48
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,390
When I was 10 years old

49
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,900
you left Dad and moved to your parents' house,

50
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,900
taking us both with you.

51
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,550
You remember that?

52
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,820
Your dad and I,

53
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,720
we got married despite fierce opposition from both our families. You didn't know that did you?

54
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,580
Like Romeo and Juliet.

55
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,570
What?

56
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,570
Really?

57
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,310
We were so passionate.

58
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:41,190
Your dad and I both, we threw fits saying we couldn't live without each other.

59
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,930
So after all that difficulty, we finally married.

60
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,690
But after living together for a while

61
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,970
I even thought about splitting up with him.

62
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,090
Then why didn't you do it?

63
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:04,590
I had decided to divorce him, then watched your father as he slept.

64
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,120
Then suddenly, the thoughts of our dating days kept coming to me.

65
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,180
"Oh, if I split up with him now,

66
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,330
I would live the rest of my life longing for him."

67
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,060
I knew that I would keep him in a small corner in my heart

68
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,460
and intensely long for him, this man.

69
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,090
And once I had that thought

70
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,450
I just decided to live together with him, again.

71
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:43,020
Ji Ho, a person's life is similar to most others, in the end.

72
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,090
It's all quite ordinary.

73
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:53,820
However, they just have to take good care

74
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,440
of their 'star pockets,' that is what is important.

75
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,890
Star pockets?

76
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,870
Even in an ordinary life

77
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,730
there are times when something sparkly floats by.

78
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,790
At those times, you have to not miss it,

79
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,690
and keep it carefully in your star pocket.

80
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,470
So when you are having a tough time later,

81
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:23,770
and when you are exhausted, you can take out and look at your stars

82
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,460
and endure the hard times.

83
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,680
So...

84
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,380
Because I don't want to miss my star

85
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,630
I am getting divorced.

86
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,000
In my star pocket, twinkle twinkle,

87
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I want to fill it up.

88
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,870
You're talking crap.

89
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,310
You better not breathe a single word to your dad

90
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,460
that you are divorcing.

91
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,830
He will shave your head bald, and you will be shoved into the newborns' room.

92
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,490
Then when do I tell him?

93
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,330
How is that my problem?

94
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,930
You figure it out.

95
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,130
You damned brat, you dare to speak of divorce?

96
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,660
It hurt.

97
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,760
That family was a gift,

98
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,730
those beautiful words spoken by my mom

99
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,520
felt like punishment to me.

100
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,530
Marriage is

101
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,720
a sparking, shiny thing.

102
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,600
Come on, Ji Ho's Dad.

103
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,640
Get up, let's go.

104
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,320
- Oh, you're here?
- Get up now.
- Hold on.

105
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,490
What are you doing?

106
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,960
Marriage is...

107
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,550
I told you to sleep in the car.

108
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,190
even if you hate him, just once more

109
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,640
turning around to look back at him.

110
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,720
We, who thought of marriage too lightly,

111
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,830
we...

112
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,970
Two Year Tenancy Marriage Contract

113
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:58,430
...I felt shame, for the first time.

114
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,460
Shall we shake hands once?

115
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,680
I wish you luck.

116
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,720
For both of us

117
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,660
this is the first time to divorce.

118
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,050
Yes.

119
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,190
I wish you luck as well.

120
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,570
Ji Ho.

121
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,670
Our relationship, which began with a handshake,

122
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:59,290
it was right to end it with a handshake, I thought.

123
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,460
Our first half was marriage

124
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:10,470
but I wanted our second half to be love.

125
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,460
Last Episode: Because This Life is Our First

126
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,050
Thank you.

127
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,640
My phone's out of battery. Do you guys have a charger?

128
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,690
I'll bring it to you later.

129
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,890
Deputy Park.

130
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,040
Whoa, CEO Ma. It's been a while.

131
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,250
Have you been well?

132
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,360
Of course.

133
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,690
What happened to your nose?

134
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,040
Oh, this? I was drunk and fell down on my way home.

135
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,090
Aigoo.

136
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,080
Oh, the elevator is here. Let's go.

137
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,750
Oh, that's right. I heard you secured investment.

138
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,520
Oh, congratulations, CEO Ma.

139
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,250
Oh, yes, thank you.

140
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,000
But . . .

141
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,640
I don't see Deputy Woo.

142
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,130
- Deputy Woo?
- Yes.

143
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,860
She left the company. Didn't you know?

144
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,100
Ah, I see.

145
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,660
Yes. This is why I hate working with women.

146
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,720
They just work briefly before they get married.

147
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,310
Would they understand the responsibilities of being the head of a family?

148
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,980
So cold.

149
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:43,600
Deputy Park, it's been such a long time. How about having a smoke with me?

150
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,290
Shall I? You guys go ahead, I'll be there soon.

151
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,300
You're not smoking?

152
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,100
No, I quit.

153
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,940
Smoking never really suited me.

154
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,660
Oh, is that right?

155
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,840
But if you don't smoke, your social life will be disadvantaged.

156
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,320
You won't have as many chances to have conversations.

157
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,930
What sort of conversations? What disadvantage?

158
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:11,450
You mean not being able to join in silly conversations men have while smoking with each other? Is that what you mean?

159
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:15,790
I know about that. Pretending to be a strong, alpha male and using sexual innuendos,

160
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:21,200
it makes you feel like you are strong, and as if your existence is being validated.

161
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,150
But shouldn't that end when you're in eighth grade?

162
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:32,510
No, eighth-graders these days don't engage in such silliness.

163
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,920
Kids are so smart these days.

164
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,520
they understand well what shabby behavior is.

165
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,800
What the heck are you talking about?

166
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,960
What's up!

167
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,020
This is my girlfriend. Want to say hi?

168
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,230
You are out here early.

169
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,460
Yeah.

170
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,080
I was having some deep conversation with Jin Ho here.

171
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,480
Isn't that right?

172
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,340
Oh yeah?

173
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,560
It's been a while, Jin Ho.

174
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,350
You got fatter.

175
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,580
No, he lost some weight, actually.

176
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,710
Jin Ho, I am three years older than you.

177
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,750
Be well, and see you around.

178
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,580
We're going.

179
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,320
Bye.

180
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,960
So these are all no-wire bras, right?

181
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,530
Yes, they are all push-up mold.

182
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,000
Can I have a fitting for these?

183
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,130
Yes, of course. This way, please.

184
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,000
Yes.

185
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,970
Work hard.

186
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,050
Oh, you're working so hard when it's so cold today. My name is Ma Sang Goo.

187
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,030
It's nice to meet you.

188
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:59,910
Wow, you've worked out a lot. Fighting!

189
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:09,510
Oh, the sample research is finally over. You've worked hard.

190
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,120
But there is still so much to do.

191
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,680
I have to prepare the online homepage.

192
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,930
I also have to look at the sample fabrics with the designer.

193
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,180
Take care.

194
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,970
Okay, you've worked hard.

195
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,370
Oh, and make sure you don't skip meals.

196
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,140
Freelancers work on the fuel of food, you know.

197
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,170
Oi!

198
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,040
Oppa.

199
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,610
What?

200
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,600
Want to come up and have ramyun?

201
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,700
Oh, oh!

202
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:48,340
I am no longer someone who is so easily fooled.

203
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,890
Really?

204
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,510
Yes. Get in.

205
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,260
Awesome!

206
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,920
Ahhh!

207
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,570
There still isn't anyone who has cometo see this room.

208
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,520
When someone rents it, I will contact you right away.

209
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,630
Yes, Ahjumma.

210
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,830
Aigoo, what happened to you these past few months that your face looks so terrible?

211
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,260
Go back home, eat your mom's home cooking, and look pretty again, okay?

212
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,210
I'll be going.

213
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,460
Yes, see you.

214
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,410
Goodbye.

215
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,440
So you lived here for about three years, right?

216
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,640
Yes.

217
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,260
Goodness, you kept the place so neat.

218
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,980
You will not find a better two-room place. Come this way.

219
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,540
Oh.

220
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,140
This smaller room, you can use as a closet, and later, you can make it the child's room.

221
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,710
This is quite a pleasant room. Nice big window, and you can get fresh air.

222
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,780
That's right, you won't find a better place. Take a look at this now.

223
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,820
Honey.

224
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,910
Oh, I'm coming.

225
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,840
We enjoyed seeing your place.

226
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,830
Thank you, I'll be in touch.

227
00:17:52,800 --> 00:18:01,280
♫ Those futures I had written down, some time ago ♫

228
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,470
♫ They have come to a stop, at that time, and remained there ♫

229
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,990
♫ They have come to a stop, at that time, and remained there ♫

230
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,920
Oh, they lost. They lost.

231
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,090
♫ Sometimes I long for my younger self ♫

232
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:20,530
♫ If I could go back to that day ♫

233
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,120
♫ Maybe I can smile ♫

234
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,670
♫ Repeating the same time over and over again ♫

235
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:35,530
♫ I have become used to it, I don't know when ♫

236
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,280
♫ And that is how time is passing by ♫

237
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,350
♫ Like today ♫

238
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,080
♫ Just like today, I endure another day ♫

239
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:51,300
♫ But another day keeps coming, so I continue to live ♫

240
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,560
♫ Repeat the same foolish things ♫

241
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:01,080
♫ Standing by myself in the corner ♫

242
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,960
♫ And hoping again that tomorrow will be different ♫

243
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:14,810
♫ I can't walk even one step ♫

244
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,080
Dear Se Hee,

245
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,690
Did you enjoy watching soccer today, too?

246
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,360
Is Kitty doing well?

247
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,220
When you find this letter, Se Hee,

248
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,810
I wonder when that will be.

249
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,650
It will probably be after I left

250
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,210
and you come into this room, right?

251
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:34,680
To be honest, there was one time I went into your room.

252
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,710
At that time, the poetry book that you liked

253
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,220
I saw it there.

254
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,160
And that CEO Go

255
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,270
was the owner of that poetry book,

256
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,080
I know that, too.

257
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,220
I am sorry.

258
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,290
Se Hee,

259
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,100
Mongolians,

260
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,710
when someone dies, they do not bury

261
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,140
or cremate the corpse, they say.
The Last Jurchens on Earth

262
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,110
Instead, they carry the corpse in a cart

263
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:13,130
and in a place they do not know

264
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,780
they just drop it and leave it there.

265
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,190
And they later go back to the same place

266
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,360
and look at the corpse.

267
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,540
If the body is intact, they are aggrieved,

268
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:34,420
and if only the white bones are left, they rejoice as they return.

269
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,680
Me...

270
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,620
When I leave this room and return,

271
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,280
what will be left in my heart?

272
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,630
I've become curious about it.

273
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,860
What is going on? Asking to eat with me of all people.

274
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,420
You and I are the only ones

275
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,560
who are taking a day off from work.

276
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,670
Oh, I see.

277
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,570
But I heard that you don't like to eat out.

278
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,130
I don't want

279
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,790
to eat at home,

280
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,550
alone.

281
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,200
Yes, affection borne of food is a very scary thing.

282
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,670
Ah, I heard that you put your home up for sale.

283
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,950
Yes. I think

284
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,960
the transaction will be complete soon.

285
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,100
Where do you plan to move to?

286
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,950
Did you find another place?

287
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,040
Well,

288
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,710
I'm sure there's a room somewhere. As long as it is not that house

289
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,960
I don't care

290
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,820
where it is.

291
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,610
Oh, that isn't cooked yet.

292
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,860
Who cares?

293
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,470
As long as it fills my belly.

294
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,400
But where did Ji Ho go traveling?

295
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,030
Um,

296
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:01,190
are you going somewhere far away?

297
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,510
I think

298
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,250
I probably will.

299
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,610
So did she really go somewhere very far?

300
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,100
Yes.

301
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,720
I think she went to Mongolia.

302
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,050
Mongolia?

303
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:26,920
Wow, you are intense, Yoon Ji Ho. You went to Mongolia?

304
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,110
Here. Right here.

305
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,710
Will you be all right?

306
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,990
Of course, don't you know my head? Come on! Come on!

307
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,800
I will really slam it hard.

308
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,700
Come at me already.

309
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,350
I am really gonna do it.

310
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,060
Come on!

311
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,800
Oh, that really hurt.

312
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,790
It's been a long time since we hung out like this, huh?

313
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:19,120
I know, I'm happy too.

314
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,140
But you said you were going on a trip. Can you really play with me like this every day?

315
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,990
It's been awhile since you had some time off, you should at least go to Jejudo or something.

316
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,760
Hey, I'm a girl from the ocean.

317
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,440
You want me to take a trip to see the ocean?

318
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,590
Yeah, what's so great about taking a trip, anyway? As long as you are happy and content, right?

319
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,250
How is the guest house? Not uncomfortable?

320
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,040
Yeah, it's fun.

321
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:49,680
I have many foreign friends, and although the room is shared with many people, so I can't sleep well sometimes,

322
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,510
it's fine. It kind of feels like a trip, so it's nice.

323
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,350
Ji Ho.

324
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:03,790
Until you get your own place, do you want to live at my old rooftop apartment?

325
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,030
There...

326
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,860
Won Seok moved out. He's going to move in with his parents.

327
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,020
That's good. He probably won't cook much for himself anyway.

328
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,780
There is still a lot of time left on the lease, and I don't need the security deposit right away.

329
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,480
So if you're okay, you can live there for a while.

330
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,310
Let's have ramyun!

331
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,690
Yes, yes, yes!

332
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,170
Ta-da!

333
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,030
That I would get to eat ramyun that Woo Soo Ji made for me,

334
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:04,630
I feel like I have succeeded at life. Thank you. I will enjoy it.

335
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,790
Is it good?

336
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,650
It is so good. It is astounding.

337
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,860
Ah, kimchi.

338
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,950
Why is the ramyun raw?

339
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,820
It's hard to make bad ramyun.

340
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,510
Try eating it with this, it will taste good.

341
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,320
What's this?

342
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,660
Wow, there is even kimchi!

343
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,900
Ah, you said Se Hee put his place up for sale? Where is he going to live?

344
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,150
I don't know either. Even I haven't seen Se Hee in a while.

345
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,350
He's using the paid leave he's accrued. I think he's going to use all 20 days at once.

346
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:14,570
The whole company is on the verge of death thanks to Nam Se Hee.

347
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,830
What the heck is he doing, anyway?

348
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,110
Eat up, quickly.

349
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,080
You try it too.

350
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,700
No, you eat it.

351
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,370
- Oh, it's tasty!
- Isn't it?

352
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,450
It's breaking off.

353
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,290
Sanchez scored a goal again.

354
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,840
Wow, he sure scores often.

355
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,150
In was a perfect goal in joint with Sanchez.

356
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:43,240
A good play between Sanchez and Girouad.

357
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,820
Woori. Did you put that collar on yourself?

358
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:54,570
Or did your noona (older sister) put it on you?

359
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,500
Your noona, she was going to leave us.

360
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,950
So why did she bother putting that on you, anyway?

361
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,610
What was her reason, did she tell you?

362
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,330
Do you know what's going on in your noona's heart?

363
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,880
Yes, Sanchez chased after him and stole the ball.

364
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,780
- Hey!
-Hey!

365
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,460
- Hello.
- Oh, hello!

366
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,590
To the center, shoot!

367
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,980
Hi, Ji Ho.

368
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,350
Oh, hi Nancy!

369
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,180
You're watching soccer today again?

370
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,690
Yes.

371
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,080
It's important game.

372
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,040
But why do you like watching soccer so much? Isn't it a bit boring to just watch?

373
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,550
Boring?

374
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,350
No.

375
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,900
Ah, so…

376
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,730
"It's not important just to watch."

377
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,180
No wait. I need to use a relative pronoun, don't I?

378
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,250
"What you are..." No, that's not right. So what I mean is,

379
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:22,740
With soccer, it's not watching that's important.

380
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,230
It's who you watch it with that's important.

381
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,670
Goal!

382
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,660
Oh, daebak!

383
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:42,460
Depending on who you're watching it with

384
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:47,310
that day's match becomes memorable.

385
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,740
I totally have no idea what you're talking about.

386
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,760
I know.

387
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,340
This is the negative result of high school English in Korea.

388
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:05,050
How nice would it be if you learned some Korean?

389
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:08,280
Anyway, what are you doing tomorrow?

390
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,330
Tomorrow? I will make cake. I'm going to make a cake.

391
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,370
For who?

392
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:18,510
Hmm, to my ex-husband.

393
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,810
Pardon?

394
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,170
Goodnight, Nancy.

395
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,310
I'm going to sleep.

396
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:30,020
Then let's begin with the batter.

397
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,660
♫ Thinking of you  ♫

398
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,890
♫ I smile quietly ♫

399
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,100
♫ No one  ♫

400
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,690
Let's put our hearts into it, for the person we want to give this gift to.

401
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:01,770
Thanks, memory, or perhaps a confession of love. Oh!

402
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,860
Wow, it's so pretty!

403
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,200
You did a great job making a raccoon.

404
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,790
So pretty.

405
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,910
If you lose here, you will treat all of us to tomorrow's late night snack. No backsies!

406
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,600
- It's a deal.
- It's a deal.
- Fighting!

407
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,520
- Won Seok-nim, you are ready, right?
- Yes.

408
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,680
Three! Two! One!

409
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,310
Start!

410
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:40,620
Move. Move. Why are you there?!

411
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,810
You really suck at this game.

412
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,570
- What did you say?
- Left, go left.

413
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,160
Step on it!

414
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,670
Oh! Chief Nam!

415
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,540
- Hello.
- Hello.

416
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,880
It's quite small. Won't you be uncomfortable?

417
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,210
All I need to do in my house is eat and sleep.

418
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,660
What is there to be uncomfortable about?

419
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,420
It's not as if I can take it with me when I die.

420
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,050
You're not intending to quit your job at this company, are you?

421
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:37,060
I still have more paid leave left.

422
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:39,530
So I won't quit, yet.

423
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,100
What is this?

424
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,740
This room layout that feels weirdly familiar?

425
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:23,880
Oh, Won Seok left some of his things behind.

426
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,060
What is this?

427
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,590
Why is this so comfortable?

428
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,970
Like it's my own bed?

429
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:43,770
Rang, I moved into the rooftop apartment.

430
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,680
Thank you.

431
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,420
Thank you.

432
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:57,670
Ho Rang, I saw the calendar

433
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,310
and next year's Independence Movement Day (March 1) is a Thursday.

434
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:04,080
So if I get days off on Friday and the Monday and Tuesday after,

435
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,440
I think a trip to Bali will be good.

436
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,870
Ah, so you're going to Bali?

437
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,370
Yes, it's perfect for a honeymoon.

438
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,890
Ho Rang, go to Bali with me next year.

439
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,590
Won Seok-nim, thank you.

440
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:34,660
I will take care of your place and move out later.
- Looks like he's moved in.

441
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,510
Aren't you leaving work?

442
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,540
I will, soon.

443
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,240
The video recording of the game that you played earlier,

444
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,150
turn it on.

445
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,420
It's on.

446
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,310
Look at this.

447
00:35:55,310 --> 00:36:00,420
Your start is faster, but you let your opponent mess with your mind,

448
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,090
and you lost your pace.

449
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,090
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

450
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:10,160
It better to just let the opponent pass you in the beginning and use a last minute spurt to pass them.

451
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,100
That's true, I could do that.

452
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,350
As expected, using your data analyst skills.

453
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:18,630
My favorite thing is talking about are games, formulas,

454
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,520
and game formulas.

455
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,530
Really? I'm also like that.

456
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,250
So, I was thinking.

457
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,300
Yeah?

458
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,730
If you have time,

459
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,420
Yes?

460
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,770
shall you and I date?

461
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,700
Yes.

462
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,590
Yes. Yes?!

463
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,210
You did well.

464
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,580
Who are you?

465
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,080
Huh?

466
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,590
That's the question I want to ask you.

467
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,990
Who are you?

468
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:28,060
Ah, I just moved in here. This is my home now.

469
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,570
Huh?

470
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,310
So he sold his place?

471
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,900
Mr. Left-brain-loan and Right-brain-cat?

472
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,830
But why?

473
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,160
Where did he go?

474
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,400
Where did you go?

475
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:03,860
♫ Please stay still, without a sound, just like this ♫

476
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,970
♫ As if we just happened to be together by coincidence ♫

477
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:16,790
♫ Not even any scent remains ♫

478
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:17,930
Wife

479
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:24,520
♫ But your image lingers on ♫

480
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,500
You couldn't be connected with the caller. After the beep...

481
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,590
♫  Stay with me  ♫

482
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,800
♫  Come with me  ♫

483
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,340
Today is Our Day 1!

484
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,710
We were going to become a real "us" starting today.

485
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:16,680
To make this day our Day One, I wanted to confess to you first.

486
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,880
Looks like that's out the window now.

487
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,360
Woori,

488
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,980
he won't even answer the phone.

489
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:33,920
Where is he? This man?

490
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,150
After leaving that room and walking around Seoul for several months

491
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,900
what would be left in my heart?

492
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,650
Be well. Go back and live your life like nothing happened. Don't ever love someone again. You have no right to.

493
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,300
I really wanted to find out.

494
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,270
Shall we sleep together

495
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,550
again today?

496
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,360
No, not today...

497
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,120
To be honest, I hated him a little, too.

498
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:05,300
Marriage that people enter into because of love must be happy, right?

499
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:09,090
And I hurt a lot, too.

500
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:14,920
So that we can endure the dark night sky together...

501
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,890
a star pocket that belongs to only us...

502
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:23,500
From now on, I want to

503
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,310
terminate our contract.

504
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:32,020
... Did it exist for us, at all?

505
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,470
I was curious.

506
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,600
No, to be honest,

507
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,720
I was doubtful.

508
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:47,460
But when I looked back, what remained in my heart

509
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,250
was not hate nor hurt, but

510
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,210
10/31 She is an excellent cook... snores... met with the CEO of a production company 11/16 She asked to end the contract.

511
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,020
just longing.

512
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:09,180
Just missing him.

513
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:22,460
My star pocket is so full now,

514
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,740
but where is this man?

515
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,430
Hmm, Ji Ho.

516
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:38,770
Ji Ho. I heard you went to the rooftop apartment.

517
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:41,440
Perhaps, did you meet him?

518
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:08,090

How did you end up here?

525
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,960
You carried your hyung (older brother) here on your back, huh? Riding a taxi?

Ji Ho...

535
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,280
I dreamt of Ji Ho's bag before,

536
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,960
and now my Ji Ho came into my dream. (casual speech)

537
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:13,290
You must have missed me a lot (casual speech)

538
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,440
that I would appear in your dream.

539
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,010
Now you even talk.

540
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:32,510
Did you have a nice trip to Mongolia?

541
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,230
Mongolia?

542
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:42,750
Mongolia. Did you enjoy it there, while leaving me behind here?

543
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:49,630
Did you have fun while leaving me here alone?

544
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,790
No.

545
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:58,960
It was no fun at all.

546
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,710
Because I missed you so much.

547
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,950
I longed for you every day.

548
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:15,330
How funny.

549
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:25,890
I love you.

550
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,000
What?

551
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I love you

552
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,400
very much.

553
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,290
♫  The night that I cried  ♫

554
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,640
You are

555
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,400
so bad.

556
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,040
♫  I could not find  ♫

557

You're not going to be by my side.

♫  remember  ♫

559
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:04,100
When I wake up, you won't be there,

00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:10,460
so how can you say that you love me?

561
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:16,520
You're a bad person, Ji Ho.

562

I'm sorry.

565
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,790
I promise I won't go anywhere anymore.

♫ I can cry ♫

567

I'm sorry.

How can a dream be so sad?

569
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,470
♫ That dream that does not disappear ♫

570
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,460
But still,

571
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:55,380
this is nice.

572
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,100
It's good to see you, even like this, Ji Ho.

573
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:06,380
Even if it's just a dream

574
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,120
I'm happy.

575
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,140
Ji Ho.

576
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:19,530
♫ The dark night sky ♫

577
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:23,900
♫ by your side ♫

578
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:30,960
♫ The love that drew me there ♫

579
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:25,680
Perhaps, did you make this tea, Woori?

580
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:28,000
The citron tea.

581
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:35,270
It looks like I am suffering from alcohol-induced dementia, after all.

582
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:42,640
Maybe that's a good thing.

583
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,330
You're up? (formal speech)

584
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:18,790
You're drinking as soon as you wake up? Doesn't your stomach hurt?

585
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,760
Let's eat breakfast.

586
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:25,690
Come and shower. You smell.

587
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,230
What is this, Ji Ho?

588
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:43,190
Huh?

589
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:49,060
Can you really swallow that marinated crab right now?

590
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:54,720
Why not? Oh, is it too heavy for breakfast?

591
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,020
Marinated crab?

592
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,510
That's not what I mean, obviously.

593
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:00,490
Then what is it?

594
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:03,690
Why can't I swallow marinated crab?

595
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:08,440
Didn't we get divorced?

596
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:17,690
This situation is quite strange.

597
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:20,800
We divorced, and you disappeared, saying you were going to Mongolia.

598
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,340
And then you appear like this suddenly

599
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,870
and are eating marinated crab.

600
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:33,530
This situation is quite complicated for me.

601
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:38,200
Then shall I

602
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,790
leave?

603
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,100
All right.

604
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,790
I'll go, then.

605
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:01,260
You know that is not what I mean. (casual speech)

606
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:06,830
Where did you go? Where were you?

607
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,250
Insa-dong.

608
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:15,490
In... sadong?

609
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,790
Are you angry?

610
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,470
No. (formal speech)

611
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,030
Is that true?

612
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,230
You're really not mad?

613
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:43,920
No, I am not angry.

614
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,420
No, you are angry.

615
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,640
I am not angry, I said.

616
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:55,820
Insa-dong? When you were there, how could you not contact me, even once?

617
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:59,140
You were so nearby, and you never came to see me, even once?

618
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,600
I missed you so much.

619
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,920
I suffered... so much.

620
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:14,840
You're smiling?

621
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:19,200
Why are you smiling? After driving someone crazy

622
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,670
and you even made me sell my house, and you can smile right now?

623
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:31,190
Se Hee got angry.

624
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:41,350
For the first time, you said these things to me.

625
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,260
"I missed you so much."

626
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:53,130
"I suffered so much."

627
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,660
You told me how you felt

628
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,600
for the first time ever, Se Hee.

629
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,600
Thank you.

630
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,630
Thank you for opening your Room 19.

631
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:18,700
I'm sorry for leaving when you were suffering. (casual speech)

632
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,430
Shall I hug you?

633
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,800
I don't know.

634
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,500
What do you mean? I'll give you a hug.

635
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,930
Stop it, what are you doing?

636
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:38,790
- Why not? Let's have a hug.
- No, don't come close.

637
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:42,080
- Oh, come on, come here.
- Oh really...

638
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:49,060
I told you to not come closer, didn't I?

639
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:56,840
Do you need to eat more breakfast?

640
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:04,230
I don't need to eat more breakfast.

641

646
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:44,460
This is the result of my analysis of our compatibility as a couple.

647
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,570
You know that a numerically perfect match such as this is not easy to find, right?

648
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:53,740
I will wait for your wise decision.

649
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:14,040
Did you make up your mind?

650
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,470
Yeah.

651
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:19,000
Bo Mi-nim.

652
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:25,060
You are like a Mac OS to me.

653
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:31,530
New, fascinating, and user-friendly, so you're comfortable. That is how you are like, to me.

654
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,360
However,

655
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:38,910
even though things can be inconvenient and annoying,

656
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:41,490
I would still prefer Windows.

657
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:51,750
My head knows that the Mac OS would be the best for me,

658
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:56,180
but even though I know that, my heart and hands

659
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:00,470
still remember Windows.

660
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,730
I'm sorry, Bo Mi-nim.

661
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:07,970
Okay. I get it.

662
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:14,780
Of all the rejections I've heard, this is the most romantic.

663
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:17,710
Ah, is that so?

664
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,530
Thank you.

665
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:25,880
However, how long are you planning to be chained by that outdated operating system?

666
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,350
Shouldn't you also update your Windows?

667
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:34,390
I heard that Mr. Accountant will propose tomorrow.

668
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:40,720
So please "update" before you get "formatted."

669
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,800
So you knew about this already, Bomi-nim?

670
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,390
From today on, today's our day 1!

671
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,330
Se Hee,

672
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,470
Se Hee?

673
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:02,580
Get up already.

674
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:04,840
We should eat dinner.

675
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,680
Can't we sleep just a little more?

676
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:11,440
These days I haven't been sleeping well.

677
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,530
But still, eat dinner and then sleep again, okay?

678
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:31,450
Shall I make omurice for you again?

679
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:37,820
Let's order fried chicken.

680
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,520
It's nice.

681
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,430
Yeah, very.

682
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:03,530
I heard you didn't sign the contract…

683
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:06,240
from CEO Go.

684
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,270
Yeah.

685
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:15,530
I was wondering if you gave up on a good opportunity because of me.

686
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:19,260
Why does everyone think that

687
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:23,630
because of them, I decided to give up something?

688
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:25,990
CEO also thought that.

689
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:31,540
I don't give up that easily

690
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:34,840
since I am an unlucky kid born in 1988.

691
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:40,550
Chances are precious and hard to get,

692
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:43,920
so I do not give up anything that easily.

693
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:51,830
Of all those chances, there is also love.

694
00:58:54,830 --> 00:59:01,050
Both CEO and your dad helped me

695
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:04,020
realize what I can't give up on.

696
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:08,560
I just couldn't give up on love.

697
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:14,630
So, rather than me giving up this chance,

698
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:19,480
I chose love as my priority.

699
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,000
Experiencing what real love is,

700
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,070
in this era that I live in,

701
00:59:30,070 --> 00:59:35,280
it's very difficult to do it properly, even once.

702
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:44,510
Therefore, if marriage will harm our love,

703
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:48,500
then I do not plan to make that choice again.

704
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,340
What do you think, Se Hee?

705
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,410
I...

706
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:02,170
don't want to be separated from you ever again.

707
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,990
Also, I want to be your

708
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:11,180
legal guardian,

709
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:14,160
so if anything dangerous were to happen,

710
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:17,900
I could be the first one to run to you.

711
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:26,410
However, that marriage is an institution that can change love,

712
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:28,530
I agree with that, in general.

713
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:31,620
The traditions and rules set by our parents' generation,

714
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:37,060
I no longer want them to harm our feelings in the future.

715
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:43,950
From now on, let's you and I together

716
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:46,230
find an alternative that works for us.

717
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,380
Okay.

718
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:06,220
But wait. Did you and CEO Go meet with each other, alone?

719
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,320
When? Where?

720
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,570
Uhm... You see... About that...

721
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:17,450
I got a call from her first.

722
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:20,190
- She called you first?
- Yes.

723
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:25,130
But that CEO is a bit strange. How can she just call someone else's man like that whenever she wants?

724
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:28,360
I-I know, right?

725
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,600
Should I change it? My phone number?

726
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,700
No thanks.

727
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:43,330
The chicken is getting cold.

728
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:46,470
Yeah, Ji Ho?

729
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:49,810
District office? Why are you going there?

730
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:53,420
I think I should throw away that sofa.

731
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,420
The landlady gave me a call.

732
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:01,070
You're right. Wow, there's a lot of mold on the sofa.

733
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:03,720
It also has a bunch of scratches here and there, too.

734
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,650
Right?

735
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:09,250
I'll go report it as bulk waste and then come get it later.

736
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:11,070
Okay, I'll see you later.

737
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,760
Okay.

738
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,400
I heard from the attorney.

739
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,230
Congratulations on taking your first step as a 'striker.'

740
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:25,050
Also, you will be getting a call from another production company soon.

741
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:29,200
With a pure fan's heart, I promoted your work.

742
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,440
Please write what is in your heart, Writer.

743
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,800
My Man ♥

744
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:50,260
- It's been a while, CEO Ma.
- Yeah.

745
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,820
Oh?! Just who do we have here?

746
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:56,760
Our Chief Nam, who is finally coming to work after fifteen days off?

747
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:00,230
I thought that you had left this company, so I was planning to get rid of this desk.

748
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:04,150
However everyone, Nam Se Hee finally came to work on his own two feet.

749
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:08,400
I missed your

750
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,230
gags, CEO Ma.

751
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:14,880
Mine ♥

752
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,020
Mine? Hey, your phone must've been switched with someone else's on the bus.

753
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:21,540
- Yeah?
- "Yeah?"

754
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,810
- Did you get to work okay?
- Yeah.

755
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:25,320
I did.

756
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:27,320
Are you going to perhaps be late later?

757
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:30,120
I have to help Ho Rang throw away her sofa,

758
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,950
but it's not something we two can do alone.

759
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:33,580
Ah...

760
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:37,000
Just leave it. I'll take care of it.

761
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,510
Is that so?

762
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:42,260
Me too.

763
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:56,790
Did you unplug this?

764
01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:59,370
So I prepared this...
Marriage Proposal Project

765
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:03,700
I'm also planning on buying a house together on our 4th year anniversary.

766
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:08,320
Marriage is life's biggest project, after all.

767
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:11,370
So in order to not fail,

768
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:15,980
we have to slowly prepare ourselves, step by step.

769
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:25,210
Yeong Hyo, I'm sorry.

770
01:04:25,210 --> 01:04:30,720
I can't accept your feelings.

771
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,680
Honestly, I came here to tell you that today.

772
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,990
I can't say I'm completely surprised.

773
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,910
I'm sorry.

774
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:46,450
Is it okay

775
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:50,430
if I ask the reason?

776
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:52,850
The real reason.

777
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:57,410
I think only then can I have real closure.

778
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:12,530
This is the ring someone gave me when he proposed.

779
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:17,850
Honestly, all this time, I still carried this around with me.

780
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,370
When I was dating you,

781
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:24,610
I also tried my best to give you

782
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:27,330
my heart.

783
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:28,950
However,

784
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:35,150
it turns out one's heart isn't something you can work for.

785
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:38,950
It just comes.

786
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,590
That's a great phrase.

787
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:56,100
That's something I can "real(ly)" agree with.

788
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:00,970
Agree?

789
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:02,790
Of course!

790
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:10,860
Ho Rang

791
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:22,870
It's been a while, Won Seok.

792
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,680
You finally came to work.

793
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,330
Is it manageable to be living in that one-room place?

794
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:32,560
Yes, it is very great.

795
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:38,140
I never imagined that a one-room place like that could be such an ideal living space.

796
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,190
That is good to hear.

797
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:45,420
Se Hee, by any chance,

798
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:48,420
did Rang go there, or anything like that?

799
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:50,100
How did you know?

800
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,130
She's supposed to be coming over today.

801
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:54,160
What? Rang?

802
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,300
Yes.

803
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:57,640
She went to the district office and filed some documents

804
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,080
and she plans to finalize things at the rooftop place.

805
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,400
File something at the district office? What is she finalizing?

806
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,190
- Ah, it's a sof—
- Is it a marriage registration by any chance?

807
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:07,020
What?

808
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,340
I think that must be the case.

809
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:18,620
A woman in her early 30s, filing documents at the district office.

810
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:21,990
I can't imagine she would have any other reason than that.

811
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:24,820
Marriage registration.

812
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:34,750
Ah, speaking of which, I saw her with our company's accountant earlier in the cafe by our company.

813
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,060
Ho Rang.

814
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:39,670
The cafe by our company? Please let them know I am taking a half-day off.

815
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:41,560
Yes.

816
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:56,660
♫  You are my everything Stay by me every day  ♫

817
01:07:56,660 --> 01:08:05,220
♫  I'm falling in love, won't you be my one love?  ♫

818
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:08,130
Thank you. Stay healthy and

819
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:10,070
- meet a good person.
- Yes.

820
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:14,010
You must also succeed on marrying someone you love.

821
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:15,660
You must!

822
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:17,350
Yes.

823
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:26,680

824
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,110
How are you here?

825
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:39,500
I can't do this.

826
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,280
- What do you mean?
- I can't give up.

827
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:45,580
I can't give up. I won't do it.

828
01:08:47,070 --> 01:08:51,670
Oh. But it's useless now, anyway.

829
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:54,350
It's already too old.

830
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:57,800
And it's got wounds here and there so it's not possible to revive it.

831
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:01,830
No. It's because it's old,

832
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,820
because it's got wounds,

833
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:08,550
so it should be that much more cherished and looked after.

834
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:09,940
Huh?

835
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:17,250
Rang, I did wrong.

836
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,700
From now on, I will cherish more and put in more effort,

837
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:25,420
so I will make it look like it did before.

838
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,100
- Why are you crying?
- So Ho Rang...

839
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:33,630
So could you give me just one more chance?

840
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:35,460
Please.

841
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:38,420
Alright then.

842
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:41,410
You take it then, if you want it so badly.

843
01:09:46,170 --> 01:09:48,560
What's this?

844
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,470
Large Item Disposal Report
Three-seat sofa

845
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:55,060
I didn't know it was the sofa.

846
01:09:55,060 --> 01:10:01,450
Why did you think I accepted another ring?

847
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,760
How could I

848
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:10,360
accept any other ring?

849
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:14,400
How could I take off this ring?

850
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,910
When this ring means so much.

851
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:26,970
In this life, when it comes to rings, this one

852
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:29,840
is plenty.

853
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:46,210
So Won Seok.

854
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:50,200
Will you

855
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,770
marry me, please?

856
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:03,270
I was going to say it first.

857
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:09,500
Silly. Don't cry, or your makeup will be all erased.

♫ I'm changing little by little ♫

861
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:22,340
Why is your face looking like this? It makes me upset.

862
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:30,850
Where do we go for our newlywed home? We shouldn't have moved out of the rooftop apartment, maybe?

863
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:33,830
Oh. We don't need a newlywed home.

864
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:36,360
We'll move in with your parents.

865
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,270
My mom and dad's?

866
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:42,680
- Yup.
- That's a bit...

867
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:47,410
Why? I don't want to see you getting loaded with house chores.

868
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:50,330
Get your head together!

869
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:52,800
We should be grateful they will take us in at our state.

870
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,450
I already talked to your mother so don't try to say otherwise.

871
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:57,650
Already? With my mom?

872
01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:00,750
Let's discuss our plan since we're on the topic.

873
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:05,170
♫ Is there?  ♫

874
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:07,840

Marriage Project: Preparing for wedding, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 6-20 years, After Retirement

875
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:11,480
- What is this?
- Our marriage development five-year plan.

876
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:16,160
According to sociologist Gary Becker,

877
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:19,140
the benefit of living in a marriage

878
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:25,140
Did you receive my e-mail?
needs to be bigger than living alone

879
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:29,530
I will be there. Okay, see you soon.
in order for people to marry, he said.

880
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:37,340
- You're here, our baby.
- Oppa!

881
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:39,840
Yup, put on the seat belt.

882
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:41,770
It's so cold.

883
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:44,400
Nice style today. Kind Ms. Woo Soo Ji (parody of movie title, "Lady Vengeance" aka "Kind Ms. Geum Ja" in Korean.)

884
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,170
Now, let's go!

885
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:52,470
What? You're leaving for a business trip tomorrow?

886
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:53,960
Surprise!

887
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,370
I was going to do that so I kept it a secret. Hong Kong. Three o'clock flight.

888
01:12:57,370 --> 01:12:59,950
What? You're on the same flight as me.

889
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:02,010
Crazy, right? What is your seat number?

890
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:05,670
Let's go and switch our seats so we can go next to each other, okay?

891
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:09,830
Of course. I'm almost near the very front. EA. Oppa?

892
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:15,780
EA up very front. Oh, I see.

893
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:18,480
I'm on the wing side.

894
01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:24,570
So not in the business class then.

895
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:29,860
Of course. Compared to our CEO Woo who's bringing in five million dollars in annual sales,

896
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:32,450
I can't match you.

897
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:37,440
Plus I've always preferred the wing side anyway. When I eat chicken, I only eat chicken wings too.

898
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,070
Whuang!

899
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:46,550
Let's go.

900
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:49,050
- Oppa.
- Yes?

901
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:51,320
Should we use our mileages together?

902
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,710
My mileage. It'd be nice for you to use them too for business trips.

903
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:56,310
You can upgrade your seat too.

904
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:58,740
Oh. That would be super great for me, of course.

905
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:01,410
But I think that's only allowed between family members.

906
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:03,570
Oh, right?

907
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:06,110
Then should we just do it? Get married?

908
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:12,000
- Do what?
- Why? You don't want to?

909
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,170
Why wouldn't I want to? I'd love to.

910
01:14:16,170 --> 01:14:19,800
But you disliked the institution of marriage.

911
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:23,970
And how can we get married over stuff like mileage?

912
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:26,290
Stuff like mileage?

913
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:29,020
For the past few years, in order to save hotel costs,

914
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:32,520
I slept like a homeless person in the airport seats in order to save up this mileage. It's like gold to me.

915
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:36,050
Did you think I just easily came up with the idea of sharing that mileage with you?

916
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:39,660
How much I must love you to have that thought!

917
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:41,090
- Soo Ji.
- Forget it!

918
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:42,950
I think it's only me who gets the short end of the stick.

919
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:44,990
Not getting married!

920
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:49,970
And to think I even brought our son today. You poopy head!

921
01:14:54,010 --> 01:15:01,700
♫ When we are together I smile without knowing  ♫

922

Honey (spouse)! Let's go together. Forever!

925
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:19,120
However, Writer Goethe said,

926
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:23,990
there is nothing like marriage

927
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:28,000
that one's essential happiness hangs by.

928
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,540
Goethe said this.

929
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:34,040
Married life

930
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:36,510
is the beginning of dating.

932
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:50,480
♫ I'm in (love you, love you, love you) love with you every day ♫

933
01:16:11,190 --> 01:16:12,720

934
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,020
All done writing? (casual speech)

935
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:30,910
Nope. Not yet. (casual speech)

936
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:34,920
I'll just watch the broadcast and I'll have to stay up all night again later.

937
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,180
Hmm.

938
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,910
Do you want a beer?

939
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:59,550
We registered our marriage three years ago.

940
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:02,220
Along with registering our marriage,

941
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:05,920
we rewrote our contract, too.

942
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:10,870
As we both paid half the lease, this house is under both names.

943
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:14,600
Any matters regarding the house shall be decided by mutual agreement.

944
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:18,300
- Do you have any objections?
- I don't!

945
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:25,290
On holidays, we will each go to our family's home and spend time there, apart.

946
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:30,090
- This one is a bit...
- Why?

947
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:31,620
Do you have a problem with it?

948
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:33,880
Won't this be difficult?

949
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:39,280
Korean tradition, to split up like this to visit on holidays,

950
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,380
I think it will be difficult for our families to understand.

951
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:44,350
Because it's not a visit. It's forced labor,

952
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:46,540
and you endured it during our last holiday.

953
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:49,250
Afterwards, we were both sorry to each other

954
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:52,010
and felt awkward, for an entire week.

955
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:56,280
I don't want to experience that with you ever again, Ji Ho.

956
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:01,610
And what is so important about Korean tradition, anyway?

957
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:04,740
Our tradition is what is most important.

958
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:07,910
Okay. Call.

959
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:11,720
It is something that conflicts with our "primary objective," after all.

960
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,510
The next one...

961
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:17,420
We renew our contract every year

962
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:22,410
but our "primary objective" is always the same.

963
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:24,740
That our love

964
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:27,430
comes first, before anything else.

965
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:31,790
- Call.
- Call.

966
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:35,590
I admit that this isn't usual, of course.

967
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:39,520
After our first holiday when we split up to visit each of our family homes

968
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,680
Mother-in-law called me and cried over the phone.

969
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:47,930
And my father flipped the table over.

970
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:53,020
But that was all.

971
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:57,890
Not much else happened.

972
01:18:57,890 --> 01:19:03,350
We just became the "psycho couple" in other people's eyes,

973
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:08,350
and as a result, we were able to be faithful to the lives we wanted to live.

974
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:12,400
Married or unmarried,
