Yes.

17
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,870
What did you say?

18
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,640
Let's break up, I said.

19
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,470
Let's break up.

20
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,520
Why?

21
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,010
I asked why.

22
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,060
I don't have the confidence.

23
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,350
The confidence to make you happy.

24
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,310
What dog crap is that?

25
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,610
Are you saying some play line here?

26
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,390
Don't put on that dog air, Sim Won Seok!

27
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,280
It's not dog crap and not air either.

28
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,720
I mean it.

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,030
I really want to stop this now.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,020
So you think about it earnestly too and call me.

31
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,560
I'll be at Sang Goo Hyung's for now.

32
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,500
Hey, you!

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,250
Should you be saying that now?

34
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,140
What? You don't have the confidence?

35
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,810
As if dating for seven years isn't enough, you said to wait another five years!

36
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,730
But . . .

37
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,590
Come now and you say you don't have the confidence?

38
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,350
That's why you shouldn't wait!

39
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,090
Was it seven years of dating for you only?

40
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,630
I did too! I dated for seven years too, just the same as you did!

41
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,160
But why do you always talk like you're the only one who's suffered some loss?

42
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,090
Why do you always talk like you're the only one who has waited? Why?

43
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,150
Hey! For the likes of getting married, I quit all the things I wanted to do.

44
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,120
I gave up my dream!

45
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,330
Day after day, stifling to death!

46
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,460

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,470

I just went to the mart downstairs to buy some barley for tea.

It's cold, Mom. Let's go inside.

Are you going around eating at least?

After getting married, it's my first time coming to your room.

63
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,810
You're right.

64
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,500
If I had known, I would've done some cleaning.

65
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,360
No, it's nice.

69
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,630
I smell?

70
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,480
What?

71
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,010
No.

72
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,310
No.

73
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,960
To Room Nineteen?

74
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,480
Oh, that's

75
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,900
a book I liked when I was in college.

76
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,720
Lately, I thought of it again so I'm reading it.

77
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,430
May I ask what the story is about?

78
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,230
There's a husband and wife.

79
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,770
They are a perfect couple.

80
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,300
Even when others see them, they lack nothing.

81
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,570
They, themselves, are also happy in their life.

82
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,940
A family that's full and happy.

83
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:09,760
But then one day, the wife suddenly wanted to have her own space.

84
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:17,040
So the husband made a room for the wife upstairs.

85
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,630
"Mother's Room."

86
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,940
He named it.

87
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,790
But then somehow

88
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:33,670
the kids start to frequent the room and with the family members going in and out,

89
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,510
that room also becomes yet another living room.

90
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,200
So what happens to the wife?

91
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,970
So that wife, at a cheap hotel far away from home,

92
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,520
she gets a room without the family knowing.

93
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,750
And every now and then, for a few hours at a time, she stays in that room alone.

94
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,560
Doing nothing.

95
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:13,110
Just being inside the room gave her happiness.

96
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:22,720
Since that room is a perfect space that's all hers alone.

97
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:31,550
Since being married means your time and space alone disappear.

98
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,060
Just the fact that another person isn't there could bring her happiness.

99
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,880
Plenty.

100
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,030
It's a good story.

101
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,900
It's also a sad story.

102
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:56,680
Actually, while reading that book, I thought of you.

103
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,880
You said that.

104
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:08,120
That the only things you can be responsible for are this house and Kitty

105
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,530
and yourself only.

106
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,310
So that's why you weren't getting married.

107
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,150
At the time, those words were very relatable to me

108
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:25,440
since I was also in a situation where I could only be responsible for this one room alone.

109
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,030
But you know . . . if you live like that,

110
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,330
won't you be lonely?

111
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:46,650
Have you never thought you were lonely?

112
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,350
I'm not sure.

113
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:57,900
I think I've been living life without thinking of loneliness altogether.

114
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,810
Being alone is better than enduring and knocking into people.

115
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,530
I had lived life with that thought.

116
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,400
I wanted to ask him.

117
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,010
In life, loving once,

118
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,060
is plenty.

119
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:24,000
That one love, did it already pass?

120
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,320
And if it did pass,

121
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,400
to you, is there no more love to start?

122
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,150
Should we sleep now?

123
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,930
It's late.

124
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,680
Yes.

125
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,320
I think I should go get my pillow.

126
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,740
Yes.

127
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,470
Yeah, I think so too.

128
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,280
Maybe I should've at least had some alcohol?

129
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,970
No. What alcohol when you're not a kid?

130
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,670
Right?

131

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,380
♫ To someone like me emotions  ♫

168
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,010
♫ of love are useless things.  ♫

169
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,890
♫ Though I say no to love and it passes by  ♫

170
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:31,960
♫ When you're before me, I want to hold your hand ♫

171
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:39,330
♫ Everything's fine and I want to love  ♫

172
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:44,020
♫ I become wanting to love  ♫

173
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,850
Give me.

174
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,990
You should stay a few more days.

175
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,340
It's alright. Are you the only one who works?

176
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,580
I work too, you know!

177
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,540
Mom, can you quit working now?

178
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,270
What's this useless talk again?

179
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,780
You know the place I've been paying installments for in Munraedong? They said I can move in next year.

180
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:26,930
So next year, come to Seoul and let's live together. Okay?

181
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,310
If you want to live with me so bad, you come to Namhae then.

182
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,780
Don't keep on only joking around.

183
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,920
How long are you going to be going back and forth from Seoul to Namhae like this?

184
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,190
Do I walk around? The bus picks me up right in front and back. What?

185
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,560
Go now.

186
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,750
What are you talking about? Hurry and get in.

187
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,960
It's alright. I can just take the subway. It goes all the way to the terminal without needing to transfer.

188
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,270
What subway? Hurry and get in, and stop being so stubborn.

189
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,500
I heard all about you getting cursed at by your manager earlier.

190
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,080
Hurry and go to work now.

191
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,360
Mom!

192
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,950
I'll escort you.

193
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,840
Hello, Mother. I am Woo Soo Ji's boyfriend, Ma Sang Goo.

194
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,290
Boyfriend?

195
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,580
I didn't know she had a boyfriend though.

196
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,120
Well, she tends to be reserved

197
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,240
so I thought I should say hi to you first, and I came like this.

198
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,950
Great big height too.

199
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,100
Our Soo Ji holds her own in height too.

200
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,830
How is it that you're just so compatible?

201
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,760
Since I was little, I was not picky about food and I loved spinach.

202
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,150
So, not funny.

203
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:52,210
It looks like Soo Ji is late for work today. Mother, I'll take you.

204
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,300
Come, get in, please.

205
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,650
Never mind.

206
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,850
I will take her.

207
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,910
Where? That car?

208
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,750
Yes.

209
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,080
Mother, give that to me. I will.

210
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,000
Mom!

211
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,740
You hurry and go to work now.

212
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,410
Soo Ji takes after you so much.

213
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,680
How? She doesn't look like me one bit.

214
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,160
She looks like a fruit bowl. And me, just the look of a beauty.

215
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,550
Soo Ji doesn't compare to me when I was young.

216
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:31,460
No, even now, it seems like you're the one who's more beautiful.

217
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,860
But what do you do?

218
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:41,000
Oh, I represent a company that's in developing social networking app.

219
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,070
Our main service is called Gyeolmalrae, an app for making matches.

220
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,170
So how should I explain this. Um . . .

221
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,160
Oh, Ji Ho's husband. You know him, right? I'm the CEO of that company.

222
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,360
- Oh, Ji Ho's husband?
- Yes.

223
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,930
You're the president of that company, you said?

224
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:00,040
Yes. He's my closest friend and I'm the CEO of that company.

225
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,500
Then you're also a '80 birther?

226
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,170
Yes, I'm 38 this year. Yes.

227
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,100
That's more than I thought.

228
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,300
Well, as long as you're younger than me!

229
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:22,340
But you're not younger than me, right, Mother?

230
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,770
Just a moment.

231
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,240
Yes.

232
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,600
Very . . .

233
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,360
beautiful night, it is.

234
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,380
I'm all slept out for the night.

235
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,630
I just slept like that?

236
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,580
Is this for real right now?

237
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,710
That golden opportunity.

238
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,110
How did I shoot a suicide goal (own goal)?

239
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,350
I'm going to work first because there's some work I need to do.

240
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,690
Please have breakfast.

241
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,570
Breakfast?

242
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:35,020
He put raw onions in here.

243
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,050
Does he like raw food?

244
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,070
Let's Eat 2

245
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,800
Script: Hwang Se Hee
Producer: Gye Yong Seok

246
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,190
The bus is arriving shortly.

247
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,910
New Drama "Let's eat 2" Promo Event

248
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,110
This stop is . . .

249
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,810
Director Gye Yong Seok, aiming for both the ratings and quality of the drama.

250
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,250
Writer Hwang Se Hee, this project is culmination of 15 years of writing.

251
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,480
Sorry.

252
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,250
You're here.

253
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,500
Noona, do you know this person?

254
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,150
Go Jeong Min, CEO, My Entertainment

255
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,470
Who is it?

256
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,130
I don't know, of course.

257
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,990
Someone came and left this for you yesterday after you left, before we closed shop.

258
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,240
They said you'd know if you saw it.

259
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,990
A man or a woman?

260
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,620
A man. He said he'd call you.

261
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,240
T-bone steak? How would you like your steak done?

262
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,110
What do you want?

263
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,690
Please make it medium rare.

264
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,020
Okay, we'll make it medium rare for you.

265
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,760
If there's anything you need, please tell me.

266
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,800
Set up Table 14.

267
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,360
Okay.

268
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,160
I think our Manager has a cold.

269
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,250
- Really?
- Yeah.

270
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,320
Ever since earlier she had a runny nose

271
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,340
and her eyes are red, too.

272
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,740
Where are you? I'm really angry.

273
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,900
Hey, Sim Won Seok. Hurry up and go home.

274
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,070
Answer your phone immediately.

275
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,330
What are you doing?

276
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,920
Seok, please answer your phone.

277
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,180
Do you really want to be over now?

278
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,340
It's already been read and no response.

279
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,790
He read it, but he won't respond.

280
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,990
Glam
"I want to get married." 33 years old. Accountant. I am not into casual dating, I want someone I could marry.

281
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,370
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

282
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,150
I'm going to go to the restroom for a bit.

283
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,420
Is your weekend going well?

284
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,130
Your profile picture looked really pretty and kind, so I was curious about what type of person you are...

285
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,660
Ah, thank you.

286
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,320
For some reason, I think we're going to get along very well.

287
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,540
I see. You seem like a good person, too.

288
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:33,560
"I want to get married."

289
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,900
" I am not into casual dating, I want to find someone I could marry."

290
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,220
I understand, so please talk.

291
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,810
Even if you want to end it. We should see our faces one last time and end it.

292
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,440
Then, meet me after work at the usual spot.

293
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,830
Today's Special
Aricha coffee

294
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,830
Go Jeong Min

295
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,470
Who can do what they want from the very beginning?

296
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,330
Only successful people can do what they want.

297
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,740
Have you never liked me, Writer?

298
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,800
Stop it.

299
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,090
Stop it, Director. Director!

300
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,060
Wait!

301
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,830
Since we're all precious here, we're trying our best not to break this teamwork.

302
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,290
This is your best, Writer?

303
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,930
Since I wasn't bleeding and look fine, are you telling me to just move on like nothing happened?

304
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,580
You forcibly dragged me all the way here and you're telling me this is you trying your best?

305
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,160
Even though the person is in so much pain from all that bleeding?

306
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,930
Writer Yoon. Do you think this is some college club meeting?

307
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,660
If you're so whiny about something this small,

308
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,630
how can you make any dramas?

309
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,730
That's why, I'm

310
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,160
not going to make dramas anymore.

311
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,850
I'm never doing it again.

312
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,180
Thank you.

313
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,120
Aricha is one of my favorites.

314
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,360
I thought the CEO was a man.

315
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,020
Are you disappointed because it's me?

316
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,650
No. That's not what I mean.

317
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,980
Honestly, I was a bit surprised.

318
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,520
I understand.

319
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,290
I didn't know it would've been you, the one with pretty earrings.

320
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,030
Is this destiny?

321
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,600
Anyway, it was our director that stopped by here.

322
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,620
He said that he sent many texts but there was no response to any of them.

323
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,880
Oh, yes.

324
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,070
The cafe has been busy lately.

325
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,910
But how did you know...

326
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:04,180
Oh, the director called you

327
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,540
and the other employee picked it up.

328
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,580
He told us that you were working here.

329
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,610
Oh.

330
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,980
Officially, I would like to introduce myself.

331
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,590
After reading your script, I came here.

332
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,710
I'm production company CEO Go Jung Min.

333
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,610
I happened to see the script you were working on with Director Park

334
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,510
about the student hostel.

335
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:45,630
I wondered what kind of person you were and I wanted to see you.

336
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,270
I mean to be specific.

337
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,300
I wanted to work with you, Writer.

338
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:00,330
I... I'm not doing any more drama.

339
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:04,530
It's been a while since I quit my job as an assistant writer.

340
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,590
I'm sorry.

341
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,170
Did you only quit being an assistant writer, or did you quit writing completely?

342
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:27,360
I came here because I wanted to work with you.

343
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,140
Hello Soo Ji.

344
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,760
Seatbelt.

345
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,410
Yes.

346
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:07,500
Are you not writing anymore?

347
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,590
I'm sorry.

348
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,520
Writing too… I don't do it anymore.

349
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,430
Can I ask for a reason why?

350
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,600
I'm married.

351
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,410
Since I'm married, I decided to quit.

352
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:34,240
I'm just working here part time because staying at home was too boring.

353
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,830
I see. You're married.

354
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,410
Yes.

355
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,030
I'm sorry since you came all the way here.

356
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,450
Then...

357
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,540
Enjoy your drink and have a nice day.

358
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,800
However, Writer.

359
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:11,300
Why does that reason sound like a sad one to me?

360
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,040
I enjoyed the coffee.

361
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:31,710
If you want don't want to give me that excuse and give me the truth,

362
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,110
contact me whenever.

363
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:40,690
Even if we don't work together, we can always have a drink.

364
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,260
Why are you so mad?

365
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,020
What are you doing?

366
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,490
What do you mean? In place of my busy girlfriend,

367
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:45,310
I sent my girlfriend's mother home.

368
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,410
So what?

369
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,480
Is this CEO Ma's type of dating?

370
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,410
Barging into the parts of someone's personal life that they don't want to show you?

371
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,560
Making someone miserable by doing that?

372
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,340
Miserable?

373
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,610
People who love each other meeting each other's family,

374
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,670
knowing each other's situation.

375
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,190
How can you call such a normal thing miserable?

376
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,680
It makes me miserable!

377
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,390
Normal?

378
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,560
Do you know what a repulsive word that is to me?

379
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,030
"What do your parents do? Are you parents doing well?"

380
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:30,600
In this world, those types of "normal" questions are what I hate the most.

381
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,480
And then you would be like this.

382
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,560
"Why are you taking it so twisted? They could do that if they didn't know."

383
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,550
But there are hundreds, thousands of people who say those kinds of things to me.

384
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,450
Do you know how it feels to live in this world?

385
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,000
That's why I want to live together.

386
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,560
In this world,

387
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,320
I said that I'll be by your side!

388
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,460
By my side?

389
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,780
How?

390
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:02,190
If we do get married, will you be able to live with my mother?

391
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,200
Answer me!

392
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,700
I'm asking if you can live like that!

393
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,100
I can just do it, why can't I?

394
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,740
Fine.

395
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,410
What are you going to say to your parents?

396
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,600
"A woman doesn't know who her father is

397
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,030
and who lives to take care of her disabled mother, that's the kind of woman I'm marrying."

398
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,440
Is that how you are going to introduce me?

399
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:44,860
My mom, with her disability, worked in a restaurant to raise me by herself.

400
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,700
Since I was lucky and was able to study well,

401
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,880
I got into a large corporation that gives good pay.

402
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:59,200
Finally, I am able to ask her to move in with me.

403
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,380
Unlike your kind where three generations are gathered and living together.

404
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,270
I don't know that kind of "normal" world.

405
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,250
My mom...

406
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,530
Someone to lean on when she's sick…

407
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,090
She has no one in this world but me.

408
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,760
Even when she dies she'll have no one but me to bury her.

409
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,960
That's the world I live in, CEO Ma.

410
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,620
So, don't give me any false hope.

411
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,730
If you are this warm to me,

412
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:54,990
I'll start to become greedy for a different world.

413
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:29,620
In "To Room 19," the main character eventually

414
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:36,370
has her secret room discovered by her husband.

415
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,680
And she lies to her husband

416
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,620
that she'd been having an affair.

417
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:53,570
At the time, my 20-year-old self couldn't understand the main character.

418
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,160
To tell such a big lie of having an affair.

419
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,810
Was keeping the room secret really that important?

420
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,960
I can understand that.

421
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,010
Because that room, the moment other people know about it, it no longer has meaning.

422
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:16,210
Still, how could she lie that she was having an affair?

423
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:24,280
"For a year now I've been spending all my days in a very sordid hotel room."

424
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,550
"It's the place where I'm happy. In fact, without it, I don't exist."

425
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:34,310
"She heard herself saying this, and understood how terrified he was that she might."

426
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,840
- You don't get it?
- No.

427
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:42,330
What it means is, rather than trying to explain something that her husband could never understand,

428
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,920
being mistaken for a crazy bitch was easier.

429
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,900
Actually, there are a lot of things in the world that are easier that way.

430
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,100
It's better to be a crazy wench than a pathetic wench.

431
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,520
Earlier, to that CEO . . .

432
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,530
Why did I reply like that?,

433
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,890
When she asked me if I wouldn't be writing anymore…

434
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:12,070
Why did I reply that I got married?

435
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,900
The bus will arrive shortly.

436
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,060
If you're going to keep crying like that, let's just talk later.

437
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,360
I'm not crying. I won't cry anymore.

438
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:00,150
Have you given yourself time to think about it?

439
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,270
Yeah.

440
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:13,800
I was wrong.

441
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,660
What did you do wrong?

442
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,120
For yelling and screaming at you.

443
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:28,490
You worked so hard to move that couch in, but I was only annoyed.

444
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:34,770
Also, for giving you pressure for asking you to marry me Also, for—

445
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:37,620
So if we date again, what changes?

446
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,650
What?

447
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:45,800
If we date again, are you not going to ask to get married anymore?

448
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,930
If you don't like it,

449
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,650
- I won't ask anymore.
- That's not the problem right now!

450
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:01,330
You just want to get married, so why are you hiding that fact for me?!

451
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,460
I'm not hiding it.

452
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,880
- I just want to marry you because it's with you—
- Are you sure you want to do it with me?

453
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,490
Are you confident? Are you that confident about your heart?

454
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,760
What are you saying? What's wrong with you?

455
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,480
You contacted another guy.

456
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,700
I saw it.

457
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,850
How you were chatting with another guy on my company's dating app.

458
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,800
I... I was just trying it out.

459
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,100
I just installed it because you work for that company now. However, I got a message first, so I—

460
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,930
Still, you talked to someone.

461
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,890
- I was just messing around. There was no meaning behind it.
- Why is there nothing to it?

462
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:43,770
You want to get married and chatted with a guy looking for a girl to marry.

463
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,310
But still, you're telling me it meant nothing?

464
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:50,770
- No. My heart wasn't being sincere.
- Heart?

465
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,800
Your heart was relating to facts, actually.

466
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,440
For months, how were we like?

467
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,510
As soon as you opened your mouth, it was marriage and as soon as I opened my eyes, I was busy running away.

468
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:05,710
You were always pressuring me…

469
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,510
and I couldn't fill you.

470
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,710
That's a fact and how we feel.

471
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:19,840
Plus, how you replied to that man is also what's in your heart.

472
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:26,330
I would also like you to be honest with your heart from now on.

♫ On marrying ♫

474
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,350
Let's just call it quits now.

475
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:38,420
It's also hard for me.

476
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,440
I'll move my things out when you're not in.

No, Seok.

479

Don't go. Please don't go.

480
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,170
How can I live without you?

481
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,680
How can I live without you?

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,930
How can I live alone?

00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:11,880
How can I go into that house without you?

485
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,070
Please don't go.

486
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:22,220
Without you, I'll die.

487
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,980
♫ Pick sharp words  ♫

488
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,720
♫ Say them harshly  ♫

489
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,280
Without me, you won't die.
♫ We become strangers ♫

490
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,530
It'll only be hard for a little bit.

491
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:36,370
You'll be fine soon.
♫ That's how my heart is ♫

492
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:41,240
♫ That's what I fear  ♫

493
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,320
♫ That's what's hard for me ♫

494
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:55,310
Did anything special happen today?

495
00:45:55,310 --> 00:46:00,010
Not really. It was peaceful just like any normal day.

496
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,740
What about you?

497
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:06,140
I also had a normal day.

498
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:16,200
Honestly, something did happen today.

499
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,010
Some production company's CEO came to find me.

500
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:32,930
A production company?

501
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:38,510
Yeah. For drama. She wanted to work with me, so she came to meet me.

502
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:42,250
Ah. Then are you going to write again?

503
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:45,650
No. It's not that.

504
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:52,140
I don't know what my heart wants yet.

505
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:58,580
It sounds like a man's name, right?
Go Jeong Min

506
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:02,010
Was the CEO a woman?

507
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:03,920
Yes.

508
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,620
A very strong woman.

509
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,530
She's strong but how should I say it?

510
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:18,030
That sturdiness isn't to break her surroundings but to embrace it.

511
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,460
She wasn't someone common, that CEO.

512
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:27,930
Even though she has a common name, like me.

513
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:34,750
Yeah. It's a common name.

514
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,180
Yeah, it's Ji Ho.

515
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:43,810
What? Really?

516
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:51,950
Rang.

517
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,400
I found her like this on some park bench and brought her home.

518
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,570
She said she had no strength in her legs to walk.

519
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:02,900
Rang. Ho Rang.

520
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,680
Let's go inside and rest.

521
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:12,140
Yeah, let's go inside. You'll get a cold.

522
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,880
I can't bring myself to go in.

523
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:21,640
I can't go into that room.

524
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,410
Oh, you actually came.

525
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:42,480
Oh? Oh! It's Se Hee Hyung!

526
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,440
It's Nam Se Hee!

527
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,650
See? See? I told you, he'd come right away if I called him, our Se Hee Hyung.

528
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:50,620
Did he drink a lot?

529
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,880
Yeah.

530
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,740
Have a glass, my mentor.

531
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,790
- Mentor?
- Of course!

532
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:01,380
It's no longer you, Hyung, but our Se Hee Hyung who's my mentor now.

533
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:06,220
Hey. What did he say to you? What did you say to him?

534
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:09,580
He told me to be honest.

535
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,070
The subjects of the sentences you just spoke,

536
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:15,740
they're all about yourself.

537
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:19,020
Your other half isn't the subject of your sentences.

538
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,200
So I tried changing the subject of my sentences.

539
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:28,000
Rang smiles because of me?

540
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:33,520
Maybe she and I are walking on parallel lines that will never touch.

541
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:39,390
Because of me, Rang was happy.

542
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:44,310
Won Seok, if I have to wait 5 more years, I'll be 35.

543
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,380
Are you saying we should date for 12 years?

544
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,800
Also, Rang can't live without me.

545
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,790
When I changed the subjects like that,

546
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,510
the answer was very simple.

547
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:03,340
The formula was wrong to begin with,

548
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:06,820
to get an answer.

549
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:12,680
For 7 years, I've chosen only the paths

550
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,020
that made me happy.

551
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,220
Life's too long.

552
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,180
You have to go through too many things.

553
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,700
I know, right?

554
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,540
It's only going to get worse, isn't it?

555
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,560
You look disturbed today too.

556
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:02,460
I... Today a production company CEO came to find me.

557
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,910
She said she wants to work with me.

558
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,760
But then... I...

559
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,720
To the question about why I don't write anymore,

560
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:19,580
I answered, "I got married."

561
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:23,000
Why did I do that?

562
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:31,380
You just probably find it a hassle to explain.

563
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:37,420
Honestly, marriage is a good shield from society.

564
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,090
A safe and sturdy shield.

565
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:42,840
But then...

566
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:46,710
I thought for a moment that I was being cowardly.

567
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:49,530
Why to the extent of being cowardly?

568
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:53,240
There are times when you just want to go with the flow.

569
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:59,890
In life, there are times when you need a leg to lean on.

570
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:06,440
Woo Soo, do you also have times like those?

571
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,790
Where?

572
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,510
CEO Ma?

573
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:19,930
My legs are already 3 so there's no need for another pair.

574
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,250
Huh?

575
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:24,590
Since my mom's legs are mine.

576
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:27,430
I better call her.

577
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:38,070
Why did you tell this kid something so useless.

578
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,980
Honestly, it wasn't something I said.

579
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,720
You said that to me.

580
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:53,520
Twelve years ago.

581
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,570
Se Hee.

582
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,300
Humans are selfish animals anyway.

583
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:20,240
If you have lingering attachment to someone whose heart already left, it is also greed.

584
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,320
"I feel happy when I am with her." "I want to make her happy."

585
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,850
"I can't live without her." That's what you are right now.

586
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:36,350
But then... Jeong Min, it's not like that for her.

587
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:39,970
Even if she is with you, she is no longer happy.

588
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:43,720
Even without you it's livable.

589
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,640
That's why she left.

590
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:52,470
Ah. So that was here.

591
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,820
Time sure flies.

592
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,080
Hey, perhaps that time,

593
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,470
did something happen between you two?

594
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:08,380
You two just suddenly requested absence from school

595
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:11,550
Jeong Min didn't come back and just disappeared all of a sudden.

596
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:15,010
Now that I think about it, it's a bit...

597
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:22,660
Perhaps, since then, have you heard news about her?

598
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,120
None, of course.

599
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,300
No, she cut ties with all her friends.

600
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,370
Ah! I think I heard something about her going to the US.

601
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,840
Hey, you can't throw up there.

602
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,780
Hey, stay still. Do it in the restroom.

603
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,950
Get up.

604
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,690
Aigoo.

605
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,480
Hold it in.

606
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,090
CEO Go Jeong Min.

607
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,680
Will you be okay not eating anything?

608
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,630
I'm fine.

609
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:12,750
I will be going in first.

610
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,780
Sleep on the bed and not on the floor.

611
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,020
What about Won Seok?

612
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:49,030
I am taking care of him.

613
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,440
Soo Ji.

614
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:02,790
After I saw the text from your mother, I ran to your house secretly

615
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:06,020
in case you would be meeting another man.

616
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:09,110
I ran up the stairs like a lunatic.

617
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:14,020
So pathetic, right?

618
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:20,850
As you said, I must really not know your world very well.

619
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,960
I just grew up ordinarily without much hardship.

620
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,560
That's why, honestly, I find you difficult.

621
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:36,030
Your prickliness is heavy sometimes.

622
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:40,230
But you know,

623
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,020
I must really like you a lot.

624
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,760
Even though your prickliness is piercing me,

625
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,190
even though it hurts so much.

626
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,670
If only that would make it better, even if I get pricked,

627
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,040
then it's such a relief.

628
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:06,430
That's what I thought.

629
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,700
Like today, out of nowhere all of a sudden

630
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,580
I won't look into your room.

631
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:18,760
And also, I won't act as if I know everything about your world.

632
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:23,930
And you too should

633
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:31,260
stand properly in front of the world.

634
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:37,820
The way I see it, you have never faced the world properly.

635
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:42,920
You always run away or fight.

636
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:46,800
You use the company as an excuse and your mom as your shield.

637
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,650
You lived only criticizing the world.

638
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:55,140
For once, grab and stand in front of the world properly

639
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:59,520
and face it head on. That's what I think you should do.

640
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,160
And if you start,

641
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,830
I will be by your side ready to hang in there for you.

642
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:07,420
Okay?

643
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:16,850
So charismatic, Ma Sang Goo.

644
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:24,450
Aigoo. It's a bit scary to be scolded twice in a day, so

645
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:27,290
for today, I will stop here and go back.

646
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:29,630
Then see you again, Ms. Woo Soo Ji

647
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,470
Goodbye.

648
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:35,420
Aigoo. Woo Soo Ji is the scariest in the whole world.

649
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:54,410
He's a character I can't get a grasp of.

650
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:08,490
To everyone, we all have our own Room #19.

651
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:17,380
No matter how close you are, a room where you don't want to get caught.

652
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:32,700
But then, why do you sit on the floor since last time?

653
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,220
Huh?

654
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:40,800
I am used to sitting on the floor

655
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,460
so this is more comfortable.

656
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:45,880
But then, why did you continue to sit on the sofa?

657
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,740
Back then, to do so

658
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:55,570
this house was uncomfortable.

659
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,800
And you too.

660
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,870
You were uncomfortable.

661
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:10,080
No matter how comfortable you have become

662
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,980
a room where you can't invite anyone in.

663
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:16,270
Sleep well.

664
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:19,170
Yes. You too.

665
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,270
Earlier, because it was a bit chaotic.

666
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:27,710
Ah, that's right.

667
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,800
That... Ji Ho.

668
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,420
Yes.

669
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:36,390
Dramas, though I don't know much about them.

670
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:41,260
You are not hesitating to do it because of this marriage, right?

671
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:46,170
- Pardon?
- So just in case,

672
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,530
if this marriage would block your future

673
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:52,780
I hope that won't be the case.

674
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,530
As promised,

675
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:59,310
to you,

676
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:01,860
I don't want to be a hindrance.

677
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:07,540
Yes.

678
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:12,400
I understand what you are saying.

679
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:14,990
Yes.

680
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:31,900
Today, that person and I, for some reason...

681
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:36,780
Go Jeong Min

682
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:42,770
I think it's a day when we need to rest in our own Room #19.

683
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:49,460
♫ Stay with me ♫

684
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:55,360
Turtle Test-Taker's Hostel

685
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:14,950
Ho Rang, what do you want for breakfast?

686
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:41,170
You were home.

687
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:45,250
I just dropped by for a while to pack my things.

688
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:49,620
Why would you be the one packing? I should be the one to leave.

689
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,930
I thought about it.

690
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:54,840
And I think it would be better if I leave.

691
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,160
You can just stay here.

692
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:03,460
No... Why would you be the one leaving? You were the one who gave the deposit.

693
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:06,100
Later.

694
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:10,110
When the lease is over. Deposit it to my account then.

695
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:25,530
Ho Rang.

696
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:35,910
You're okay, right?

697
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:40,510
Yeah.

698
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:44,920
I'm much better now.

699
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:49,400
Okay. That's a relief.

700
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,750
I'm leaving.

701
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,910
What you said was right.

702
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:19,570
I'm going to be true to my heart now.

703
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:34,990
♫ To look forward toward other things  ♫

704
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:39,260
♫ isn't as easy as said.  ♫

705
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:42,680
♫ I can't even put my hand to it.  ♫

706
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:47,300
♫ Like today, though I endure a day  ♫

707
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:54,460
♫ living through every day that keeps coming back ♫

708
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:58,770
♫ and like a fool repeating these things ♫

709
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:02,620
♫ And I stand alone on one side again ♫

710
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:09,600
♫ Just in case somehow tomorrow might be different ♫

711
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:13,040
4F MY Entertainment

712
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:17,740
It's time to be true to myself.

713
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,040
Yes?

714
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:43,720
I want to write.

715
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:48,040
I want to write something good.

716
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,660
As to the what your direction is in work,

717
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:54,370
I still don't know.

718
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:01,290
I want to try to tell a good story.

719
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:04,690
That is my direction.

720
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:08,150
For the writer to tell the story that they want.

721
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:17,650
But then, there is one thing I need to settle first.

722
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:19,600
What is it?

723
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:25,860
Did you have a contract somewhere else?

724
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:31,430
No. There was something that happened that prompted me to stop writing.

725
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:40,230
I was almost sexually assaulted by the assistant director I used to work with.

726
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:49,740
I want to settle that first.

727
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:55,080
And also, I want to write.

728
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:02,930
If so... that would be good.

729
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:05,360
How do you want to settle it?

730
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:08,720
I came here to discuss how to go about that

731
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:13,230
since I don't know the ways to settle it.

732
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:16,350
That is, There are two ways to settle it.

733
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:19,370
There's the somewhat complicated lawsuit method.

734
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:23,940
If not, then there is simply making it disappear.

735
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:26,380
Disappear?

736
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,710
Yes. I normally chose the latter.

737
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:32,380
My employees also do those things.

738
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:36,000
Them? How?

739
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,230
Well, all of a sudden, kill them off by surprise.

740
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:43,790
If not kill them with laughter.

741
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:48,040
Ahh, there is also kill by frustration.

742
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,520
Since I already cracked a joke, let's talk as we eat.

743
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,000
Yes.

744
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:08,500
But then, CEO, you really can't joke.

745
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:14,130
I always heard that was my charm.

746
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,760
Yes.

747
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,770
- I'm here.
- Oh! Welcome.

748
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:38,890
They don't have a menu board in here. Can I just order as I wish, Writer?

749
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:40,570
Yes, of course. I'm fine with it.

750
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:43,600
Uncle, we will have spring onion pancake and whelk soup.

751
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,990
And rice wine, three bottles.

752
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:47,460
Three bottles?

753
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,940
Ahh. I'm sorry.

754
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:52,860
Uncle! Four bottles!

755
01:08:56,950 --> 01:08:58,270
Tada.

756
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:09,430
Writer, you drink deliciously.

757
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:14,910
The drink is delicious today. Maybe it's because it's after a long while.

758
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:17,940
Don't you drink with your husband?

759
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:20,880
Ahh. My husband.

760
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:26,320
We only drink beer while we watch soccer.

761
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:30,660
He's a unique person.

762
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:33,460
I have never seen him drunk.

763
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:37,310
You must have been very careful with each other even though you are a married couple.

764
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:41,270
Yes, that's right. We are very careful.

765
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:46,800
He and I each have our own Room #19.

766
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,600
Room #19?

767
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,500
Yes.

768
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,900
A place where we don't cross.

769
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:59,390
Ahh. That's nice, a relationship like that.

770
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:00,470
Really?

771
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:02,170
Of course.

772
01:10:02,170 --> 01:10:05,000
Even married couples need something like that.

773
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,010
When you love, all the more you have things you have to protect.

774
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,740
CEO, why are you not married?

775
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:20,580
Pardon? Me?

776
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,280
Yes.

777
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:26,200
Well, you are so pretty and strong.

778
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,640
I'm just wondering why you aren't married yet.

779
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,830
I'm just curious.

780
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:34,870
Maybe all the more because I am married.

781
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:39,630
Was it a rude question?

782
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:44,480
No. I was also curious about that when I was young.

783
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,980
"That Unni, why is she not married at her age?"

784
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:53,180
That time, I thought marriage would happen eventually for sure.

785
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:03,960
I did it once, something like a marriage.

786
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:10,400
I once lived with someone who was a CC (campus couple) when I was in college.

787
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:13,470
Living together?

788
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,680
Whoa. That's cool.

789
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,660
Well, it wasn't that kind of a cool living together.

790
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:26,700
As we dated, and we got pregnant.

791
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:31,530
That's why we lived together with the thoughts of marriage.

792
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:37,400
Aren't you curious as to what happened after?

793
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:42,220
Yes. Honestly.

794
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:49,160
When we lost the baby, we broke up.

795
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:53,010
His family also opposed it.

796
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:03,040
My, because you're so transparent, I'm becoming transparent too.

797
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:07,460
This is why I should not drink with someone like you.

798
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:15,400
I asked a needlessly rude question.

799
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,220
That's okay.

800
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:20,770
This is a benefit of growing old.

801
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:24,930
Hurt, too, is a memory now.

802
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:33,910
Here.

803
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:40,170
Somehow, I may have known that time.

804
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,160
Should we have a drink?

805
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:56,950
That this person is his Room #19.

806
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,380
And also...

807
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:04,390
♫ With air that is different from yesterday's ♫

808
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:08,590
♫ everything's changed ♫

809
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:13,740
Somehow he may have known too.

810
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:20,660
Someday, he would have to face that room.

811
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:32,400
I knew it the moment I saw you.

812
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,680
CEO is just my style.

813
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,900
Is that so? Thanks.

814
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:42,170
Since you said it like that,

815
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:44,860
I feel really good.

816
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:51,530
So, Writer. That bastard. Don't worry.

817
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:55,740
I will teach him a lesson. Bad jerk!

818
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:59,270
Those kinds of bastards. You just need to restrain him

819
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:03,900
and cut that part of his body so he can't function as a man.

820
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:09,670
CEO! You're crazy!

821
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:12,160
Crazy! CEO!

822
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:15,170
Writer! That hurts.

823
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:18,410
CEO, I think we're almost there.

824
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:22,870
Writer! Is this the right way?

825
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:24,140
Yes.

826
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,530
Oh! Here, here. You can just stop here.

827
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:28,930
Yes.

828
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,270
Writer, are you sure this is it?

829
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:39,700
CEO, honestly...

830
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:43,200
I need to use the restroom. I will go first.

831
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:55,370
She's such a good person.

832
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:59,670
She seems like a good person, right?

833
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:01,180
Yes.

834
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:06,970
Why do good people come all at once?

835
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:17,210
♫ With air that is different from yesterday's ♫

836
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:21,420
♫ everything's changed  ♫

837
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:25,540
♫ Me, with a different look from yesterday ♫

838
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:31,890
♫ where should I go?  ♫

839
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:42,970
Why is fate, sadly unpredictable?

840
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:50,410
Your and my Room #19

841
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:52,790
has opened.

842
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,580
♫ Like today though I endure a day  ♫

843
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:08,700
♫ Living through each day that keeps coming back  ♫

844
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:13,000
♫ Like a fool repeating things and I stand on one side alone  ♫

845
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,770
Should we sleep together today, too?

846
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:21,440
Go Jeong Min?

847
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:26,390
No matter how you say it she will be hurt.
- Since Ji Ho is a transparent person.

848
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:31,510
After having love, why does the hurt get bigger?

849
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:36,360
Does me being Ji Ho's husband have an effect on you with her writing?

850
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:38,460
I thought you were going to confess to Ji Ho.

851
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:42,690
You said all three were cheezy.
[CEO Ma, which is least cheezy to confess feelings? Shall we 1. get married now? 2. really become a married couple now? 3. really be together now?]

852
01:16:42,690 --> 01:16:44,320
What I was worried about was only one person.

853
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,140
Let's...
