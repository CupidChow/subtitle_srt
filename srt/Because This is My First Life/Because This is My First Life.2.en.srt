1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,210
Because This Is My First Life

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,110
Lee Min Ki

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,750
Jeong So Min

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,110
Esom
Park Byeong Eun

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,670
Kim Ga Eun
Kim Min Seok

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,040
Because This Is My First Life

7
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,810
Thank you for telling me about the neocortex.

8
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,970
I think this life is a bit of a failure,

9
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,390
but I'll still try my best.

10
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,440
I wish you the best of luck.

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,440
This life is everyone's first, anyway.

12
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,130
The buses have finished for tonight.

13
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,890
Let's eat.

14
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,550
I don't want to. Why do I have to spend my weekend with CEO Ma?

15
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,420
It's because I really want to try my best with her. But it seems like she's too shy to meet one-on-one.

16
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,910
What's awesome is that her friend is really pretty.

17
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,640
- You saw the picture I sent you, right? 
- I didn't.

18
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:26,460
I know you're going to eat a tasteless boxed lunch anyway. Why are you like this to me?

19
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,910
Why are you belittling my time like that?

20
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,200
CEO Ma, to humans like you, who are always desperate to be affirmed by others,

21
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,810
and who need to prove their self-worth through social connections, it may just be a tasteless boxed lunch,

22
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,710
but to me, it's an oasis-like existence.

23
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:47,730
Do you know how stressful it is to eat while listening to useless chatter from humans like you during meetings on the weekdays?

24
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,600
Oh, Se Hee. I made a mistake. I'm sorry, yeah?

25
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,540
I'll apologize and reset, format and reboot. Okay?

26
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,300
Stop interrupting the first quiet, peaceful lunch I've had in five days.

27
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,020
Ah yes. Of course.

28
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,410
That's a really important time. Really important. This conversation is finished, okay?

29
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:11,320
But, who was that new housemate of yours. Ji Ho?

30
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,440
I'm sure he wouldn't compare to you, but it looks like I'll just have to take him.

31
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,080
All my friends are busy—

32
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,680
You sure you don't want to? He's really nice.

33
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,880
No, I'm fine.

34
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
You know I'm bad at blind dates.

35
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,680
Hey, does it make sense that a drama writer has never dated before?

36
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,140
How can a woman who hasn't even kissed before write kiss scenes?

37
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,880
That's a story that should be aired on "TV Inside of TV."

38
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,330
Hey, that's such an old reference.

39
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,550
Also, kisses. They're not even a big deal.

40
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,190
What are you saying? How would you know what a kiss is like. You've never even dated.

41
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,260
What?

42
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,340
I mean... That...

43
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,680
I saw it a lot on shows like "TV Inside of TV." What are you talking about?

44
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,240
Ji Ho. You're not dating secretly, right?

45
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,510
No! No, I'm not. What do you mean?

46
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,770
Hey, Soo Ji. I have an incoming call. I'll call you later.

47
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,380
That was close.

48
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,720
Why did I mention that useless stuff out of nowhere?

49
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,920
What?
Tile Grout Repair

50
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,870
$10 USD

51
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,220
Whatever. I'll just think of it as a present I'm giving to the homeowner unni.

52
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,710
You acted natural.

53
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,490
Do you have to date to kiss someone? I've done it now too, kiss.

54
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,370
Is that something to gloat about? What a lady!

55
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,410
Good thing it was with someone I don't know.

56
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,450
The doors are opening.

57
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,140
Thank you.

58
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,100
The doors are closing. Floor 4.

59
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:24,120
This is the 4th floor.

60
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:38,460
Wait. That person... Kiss. Neocortex. Wait, why? Why is he...?

61
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:43,380
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Why is he getting off here?

62
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,410
That person... perhaps

63
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,540
lives here?

64
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,150
I forgot my wallet.

65
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,490
What do I do if I run into him again? No way.

66
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,280
Okay. Let's just go back home.

67
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,080
The house is the safest place for now.

68
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,140
This will do for now.

69
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,660
Since I'm inside the house, I'm safe now.

70
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,400
You can calm down. Don't get worked up.

71
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,180
Uh? It looks like the homeowner unni is home.

72
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,780
Your delivery is here.

73
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,400
Ah. If I'm living on the same floor as the neocortex guy...

74
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,900
No. There's no way. No matter how unlucky I am,

75
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,910
there's no way I could be living on the same floor out of all the homes in Seoul.

76
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,930
That's right. Let's ask the homeowner unni who lives on this floor. I'm sure she knows her neighbors.

77
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,230
Dang. This unni has really big feet.

78
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,250
275?! Is she Seo Jang Hoon (famous Korean basketball player) or something?

79
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,610
Hello! You were home—

80
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,280
Why are you... here?

81
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,060
- Episode 1 -
Because it was my first time kissing

82
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,010
Why are you... here?

83
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,020
That's something I should ask. How did you get in here?

84
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,760
Ah I...

85
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,430
Because this is Apt 401 and I live here.

86
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,950
No way.

87
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,280
Ah. I must've come into the wrong house.

88
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,950
I'm sorry. All of these houses are really similar.

89
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,040
Goodbye.

90
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,570
Se Hee (Homeowner Unni)

91
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,280
H-Hello?

92
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,340
Hello?

93
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,740
Yoon Ji Ho?

94
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,400
Yes?

95
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,350
Hot. Hot. Hot.

96
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,480
Hey, give me your foot.

97
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,820
What are you doing? It smells.

98
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,630
I've smelled them for 7 years. Why are you acting like this now?

99
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,700
See, it's all tense. What did I tell you?

100
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,260
I told you to sit down and rest in the bathroom, dummy.

101
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,590
Oh yeah. Is it today?

102
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,870
Today? What's today?

103
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,300
Is it some kind of day today?

104
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,710
Ah, that's not right. It was yesterday.

105
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,900
Yesterday? N-No, there wasn't anything yesterday.

106
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,970
I checked, there wasn't anything like an anniversary or anything special.

107
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,000
It wasn't an anniversary or anything.

108
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,690
It was the day my period ended.

109
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,830
Hey, Yang Ho Rang. Seriously...

110
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,450
What?

111
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,420
Why are you only telling me this now? You are dead meat.

112
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,130
Hey! I love this. Oh my!

113
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,810
I'm not going to let you go to work.

114
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,830
- Wait.
- Huh?

115
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,200
What?

116
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,840
- Yeah, Ji Ho?
- Yes, Hyung?

117
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,620
This is a mess. How can his housemate be a woman?!

118
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,520
What? What are you talking about?

119
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,850
What? The owner of the house is a man?

120
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,200
Yoon Ji Ho

121
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,170
Yoon Ji Ho

122
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,420
You said their name was Ji Ho, good-looking, and quit smoking.

123
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,560
Yes. This Ji Ho. She's really good looking.

124
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,210
She really quit smoking.

125
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,640
Are you messing with me right now?

126
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,430
Aren't you the one messing with me?

127
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,900
You said their name was Se Hee. A quiet person born in 1980 that lives with their cat

128
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,910
and is the person standing next to you.

129
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,100
That's right. He was born in 1980, he's usually quiet, and is raising a cat.

130
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,500
There. The person standing next to me is Se Hee.

131
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,200
That's Se Hee. No matter how much you look at it, that is a Se Hee.

132
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,620
No, Hyung.

133
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,590
From a logical stand point, who would expect a male to have a quiet personality and raise a cat?

134
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:08,300
The same goes for me. Who would expect a good-looking woman to quit smoking?

135
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,360
This is a big mess.

136
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,100
Ah, seriously.

137
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,650
We're doomed.

138
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,420
Ah, okay. Okay.

139
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,890
Nam Se Hee

140
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,460
Yoon Ji Ho

141
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,810
Here.

142
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,570
My friend said she'll take care of it and that she's very apologetic.

143
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,630
What can that person take care of exactly? We're the ones in this situation.

144
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,030
That's right.

145
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,810
Because of your name, I thought for sure you were a female.

146
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:08,730
I also know someone with the exact same name as yours. He was in my military troop.

147
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,440
Yes.

148
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:26,500
Then, since I have some things I need to do, I'll be leaving.

149
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,350
Yes.

150
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,660
Then, please contact me when you have things planned out.

151
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,360
Yes, I understand.

152
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,090
That's right. What you say is correct.

153
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,270
I should have at least eaten something.

154
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,280
I need to end my life.

155
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,140
- Ji Ho.
- Yeah?

156
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,190
Do you want some steak? I have some. I'll go back there and get some—

157
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,810
It's fine. I'm fine with this.

158
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,670
I'm sorry.

159
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,100
No. Does it make any sense?

160
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,000
Bong Hee and Ok Hee are all girl name's,

161
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,810
so how can a guy's name be so pretty?

162
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,200
Hey! Are all pretty names automatically girls?

163
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,760
That's true, since your name is Soo Ji.

164
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,870
Water? Water? Wait a minute.

165
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,590
That wench, seriously. Are you okay?

166
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:07,740
Soo Ji. You know the house owner.

167
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,170
Honestly, that guy...

168
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,270
- I...
- What? Did that guy try to hit on you?

169
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,690
What? That guy hit on you? Is he handsome?

170
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,990
- Is he tall?
- What's his income?

171
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,960
Forget it.

172
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,720
Hey, I know your captain lives in Namcheon-dong (Busan).

173
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,760
It's already a done deal with your captain.

174
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,900
Wow. This jjajangmyeong (black bean noodles) is delicious.

175
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,200
Ah, so what can I do?

176
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,100
I stood up a girl I'm kind of dating,

177
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,510
and now I'm here eating this black bean noodles in the office on the weekend.

178
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,460
What else can I do for you?

179
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,980
Fine. Just hit me. If this makes you less mad, then hit me until you release your anger.

180
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,910
No. Hitting me won't help. Here. Use this and just stab my artery. It will be a great stress reliever.

181
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,400
Try stabbing me!

182
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,860
No. Since you're such a detail-oriented person, why didn't you call her on the phone to check first?

183
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,840
You've very thorough.

184
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,740
Is that something that the CEO of this company should be asking right now?

185
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,970
Love is a science too. Instead of phone calls and instead of feelings, use data to date!

186
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,440
Instead of phone calls and instead of feelings, use data to date!

187
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:49,900
All the data was perfect. I checked their face through Facebook and more than anything, in carrying out the terms of the contract

188
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,020
from recycling to watching my cat, she was flawless.

189
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,780
You didn't have the category of 'female' in your initial set up. Is she pretty?

190
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,390
Pretty? What's this non-response?

191
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,950
I guess she is pretty.

192
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,160
I will be sleeping at my friend's house today.

193
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,290
- She's pretty, right? She's pretty.
- So you can rest assured.

194
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,260
She must be very pretty, right?! One hundred percent, she's pretty.

195
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,650
What about the director? Did he not contact you yet?

196
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,820
I know, right? Did he go on a vacation or something?

197
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,320
Hey, do you really trust him that much?

198
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,340
He's always using you and telling you that he'll use your scenarios.

199
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,050
Hello?

200
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,340
Yes, Team Leader?

201
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,200
Yes. I'll go back now and fix it.

202
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,090
Yes. Yes. Goodbye.

203
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,030
Aish, this bastard.

204
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,130
Is it the company?

205
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,190
Did they call you to go back?

206
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,230
That's what he's saying.

207
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,600
Honestly, I can do it tomorrow,

208
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,000
but I think I'll feel more comfortable if I do it today.

209
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,590
Yeah.

210
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,900
If there's something you need to do,

211
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,700
it's always better to do it today.

212
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,680
Right? Also, this is something I need to do sooner or later anyway.

213
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,980
It's not like someone else will do it for me if I put it off.

214
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,630
Ji Ho, I'll take you home, right?

215
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,800
Let me off here, Soo Ji.

216
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,000
There, by the bus stop.

217
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,840
Thanks!

218
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,400
If anything happens, call me.

219
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,700
If he tries to do something to you, I'll...

220
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,510
It was me who tried to do something.

221
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,250
I can't undo what I did by putting it off.

222
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,190
I...

223
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:34,190
think apologizing to you in person is more polite,

224
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,220
so I came.

225
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,380
At that time, at the bus stop...

226
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,060
when...

227
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,180
I kissed...

228
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,430
you.

229
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,090
I am very sorry. You must have been very shocked.

230
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,400
It was an offside.

231
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,600
What?

232
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,980
It wasn't any regular attack. It was something done when I wasn't able to defend,

233
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,590
which would be considered an offside.

234
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,630
Yes. You're right. Like you said, it was an offside kiss.

235
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,380
I am very sorry.

236
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,690
Yes.

237
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,240
Are you very mad?

238
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,000
- If I were you, I would also—
- One becomes mad when emotions are involved.

239
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,770
When a person gets unexpectedly attacked, they will feel flustered and unpleasant.

240
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,200
Attacked? Did you say attacked?

241
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,980
No, it was to that point.

242
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,680
That day, for doing that suddenly, it was because I was too intoxicated by the ambiance.

243
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,960
It was definitely not some cajolement.

244
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,960
It was never my intention to attack you. I'm being serious. Please believe me.

245
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:57,690
I know the right plot for the story is for me to leave right away now.

246
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,120
But honestly,

247
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,280
I don't have any place to go.

248
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,570
I'm just waiting on something. Once it finishes up,

249
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,170
I'll leave.

250
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,500
I'm really sorry.

251
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,980
Director, are you resting well?

252
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,240
I fixed up some things one more time from the scenario you said you liked.

253
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,760
Please don't feel burdened

254
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,100
and contact me!

255
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,630
Did he just lock the door?

256
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,200
Holy crap.

257
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,270
Hello?

258
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,960
Yes.

259
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,740
No! I wasn't sleeping.

260
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,420
- Dramas for Friday and Saturday?
- Yeah.

261
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:06,480
The people on top were asking for a fresh, youth romance drama actually.

262
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,030
Well, there's no reason not to do it, since you wrote so much.

263
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:16,260
I'm... I'm very thankful.

264
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,900
- Yong Seok.
- Yes?

265
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,400
You know that this is the first drama that you'll be directing.

266
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,290
You two should work hard together and

267
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,910
make a proper drama.

268
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,700
No matter how much I think about it, I think we should include

269
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,540
the back side story and secrets about the character.

270
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,320
Okay.

271
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,590
Also, the among the supporting roles, there is a student who wants to be a writer...

272
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,450
What is it?

273
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,380
No. Isn't it a little unrealistic for someone who graduated from Seoul National University with a degree in literature

274
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,900
to be a scenario writer?

275
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,910
Unrealistic?

276
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:04,560
Then why do people take a lot of exams just to be a director?

277
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:10,150
Ah, that's different. That's only studying to get a job.

278
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,500
For writers, what should I say...

279
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,270
It's like a dark tunnel that you never know where the end is.

280
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:20,640
Would a smart person who graduated from Seoul University do something so reckless?

281
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,030
Let's make a hit for our debut.

282
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,960
You should also try and become a star writer after this.

283
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,580
Fine. This is going to be the end of this tunnel.

284
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,810
I'm going to become one, too, a superstar writer.

309
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,120
I'm trying to fix my cost for next month.

310
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:53,030
Aigoo. How does someone like you have a tenant?

311
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:58,600
I don't think you're a species that can live with another human being.

312
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,480
It's because I need rent.

00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:08,040
If rent and pay are secure, I can pay back my loans within 12 years.

315
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,720
So?

316
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,800
If I want to retire at 50 years old, then I'll need to work 12 more years.

317
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,870
The average Korean lifespan is 81.1 years.

318
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:18,110
So I'd live in my home after it's paid off, for approximately 32 years.

319
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,810
While I'm living, I'll spend more time outside of my house anyway,

320
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:27,330
I might as well get rent so that I can achieve my goal of paying off my loans in the next 12 years.

321
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,470
I understand your goal,

322
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,430
but it looks like you don't have the rent for next month.

323
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,240
And that's because of who?

324
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,100
The Graduate

325
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,380
Reason for disqualification: failure to carry out duties

326
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,600
Reason for Disqualification: suspected alcoholism

327
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,610
Reason for disqualification: avid Chelsea fan

328
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,270
Reason for disqualification: yells at cat

329
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:29,050
4.7. Is this a possible score from you?

330
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,180
If it's this high, just live with her.

331
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,200
Getting such a score from a crazy guy like you

332
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,740
is harder that getting a perfect score on the CSAT (college entrance exam).

333
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,120
I still can't do that.

334
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,620
Why? There are lots of guy and girl housemates.

335
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,000
Also, you're not interested in dating nor women.

336
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,210
I still can't. The risk is too high.

337
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,310
Risk?

338
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,300
What risk?

339
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,010
Reason for disqualification:

340
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,610
You're going to work already?

341
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,220
Yes.

342
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,000
Uhhh. You don't need to do the recycling anymore.

343
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,220
Ahhh. Still, it's still my duty.

344
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,520
I thought it was right to do it until I leave.

345
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,550
I see.

346
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,410
Yes.

347
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,300
Well then.

348
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,100
Excuse me.

349
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,970
Yes?

350
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,810
Did you perhaps redo the grout on the bathroom tiles?

351
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:19,770
Ah, yes. It looked a bit old, so I did it over the weekend.

352
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:24,340
Ahh. Was I supposed to get permission?

353
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,320
No, it's not that.

354
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,210
Then, did you perhaps also clean the living room windows?

355
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:34,190
Yes, when I write, I have a habit of cleaning.

356
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,230
I see.

357
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:43,230
Then, perhaps, for what reason exactly did you kiss me?

358
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,320
Is he a crazy bastard?

359
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,860
Aigoo. Junsu's grandpa. How are you?

360
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,720
Why would you... ask me that?

361
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,190
It is very important to me, I mean, to live with you. It is an important question.

362
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,730
Still, I don't think...

363
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,160
it's something to talk about here.

364
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,360
- Did you dry all the peppers in your house?
- No, I haven't yet.

365
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,290
Oh.

366
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,600
I understand.

367
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,620
Aren't the colors nice? The peppers looked good.

368
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,680
Here, now tell me comfortably.

369
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,500
You see...

370
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,470
Honestly, I just wanted to try it out once.

371
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:44,760
You said you just wanted to try it out once?

372
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,430
Yes.

373
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:49,970
Uh...so you see....

374
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,970
I never got a chance to date anyone, so

375
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:57,260
it's obvious that I've never kissed anyone before.

376
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,170
Also, that day didn't go well with the guy I liked.

377
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,260
Yes. That's right.

378
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,400
When I think about it, it was bound to happen.

379
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,510
You need to have a stable financial status and time before you can date anyone,

380
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,870
and I don't have either of those.

381
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,360
Normally, you need to be dating the person you kissed,

382
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,130
but I thought that wouldn't really happen in my life.

383
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,740
So when I thought about it that way, I suddenly

384
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:26,380
told myself, "Just do it. You never know when you'll get a chance to kiss

385
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,270
with...

386
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:33,070
anyone."

387
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,230
Now that I say it out loud, I must sound like a crazy woman.

388
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,850
You don't understand much, right?

389
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:45,620
No. If that's your reasoning, then it makes total sense.

390
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,440
R-Really?

391
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,730
Yes. Relationships will cost you something, whether it's money, time, or emotions.

392
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:57,830
Therefore, you wanted to try to bring out a result of something done without cost, so you kissed me.

393
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,220
Yes. That's right. That's what it was.

394
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,320
From now on, you're not looking for any type of relationship either.

395
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,410
Of course not! I have a lot to deal with already, I can't put more onto myself.

396
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,590
Then, that's fine. It's perfect.

397
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,170
What is?

398
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:19,480
This is the log of all the names of my past housemates.

399
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,080
As you can see, between all these 7 housemates,

400
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,830
you have the highest score.

401
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,930
If I'm being honest, I've never met someone that perfectly meets my standards.

402
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:34,160
Because of this, I think it will be hard to find another person that can live up to these standards.

403
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,730
However,

404
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,710
I have a very critical reason for disqualification.

405
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,360
I believe that is our blind spot, but at the same time, our advantage.

406
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,650
- What?
- You would have been disqualified if you and I had a chance to fall in love.

407
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,610
However, if you say that you're done looking for a relationship,

408
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,040
then, wouldn't this be safer?

409
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,370
Moreover, we have already kissed each other.

410
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:59,880
It has been proven that the chance of it not happening is high.

411
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,980
- That's true.
- Yeah.

412
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:10,640
I am being honest, and I somehow got the chance to kiss you,

413
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,600
and you're really not my type.

414
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,660
I feel the same.

415
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,260
Then by any chance, can we still continue to live together?

416
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,060
It's okay.

417
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,310
So he just said it's okay to live together?
Se Hee (House Owner Unni)

418
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,360
Are you okay? Still, he's a man.
House owner

419
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,700
Of course.

420
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,930
Well, there's no way that would happen.

421
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,710
No way?

422
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,140
Now?

423
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:52,020
Well, now looking at it, I don't think I'll be able to find a better house than that.

424
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:56,770
Well, you see the house owner is in need of a tenant to pay his loans, and

425
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:01,590
I need a place to rent without any deposit, so this is just perfect.

426
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,530
That's true. When will you be able to live in a place like that again?

427
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:08,470
Hey, how much is the lease then? It must be expensive, right?

428
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,720
Turtle Student Housing
- By Yoon Ji Ho

429
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,570
- Hello.
- You're here already?

430
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,870
You're here early.

431
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,700
Hello, Writer Yoon.

432
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,390
- Hello.
- Were you surprised?

433
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,540
It's so nice to see you guys again.

434
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,520
- You should take a seat.
- Yes.

435
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:42,630
I was thinking it would be better if

436
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:46,680
Writer Hwang could formulate the the major storyline.

437
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,400
Actually, it's more advantageous when it comes to getting it scheduled.

438
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,200
You know how they don't schedule for new writers.

439
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,780
Yes.

440
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,490
Well, of course, both of you are the main scriptwriter. Don't misunderstand, Writer Yoon.

441
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,520
There's no reason for me to misunderstand.

442
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,660
It's an honor for me.

443
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,930
Please take care of me, Writer-nim (higher class).

444
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:13,210
Yeah. Do you really think I will try and take the project away from an assistant writer?

445
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:17,670
I'll help you a lot. Let's do well. Fighting.

446
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:22,440
That's great. Then, let's look at the script starting at the first episode.

447
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,920
Well, where should we start off?

448
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,480
Sorry, there's just too much to fix.

449
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,700
Writer Yoon.

450
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,140
Yes?

451
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,020
Excuse me.

452
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,360
Excuse me!

453
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,740
Oh! You're here?

454
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,690
Yes.

455
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,340
I guess your work is not going well again.

456
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:10,430
Yeah, I was just scrubbing the floor since it helps me with my stress.

457
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:12,280
You seriously

458
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:17,050
have an ideal stress relief strategy.

459
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,600
- Is that so?
- Yes.

460
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,760
That's so great of you.

461
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,850
Oh, thank you!

462
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,800
Do you want to watch it together?

463
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,680
No. I have some other work I still need to do.

464
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,630
He surpassed. Good. He shoots.

465
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,580
Goalkeeper Lloris caught it straight on.

466
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:31,260
Now the speed of Arsenal's offense is so fast.

467
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,020
Indeed, a derby match is so sweet.

468
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,590
This is the best part of the series.

469
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:44,040
However, won't that guy get married? I mean he has a house and a stable job.

470
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,780
So why isn't he married? Perhaps, is he gay?

471
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:54,630
However, aren't you going to marry anyone?

472
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,400
No. Normally, people get married around your age,

473
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,970
and you also own a house.

474
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,970
Well, that's usually the case,

475
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,880
but I choose to be single.

476
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,440
If that's the case, then are you never going to get married?

477
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,960
Yes. I'm only able to handle three things in my life and those are

478
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,970
my house, my cat, and myself.

479
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:22,120
I don't need other things that require more energy and cost.

480
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,350
I see.

481
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:29,360
However, then how much longer do you have until you pay off your loans?

482
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,220
I just need to pay it off over the next thirty years.

483
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,360
Thirty years?!

484
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:41,640
No, then you will have to work for the rest of your life just for this house,

485
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,270
and I wonder if it's a little too much.

486
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:51,220
In the country of South Korea, is there anything more certain than property?

487
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,620
Should you at least know a little more than me?

488
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:08,190
By the way, I saw a major hospital nearby.

489
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:13,040
Yes. It's a 10-minute walk and also one of the many reasons I chose this house.

490
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,730
- Are you sick somewhere?
- No, not exactly at this point.

491
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:21,090
In order to protect my health in the later years, it's necessary to have a hospital nearby.

492
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:24,780
No, you're still at your prime age, so I don't think you really need to worry about that at this moment.

493
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:29,780
I'm going to stay in this house until I die, so I need to take everything into consideration.

494
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:35,740
Honestly, your room is where my death will take place.

495
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,130
What?

496
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,230
The room's ventilation is good.

497
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:58,190
No wonder, the room felt nice and cool.

498
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:04,170
I can understand it logically-speaking but his brain seems to be shaped like a square.

499
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,730
His heart, too.

500
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,350
Ah, he's seriously not my type.

501
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,950
Oh, please wait a moment.

502
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:20,810
Yes, thank you.

503
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:24,100
The doors will be closing and going up to floor 4.

504
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,600
What floor are you going to?

505
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,420
I'm also going to the 4th floor. Thank you, Miss.

506
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,520
The door's opening.

507
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,290
Miss, why are you going in there?

508
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:45,090
Yes?

509
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:49,150
Oh, you see, this is my house.

510
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,960
This is my son's house.

511
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,520
What?

512
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,940
Forget it!

513
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:18,630
So you're saying, you're not dating that lady?

514
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,890
You already heard me, she's my housemate.

515
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:24,560
Housemate or whatever-mate it is, she's still a girl.

516
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,190
No, you're not even dating, but you're living together. Just what are you doing?

517
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:31,720
Because we're not going to date each other, that's why we're living together. She's a tenant.

518
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:35,140
Are you seriously not going to marry anyone? Are you trying to kill me?

519
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,470
Why are you bringing that topic up again? I already told you, I'm not going to do it.

520
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:42,280
You father wants a divorce.

521
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,820
If you're not going to get married, he's going to get a divorce from me.

522
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:49,770
Do you think this is a logical reason to get a divorce?

523
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,440
You should at least let me leave in peace.

524
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,250
How can you only think about yourself?

525
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:02,900
I'm sorry. I didn't think about other strangers coming to our house.

526
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,800
She isn't a stranger. She is your mother.

527
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,700
Well, all parents try to think of the best for their children.

528
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,000
They are all alike in their selfishness, wanting to fulfill their own unfulfilled desires

529
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,000
through their children.

530
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,900
If you're okay with it, you can just ignore her.

531
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,300
No. How can I do that?

532
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,600
She left after taking two anxiety pills.

533
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,600
A director I know, has an empty workshop,

534
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,400
so for now, I can just stay there.

535
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,600
When I get paid, I will also get myself a room.

536
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:43,300
Yes. Then, I'll transfer this month's rent back into your bank account.

537
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,700
Then, I have some work at my company, so I'm leaving now.

538
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,200
Oh, yes. Goodbye.

539
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,400
Kitty.

540
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,400
I have already grown attached to you.

541
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,700
What will you do when you're bored and I'm not here?

542
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,200
What is this? Why?

543
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,800
Huh?!

544
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,100
Director, this isn't just some editing. It's a different drama altogether now.

545
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,100
What's wrong? You already agreed to allow Writer Hwang formulate the main storyline.

546
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,600
I know, but the whole storyline—

547
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,600
How is this different from other dramas?

548
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:01,700
I mean, why add a birth secret to a story about youth?

549
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,000
Writer Yoon, why are you asking me like you're childish?

550
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,700
What?

551
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,600
Everyone knows that a drama about youth is fresh and new.

552
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,100
Just because it's good, does it mean everyone will eat it?

553
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:17,000
It has to be good with some other conflict for it to be delicious.

554
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,300
Writer, I heard you graduated from Seoul National University

555
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,200
from Writer Hwang. All your classmates are probably doing well right now,

556
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,300
so you should, too.

557
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,300
You are already pretty old. Until when are you going to continue living like this?

558
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,300
Don't you think so, too?

559
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,700
She's a teacher in the school where your father used to work.

560
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,600
I heard she's 28, so the age difference is just perfect.

561
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,500
Yes, I already heard about it earlier.

562
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:58,100
Make sure to not be late. Try to put in some hard work for me, son.

563
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,900
Okay. Goodnight.

564
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:16,500
I left without being able to say goodbye. Thank you.

565
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,700
May the groom enter.

566
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,600
May the bride enter.

567
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,000
Beautiful!

568
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,000
Hey, it's not a big deal. Just get married.

569
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,700
"Hey, it's not a big deal. Just go to the military and serve another term." What's the difference?

570
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,800
Of course it's different. Look over there.

571
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,800
You just need to work hard and get through an hour of doing this

572
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,500
and paying respect to the elders. Then that's it. It's over.

573
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,700
So do they just go to their separate homes after the wedding?

574
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,300
There are some couples who do that.

575
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,600
There are various forms of marriage. Show couple, weekend couple,

576
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,700
and sexless couple.

577
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,700
Why are you thinking too hard about it?

578
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,700
Hey, punk. Your father promised to pay back all the loans once you get married.

579
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,400
If it were me, I would get married and then divorce afterwards.

580
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,300
May the groom and bride bow to each other.

581
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,900
You look good together!

582
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,900
- Why isn't she coming?
- She said she'll be late because of work.

583
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:06,000
However, why are you here when it's the wedding of my college friend?

584
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,600
She's also a college friend of Won Seok, but since he's busy, I'm taking his place.

585
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,800
Soo Ji! Soo Ji!

586
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,600
Soo Ji! Soo Ji!

587
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:23,500
Ji Ho!

588
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,600
Aigoo, congratulations to your son.

589
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,700
Thank you. Excuse us.

590
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,800
Your dress is really pretty.

591
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,000
I bought a new one.

592
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:45,300
Hey, Soo Ji. Could you give me your business card? My younger sibling is applying for the company you're working at.

593
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:50,800
I can't do much. Tell him if he has any general questions, he can email me.

594
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,300
I heard from my older brother that you are an important figure in the business department.

595
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,800
- Hey, give me a business card, too.
- Hey, me too.

596
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,600
How can you just hear half of the story?

597
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,500
They just call me that to make fun of me.

598
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,500
What the heck?

599
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,400
The real important figure is Ji Ho.

600
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,000
She is probably the only person that got a full scholarship

601
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,700
when we were in school.

602
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,100
Wow.

603
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:18,700
Oh, yeah. It's been a while.

604
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,500
Oh, what are you doing right now?

605
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,500
Hey! She's a drama scriptwriter.

606
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,000
- Really?
- That's so great.

607
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,200
No. I'm still an assistant writer.

608
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,300
Wow, that's so amazing. What type of dramas did you write about?

609
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:39,300
Oh, the latest one was "A Dork's Love."

610
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,100
A dork?

611
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,000
Fool?

612
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,600
Before that, it was "Pretty Girl's Ramen Shop".

613
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,600
Oh. I see.

614
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:54,900
"Homemaker's God." That one, most people seem to know.

615
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,400
Oh, yeah!

616
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,100
Oh, that drama. You saw it, right?

617
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,400
Oh, yeah.

618
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,200
Hey! How do you not know that drama?

619
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,500
Sorry, I don't watch drama lately.

620
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,700
That's a legendary morning drama.

621
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,400
Hey! Take out your phone and search for it immediately.

622
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:15,500
Hey.

623
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,600
- Hurry up.
- Okay, I didn't know about it. Sorry.

624
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,300
Since I have another appointment, I'm leaving first.

625
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,900
Oh. Bye.

626
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,600
Hey, why are you overreacting so much today?

627
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,900
Just stick to one thing. Just one thing.

628
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,400
Why did you leave? I seriously have another appointment, so—

629
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,000
I have to go home, too.

630
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,500
Does bus 7737 come here?

631
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:09,200
Why do hot-shot girls act so humble too, yeah? So hapless.

632
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,000
Right?

633
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,700
See, I told you. What was the point of studying so hard?

634
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,400
Look at me. It's easy for me since I didn't do well in school so I don't have much choice.

635
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,400
Is there a reason why people tell you not to do things?

636
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,600
My father said literature majors starve to death.

637
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,100
I guess his words were right.

638
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:44,300
Ji Ho. Are you not doing so well with your writing?

639
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,000
What?

640
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:49,600
No, you don't earn as much as Soo Ji and you also don't date like me,

641
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:53,800
but you look the happiest when you are writing.

642
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,600
Do you not feel happy lately when you're writing? Are you having a seven-year itch with writing?

643
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,100
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.

644
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,000
Yes.

645
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,700
Nice to meet you.

646
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,200
I'm leaving first.

647
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,000
You should at least leave with me. Hey. Hey.

648
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,900
I'll see you next time.

649
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,200
Let's go together.

650
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:22,600
- I have an appointment that I can't be late to.
- It's the weekend, what kind of appointment would you have?

651
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,200
You're going on a blind date, right?

652
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,500
I'm leaving.

653
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:31,000
If you pretend to be a normal person, then you can also get a chance to marry someone, too! Fighting!

654
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,000
Oh! Hello, I'm Ma Sang Goo.

655
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,500
I run a dating company called Dating, Not Marriage (Gyeolmalae).

656
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,500
Ji Ho

657
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,200
Where are you now.

658
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,800
Oh my. I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

659
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,700
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

660
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,500
I'm sorry, are you alright?

661
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,800
Yes.

662
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,800
This...

663
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,600
I used it yesterday. Did I not?

664
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,900
Please give it to me.

665
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,400
- What?
- That.

666
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,300
It's mine.

667
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,300
Ah. This condom?

668
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:46,000
She's the one from the rooftop party. How dare she not recognize me!

669
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,600
There's a woman called Choi Yeong Jae who killed the original owner of the student housing to become the owner now.

670
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:56,400
Then here, we've got a third-generation tycoon heir. He's a writer called Choi Joon Seok...

671
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,800
... and find her mother.

672
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,300
But actually what happens is they are half-siblings.

673
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,900
You look the happiest when you are writing.

674
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,700
Do you not feel happy lately when you're writing?

675
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,300
- There's this girl that has different crushes on different guys.
- It seems interesting.

676
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,000
Yes, it's fun.

677
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,400
- Right?
- What do you think about it, Writer Yoon?

678
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,840
Yes?

679
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,850
Yes, fun.

680
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,630
Do you think this is fun?

681
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:35,470
What about it?

682
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:42,340
Why did you say we'd do a story about a student housing but now a the third generation of a conglomerate is hiding here?

683
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:46,730
Why did you say we'd do a story about youthful romance but now they are half-siblings?

684
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:47,930
Writer Yoon.

685
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:49,660
I'm right though, Director.

686
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:55,010
If we're going to do this, we should just do a traditional Makjang. Why trick the viewers?

687
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:58,840
Writer Yoon? Did you just say Makjang?

688
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,690
Your words are too harsh. I was just trying to help.

689
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:04,900
Do you really not want to do this project?

690
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,930
The decision to do or not do this project...

691
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:13,530
It's my decision to make.

692
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,610
This is originally my work.

693
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:40,960
♫ Just stay still for me like this quietly ♫

694
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:46,570
♫ As though we are together by coincidence ♫

695
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:55,390
♫ Though there are other stories that exist  ♫

696
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:02,570
♫ Their aftertaste that is too long is what remains ♫

697
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,890
Text blind date. 6:01 pm.

698
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,780
If she made it home safe,

699
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:30,620
what's after that? What is this waste of time?

700
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:49,900
♫ Nothing is changed by it ♫

701
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:53,930
Sorry, I forgot your food because I was so busy.

702
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:01,620
The thing we need isn't marriage.

703
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:13,590
♫ Only that very dark road in the far distant remains ♫

704
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:21,370
Writer Yoon, where are you? Apologize to Writer Hwang.

705
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:26,020
If you don't, you won't be able to do this project. Do you want your writing career to end?

706
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,840
Who is it?

707
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:37,400
What is this? Why are you coming in here?

708
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:42,420
Am I not allowed to come here to see you?

709
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,860
I found you this place.

710
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,900
Writer Yoon,

711
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:58,090
why are you doing this?

712
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:03,010
I'm trying to work well on this project with you.

713
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:06,290
Why are you doing this to me?

714
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:09,910
I'm just... I wanted to do well, too,

715
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:14,180
but this isn't the story we wanted to tell.

716
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:19,260
Who does what they want from the start?

717
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:25,170
Things one wants to do, those are done by people who have already succeeded.

718
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:29,190
People like us just need to do what they tell us to do!

719
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:34,140
D-Director, I understand. I understand, so let's talk about it tomorrow when you're sober.

720
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,520
Why are you like this?

721
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:41,050
Writer Yoon,

722
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:44,110
did you never like me?

723
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:48,220
Don't do it. Director, don't do it!

724
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:49,830
Director!

725
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:51,420
Wait a minute!

726
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:54,820
You're drunk! Let's talk tomorrow! Stop!

727
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:58,250
Wait! I said stop it!

728
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:01,980
Hey!

729
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:06,570
Do you... Do you know what's really terrible about you?

730
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:09,400
It's not the fact that you played with my feelings for three years.

731
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,180
It's not that you played with my work.

732
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:15,590
It's not even that you that came onto me even though you have a girlfriend.

733
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,690
It's that this is the only place that I have to sleep,

734
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:25,820
and you just kicked me out of even here. Do you know?

735
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:30,450
I just wanted to sleep, you bastard!

736
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:04,450
No matter how close you are, there are sides of you that you don't want to show.

737
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:27,760
Stop it, Oppa.

738
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:32,390
Come here. Did you say you already slept enough?

739
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:38,160
Sometimes, your family feels

740
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,690
the farthest from you.

741
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:50,980
When I made the decision to make a living off of my dream,

742
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:53,180
I knew that my life was now

743
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:56,160
like walking alone

744
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,660
in a dark tunnel.

745
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:05,430
But I didn't know... that it would be this dark.

746
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:11,850
But I didn't know... that it would be this lonely.

747
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:13,700
How much more.

748
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:19,670
How much more do I need to go?!

749
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:35,950
♫ Come with me  ♫

750
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:47,350
Why am I all the way here?

751
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,230
What is this?

752
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:56,290
What GPS mode is this?

753
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:11,560
From Arsenal's standpoint, they need Walcott to have a breakthrough.

754
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:15,440
The last try on goal looks to have failed.

755
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:20,660
Chelsea is still leading by one goal.

756
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:24,900
Now the ball is to Arsenal.

757
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:26,460
Now we see it.

758
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:30,560
Walcott. Inside to the back. Sanchez!

759
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,720
I was sleeping

760
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:38,200
and had a bad dream, so I woke up.

761
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:45,320
I came out to walk a little and somehow ended up all the way here.

762
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:49,030
Yes, it must have been a nightmare.

763
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:55,330
Yes, I dreamed that I was walking down a tunnel,

764
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,730
down a never-ending tunnel alone.

765
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:02,050
I see.

766
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:07,920
Have you been well?

767
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,430
Yes. Sure.

768
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:20,260
Excuse me.

769
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:22,810
I have something to say to you.

770
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:23,970
Yes.

771
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:27,270
Perhaps, if you have some time.

772
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:28,780
Yes?

773
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:32,970
Will you marry me?

774
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:43,170
At that moment, I just wanted somewhere

775
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:45,770
to sit down.

776
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:50,430
Whether that's a manhole or a pit.

777
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,200
Wherever.

778
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:55,600
Yes.

779
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:03,650
Tonight, I want to sleep comfortably.

780
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:31,210
Because This Is My First Life

781
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:34,240
Do you like me by any chance?

782
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,570
- Ji Ho is
- A bit of a

783
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:37,310
Excuse me.

784
01:07:37,310 --> 01:07:39,370
Psycho.

785
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,720
Isn't that guy so cute?

786
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,340
They say it's super popular with newlyweds.

787
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:47,030
That's why they also say - the usual doers will always do.

788
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:50,890
Stop bragging, because it's really annoying!

789
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:53,390
Once my dad upturns the table, it's game over.

790
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:58,110
Are you out of your mind! You're living together?!

791
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:01,090
I think it's fate.

792
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:02,360
You must've fallen for him at first sight.

793
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,550
Bbyong!

794
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:07,970
Do you... like me by any chance?

795
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:12,100
It's because you're Ji Ho. I did it because it was you.
