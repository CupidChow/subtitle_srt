00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,150
Hello?

8
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,990
Yoon Ji Ho?

9
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,670
Yes that's me. Who is it?

10
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,200
It's me, Alleyway.

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,370
Alleyway?

12
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,320
Ah, the guy from the alleyway when I was looking for Bok Nam.

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,840
Yes, Bok Nam.

14
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,100
Ah, but what is it?

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,030
I had something to ask. Do you have paper with you?

16
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,170
Paper?

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,500
Yes, I do.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,580
What about a pen?

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,780
I have a pen.

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,280
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- A boyfriend...

21
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,920
What?

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,120
Do you have a boyfriend?

23
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,140
I don't...

24
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,350
have a boyfriend

25
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,700
I'm leaving.

26
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,220
Why are you asking that?

27
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,420
Ah, I saw Bok Nam in the alleyway. He was wandering around alone again.

28
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,240
Oh, really? Bok Nam ran away again?

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,470
But...

30
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,030
It has nothing to do with me anymore.

31
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,430
I probably didn't get that restaurant's part-time...

32
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,540
Ah, do you want me to tell you the name of that restaurant? You can try contacting them directly.

33
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,600
The alleyway you saw last time.

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,410
Come there by 11:30am. You'll only find Bok Nam if you come by then.

35
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,070
Hello? Why would I—

36
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,110
Hello?

37
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,200
What time was it?

38
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,940
11am?

39
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,610
Ah, 11:30am.

40
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,280
He said the puppy's alone.

41
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,790
That's right. It's because I'm jobless.

42
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,310
I have a lot of time on my hands.

43
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,140
What? All you do is sleep, too.

44
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,910
What?

45
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,890
Is he a celebrity?

46
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,410
- Wow.
- Is he a doll?

47
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,400
What is it?

48
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,470
We're looking at the profiles,

49
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,980

50
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,020

52
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,150
Isn't this score really the highest we've ever had?

53
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,610
- This is the first time a male member has surpassed 9 points, right?
- You're right.
- It's the first time.

54
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,570
So, this is the type of guy who's really popular nowadays.

55
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,970
They look like puppies.

56
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,070
You mean they look as cute like puppies.

57
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,980
- How old is he?
- 24 years old.

58
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,750
Then he's... 2 years older than me?

59
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:26,080
Oh gosh. Why would you make such an ugly face? You scared me.

60
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,340
I should be saying that.

61
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,590
What about Bok Nam?

62
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,450
Follow me.

63
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,220
Why are we here? What about Bok Nam?

64
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,300
Let's go in first, then we'll find Bok Nam.

65
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,030
No.

66
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,260
I can't go in.

67
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,470
I didn't get the part time job here.

68
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,880
What?

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,620
Didn't the owner here ask you to find Bok Nam?

70
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,120
I know, right. He told me to look for his puppy as soon as I met him.

71
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,270
Also if they don't call then that means I got rejected.

72
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,280
No, why?

73
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,570
How can you fail to get a part-time job? It's not like being admitted to colleges.

74
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,810
It's possible.

75
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,240
I'm old and don't have the experience.

76
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,430
From the owner's point of view he must have felt burdened.

77
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,980
What do you mean burdened? What part of you is burdensome?

78
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,130
You look super easy to order around, perfect for a part-time employee.

79
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,490
How could he miss such a talent. Is he blind or what?

80
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,380
Are you... complimenting me right now?

81
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,430
Of course I am. Today you came out to help find Bok Nam again.

82
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,150
Wow. What is the owner doing?

83
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,020
He asked you to find his puppy and now he's rejecting you from a part-time job.

84
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,050
Let's you see why you didn't get the job.

85
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,450
Why would I...

86
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,690
Wait just a bit. Thank you.

87
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,650
Bok Nam you jerk. I'm so busy why are you only coming now?

88
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,840
Bok Nam?

89
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,680
So I brought a new part-time worker. I'm recommending her for her work ethic.

90
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,410
Hey Bok Nam, why are you doing things no one told you to?

91
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,970
Where is Bok Nam that he keeps calling his name?

92
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,410
Bok Nam.

93
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,640
That person, I'm going to use her as my minion starting tomorrow.

94
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,780
Hey! Yeon Bok Nam, you...

95
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,650
Bok... Nam.

96
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,440
Curly brown fur and... pink.

97
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,880
Bok Nam was a person?

98
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,210
If you don't hire this person I'm going to quit.

99
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,940
- What!
- What!

100
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,970
I was going to call you but,

101
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,480
the shop was so busy.

102
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,660
- Ah yes.
- Yes.

103
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:06,680
But perhaps, are you picking me because of the threat, even though I'm lacking?

104
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,190
No, it's fine if Bok Nam likes you.

105
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,870
You need to be liked by your coworker.

106
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,280
Then, start working tomorrow.

107
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,610
Yes, thank you.

108
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,220
Excuse me.

109
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,210
Were you hired?

110
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,640
Yes.

111
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,210
That's great.

112
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,950
Why are you treating me this way?

113
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,810
- What?
- Pardon?

114
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,850
Calling you to meet me? Or hiding that I was Bok Nam?

115
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,200
Or that I'm getting you hired? Which one?

116
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,030
Uh... um...

117
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,280
Well... All three.

118
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,180
Hey, Bok Nam! Deliver this to Mr. Yoo. Right now.

119
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,850
Yes.

120
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,040
Come here.

121
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
Why?

122
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,440
You told me to tell you the reason I'm being like this.

123
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,870
What are you doing?

124
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,840
The owner said to hurry and make this delivery.

125
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,150
Hurry and get on. I'll tell you on the way.

126
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,380
- Really?
- Hurry and get on.

127
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,250
I'm busy.

128
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,100
The kimchi has to be tasty, the kimchi.

129
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,320
If possible, let's eat lunch out more often,

130
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,710
like human beings.

131
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,440
Oh, it's Sae Hee's wife.

132
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,020
You're really on guard.

133
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,810
Tell me now, why did you do that?

134
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,880
Why do you think? I did it because I like you.

135
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,530
Me?

136
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,540
Who else would it be?

137
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,560
Hello, Mr. Yoo. I'm nearby. I can swing by, right?

138
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,490
Yes, yes.

139
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,670
See you tomorrow then.

140
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,470
Excuse me.

141
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,080
I think I led you to misunderstand.

142
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,550
I don't have a boyfriend,

143
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,850
but I have a husband.

144
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,970
That's sister-in-law's brother, they look alike.

145
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,340
What are you talking about? You saw her brother at the wedding.

146
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,210
So what?

147
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:24,350
- Huh?
- So you have a husband what does that have to do with me?

148
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,140
If you have a husband, does that mean you can't have a boyfriend?

149
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,410
Episode 7
It's My First Time Saying YOLO

150
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,180
He said what? "If you have a husband, does that mean you can't have a boyfriend?"

151
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,750
So? What did you say?

152
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,220
What do you mean? I was speechless.

153
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,760
Kids nowadays come off strong.

154
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,450
- How old did you say he was? 24?
- I know, right?

155
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,980
24 years old.

156
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,570
Wow, there's a limit to how far you can take a joke.

157
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,450
Hey, Woo Soo. Work hard at your company.

158
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,600
Even it's hard, survive until the end. Understand?

159
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,090
There's nothing I can do after quitting as a writer.

160
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:24,410
At my age of half-sixty, working part-time with a boy who's younger than my little brother and suffering this cajolement.

161
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:29,740
Hey, that's not something you should say to a company worker who's getting cajoled by the bastards everyday.

162
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,270
Huh?

163
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,700
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,760
Where's Ho Rang? Isn't the restaurant closed today?

165
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,110
She's in shock right now.

166
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,780
Why?

167
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,980
I thought you loved me.

168
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,200
Of course. You know that I can't live without you.

169
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,390
But, loving someone and getting married isn't the same.

170
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:01,850
- Huh?
- It means having kids and being responsible. Marriage.

171
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,670
How will I be able to do that.

172
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:10,120
Are love and marriage the same?

173
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,700
Get a hold of yourself Yang Ho Rang you shouldn't be like this now.

174
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,430
Did they forget our radish?

175
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,540
It's right here.

176
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:36,480
- Who is it?
- It's me! Me!

177
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,160
Oh!

178
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,800
What's up? I thought you couldn't come.

179
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,140
Recommend me some books.

180
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,030
Books? Things to read?

181
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,450
Why do you need them?

182
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,940
Why do you need books all of a sudden?

183
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,910
Books on human breeding and necessities of the marital institution.

184
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,500
Why? Is this because of Won Seok?

185
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,220
Are you okay? Did you go insane from the shock?

186
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,260
No. My head just got clearer.

187
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,530
What? He loves me but he doesn't know about marriage?

188
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,870
I mean, he thought if he said it like that, I'd be like, "What? But you love me."

189
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,420
"Why am I not in your future?"

190
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:30,320
Should I be crying like this in my room?

191
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,070
Who does he take me for?

192
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,470
She's giving me goosebumps. She can go to Cannes with that.

193
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:43,360
You know it already. I put in seven years of my life into Sim Won Seok, who used to be like Alpha Go, and changed him into how he is now.

194
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,780
But I trained him to be a boyfriend until now.

195
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,510
Now, I have to train him to be a husband.

196
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,370
I'm going to the bookstore so text me some book titles.

197
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,240
Hey eat before you go.

198
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,480
Forget it. I don't have time to chat.

199
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,210
- A guy who was born in 1994 asked for Ji Ho's phone number.
- Hey.

200
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,230
In 1994? How old is he?

201
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,060
Twenty-four.

202
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,240
Bring out the soju.

203
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,990
Okay

204
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,230
You're late

205
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,810
Yes.

206
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,180
Kitty must have thrown up.

207
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,680
Yes, it seems so. I saw this when I got home from work.

208
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,170
Is she okay? Is she sick?

209
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,940
Sometimes she throws up without a reason.

210
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,970
Still, I don't know, so tomorrow I will take her to the hospital.

211
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,310
Ah, If you are getting off late tomorrow I will ta—

212
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:51,190
I find it a bit uncomfortable. It's my cat but ,

213
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:56,510
having someone call it by another name is uncomfortable.

214
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,200
What? In the afternoon?

215
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,900
Oh. In the afternoon, I have to go to work.

216
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,510
I got a part-time job.

217
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:11,370
Uh-huh yes, the Yolo cafe next to my workplace.

218
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,730
I saw you near the company,

219
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,810
on the back of a motorcycle.

220
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,800
Ahhh, yeah, that's right, earlier I was close to your office.

221
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,170
Did you see me? The other part timer told me he was busy so he told me to get on.

222
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,100
But that guy's joke was excessive.

223
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,720
- From the first time we met—
- You seemed rather close with him from since it's first time you met,

224
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,110
with that part-timer.

225
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,680
I mean since we're working together—

226
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,800
You only work together.

227
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,250
But you seem quite close with that part-timer.

228
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,550
Then, have a good night.

229
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,520
Excuse me...

230
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,280
Are you upset with me?

231
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,410
No, why would I be?

232
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,780
I know, right. Why would you be?

233
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,010
There's no way.

234
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,810
He must be upset because of Kitty.

235
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,570
Oh, this tastes good.

236
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,670
Come to YOLO, 24 years old. Seoul. Taking time off from college, 183cm tall, lean toned type.

237
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,090
That man earlier. The one with the highest score. It's him, isn't it?

238
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,800
You're right. He works part-time at the YOLO cafe.

239
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,010
They opened recently.

240
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,950
Oh. I hard that sister-in-law was looking for a part-time job.

241
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,440
They must be work colleagues.

242
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,700
How can a part-timer afford to ride that kind of motorcycle?

243
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,210
The cheap ones cost 30-40 million won. Don't they? ($30,000-$40,000)

244
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,840
Some cost more than ₩100 million.

245
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,970
I know. Why does he work as a part-timer when he drives around this kind of motorcycle?

246
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,390
It doesn't really make any sense.

247
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,810
You only live once. Personality: Laid Back, Outgoing

248
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,380
- Rang, should I take the lights off?
- Later, after I finish watching this.

249
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,280
What are you looking at?

250
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,990
Rang, why are you watching it? This is not like you.

251
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,370
Oh, I am sorry. Please be understanding. I am ovulating now.

252
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,470
What does your ovulation have to do with this?

253
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,550
It's when the level of luteinizing hormone peaks.

254
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,170
Luteinizing what?

255
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,770
It's the hormone that boosts female sex hormones.

256
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,910
I think my instinct to breed becomes stronger.

257
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,370
I must be instinctively seeking these beast-like (muscular) men.

258
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,330
What are you doing?

259
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:51,050
So you're saying your hormones are at high levels now.

260
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:56,350
A healthy boyfriend like me exists so you could release that.

261
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:59,020
I must prove my reason for existence today.

262
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,680
I'm sorry. I don't think I can do it with you tonight.

263
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,130
What are you saying all of a sudden?

264
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,790
Of course sexual desires peak during ovulation.

265
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,430
Still woman doesn't allow mating to just anyone. Evolutionary psychology

266
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:23,200
dictates that the female instinctively searches for the male who could safely protect its children.

267
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,140
Since we don't have any plans for marriage,

268
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,130
my body must sense you as a potentially dangerous element.

269
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:38,230
The black-headed weaver (bird) too. When the male doesn't build a strong nest during a mating season, the female will just leave without a second look.

270
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,250
A black-headed weaver?

271
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,580
There's something like that? Rang, it's about animals.

272
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,180
We aren't birds. We are human.

273
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,720
Humans are animals. Haven't you read the book "The Selfish Gene"?

274
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,480
Humans are just a machine to pass down the gene to the next generation. Nothing more or nothing less than that.

275
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,510
Rang, you read that book?

276
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:07,260
So please be understanding during my ovulation. I need an outlet to relieve my desires.

277
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:16,190
Rang, do you love me?

278
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,610
Of course, you know I can't live without you either.

279
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,250
Then you can sleep with me instead of looking at that.

280
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,650
I thought about what you said.

281
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,350
If we sleep together there is a possibility I could get pregnant. Even if we are careful,

282
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,340
there are still risks.

283
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,360
But, I can't do it with someone who is unsure our future together.

284
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,780
However, I don't know about sleeping together just because we are in love.

285
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,610
Huh?

286
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:57,050
It's quite hard. I sometimes think about that, too.

287
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:01,290
Is love and sexual desire the same thing?

288
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:08,670
Rang, where did you get those glasses from?

289
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,500
I bought them today. They hired a new part-timer in the optometry nearby.

290
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
That guy, he looks like this guy.

291
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,680
You woke up early today?

292
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,220
Yes, I have to start working today.

293
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,880
I didn't eat breakfast today.

294
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,610
Yes

295
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,310
Would you like one?

296
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,990
It's really good to eat as a meal replacement in the mornings.

297
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,630
Okay. I will eat it well.

298
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,450
Thank you.

299
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,250
You get off at the next stop, don't you?

300
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:37,220
Yes, the cafe is close to my office.

301
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,910
So, when you are free sometime you should c—

302
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,380
If possible, I want to avoid situations when we have to pretend that we're a married couple

303
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,520
like today if we could in the future.

304
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,530
Nothing.

305
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,100
I'll see you at home.

306
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,330
Noona!

307
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,610
- Noona?
- Then what? Hyung?

308
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:30,650
Since you're a cute Noona, I'll call you Noona. I'll continue to call you that in the future, too.

309
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,930
What?

310
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,530
Ah, also don't use informal speech.

311
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:42,830
I'm more old-fashioned than I look. I don't want to have anything special with someone who talks to me informally.

312
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,320
Did he take a class on how to talk to girls?

313
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,630
That's something...

314
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,560
- Please wash these, too.
- Okay.

315
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,790
Ah, it's fine! I'll do it.

316
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,900
I'm almost finished tying it.

317
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,120
No, where did get the hair tie from?

318
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,270
I brought it before work. I'm telling you, you look prettier with your hair to the side like this.

319
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:37,400
What? I mean... When have you seen me with my hair on the side?

320
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,070
I don't think that ever happened.

321
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:43,370
Ah..I'm saying you probably look better with your hair like that.

322
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:48,280
Tie your hair. Why would you hide your pretty neckline?

323
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:04,130
Did you get to work? How is that 1994 guy doing?

324
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,800
Was he a bit surprised when you told him you were married?

325
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,380
No, it doesn't seem like it at all.

326
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,010
Why? Is he still flirting with you?

327
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,210
I don't know whether it's flirting or just messing around.

328
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,450
He even bought a hair tie and tied my hair up earlier.

329
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,900
What?! Hey! Isn't that sexual harassment?

330
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,670
This punk, how dare he?

331
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,410
Pervert! I'll have to go there and teach him a lesson!

332
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,420
- Ji Ho, wait for us.
- We'll go there.

333
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,340
Ah, I'm sorry...you told me to not include whipped cream. I forgot. I'll make another one.

334
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,630
No, no! It's fine, I normally lose weight easily, so I'm fine.

335
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,580
I'll enjoy it. I'll finish it all.

336
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,600
As for you, lavender tea.

337
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,550
It's hot, so be careful.

338
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,650
Enjoy!

339
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:10,360
Hey, you said it was sexual harassment and that you'll teach him a lesson.

340
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,960
My friend, I feel like dating him would also be a great experience in life.

341
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,840
Are you crazy? What's wrong with you?

342
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,070
Should I not get married?

343
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,950
Suddenly, I feel like I didn't get to explore the world enough yet.

344
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,900
What's wrong with you, too?

345
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,560
- Thank you, Boss.
- Thank you for the meal!

346
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,240
It's fine. As a boss, I should at least do this for you.

347
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,640
It wasn't even ₩1,000,000 ($1,000).

348
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,850
As for the second round, it will be treated by Nam Se Hee!

349
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,910
- Wow!
- Yeah!

350
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,970
Then let's go to Ji Ho's part-time job.

351
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,970
The cake there's the best. It's known as the it-place around here.

352
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,610
Okay. Let's go!

353
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,790
Okay!! I love cake!

354
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:05,710
You're going to buy us cake, right?

355
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,350
- Hello.
- Oh? Ji Ho!

356
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,530
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello, Sister-in-law.

357
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm here for the cake!

358
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,840
- Ah, here's the cake!
- Wow. It looks so delicious!

359
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,990
Choux cream looks good.

360
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:25,220
- This looks great.
- No, this one's better.

361
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,000
Pick one.

362
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,610
Which one is good? Se Hee's paying today.

363
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,180
Ah, is that so?

364
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,970
The ones that sell best are the cheesecake and chocolate cake.

365
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,380
- I'll take blueberry cheesecake.
- Like a man, I'll take chocolate mousse.

366
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,710
- Then, I'll take a cheesecake.
- Me too.

367
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,820
- Are you ready to order?
- Yes.

368
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,310
We'll take seven Americanos.

369
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,610
Aren't you going to order any cake?

370
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,540
No, I'm not.

371
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,580
Anyone who wants iced coffee?

372
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,260
Is there none?

373
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,220
Is your face not burning up [from embarrassment]?

374
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,680
I mean, why can't you order a cake, just how expensive can it be?

375
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,590
You have the highest salary in our company. I'm still embarrassed to death.

376
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,850
Sadly, my expenses this month are also its highest.

377
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:27,820
I will treat everyone to meat when I finally pay off all my loans. Beef.

378
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,770
When will that be?

379
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,940
2048.

380
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:37,120
Will I even be able to chew up meat at that time?

381
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,750
Do you think you'll be alive then?

382
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,610
If it's 2048, then that's 31 years from now.

383
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,020
Don't you have to be alive to pay everyone a meal?

384
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,480
What is this?

385
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,180
Freebies. I'm buying it for you.

386
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,550
- Okay!
- That's great!
- I'll enjoy!

387
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:00,550
Our YOLO youngster has a good mindset.

388
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,140
I'm personally curious, but

389
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,500
by chance, is your family wealthy and affluent, with old money?

390
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,480
No, I saw your motorcycle outside and that's something hard to buy with your own money.

391
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,450
Are you perhaps a third-generation chaebol or something and training yourself here to be a successor?

392
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,950
It's not something like that.

393
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,350
Though I did have to move into a half-basement monthly rental, in order to buy that.

394
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,780
Really? Then I guess you traded your house for that motorcycle.

395
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,280
Wow. That's YOLO. You live your life coolly!

396
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,010
I only live once, so I can't waste it paying off a mortgage.

397
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,640
I think people who are called, "house poor" are a bit pathetic in my eyes.

398
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,980
Well, not to the extent of pathetic.

399
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,890
Everyone has different life goals, though.

400
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:52,210
But that's not really a life goal, it's more of not taking care of your life.

401
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,450
Just how can you sacrifice your whole life just for a house? You should try to enjoy every moment you can in your life.

402
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,280
I guess you want to believe you're living every moment of your life in enjoyment.

403
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,340
Since YOLO is a nihilist consumption pattern.

404
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,520
Since you know you can't earn much, can't save much, can't accomplish much,

405
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,180
you escape it with temporary consumption.

406
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,180
Escaping?

407
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,480
As expected, maybe because you studied more than me, your interpretations are unique.

408
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,710
Then, you guys should all briefly escape by enjoy something sweet today.

409
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,150
Enjoy!

410
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,510
What a sweet type of guy.

411
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:38,070
A sweet youngster he is. Sweet youngster!

412
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,530
- Okay, let's eat!
- Enjoy!

413
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,380
I enjoyed it.

414
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,380
I'll see you at home.

415
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,240
Okay. Are you going to get off work late?

416
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,420
No, if nothing happens, then I should get home in time.

417
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,470
Okay. Then, I'll see you at home.

418
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,030
Yes.

419
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:04,080
Ah...Do you get off work late?

420
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,980
Ah, well, same for me, if nothing happens...

421
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,150
Why?

422
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:18,890
No, just because...Goodbye.

423
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,880
Work hard, Ji Ho.

424
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,110
Goodbye!

425
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,640
By any chance, does that YOLO guy have a girlfriend?

426
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,460
I'm not sure. I don't think he does.

427
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,080
- I'm leaving.
- Yes.

428
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,020
What are you going to do?

429
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,850
What? About what?

430
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:02,110
That YOLO guy seems to be interested in Ji Ho.

431
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,000
Since they work together, isn't that something you should be concerned with?

432
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:11,050
Why would I?

433
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,650
Because you're her husband?

434
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:17,700
Just because I'm her husband, it doesn't mean I have the rights to tell my wife how to live her social life.

435
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,920
Anyway, that workplace is an environment chosen by her.

436
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,680
Anything that happens there, is her own personal work life.

437
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,400
Although I'm her husband, I have no rights to tell her what to do.

438
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,730
I expected it, but your marriage seems exactly like you.

439
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,420
Still, you should at least show her when you're jealous.

440
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,480
Girls like it when their man gets jealous sometimes.

441
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,790
Jealous?

442
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,880
Are you talking about me?

443
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,890
Yes, you were jealous. The whole entire time.

444
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,550
I wasn't.

445
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:56,590
Then why are you looking at the same thing again since earlier?

446
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,950
You've been looking at the weather report for an hour now.

447
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,120
When it comes to weather report, there is a lot to read.

448
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,890
Ah, yes...

449
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,740
What was that? That bad attitude just now?

450
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,520
Please apologize, Bo Mi. Here the weather report.

451
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,890
I'm not just looking at Korea's weather report, if you look at it right here...

452
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,240
Okay, here.

453
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:30,130
How can a man's dimple be that deep?

454
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,310
He is really amazing.

455
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,540
No, isn't he the total opposite from our brother-in-law?

456
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,840
Extreme opposite from each other, including looks and lifestyle.

457
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,540
If it were you, who would you choose?

458
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,380
One is YOLO without a house and the other is house poor.

459
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,240
Can I not choose?

460
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,660
No, I mean if they were the last men on earth. Who would you choose?

461
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:55,630
Why would I choose only one if they are the last two men on earth? I will go back and forth sleeping with them.

462
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,050
Pervert.

463
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,600
So, how's it going with CEO Ma?

464
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,540
What do you mean by that?

465
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:10,150
I mean have you slept with him, are you going to sleep with him or are you sleeping with him? What's the verb tense?

466
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:14,160
What are you talking about? We only have a work relationship.

467
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,430
I see. I guess, instead of documents,

468
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:24,210
you give toys at work. That's so adorable.

469
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,330
He said that he had some coins and he got it for me.

470
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:32,770
He gave it for me but I was going to throw it away.

471
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,910
I see.

472
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:40,590
If you were going to throw it away, why did you put seat belt on it?

473
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,320
Also, he just gave it to you? It looks just like you.

474
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,220
What do you mean by that?

475
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,490
Do I look that ugly?

476
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:58,410
What about Won Seok? Is everything okay?

477
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:03,250
Of course. I'm paying everything back to him.

478
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,640
Slowly, but painfully.

479
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,300
What?

480
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,870
Oh my gosh. Some trouble came up from app users.

481
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,400
This guy met a woman by chat and stalked her.

482
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,350
Where? Which company?

483
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:19,950
Don't worry. It's not your CEO Ma's company.

484
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,540
Heol!

485
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,930
What?

486
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:40,630
Day before yesterday, a man imprisoned a woman for thirteen hours in a studio apartment around Namgang station.

487
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,100
It said that they met through a game app. It just appeared online.

488
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,820
Won't our image suffer because of these things?

489
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,490
You're right. People will just think that they met through an app.

490
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:55,940
Shouldn't we be prepared and make a blacklist?

491
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:01,250
It looks like we might need to gather data on the behavioral patterns of such potential criminals and apply machine learning to raise red flags or something.

492
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:06,080
Bo Mi, you are taking care of the customer satisfaction issues?

493
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,210
Was there anything special?

494
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,250
There were 32 complaints this week.

495
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,980
They were all complaints about the women not being very active in conversation.

496
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,180
Even though we might not know, monitor them just in case.

497
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,710
Also, if any complaints need to be follow-up, share them right away.

498
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,890
Even if it looks like low risk.

499
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:29,030
Okay. Then I'll share it with you.

500
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:32,700
No. Don't tell me, tell CEO Ma.

501
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,360
Customer satisfaction isn't my job.

502
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,420
- Okay.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

503
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,160
Yes! Yes! Yes!

504
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:53,450
Everyone. It seems like finally, we can launch a global office.

505
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,360
Wow!

506
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,130
Oh!

507
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,640
- You secured an investment?
- I was just on the phone with Deputy Park.

508
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,230
Today, they are going to confirm it at the Golden Venture meeting.

509
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:09,520
Deputy Park? The one who you want to send back to military to have him go through military service again?

510
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,370
The Deputy Park you want to meet in India in your next life?

511
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:15,830
That's right. If I was born as a chaebol in India in my next life,

512
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,280
the same Deputy Park I wanted to order around as my sudra for the rest of my life.

513
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,680
That Deputy Park. Oh, my world. Oh, my world!

514
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,760
He is the college senior to Golden Venture's investment evaluator.

515
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,290
- Great!
- Then what's will happen?

516
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,980
Deputy Park who's supposed to be your sudra in your next life.

517
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,000
Deputy Park is someone I need to serve for the rest of my life as my

518
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,640
Brahman. A Brahman!

519
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,950
Then let's all say our slave version motto!

520
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:45,820
- We,
- We,

521
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,790
- if we get paid,
- do everything!

522
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,210
- This is great!
- This is amazing!

523
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,610
Thank you.

524
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,160
Come in.

525
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,520
You came early.

526
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,850
Congratulations for getting the investment.

527
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,780
Yes. Thank you.

528
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,960
Deputy Park worked hard for this.

529
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,520
He's not that type of person who usually works hard like this.

530
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,490
Being good at a job is more important than working hard.

531
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,040
I worked as a deputy in Samsung Electronics, too.

532
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,210
There's no one that is born as a CEO.

533
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:59,120
Last time, I was being nosy, under the disguise of advising.

534
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,110
You already apologized.

535
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,620
Does that mean you have accepted the apology at that time?

536
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:11,070
I misunderstood because you didn't reply back.

537
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:15,620
Why are my text messages read but never replied to? Did it vanish into thin air?

538
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,710
I was about to file a complaint to the text message company.

539
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,900
But, you should accept an official apology.

540
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:31,140
I'm sorry. I won't act like that ever again.

541
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:35,210
Okay. Since the meeting is very important to you,

542
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,730
don't say anything unprofessional and personal.

543
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:42,420
What do you mean by personal? You mean by me liking you?

544
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,280
I'm just joking.

545
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:52,540
I have been a CEO for three years. I am not the type to mess up my work based on personal feelings.

546
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,860
Hello.

547
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,110
I'm on my way to get the investment by Golden Venture.

548
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:26,250
I will be successful and help you get yours.

549
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:32,060
Congraulations, Hyung. You will definitely succeed.

550
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,670
Wow. I definitely envy him.

551
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,220
End of Rang's ovulation, 7pm

552
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,810
Rang. Sang Goo went to secure his investment today.

553
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:06,950
If he does well, he's going to help me.

554
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,660
Really? That's good.

555
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,010
Then, is Se Hee going to get a raise?

556
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:15,080
Probably. Since he's a founding member.

557
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,750
I think he has many shares.

558
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:22,690
Oh, good for Ji Ho. She will become a madam before I do.

559
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:28,970
Don't worry. When I succeed, I'll make sure you live in luxury. Kiss.

560
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,480
Hey, I need to put on toner.

561
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,680
You don't have to put it on.

562
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,810
No. In autumn, I need to keep my skin moist.

563
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,510
You know what's best for your skin.

564
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:48,110
I know everything. Your ovulation ended today, right?

565
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,040
How did you know?

566
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,330
It ended yesterday.

567
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,950
Go and get some condoms.

568
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:03,690
I'm all ready.

569
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,970
Rang, my friend made this. This is really popular.

570
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,950
Let's use them.

571
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:11,570
You have two of them, right?

572
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,920
Are we going to do it twice?

573
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,040
This pervert.

574
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,170
Okay. Two times.

575
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:23,080
No. I mean, wear them both.

576
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,280
Why should I wear them both?

577
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:35,190
I've read that condom has failure rate of 15% in preventing pregnancies.

578
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,020
Let's see. If there is 10% chance to get pregnant during non pregnancy phase. 15 times 10 is 150.

579
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:48,350
If we divide it, the possibility of getting pregnant is 1.5%.

580
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:51,850
With that 1.5%, can you make sure that I won't get pregnant?

581
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:55,940
Rang, when did you calculate that?

582
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,770
And also, why did you wear those glasses?

583
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:07,720
Since you don't want to have kids nor get married, we have to take all the precautions.

584
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:13,340
So from now on, wear them both. Let's be thorough.

585
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,480
CEO, have a glass.

586
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,310
Oh. Okay.

587
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,020
I read your investment proposal.

588
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:38,040
Chief Yoon spoke so highly of it, so I asked him to just show me for a review.

589
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,120
In such a short time, you made your company grow.

590
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:46,020
- The profit outlook seems good.
- Thank you for being your positive reviews.

591
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,870
Chief Yoon, thank you. I will pour you a glass.

592
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:53,930
Oh my, my senior really pushed for Gyeolmalae

593
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,850
I listen to everything Jin Woo said.

594
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:02,690
Oh, Chief Yoon. You make it sound like you are investing based on personal connections.

595
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:07,610
This is all because CEO Jang has a very discerning eye for investments.

596
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:10,820
I admit to that but,

597
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,380
I hope that I'm right this time.

598
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,770
Of course. It's without a doubt.

599
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:19,350
Tinkle, tinkle. (bells are used by fortune tellers)

600
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,830
Here. Let's have a drink.

601
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,480
- Okay.
-Here.

602
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,050
Oh, this is nice.

603
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,250
- That's good.
- Thank you.

604
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:49,920
Once you secure this investment, will you set up a global office?

605
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,860
Yes. We are ready. We just need the investment.

606
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:59,230
That was my goal when I first started.

607
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,810
You know I followed CEO Jang all the way to Thailand, right?

608
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:04,810
- It was on the weekend.
- I heard.

609
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:09,850
I heard that you played golf for four days and even suffered a second degree sunburn from it.

610
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,460
Yeah. Do you think I followed him there to play golf for my sake?

611
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,110
It's all to push for Gyeolmalrae, of course.

612
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:20,240
The talks you throw out in the middle of fielding is very important. You know what, CEO Ma.

613
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,240
Of course. Those talks are truly very important.

614
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,330
Oh. Right.

615
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:28,380
I can drop the honorific speech, right? Since we're similar in age.

616
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,140
Or does that discomfort you?

617
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,540
How is that? How's that discomforting?

618
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,830
Don't people talk like friends if it's only three years in age difference?

619
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,030
Right, Sang Goo? It's Sang Goo then.

620
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:41,570
Sang Goo!

621
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,700
I think you'll need a beating from Sang Goo.

622
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,790
The ambiance is so great today. What were you talking about?

623
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:00,660
Oh, I was hearing about the golf trip the three of them went on.

624
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,980
I see. Golf.

625
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,090
Deputy Woo, what did you do during the break?

626
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,960
I just rested at the hotel.

627
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,230
Hotel?

628
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,080
Where?

629
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:10,990
Namsan.

630
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:14,460
Oh. Gaya Hotel?

631
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,970
That's a great place. They have a great view, too.

632
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,760
And great for lovers to get in the mood, too.

633
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,470
Who would you have gone with?

634
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:24,840
I went by myself.

635
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,680
I just wanted to rest comfortably this year.

636
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,930
No way. Not you, Deputy Woo.

637
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:32,030
I really went alone.

638
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,670
Let's be honest. Tell me honestly.

639
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,600
You went with your boyfriend, right?

640
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:49,150
Mischievous. You're so mischievous!

641
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:54,870
This crazy psycho bastard. Seriously.

642
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,960
What era does he think he lives in?

643
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,810
He is asking for a beating now.

644
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:02,260
CEO Ma. What? Why are you doing that?

645
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,230
Oh, I'm sorry.

646
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,060
I think I spoke too loud to myself.

647
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,200
This junior punk of mine is talking too much crap in his text.

648
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,030
So I was a bit riled up. Sorry. I'm sorry.

649
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,840
I'm sorry.

650
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,130
Deputy Woo. Let's just talk honestly now.

651
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,960
You have a boyfriend but you're just acting like you don't, right?

652
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,000
Hey, why do you hide that stuff between us?

653
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,910
Why would I hide it?

654
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,510
Yea, go ahead.

655
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:36,560
I want to hear about how the young people date these days, too.

656
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:40,300
This bastard just can't be helped.

657
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,420
Act like your age if you're old, you bastard.

658
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,360
Want me to make you a cripple now?

659
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:51,000
Get you a big beating on your hands and wrist? Bastard.

660
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:00,280
I'm sorry. I look pretty and all but I've got a hot temperament.

661
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,420
So if I don't fix his habit of that junior bastard of mine,

662
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,490
I think I might regret forever. That's why.

663
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:10,890
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

664
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,000
I'm sorry!

665
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,390
Se Hee. Get in. Kyeong Yeong drove his car today.

666
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:31,490
No, it's alright. I'll just take the bus.

667
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:33,070
Get in, Se Hee.

668
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:36,790
It's on my way anyway, so I'll drop you off in front of your home.

669
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,120
Oh.

670
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,930
Good job.

671
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:49,560
Thank you for your trouble.

672
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:14,700
♫ Please just stay like this and be still  ♫

673
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:19,760
♫ Like we're together by coincidence ♫

674
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:28,800
♫ Though no fragrance is left behind  ♫

675
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,430
♫ Only the aftertaste that is too long  ♫

676
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:34,730
Are you off work?

677
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,980
Noona!

678
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:46,400
So disloyal! To leave work first while I was out making delivery?

679
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:50,680
Get on.

680
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:56,090
No, it's alright. I'm taking the bus.

681
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:59,320
I know. You're sitting at the bus stop.

682
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,070
Oh. I am.

683
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:05,190
What? By chance, was your husband going to come pick you up?

684
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,990
Oh, nothing like that.

685
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,980
If it's not like that, get on. I'm faster than the bus.

686
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:16,070
♫ Stay with me  ♫

687
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,900
I mean, what's with the mindset of fussing on taking the bus?

688
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,990
What mindset? It's just that he's got a crappy personality.

689
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,370
Drop me off up front over there.

690
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,950
Oh, alright.

691
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:36,360
But why are you going to Itaewon suddenly?

692
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,480
Meeting friends?

693
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,700
Nope. Just a meeting with myself, shall I say?

694
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,010
See you tomorrow.

695
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,070
Bye, Bo Mi.

696
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,470
CEO Jang, I'm sorry about today.

697
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,950
I got it. Work hard.

698
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,170
Good bye.

699
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,670
CEO Ma. So you've got a talent to ruin a pot of rice that's all done.

700
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:08,000
I wouldn't have.

701
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,450
I'm sorry.

702
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:14,050
I think it'll be hard for us to meet for a while.

703
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,540
Going global? Yeah, right!

704
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,490
Good bye.

705
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,740
You called for a driver?

706
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,550
Yes.

707
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,130
Let's go.

708
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,450
Why did you do that?

709
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:49,350
You said it was an important meeting and you weren't going to respond with personal feelings.

710
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:51,250
You said that.

711
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:56,770
I didn't do that on personal feelings, it was a public feeling.

712
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:59,690
I am mindful of you no matter where I go.

713
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:02,360
And I'm curious about you.

714
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,570
So then, I miss you.

715
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,920
Those are public feelings.

716
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:12,460
- Look here, CEO Ma—
- I just don't like it!

717
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,660
Those bastards harassing you!

718
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:20,270
I barely kept myself from flying my fist at them.

719
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,120
So, please.

720
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:27,630
Could you just not say anything to me today?

721
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:30,980
I mean, they are the ones who did wrong.

722
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,780
So why are you acting like this just to me?

723
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,690
So cute.

724
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:49,680
You look like a baby when you smile,

725
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,170
when you usually look scary.

726
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,690
This is . . .

727
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:30,880
The place we came before. Room 303.

728
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,870
Oh. You said you don't remember, right?

729
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:41,990
Driver. Could you make a stop here?

730
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:57,520
I'm sorry. You find your way home from here.

731
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,910
What?

732
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:02,120
What now? Did I do something wrong again?

733
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,300
Nope.

734
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,970
It's because I feel like I will do something wrong.

735
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,640
What?

736
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:12,200
If we continue to stay together, I think I might jump you.

737
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:14,740
What?

738
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:21,290
Oh, also, it wasn't number 303. It was 304—our room.

739
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:35,160
What the heck!

740
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,820
So she remembered.

741
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,800
Wow, she's a complete fox.

742
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,930
The sky is nice.

743
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,490
Look at the micro-dust.

744
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,490
What is it?

745
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:14,190
What else? Dating location.

746
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,960
What?

747
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,580
Stop frowning. I'm joking.

748
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,260
Come here.

749
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,880
See? I told you, it's great.

750
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,470
It's been a while since you've done something like this, right?

751
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:40,410
Yeah..

752
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,500
It been years since I've seen

753
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,110
Seoul's night skyline.

754
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:52,770
Isn't it wrong that you've only seen this after years, even though you just got married?

755
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:55,530
Don't you go on date with your husband?

756
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:59,980
Ah, well... We do...

757
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:03,980
Like what? Drinking beers at home? Watching TV?

758
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:07,700
Or drinking beers at home while watching TV?

759
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,670
Hey, Bok Nam.

760
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,090
Yes?

761
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:23,510
At first, I thought that you were just messing around.

762
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:25,940
You are younger than my brother,

763
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:29,010
so I just saw you as cute.

764
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,350
However, I don't think I can continue thinking that you're messing around.

765
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:39,570
It's pretty, the night view

766
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:42,060
and your heart for bringing me here.

767
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,030
However, it's supposed to feel pretty,

768
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:47,820
and happy,

769
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,800
but it doesn't feel that way.

770
00:57:54,500 --> 00:58:00,740
I'm starting to feel uncomfortable around you.

771
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,030
Is it because of your husband?

772
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,080
No.

773
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,980
It's because of me.

774
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:19,280
These actions of yours, whether they are just kindness or light joking,

775
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:24,310
either way, I'm a married person now,

776
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:28,380
so it makes me uncomfortable.

777
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:32,980
Even looking at this beautiful night view,

778
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:38,890
my heart feels uncomfortable.

779
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:46,320
Then... What if you weren't married?

780
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,680
Then would it look pretty? The night view?

781
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:56,030
And would my effort make you happy, too?

782
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:58,730
Yes.

783
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:03,480
I would've probably been happy right now.

784
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,260
If I wasn't married.

785
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:11,730
How can I not be happy when a young, handsome man took me out

786
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:14,300
to look at this beautiful night view?

787
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:17,180
Young, handsome man?

788
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:23,900
You know it, too, even without me telling you that you're young and handsome.

789
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,730
It's written all over your face,

790
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,440
"I know I'm handsome",

791
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,190
"I'm handsome, right?", and stuff like that.

792
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,860
I-It's that obvious?

793
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,120
Yes.

794
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:42,610
Then, I'm sure it got a bit annoying at times.

795
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:44,170
A bit.

796
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,920
I guess it is obvious...

797
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:12,000
♫ I'll borrow your warm shoulders briefly ♫

798
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,240
♫ Please be my resting place  ♫

799
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:20,940
♫ To my tired and worn out soul ♫

800
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,710
Take it.

801
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,780
"The End of the World Girlfriend" by Kim Yeon Soo

802
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:38,380
I made a delivery to a bookstore and bought it thinking of you.

803
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:41,650
I heard that writers read a lot, right?

804
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:46,280
Ah...I heard from our boss that you were a former scriptwriter.

805
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:51,860
Do you like this writer? This is from one of my favorite writers.

806
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:54,320
I don't know since I don't read a lot.

807
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,170
I just bought it because the cover looked pretty.

808
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:01,370
I didn't read a lot nor did I study a lot either.

809
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:03,620
I was just simple like that.

810
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:06,290
So, don't find me uncomfortable.

811
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:11,050
I know what you were trying to say today.

812
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:14,520
I didn't have any serious intentions, honestly.

813
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,260
I just found you, the noona that I work with, cute and easy.

814
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:22,400
I just wanted to get close to you by drinking out together and look at the night view after work.

815
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:25,260
Easy?

816
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:29,220
You know that well without me telling you that you're easy and cute.

817
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,460
Revenge?

818
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,730
Yeah, revenge.

819
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:44,190
Okay. Then after work, we can go grab a beer together from now on.

820
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,320
I'll speak informally to you now, since I'm an easy noona.

821
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,620
See you tomorrow.

822
01:01:54,730 --> 01:01:57,600
But if you leave after changing so suddenly...

823
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:07,660
- Oh, you're home?
- Yes.

824
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:10,540
- Kitty...
- Kitty puked again.

825
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:14,390
- Did you take her to the hospital yet?
- No, not yet, because of the company.

826
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:18,130
I guess I must take her tomorrow then.

827
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:21,750
If you're busy, then I'll take her.

828
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:25,160
I can talk to Bok Nam and ask to change my working time.

829
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,090
I'll take her.

830
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,070
It's fine.

831
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:34,530
It's not something that was written in our contract, so you don't have to do that.

832
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:38,220
I will just use my lunch time.

833
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:43,140
Okay.

834
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,630
Today...

835
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,360
Did you get home from the bus?

836
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,830
What?

837
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:59,440
Did you get home using the bus?

838
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,490
Ah...

839
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:09,840
However, do I have to answer that?

840
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:17,730
It is not necessary to.

841
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:20,690
I agree.

842
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:47,990
- You must just got home.
- Yes.

843
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:52,110
Ah, I just dropped her off since it's dangerous to walk alone at night.

844
01:03:55,160 --> 01:04:00,310
Since it's dangerous, please don't take her home anymore.

845
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:04,060
- Pardon?
- Since it might be more dangerous with you taking her home,

846
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,000
I'm telling you to not do it anymore.

847
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,090
Why not? Do I seem like a dangerous person?

848
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,820
Because I have nothing to accomplish, so I'm escaping?

849
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:20,730
I guess what I said made you very uncomfortable.

850
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,740
That's not what I meant.

851
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,870
I'm just saying that a motorcycle could be more dangerous.

852
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:29,390
It's my choice to take her home using my motorcycle, not yours.

853
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:31,160
No.

854
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:35,630
It's not yours nor mine, it's Ji Ho's choice.

855
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:40,170
What rights do we have to decide what type of transportation she takes?

856
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:45,290
I am just merely giving my opinion.

857
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:48,200
Since she can't say "no" easily,

858
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:53,350
I hope that you don't tell her to get on first.

859
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:06,390
I guess it's really because you studied a lot. Your logic is top-notch.

860
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,900
But I'm different from you in that I didn't study a lot and I'm illogical.

861
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:22,020
I must have whatever I want.

862
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:35,720
Since I can't contact our Boss,

863
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:39,290
I'm going to send you the complaints today.

864
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:51,660
YOLO, 24
Reporting Reasoning: Stalking

865
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,980
Author's Note

866
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:00,230
I am skeptical that I can understand others...We often misunderstand others

867
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:04,820
It's great.

868
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,960
We often misunderstand others.

869
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:37,270
We can't say that we understand how another feels.

870
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:43,430
Instead, we should say that
[You only love one
♥ Bok Nam ♥]

871
01:06:43,430 --> 01:06:45,870
we also don't even understand what others are saying.

872
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,900
If we don't try,

873
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:56,890
we won't be able to understand each other.

874
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:07,060
♫ In so much time  ♫

875
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:13,690
♫ Those days that graze by and are gone ♫

876
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:23,100
Because This is My First Life

877
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:25,470
That is really expensive. Aren't you curious how much it cost?

878
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:28,260
No, not really. How much is it?

879
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,930
- Isn't that a lot?
- No.

880
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:31,540
Well, it wasn't as much as I thought.

881
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:33,830
That's got to cost at least as much as a mid-sized sedan.

882
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:36,670
I am a CEO of a start-up company. It's called, "Get Up".

883
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:39,660
However, why did you make an app?

884
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:41,230
Does that make money?

885
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:45,280
Since today's our first day dating, I'll only give you one flower.

886
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,940
What's wrong with you?

887
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:50,330
The report was on stalking. Where and who is the person who reported it?

888
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:54,860
I'm also trying my best to avoid situations where we have to act like a married couple.

889
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:58,130
I can fix a motorcycle and a woman's heart, too.

890
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:03,530
Do you think your husband will come running here if something were to happen?
