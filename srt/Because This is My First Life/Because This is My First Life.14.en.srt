Ji Ho, where are you? I'm out in front of the house.

8
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,970
Ack.

9
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,560
Hi.

10
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,740
Oh. Hi.

11
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,490
You live here? In this neighborhood?

12
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,990
Yup.

13
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,700
What about you? What are you doing here?

14
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,470
I-I was just passing through this area.

15
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,200
I see.

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,740
Should I give you my business card?

17
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,360
Huh?

18
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,110
Oh. Okay.

19
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,950
Let's have a cup of tea later on then.

20
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,880
I'm a bit out of it right now.

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,640
Alright. Let's do that.

22

♫ The road I go alone ♫

23
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,820
Writer, are you alright? Did you get to go the restroom okay?

24
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:16,750
Yes. What about you, CEO? Are you feeling okay?

25
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,630
Oh.

26
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,250
I think I'm all sobered up.

27
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,500
I had fun today, CEO. I'll be going now.

28
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,820
I'll take you to your home.

29
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,820
It's right up in the front and I'd like to walk a bit to sober up too.

30
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,250
Oh. Your husband would be coming out to meet you.

31
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,910
I was dense.

32
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,850

Hello?

38
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,620
Ji Ho. Where are you?

39
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,850
I'm here.

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,340

your phone?

45
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,750
I didn't have a chance.

46
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,450
I'm sorry. I was going to call you.

♫ this love  ♫

55
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:29,560
The liquor went in so smoothly today. I think since it was the first time I drank in a while.

56
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,100
I see.

57
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,100
Did you drink together? The production company . . .

58
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,930
Yes.

59
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,410
CEO is a good drinker too.

60
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,570
Oh, don't drink cold water. Drink this instead or you'll get heartburn tomorrow.

61
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,630
Keep this by your bed and sleep.

62
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,180
You might wake up in the middle of the night from the alcohol.

63
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,260
It's warm.

64
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,570
Thank you.

65
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,800
Good night.

66
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,590
Sleep well.

67
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,780
Ji Ho.

68
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,470
Yes?

69
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,540
Again today . . .

70
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,450
should we sleep together?

71
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,900
Oh.

72
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,500
No. Not today.

73
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,520
Oh. Yes.

74
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,640
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,530
No. It's not that.

76
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,020
I'm just a bit tired today.

77
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,740
On those days, I snore even more.

78
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,370
I understand.

79
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,900
I'll make more tea, so have more if you need it.

80
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,330
Yes.

81
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,230
But I'm not going to get married.

82
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,020
I did it once, something like a marriage.

83
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,930
In this life, this house, Kitty and myself. These three are what I can handle.

84
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,880
We dated and we got pregnant.

85
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,610
Since marriage isn't just about the two people.

86
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,550
It's a system where the surrounding understanding is more important.

87
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,800
When we lost the baby,

88
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,770
we broke up, and his family was opposed to me as well.

89
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,110
As for me, in my life

90
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,630
I would just like nothing to happen.

91
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,130
MY Entertainment, Go Jeong Min

92
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,120
I met the CEO of some drama production company.

93
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,110
She wasn't someone common, that CEO.

94
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,720
She's strong, but how should I say this?

95
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,730
That sturdiness isn't to break her surroundings,

96
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,420
but to embrace it, it seemed.

97
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,650
Someone like a tree, maybe?

98
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:59,660
♫ Just stay still like this quietly  ♫

99
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,740
♫ Like we are together by coincidence ♫

100
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,660
Hello?

101
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,130
It's me.

102
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,730
Yes.

103
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,310
I know.

104
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,380
It's late.

105
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,420
I'm sorry, but I have something to tell you.

106
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,840
Yes.

107
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,060
You starting to write again . . .

108
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,960
Congratulations.

109
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,290
This person is agonizing over it.

110
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,360
For starting again.

111
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,210
He's afraid.

112
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,320
It's really

113
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,180
a relief.

114
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,940
He's anxious.

115
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,740
Thank you.

116
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,210
Sleep well, Ji Ho.

117
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,990
Yes.

118
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,340
You too, Se Hee.

119
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,070
Epiisode 14
Because It's My First Time with Confession

120
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,630
Trim like usual, right?

121
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,070
No.

122
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,470
You're here.

123
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,040
Sorry to call you suddenly when you're busy.

124
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,510
What's there for the CEO to be busy about? It's the employees who are busy.

125
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,380
Wow. Ho Rang, you got a cut.

126
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,420
Oh. Yes.

127
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,610
Recharge my mood.

128
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,250
It really suits you.

129
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,470
About Won Seok.

130
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,450
He's sincere, right?

131
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,280
Please tell me. I also need a final

132
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,200
closure too.

133
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,160
But I had no one else to ask but you.

134
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,220
He's sincere, right? Won Seok.

135
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,870
For now,

136
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,700
yes, I think so.

137
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,770
Then . . .

138
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,430
Even if tried to hold onto him,

139
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,130
he wouldn't return to me, right?

140
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,490
Hmm.

141
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,840
Won Seok

142
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,920
thinks he's making you miserable, I think.

143
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,130
So he seems to have made the decision he must let you go.

144
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,920
It's not that he wants to let go?

145
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,270
Though I don't really know it well.

146
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:26,280
when someone thinks that they are the one causing the person they love to go through difficulties because of them,

147
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,240
I think it makes that person hate himself.

148
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,370
And it's also miserable.

149
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,460
Yes.

150
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,560
It's just... that this was as far as we were supposed to go.

151
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,300
CEO!

152
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,940
Oh! Deputy Shin.

153
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,270
Are you leaving after dropping by the office?

154
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,090
Yes, I had a meeting for the third and fourth quarter financial analysis.

155
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,580
Aren't you going to introduce me?

156
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,370
Perhaps... CEO's...

157
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:11,000
Ahhh, no. She's my closest younger brother's grilfriend... no.

158
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,500
She's my girlfriend's best friend, Ho Rang.

159
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,560
Ms. Yang Ho Rang.

160
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:21,450
Ahhh... So she's your girlfriend's best friend.

161
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,130
Hello.

162
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,190
I'm in charge of CEO Ma's company's finance. Shin Young Hyo.

163
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,020
Ah, yes.

164
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,770
I don't have a business card.

165
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,510
I will be going ahead, CEO.

166
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,410
Ah, right. Ms. Ho Rang.

167
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,200
I will call you. Take care.

168
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,790
Yes.

169
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,040
Yes.

170
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,030
I heard from CEO Ma that you are headed to Silim-dong.

171
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,690
Yes.

172
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:13,890
I will give you a ride. The bus in this neighborhood comes really late.

173
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,010
No, it's okay. You don't have to.

174
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:20,900
I'm not a bad person. I have known CEO Ma for a long time.

175
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,310
You must live there?

176
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,700
No. Just...

177
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,490
I just need to get my things.

178
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,230
I see.

179
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,710
But then, Ms. Ho Rang, do you really not know who I am?

180
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,870
Pardon?

181
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,500
I want to get married.

182
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,060
Huh?

183
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,490
Gyeolmalrae! We chatted on it after you accepted my 'like.'

184
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,790
Ahhh.

185
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,210
Honestly, I was really startled earlier.

186
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,130
I recognized you at first glance.

187
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,710
Yes.

188
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:06,210
After I installed that app, the first person I talked to was you.

189
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,930
But you haven't replied since then,

190
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,540
so I thought I was rejected for sure.

191
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,120
That...

192
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:23,430
That time, I too just registered for the first time so I just replied without any thoughts

193
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,440
since it was CEO Ma's app.

194
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,100
Are you trying to draw a boundary now?

195
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,360
- Pardon?
- What's this?

196
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,980
If you're startled like that, you are acknowledging as such?

197
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,970
For real, an irrefutable part?

198
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,860
Thank you for giving me a ride. Take care.

199
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,560
Yes—

200
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,880
Take care.

201
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,800
Celebrating 100 days, 1 year, 2 years, 1000 days, 5 years.
Let's love forever -Seok, Rang
Honey Hon Hon, I love you. Yang Ho Rang, I love you

202
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,790
Love forever. Seok. Rang.

203
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,460
Honey, Hon, Hon. I love you
Yang Ho Rang, I love you

204
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,510
100th day. At Campus

205
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,200
Our happy home.

206
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,260
100th day, At campus
Let's love forever, Seok Rang
Honey, Hon, Hon. I love you.
Yang Ho Rang, I love you

207
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,040
What you said was right.

208
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,380
Now, I... will be true to my heart.

209
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,900
♫ All has faded ♫

210
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:17,700
♫ those small papers on which I've recorded the days past ♫

211
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,300
Why are you here? You didn't leave?

212
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,050
No, since you said you were here to get your things and I thought maybe they would be heavy.

213
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:28,180
And I noticed you weren't in a good condition since earlier.

214
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,860
Pardon?

215
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,640
Give it to me. I will give you a ride.

216
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,170
No.

217
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,120
I would be too burdened if you do this.

218
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,590
At a glance, it's obvious that you are about to get sick.

219
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:43,420
You've got a body flu, acknowledge to the left, acknowledge to the right, acknowledge to the front?

220
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,740
Pardon?

221
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,390
No, your face shows that you're on the edge of collapsing.

222
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,620
How could I pretend not to notice and just go?

223
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,570
Give it to me, Ms. Ho Rang.

224
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,130
Then, should I?

225
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,650
♫ Though I endure a day like today  ♫

226
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:16,950
♫ Living through each day that keeps coming back  ♫

227
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,170
♫ Like a fool repeating these things ♫

228
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,870
♫ And I stand alone on one side again  ♫

229
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:32,490
♫ Just in case somehow tomorrow might be different  ♫

230
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,870
♫ I cannot even move one step  ♫

231
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,750
The lawsuit, we will proceed with it as we discussed.

232
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:44,300
In the process of investigation, you would have to personally be investigated as the victim.

233
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,070
Are you alright with that?

234
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,660
Yes.

235
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,040
I already know that.

236
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:57,210
Thankfully, you have the call and text records with that assistant director

237
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,220
so it will help.

238
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,500
Just that, once their side starts playing with the media

239
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,220
it will be noisy,

240
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,120
especially since it's in the broadcast field to begin with.

241
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:12,800
Yes. Once it starts I should prepare myself.

242
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,200
Okay. Then we will proceed as is.

243
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,190
And also,

244
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,100
this is the contract.
Program format: 20 70-minute episodes for a mini-series, Pay: 10 million won (~$92,000)

245
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,500
There's no need for you to sign right away.

246
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,650
You can take it and look through it,

247
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,240
and if you want any adjustments to be made you can just tell me.

248
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,420
But then...

249
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,450
the amount is...

250
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,050
Is more negotiation needed?

251
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,300
Ah, it's less than the amount you expected.

252
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,490
No.

253
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,220
I think it's too much.

254
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,050
Writer, you can't be like that.

255
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,660
Pardon?

256
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,830
Even if you are surprised, you should go out and be surprised on your own.

257
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,870
We are doing a contract, so how could you show what you feel in front of an enemy?

258
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,040
CEO, you are not an enemy though.

259
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,980
It's not a lot.

260
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,750
By our company's standard, that is the starting for newbie writers.

261
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:41,480
Honestly, our company doesn't sign contracts with writers that much.

262
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,760
But if we do, we do it the right way.

263
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,590
If we think it's a person we will be working with for a long time.

264
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,210
CEO.

265
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,650
Yes?

266
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,360
Today...

267
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,110
should we eat?

268
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,460
Sure.

269
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,560
Remember

270
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,560
Rather than a lot of projects, good projects are more important.

271
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,260
"My dream was to become a writer at first."

272
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,860
Aren't you greedy for money? / Yes, I am very greedy about money. I grew up in a very poor family. I started this line of work because I needed "money" right away.

273
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,430
What is that? / In this world working for money is the easiest thing. Of course, there are things you can't put a monetary value on. You shouldn't just say it's good or valuable. Sometimes you must show it.

274
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,690
Go Jeong Min

275
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,780
Writer, did you cure your hangover this morning?

276
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,510
I drank warm honey water before sleeping

277
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,860
and it was okay.

278
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,420
Ahh. Did you husband prepare it for you?

279
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,630
Yes.

280
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,290
My husband...

281
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,800
prepared it for me.

282
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,960
Before we sign a contract, I have something I am curious about.

283
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,050
Yes, Writer?

284
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,820
Regarding the person you told me before.

285
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,480
The one you almost married.

286
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,370
Yes.

287
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,500
If you were to meet him again,

288
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,300
how do you think it would be?

289
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,830
Even if you meet him again,

290
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,930
do you think you will love him still?

291
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,760
This...

292
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,870
is this question related to the contract?

293
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,990
Yes.

294
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:24,220
It is an important question that is related to the contract.

295
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,160
Honestly, I met him.

296
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,300
That friend.

297
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,030
The day when we went to your neighborhood,

298
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,850
that day,

299
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,450
by coincidence.

300
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,830
That's why right now, your question is a bit...

301
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:00,980
all the more

302
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,980
strange, I feel.

303
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,610
For me, on that day...

304
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,690
He came to get me.

305
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,370
Se Hee did.

306
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,140
The way I see it, you have never faced the world properly.

307
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,590
Using the company as an excuse and your mom as your shield,

308
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,840
you lived only criticizing the world.

309
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,270
For once, grab the world and stand properly in front of it

310
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,370
and face it head on.

311
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,040
That's what I think you must do.

312
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,450
And when you start, I will be by your side to hang in there with you.

313
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,410
Have you been to K Ventures again today?

314
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:15,810
Yes, I had some additional investments to discuss with them.

315
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,450
Okay. Work hard.

316
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,630
That... Deputy Park.

317
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,530
Would you like to smoke a cigarette with me?

318
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,620
Right now?

319
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,100
Yes.

320
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,560
No. I'm okay.

321
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,500
What do you want to say?

322
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,290
It was 2015 when I came to this team

323
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,120
and it's already been three years that we've worked together.

324
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,460
If you calculate it by work days it would be 800 days.

325
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,560
If you calculate it by time it's 7,200 hours.

326
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,830
- Is that so?
- Yes.

327
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,120
But you know, those many hours,

328
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,560
for me, in general, it was horrible.

329
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,700
- Horrible?
- Yes.

330
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:13,750
If it was a day where we would have a company dinner I would be pondering how I should smile to your sexual innuendos.

331
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:20,080
And if it was after my vacation, you would probably ask where I went with my boyfriend.

332
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,240
Then what would I give as an answer?

333
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,480
When I didn't feel good, I'd be afraid that you'd ask, "Is it that time of the month?"

334
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,340
So I couldn't even act as if I was sick.

335
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:36,020
So when I think about you, all I have is just horrible and painful memories.

336
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,870
But you are still a colleague that I've worked with for 7,200 hours.

337
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,160
Isn't that so sad?

338
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,930
Well. So what do you want to say?

339
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:52,300
About all the hurt that I have received all this time

340
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,260
I want you to apologize.

341
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,000
What?

342
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,470
I need to receive an apology

343
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,660
from you.

344
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:04,600
In a place where all the people from our team are present, please apologize officially.

345
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,490
Apologize?

346
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:12,930
I really want to end this horrible connection with you.

347
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:17,940
Today, I gathered all my sincerity to talk to you, so

348
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,840
please show your sincerity, too.

349
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,840
Then, I will be waiting.

350
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:36,630
♫ The leaves are "swish swish" (Woo Soo [Ji]) falling

351
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,490
Soo Ji, why? Did something happen?

352
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,850
No.

353
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,730
It's nice to see you.

354
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,560
Why are you so cute?

355
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,840
What you said was right.

356
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,220
I just avoided it and cursed.

357
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,890
I have never conversed with Deputy Park while looking at each other.

358
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,610
He is someone's son and a family's head of household though.

359
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,880
My Soo Ji is really cool.

360
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,190
This punk! Come here!

361
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,040
What's wrong with you?

362
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,360
You don't like this?

363
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,150
No.

364
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,050
So you don't like it. At least not yet.

365
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,130
Go Jeong Min?

366
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,300
Go Jeong Min

367
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,780
Jeong Min?

368
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,730
Go Jeong Min

369
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:35,700
How in the world... could the two meet like this?

370
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,330
Sister-in-law— No.

371
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,390
Does Ms. Ji Ho know?

372
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,660
Well, how could she know?

373
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,160
This unbelievable situation.

374
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,480
So they are working together?

375
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,290
Probably.

376
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,530
Shouldn't you be the first one to tell her about it?

377
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,580
It's not even a job where they can bump into each other once in a while.

378
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:07,670
If it's a production CEO and the writer, then they would see each other a lot.

379
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,440
What...

380
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,050
should I say?

381
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:21,400
How much should I tell her?

382
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,220
That she was someone I dated long ago.

383
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,190
Or... that time I spent with her was stained

384
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,880
with my pride and my foolishness?

385
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,340
Whatever I say, she would get hurt

386
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:44,130
because Ms. Ji Ho is a transparent person.

387
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,790
To add my stain to her transparent self...

388
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,090
I don't want that.

389
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,800
I didn't mean Ms. Ji Ho, though.

390
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,060
I was talking about Jeong Min.

391
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:08,040
I was going to ask how you are going to explain Ms. Ji Ho to Jeong Min.

392
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,840
You... it wasn't that you couldn't forget Jeong Min?

393
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,920
Isn't that why you

394
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,180
married with a contract?

395
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,750
After all, Ms. Ji Ho

396
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,120
has just a contractual relationship with you.

397
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:31,520
Wasn't she just a tenant to you?

398
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,530
So you weren't worried about Jeong Min.

399
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:59,060
♫ Let me briefly borrow your warm shoulder ♫

400
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:05,380
♫ please be a shelter for my tired soul ♫

401
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,160
I had thought that as we lived on,

402
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:13,000
that one day, I may meet her (Jeong Min) again.

403
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:18,130
I even practiced.

404
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,550
How are you?

405
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,200
It's been a long time.

406
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,010
However, from the moment I saw her,

407
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,000
what I was most worried about

408
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,450
was only one person.

409
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,230
Just how... ?

410
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:39,360
When did it start?

411
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,030
The only thing that was left in my life

412
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,770
was just dried leaves.

413
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:55,050
That is what I thought.

414
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:01,790
That for the remainder of my life, I would only spend waiting for those leaves to fall.

415
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:07,640
That if I lived on, quietly, alone, then that would be fine.

416
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,460
That's what I thought.

417
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,360
♫ please be a shelter for my tired soul ♫

418
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,580
♫ Let me briefly leave my wounded heart in your care ♫

419
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,760
To be in a position to make decisions that affected another person's life,

420
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,060
I didn't want to do that anymore.

421
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:30,910
♫ all you have to do is to give it a quick glance as you pass by ♫

422
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,950
"Although Nothing Changes If You Cry About It" by Poet Park Joon

423
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:43,120
Causing someone to cry, I thought there would never be any reason, ever again.

424
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,780
That is what I thought.

425
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,620
Here he comes. Unit 401!

426
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,720
What about Se Hee-nim?

427
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,610
Ahhh, he left work already.

428
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,310
Are you thinking of screwing up our company's program just because of your ex-girlfriend?

429
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,430
After just two weeks of employment?

430
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,920
Pardon?

431
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,900
Ahh. I'm sorry.

432
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,410
No.

433
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,390
But how did you know?

434
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,700
How could I not know? It's written all over your face.

435
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,700
My face?

436
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,240
Break ups happen when people date.

437
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,420
Why are you making it so obvious?

438
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,010
It's not like it's your first time dating.

439
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,790
I dated only once, though.

440
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,500
Ah. Is that so?

441
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,780
Then,

442
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,700
it must have been your first time doing that, too?

443
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,970
What? What is my first time?

444
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,300
What would I mean? I mean breaking up.

445
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,970
You worked hard. Goodbye.

446
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:24,870
Ms. Ho Rang, you seem to be very busy.

447
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:27,230
Did you go home safely that day?

448
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:31,160
If you are not busy, how about dinner tonight?

449
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,890
Ms. Ho Rang!

450
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,210
I'm not late, right? The moment you replied I started the engine.

451
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:07,090
Yes.

452
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,640
You must be hungry. What would you like to eat?

453
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,090
Never mind food. How about a simple beer?

454
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,600
Beer?

455
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,470
I am in total agreement with that one.

456
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,680
Let's go.

457
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,520
Cheers.

458
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:40,150
Wow. You must've been very thirsty.

459
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,050
Did you go home safely that day?

460
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:50,220
I had a boyfriend for seven years.

461
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,810
However, recently we broke up.

462
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,760
To be honest, the day you gave me a ride

463
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:03,070
was to the house that we shared up until now.

464
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,760
Ah.

465
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,460
However...

466
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,120
How could you have so little luggage?

467
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,060
What?

468
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,160
It's understandable.

469
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:24,990
Even if you date for a long time, when you break up, there isn't really that much stuff to pack.

470
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:29,360
Ah, I also dated my first girlfriend for seven years.

471
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,260
However,

472
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,060
why did you two break up?

473
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,330
We just fought a lot because of the topic of marriage.

474
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:45,990
Turns out, dating and marriage are very different.

475
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,000
So how are you planning to overcome this situation?

476
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,360
What?

477
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:04,230
Your break up. Have you come up with a plan on how to overcome it?

478
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,970
Well, I don't really have one as of now.

479
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,860
Well, time is medicine, they say.

480
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,140
How can time be medicine?

481
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,830
Time is just merely time.

482
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:25,160
The thing I hate most are these don't-go-over, triple, tuna board cliched phrases.

483
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,090
You can't get fooled by these cliches, Ho Rang.

484
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:32,950
Don't-go-over, triple, what?

485
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:38,300
You see, for a person, when they really want something, they have to speak it aloud in order for it to happen.

486
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:43,870
So every morning, noon, and night, I would say my wishes out loud looking at my reflection in the mirror.

487
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,870
So what did you say?

488
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:51,350
"I can forget her. I can overcome this breakup."

489
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:56,460
Like a zombie spirit, I will end this for all and get the whole world.

490
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,530
Please don't say those multi-syllable words in front of me. I'm not that smart, so I don't understand those.

491
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:09,490
Ah, those aren't multi-syllable words. Those are abbreviations that young people use these days.

492
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,100
What?

493
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,050
No. Why do you say those types of things?

494
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,370
It makes me feel better.

495
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,650
It also makes me feel younger.

496
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:42,610
Uhm, I've been here before.

497
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,890
Director Gye Yong Seok

498
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:47,730
Some man told me this was for Unit 401 and left it here.

499
00:40:47,730 --> 00:40:49,260
Okay.

500
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,830
Since you told me not to call you, I'm leaving your bag here.
Gye Yong Seok

501
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,940
I'm sorry.

502
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,720
Yes.

503
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,320
I know

504
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,510
that you came before to leave some luggage.

505
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,010
I see.

506
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:10,080
I didn't know she got married.

507
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,570
I'm sorry.

508
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:19,100
I just had a lot of drinks that night, so I don't really remember.

509
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,730
I'm being serious. Please believe me.

510
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:26,310
I will do whatever I can to make up for it. I will pay you as much settlement money as you want...

511
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,970
So, first, could she please withdraw the criminal complaint?

512
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:38,330
I need to work on this new project.

513
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,060
What?

514
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,790
I had a dream about me walking alone

515
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:51,140
in an endless tunnel.

516
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,200
I... well...

517
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,260
I thought you knew about it.

518
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:12,150
I think this is something that I need to talk to her about directly.

519
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:15,070
Then, sorry for bothering you.

520
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,190
I'll talk to her.

521
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:27,300
Sit down.

522
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,450
You will talk to me.

523
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:32,280
Properly. And everything.

524
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:36,010
Thank you

525
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,450
for telling me something that's hard to share with anyone.

526
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,940
I also have something I'm curious about.

527
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,370
If I met Se Hee again, would I love him again.

528
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:59,120
If my answer was yes,

529
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,420
what would your conclusion be?

530
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,660
If that was your answer,

531
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:10,380
I would probably end up being your enemy.

532
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,280
Then were we supposed to be fighting?

533
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,000
Right here, grabbing each other's hair?

534
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,680
I would probably have waited

535
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,720
for Se Hee's heart.

536
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,930
You would've waited.

537
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,140
Why? Is it because it's a contract marriage?

538
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,840
Even if it was a real marriage,

539
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,520
I would've done the same thing.

540
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:51,290
Being a married couple doesn't mean

541
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:55,280
you automatically have all of each other's heart.

542
00:43:56,830 --> 00:43:59,290
Is that so?

543
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:04,920
However, honestly, isn't that what marriage is?

544
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,200
Isn't it an institution to show that you have each other's heart

545
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,030
and are officially declaring it?

546
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:18,640
So even if you have a change of heart, it ties you down and makes it hard for you to leave.

547
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,890
I'm not quite sure

548
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,720
since this is my first time getting married

549
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,780
and experiencing love, too.

550
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,730
So there are a lot of things I don't know,

551
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,420
but there's one thing I'm sure of.

552
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,890
A heart isn't something that is taken or grabbed.

553
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:50,920
It just comes to you.

554
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:04,770
Please keep it a secret from Se Hee that I know about this.

555
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,950
Be well.

556
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:35,060
Go back and live like nothing ever happened

557
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:40,360
Instead, don't ever love anyone.

558
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:45,790
You have no right to.

559
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,440
I know, right?

560
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,500
A heart wasn't something to be stolen or grabbed.

561
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:01,250
Imagine, she already knows that.

562
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,700
I'm envious of you, Writer.

563
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,390
Your phone call was long.

564
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,790
Ah, yeah. It was the lawyer.

565
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:18,090
There was a problem with Writer Yoon's criminal charge with that guy.

566
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:19,360
What?

567
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,590
What happened?

568
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:22,540
About that...

569
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,290
That Assistant Director must've gone to find her to beg her to drop the criminal complaint,

570
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:29,690
but he got beaten up. Pretty badly, I hear.

571
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:32,220
By whom?

572
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,930
Writer Yoon's husband.

573
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,680
What?!

574
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,300
He...

575
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,350
hit a person?

576
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:42,010
It's been a long time.

577
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:45,920
Deputy Park, you did well this year. Let's have a good year next year, too.

578
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,700
Hey, should we all have a toast? Fill your glasses.

579
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,370
Everyone fill their glasses.

580
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:53,990
You should give the toast, Deputy Park.

581
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,660
Alright!

582
00:46:56,530 --> 00:47:03,580
There is not much more left of 2017. Our Team Leader, who we respect, we love you!

583
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:07,330
And our business team family, this year, you have all worked so hard.

584
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:12,820
With love in our hearts for our Team Leader, when I say, 'Team Leader!' you say,

585
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:17,090
'We love you.' You got that?

586
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:19,620
Ah, that's right, the apology.

587
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,100
I'm sorry, Deputy Woo.

588
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:26,640
I've been a bit mischievous, haven't I? Well, take a drink and let's forget everything, okay?

589
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:29,760
All together now. Team Leader,

590
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,940
- I love you!
- I love you!

591
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,790
Drink up.

592
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,720
Where shall we go for the second round?

593
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,790
Did something happen between you two?

594
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:45,610
No. Nothing happened. Drink.

595
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:48,650
Drink, drink.

596
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:50,860
Have a glass.

597
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,720
Chief.

598
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,160
Okay, I'm leaving first.

599
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,330
- Have a goodnight, Team Leader.
- Don't be out too late.

600
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,510
- Goodbye.
- See you!

601
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,490
How about we have a round 2, Deputy.

602
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,990
Deal!

603
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:07,300
Let's have some beef sashimi and afterwards, karaoke, deal?

604
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,340
Karaoke, deal!

605
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,100
I'm going to stop by the office really quick.

606
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,020
Wait for me!

607
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,940
- Okay!
- We'll wait for you there!

608
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:24,060
Yes, a deserted island.

609
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,030
Whose turn is it now?

610
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:31,220
Yes, Baby?

611
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,120
Language was created for humans to communicate with each other, right?

612
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,160
That's right.

613
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,280
If you can't use words to communicate with it, it's not human, is it?

614
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,750
Of course. If words don't work, then it is not human.

615
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:45,190
Either they are an animal, insect, or water flea. But why are you asking all of a sudden?

616
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:51,190
Oppa, were you sincere when you said you'll have my back once I begin?

617
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,660
Of course, I was sincere.

618
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,280
- Take your turn.
- Hurry and roll the dice, CEO.

619
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,390
CEO.

620
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:01,320
All right, roll the dice well.

621
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,460
I love you.

622
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,090
Hello? Hello, Baby?

623
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,760
What was that?

624
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,480
She's speaking like it's her last will and testament.

625
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,860
- It's your turn, CEO.
- Hurry up.

626
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,740
Is that Seoul?

627
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,050
No way...

628
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,250
No, no, no, no!

629
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:37,790
What do you mean no? You have to buy Seoul now, CEO.

630
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,060
That scaredy cat, seriously.

631
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:05,720
Deputy Woo needs to show her body in her profile picture.

632
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,750
B? B? No, no no.

633
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:11,590
A full A. A very full A.

634
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,900
If only I wasn't married,

635
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,220
together with Deputy Woo... Yeah?

636
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,260
Oh? Deputy Woo, why did you come here?

637
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,510
There's something I need to settle.

638
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:39,060
Is that so?

639
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,410
Jin Ho!

640
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,900
What?

641
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:49,580
Ouch.

642
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,590
Oh.

643
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:08,000
Here it goes.

644
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,630
Tak, tak, tak. Pak. I'm buying Taipei.

645
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,570
I was going to buy that though.

646
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,630
They say that a place where when the tiger (horangi) is not around the rabbit plays king.

647
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,580
What? Is this all Won Seok-nim's land?

648
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:22,300
- Yeah.
- Whoa. We really raised a baby tiger (horangi).

649
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,770
That's why you should have bought it earlier.

650
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:27,570
You need to get in the tiger's (horangi) den in order to catch the baby tiger (horangi).

651
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:28,860
Let's stop playing this now.

652
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,870
Why? It's getting fun.

653
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,680
What's fun about it? We're not even kids. We just play stuff like this every day.

654
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,780
Let's go have a drink. My treat!

655
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,970
Really?

656
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:37,620
Your treat?

657
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,840
Yes. I will treat everyone today. Let's have a crazy night.

658
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,110
Then I will be going first.

659
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:45,290
No, Bo Mi-nim should come too.

660
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,220
No thanks, I have an appointment today.

661
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,720
At this time, what appointment?

662
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,790
Should I call it an appointment with myself?

663
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,660
Have fun. I will be going first.

664
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:00,380
Ah! It's Friday, right? Bo Mi-nim must be going to Itaewon again.

665
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,290
Itaewon?

666
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:03,950
There's a famous figure shop there.

667
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:07,570
Every Friday she calls it an appointment with herself. I think she must be geeking out at that shop.

668
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:10,900
Ah. It does suit her well.

669
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:15,830
Ah! Since you mention Itaewon, should we go to a club just us guys?

670
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:18,270
C-Club?

671
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:21,400
Yeah. Club. What's the point of leaving our perfectly fine bodies?

672
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,410
We should play hard while we're single, isn't it so?

673
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:27,500
Oh, it seems like you go to clubs a lot.

674
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,160
I haven't gone even once.

675
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:53,360
- I think my ears are going to bleed.
- I didn't know it would be like this either.

676
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:57,250
Ah! I think my eyes are going to bleed.

677
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,990
Let's not stay here. Let's go down there and have fun!

678
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:12,220
No.

679
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,360
You should go ahead.

680
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,990
Then I will play downstairs so follow me later.

681
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,850
Yes. Yes.

682
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:19,010
Then I will be going down.

683
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:20,860
Yes.

684
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:31,230
Yang Ho Rang, I will forget you. Yang Ho Rang, I will forget you!

685
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:35,250
I will forget you!

686
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,590
Oh.

687
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,930
Oh?

688
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,720
Him? What's with him?

689
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,470
Oh! Bo Mi-nim!

690
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,890
Get down!

691
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:38,100
Hey, I'm so scared.

692
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,810
Then do you want to go to the internet cafe? Let's go!

693
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:46,020
No...

694
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:49,680
You said you had an appointment!

695
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:54,420
On the stage, you talk with your body and not with your mouth.

696
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,410
Body?

697
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,730
Mr. Se Hee

698
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:19,890
Can you do me two favors?

699
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:22,840
Ji Ho, later on

700
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,630
when she says she wants to write
[Assistant Writer: Yoon Ji Ho]

701
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:29,260
can you allow her to do so?
[Assistant Director: Gye Yong Seok, Kim Seong Mi / Assistant Writer: Yoon Ji Ho]

702
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:32,740
Even if it's later on, so that she can be able to write
[Assistant Writer: Yoon Ji Ho]

703
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:38,050
so she doesn't give up on her dreams.

704
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:40,760
So that she doesn't live like her mom.

705
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,150
Please do that.

Korean & Leading Writers

Excuse me.

716
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:48,670
Perhaps, do you have this book?
"Although Nothing Changes If You Cry About It" by Poet Park Joon

717
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:53,230
Ah, the one that was here got sold today.

718
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:56,660
Ah. Thank you.

719
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:05,750
Yes.

720
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:09,610
Hello, Father-in-law.

721
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,460
A bit...

722
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:22,170
you hit him a lot.

723
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:26,040
Will it cause problems

724
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,190
for Ji Ho?

725
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:31,820
I think it will be okay.

726
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:35,650
Just in time, I just met the CEO from that side.

727
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:40,380
We know each other from before, so he won't make it into a bigger problem.

728
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:43,720
Okay. Thanks.

729
00:57:47,570 --> 00:57:49,360
That...

730
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:53,830
Me being Ji Ho's husband,

731
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,690
does that

732
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:58,380
affect you?

733
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:01,890
And on Ji Ho's writing career?

734
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:05,760
Is that why you came to see me?

735
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:10,540
Because of the dregs of an old love

736
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,820
that I might ruin Writer's work?

737
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,870
That I might hurt her career?

738
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:17,520
Yeah.

739
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:31,640
When I got married, there's a favor that Ji Ho's mother asked of me.

740
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:36,370
When Ji Ho would want to write again

741
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:39,940
she asked that I allow her to write again.

742
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,800
So that she doesn't give up on her dreams

743
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,780
she asked me to do that for Ji Ho.

744
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:54,820
But honestly, I don't know how to do that,

745
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:00,340
so I just promised that I won't be a hindrance.

746
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:03,100
But

747
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,650
you do know. So that Ji Ho...

748
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:14,140
How to help Ji Ho to not give up on her dream.

749
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:22,720
So that is why you came to see me.

750
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,870
To an old lover who you met after 12 years,

751
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:29,410
and this is all you have to say to me?

752
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,500
I hate you for this, a little.

753
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,690
I'm sorry.

754
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:43,440
But then, there was nothing that I could do.

755
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,570
Why she decided to stop writing,

756
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:50,550
I only found out for the first time today.

757
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:54,240
And the only thing that I could do was swing my fists.

758
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:59,030
I heard that you were a very good producer.

759
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,480
Jeong Min...

760
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:07,410
Not as my wife,

761
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,780
but please look at her as a writer.

762
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,480
I ask that of you.

763
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:21,830
"Words are born from a person's mouth

764
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:24,900
and die in a person's ear."

765
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:31,210
"Although Nothing Changes If You Cry About It" by Poet Park Joon

766
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:37,520
But some words don't die

767
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,910
Be well. Go back and live like nothing ever happened. Instead, don't ever love anyone. You have no right to.

768
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:42,420
and go into a person's heart

769
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,740
and continue to live.

770
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:50,340
Those words that lived in my heart for 12 years,

771
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:52,820
how did they suddenly

772
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,430
disappear completely?

773
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:58,390
I tried so hard,

774
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:01,900
but those words

775
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,220
would not be erased.

776
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:11,060
I have something to ask you, too.

777
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,330
You.

778
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,350
Have you confessed your love to her?

779
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:23,530
What?

780
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:25,320
Confession.

781
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,700
"I like you" or

782
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,940
well...

783
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:36,550
A confession similar to that, have you tried?

784
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,040
No. I just... Must one say those words aloud?

785
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,340
So you haven't.

786
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,550
Do you know that?

787
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:48,880
That you never did that

788
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,570
for me, not even once?

789
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,050
Confession.

790
01:01:55,050 --> 01:02:01,790
♫ among so many hours ♫

791
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:03,130
I will be going.

792
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:04,750
Okay.

793
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:08,770
Words, too...

794
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,960
have to get into a person's heart in order to live on.

795
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:18,470
And you have to get it out of your mouth so that it can go into a person's heart.

796
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:21,490
It was not a coincidence.

797
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:28,500
So now,

798
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,960
drawing a line on purpose,

799
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:34,910
please don't.

800
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:37,770
It was due to those words.

801
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:41,390
It's no one's fault is what I think.

802
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:47,210
Like how some waves just flow by

803
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:51,510
while others break apart.

804
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:58,890
It's just how it is.

805
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:04,100
Her warm words piled up and piled up more.

806
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,180
You too, Se Hee.

807
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:09,500
You shouldn't worry too much either.

808
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,600
Just because you've lived yesterday,

809
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:18,270
it doesn't mean you know

810
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:20,450
everything about today.

811
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:26,520
In my dead heart

812
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:32,200
this word lived.

813
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,570
Woori (we/us).

814
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:40,960
Are you still doing that part-time job?

815
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,890
Oh, yes.

816
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:46,590
But I think I might quit soon.

817
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:50,180
Good. Good thinking.

818
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,280
Yes.

819
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:56,790
After I quit, I think I will start writing again.

820
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,820
By writing, you mean, what?

821
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,740
That drama?

822
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,140
Yes.

823
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:10,540
Didn't you say you quit that? To focus on homemaking?

824
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:13,480
Yes, but

825
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,200
a good opportunity came to me somehow,

826
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,650
so I thought I might try to start again.

827
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,720
What about kids?

828
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:22,820
What?

829
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:25,400
When are you going to have a baby, then?

830
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,730
Oh.

831
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:31,540
I haven't really . . .

832
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:35,370
You should think about having babies, even though work is important too.

833
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:39,190
You're still young but Se Hee's not.

834
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:51,550
Use that to pay off the loan and later on, when you've had a baby, you can use it to supplement the living costs.

835
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:53,090
What?

836
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:56,920
I promised him I would do this when he got married.

837
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:59,450
Oh.

838
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:04,460
I don't think it's something for me to accept.

839
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:06,500
Then who should accept it?

840
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:10,180
Oh. Of course, you should give it to Se Hee directly.

841
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:13,120
What would he and I meet and talk about?

842
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:17,400
If I gave it to him, he wouldn't take it anyway, so it's right for you to take it.

843
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:22,290
The wife taking care of these things behind the scenes is important, too.

844
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:25,790
Let's go now.

845
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:27,940
Wait, Father-in-law.

846
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,170
I have something to say to you.

847
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,980
It's cold, so careful going back.

848
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:01,970
Where are you? Why aren't you coming?

849
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:04,110
Oh, I'll be coming in a bit.

850
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:06,350
What time is it! Hurry and come home!

851
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:11,090
Hey, am I a kid? Don't-go-over, triple, tuna board!

852
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:13,080
See you later!

853
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,230
Over, triple?

854
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:16,250
What tuna?

855
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:20,130
At least it's a relief that she seems to be in a good mood.

856
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,500
Tada.

857
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:33,380
Soo Ji. You know the movie, "The Graduate," right?

858
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:37,250
Of course. It's your favorite movie.

859
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,550
I saw that over ten times.

860
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:43,750
I saw it for the first time when I was a first-year in high school.

861
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:48,140
When Benjamin barged into Elaine's wedding

862
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:51,880
and grabbed her hand and led out, I fell for that scene.

863
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,540
How should I say it?

864
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:59,120
To my seventeen-year-old eyes, that seemed so romantic.

865
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:03,210
That's a famous scene. Lots of parodies were made of it, too.

866
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:05,430
But . . .

867
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:11,540
After I was over 20, I saw it again, and I noticed something different.

868
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:15,880
What?

869
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,550
The two's expressions afterward.

870
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:26,650
After they fled excitedly from the wedding, they rode the bus.

871
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,550
But strangely, the two have no words to say to each other.

872
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:35,590
Feeling anxious and empty.

873
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:38,530
I didn't notice that when I was young,

874
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:43,770
but I started to notice that scene at some point.

875
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:49,840
Why?

876
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:54,630
You see that scene between you and your landlord?

877
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:04,890
Are you having a hard time?

878
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:12,360
Yeah.

879
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:30,600
Yup.

880
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,180
Now?

881
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,980
Alright.

882
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:40,900
It's so cold.

883
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:43,010
Hurry and go on.

884
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,480
Nah. Why?

885
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,780
Hurry and go. CEO Ma's waiting.

886
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:53,330
Then, call me after you've arrived. Okay?

887
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:13,280
What happened? Are you alright? What happened?

888
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,680
Did you do something to Deputy Park?

889
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:19,940
Your way didn't work so this time, so this time, I did it my way.

890
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:22,110
Your way, what?

891
01:09:22,110 --> 01:09:24,720
I punched him hard in his stupid mouth.

892
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:27,720
What?

893
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,320
You did good. Good job!

894
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:30,990
Come here!

895
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:34,650
Hey!

896
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:41,800
Ack.

897
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,150
I only knew after love existed,

898
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:48,380
the reason our marriage was easy

899
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:52,890
was because there was no love.

900
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:56,030
I'll pay for half of your wedding attire cost.

901
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:59,100
No, it's alright. It's not that much anyway.

902
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,330
But you had to pay for wedding shoes and the bouquet, unlike me.

903
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:05,850
So I'll deduct them from next month's rent.

904
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:09,320
Marriage is supposed to be done out of love.

905
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,490
But why . . .

906
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:17,150
Then what about kids? When will you have a baby then?

907
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:21,090
After there is love,

908
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:24,810
why is it that the wounds just get bigger?

909
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,700
Have you ever confessed to her?

910
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:40,080
Do you know that words have to reach a person's heart in order to survive too?

911
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:44,670
They need to come out of the mouth in order to reach the heart.

912
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:48,360
Yeah, I know that too. It's very awkward.

913
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:52,370
But more than I imagined,

914
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,370
it suits you.

915
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,750
Let's give it a

916
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,830
good try today.

917
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:25,030
You went to Soo Ji's?

918
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:29,910
Yes. I had a can of beer.

919
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:32,420
I see.

920
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:51,620
Today, were you able to sign the contract okay?

921
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:57,280
Yes. The CEO is really very nice.

922
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,730
I see.

923
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:01,970
That's a relief.

924
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:08,950
You seem tired.

925
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:15,350
A bit worn out, today.

926
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:30,760
Hey, Kitty! You came out to greet us?

927
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:37,520
I have something to tell you.

928
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:43,210
Yes. I also have something to tell you too.

929
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:56,210
Maybe this isn't very noticeable?

930
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:22,840
- Now—
- We—

931
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:24,280
Oh.

932
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,890
You go first.

933
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:32,040
Yes. So . . .

934
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,030
Now, we . . .

935
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:44,750
No. You go first.

936
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:50,280
Now, we . . .

937
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,340
Our contract.

938
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,640
I'd like to end it.

939
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:09,170
Words are always

940
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:13,270
slower than

941
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:19,680
the heart.

942
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:24,270
♫ Though I endure a day like today  ♫

943
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:31,520
♫ Living through each day that keeps coming back ♫

944
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,740
♫ Repeating these foolish things ♫

945
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:39,530
♫ And I stand alone on one side again  ♫

946
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:44,080
♫ Just in case somehow tomorrow  ♫

947
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,700
The bigger the love, the bigger my disarray.

948
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:49,940
Isn't that Ho Rang?

949
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:51,970
This morning she looked like a duckling who got rained on.

950
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:55,260
Which sentence is less cheezy for confessing?
[Shall we 1. get married now? 2. really become a married couple now? 3. really be together now?]

951
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:58,220
Who else would CEO Ma's friend's friend's friend be?

952
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:02,250
It's me. Would you like to go on a date with me?

953
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:08,610
What exactly is marriage? Do you know it, Se Hee?

954
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:13,290
A marriage out of love would be happy, right?

955
01:15:13,290 --> 01:15:16,250
Woori (us/we)
