1
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,639
Grandma.

2
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,599
What's wrong?

3
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,399
I'm fine now.

4
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,319
This...

5
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,759
is a normal symptom for people with heart disease.

6
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,079
Don't worry about me.

7
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,239

How about this?

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,879
I can wait until Aunt Ta en comes to stay with you first.

11
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,439
By the time Ta en finishes selling her things,

12
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,399
and by the time she gets here, you're going to be late.

13
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,319
Go. I can manage. Just get to school

14
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,399

15
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,079
Are you sure?

16
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,759
I don't have to go to my morning class.
It's not that important.

17
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,239
Why would you skip class for me?

18
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,479
I'm fine now. See?

19
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,479

You promised me

106
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,599
you would handle this matter yourself.

107
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,919
Don't make me do it myself.

108
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,879
Okay.

109
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,439
Everyone,please look at the quotations and invoices of PP Work and VGroup.

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,919
Everyone turn to page 2.

115
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,639
Grandma.

116
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,079
What's wrong?

117
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,199
Your leg hurt?

118
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,319
I fel.

119
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,519
I'm fine now.

120
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,639
How's Grandma doing?

121
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,719
The doctor said

122
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,239
Grandma is safe now.

123
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,119
But...

124
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,119
Grandma's heart is becoming more weak.

125
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,559
The doctor wants to do surgery as soon as possible.

126
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,159
Within this week.

127
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,039
Huh?

128
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,399
I have an urgent matter. Taking an abrupt leave of absence.

129
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,679
Urgent matter?

130
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,239
Is it really urgent?

131
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,159
This woman just straight up lies

132
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,679
How do you know she's lying?

133
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,039
She left with my dad.

134
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,519
That's her urgent matter?

135
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,879
This woman lies.

136
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,359
It's become a habit.

137
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,919
Peem.

138
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,199
I think your dad is serious this time.

139
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,479
Especially if the woman is reciprocating,

140
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,279
I think you're just wasting time.

141
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,159
l'll be honest.

142
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,639
If she has to choose between you and your dad,

143
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,639
she would choose your dad.

144
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,639
He checks off all the lists

145
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,159
Rich, old, has money

146
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,839
Most importantly

147
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,839
he owns PP World while you're just the heir.

148
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,399
No.

149
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,439
I will not surrender

150
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,399
What do you have to compete with the chairman?

151
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,199
I don't know.

152
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,959
But it's time.

153
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,519
I've waited for Dad to realize it on his own

154
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,599
that women only cares about his money not him

155
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,679
But since he can't realize that

156
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,959
I will prove it to him myself.

157
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,559
This is the estimate of the cost of heart surgery for the patient.

158
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,239
Thank you.

159
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,119
Hello M r. Komsan.

160
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,559
He wants to see you.

161
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,879
I thought you already had left.

162
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,439
How's your grandmother?

163
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,879
I heard she has to get surgery

164
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,279
Do you need help with anything?

165
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,039
Thank you sir but..

166
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,639
it's fine.

167
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,799
I can manage

168
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,799
But...

169
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,119
I know that you've struggled in the past.

170
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,079
I'm worried about you.

171
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,519
If possible.

172
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,599
I want to take care of you

173
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,919
I...

174
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,919
intend to...

175
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,679
fight on my own.

176
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,519
I don't want to entrust my life to anyone

177
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,799
I hope you understand sir.

178
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,759
Plubpl a.

179
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,999
I like you.

180
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,079
Sir.

181
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,799
Besides Man ee

182
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,679
no woman has ever been able to complete my heart

183
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,119
Ever since l met you

184
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:32,759
you are the one who fills my lonely heart and makes me happy again.

185
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,079
You really look like Man ee.

186
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,199
I want you by my side

187
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,239
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

188
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,839
So,

189
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,519
what position do you want me to be in?

190
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,879
If you want

191
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,639
I can replace you with Peem's mother, Manee

192
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,359
What about Ms. Supang?

193
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,759
I've never loved Su

194
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,679
We're living separately

195
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,639
She minds her own business, I mind mines

196
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,279
We're only parents to our child.

197
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,999
Okay.

198
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,799
I'm sorry.

199
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,199
But I...

200
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,879
can't accept your kindness.

201
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,919
For me,

202
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,479
love must come from being righteous

203
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,919
Not by stealing someone.

204
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,999
I'm sorry l have to be honest.

205
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,879
Excuse me now.

206
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,199
Kom san.

207
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,439
Plubpl a doesn't know that the more she rejects me

208
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,839
the more I like her.

209
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,399
She really is like Man ee.

210
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,078
Where do I get the money for her treatment?

211
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,479
You won't pick up?

212
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,599
How dare you?

213
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,479
Mr. Peem, the chairman is back

214
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,439
Usually when Dad leaves with a woman,

215
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,559
he doesn't come back this quickly

216
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,599
Did something happened?

217
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,759
What is it Plub?

218
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,479
You're going to pay Su thee back?

219
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,239
Tre.

220
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,639
Right now Grandma is..

221
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,519
at the hospital.

222
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,199
Huh?!

223
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,999
Hospitalized again?

224
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,639
Don't tell me.

225
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,039
The doctor said the medications aren't working for her

226
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,279
What the hell?!

227
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,159
Tre.

228
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,879
Can you talk to Su thee for me that I...

229
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,839
want to borrow money from him for her surgery?

230
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,879
Whatever.

231
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,119
If you keep bringing problems for us,

232
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,359
get a divorce then.

233
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,359
Then leave this house.

234
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,799
Tre.

235
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,919
Well,

236
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,039
Su thee is short on money right now.

237
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,279
He doesn't have that much cash on him.

238
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,279
He...

239
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,599
He really doesn't have money?

240
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,959
Why?

241
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,479
You don't believe me?

242
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,359
No.

243
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,999
I wasn't thinking like that.

244
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,199
Do you have any options to help?
I'm going blank right now.

245
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,159
What?

246
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,359
That's a lot of money.

247
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,759
I don't have any.

248
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,239
So what do we do?

249
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,359
If Grandma doesn't get the surgery

250
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,119
Grandma can get a heart attack any time and die.

251
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,279
Look Plub.

252
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,239
I'm always home. Where do I even get the money from?

253
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,399
It's much easier for you to earn some money.

254
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,799
You don't know how to use your beauty for your benefit

255
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,759
Tre.

256
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,439
You want me to sell my body?

257
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,319
If it's necessary

258
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,479
then you have to do it

259
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,479
I thought you said you love Grandma?

260
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,799
Tre!

261
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,879
Right.

262
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,439
Why don't you borrow money from Mr. Puchong?

263
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,319
He likes you, no?

264
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,359
He might even give you the money for free.

265
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,119
That's enough!

266
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,439
If you're not gonna help,can you not'say things to hurt my feelings?

267
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,479
Honey.

268
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,079
I don't know what's wrong with our daughter.

269
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,399
She locked herself in her room and refuses to come out.

270
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,159
What?

271
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,719
Who made my daughter unhappy?

272
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,239
-Let'sgo!
-Peem!

273
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,719
I said I'm in a hurry!

274
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,199
I can walk on my own!

275
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,479
Hurry!

276
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,839
It's her first day with him

277
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,199
and they're holding hands going out to eat!

278
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,199
It's not just that.

279
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,479
Mr Peemhad themmove Plubpla's
desk inside his office too!

280
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,879
Dad!

281
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,719
Who made my daughter be in a bad mood like this?

282
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,319
Dad.

283
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,919
How are you?

284
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,039
When did you get back?

285
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,039
I didn't hear the car

286
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,159
You were busy being upset that you didn't hear the car

287
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,559
Dad.

288
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,119
Did someone at the company upset you?

289
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,879
Was it Peem?

290
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,159
I'll handle it.

291
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,359
No Dad!

292
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,519
It's not Peem!

293
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,199
Geez!

294
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,159
You're quick to defend him

295
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,199
It's the truth.

296
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,759
The person I'm irritated at is me

297
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,919
I was stupid

298
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,279
to believe a low-class woman like that.

299
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,279
Who?

300
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,439
I'll handle it for you

301
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,479
It's fine Dad.

302
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,639
I can handle it myself

303
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,519
You don't have to do it for me.

304
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,279
Are you sure?

305
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,319
Let me know when you do need my help

306
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,599
I'm always ready to help my dearest daughter.

307
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,799
Thank you Dad

308
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,679
Don't be mad anymore.

309
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,399
I'm not mad anymore

310
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,359
What are you doing Plub?

311
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,639
Is something wrong Grandma?

312
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,839
Are you hurt anywhere?

313
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,399
I'm fine dear.

314
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,399
Is something wrong with you?

315
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,279
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

316
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,679
What were you looking at?

317
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,839
I...

318
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,359
was thinking about work

319
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,519
Plub.

320
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,199
Can I not get the surgery?

321
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,879
Why?

322
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,439
I thought you said you weren't scared?

323
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,239
I'm scared.

324
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,079
Scared that I will make my grandchildren struggle.

325
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,599
Why are you talking like that?

326
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,679
What do you mean struggle?

327
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,639
We're going to struggle if you won't be here with us.

328
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,359
Having surgery...

329
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,799
cost a lot of money.

330
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,399
Where will you get the money from?

331
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,959
It will be Su thee that will loan us some money

332
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,399
Really?

333
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,519
We have n't paid him back for the other loan.

334
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,759
He's letting us borrow from him again?

335
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,359
Yes.

336
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,879
I have a good job right now

337
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,039
Regardless,

338
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,679
I will pay him all back

339
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,319
Grandma.

340
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,959
Please get the surgery.

341
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,279
You don't have to worry about anything

342
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,879
My grandchild.

343
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,959
Don't cry.

344
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,999
Go to sleep now.

345
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,679
The nurse will come scold me again

346
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,079
H Hom

347
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,279
Sa!

348
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,999
When did you get here?

349
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,439
What were you doing sleeping here?

350
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,439
I stayed up late watching a football game sol fell asleep.

351
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,279
So,

352
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,279
what are you doing here so early?

353
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,839
I'm heading to work sol came to ask Pe em for a ride

354
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,919
I heard you're working at my dad's company.

355
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,759
Yes.
**

356
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,479
When will you go back to finishing school?

357
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,959
No.

358
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,719
Too lazy.

359
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,159
I don't like it.

360
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,439
That's a pity.

361
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,039
When we went to school together, I remember-that you were a very smart student.

362
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,679
You're a heavy sleeper.

363
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,079
How's it going?

364
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,679
Sa.

365
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,799
Is Pete p ranking you?

366
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,199
What do you mean p ranking?

367
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,119
I'm not a kid anymore.

368
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,119
Pete said he won't go back to school.

369
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,799
J just feel regretful for him

370
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,799
If you finish school and come to manage the company like Peem,

371
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,919
it would be so cool.

372
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,279
It's useless telling him Sa

373
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,279
I've been complaining too much about it with him

374
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,799
I'll be behind anyway.

375
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,519
Why should I go back?

376
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,159
Do you want me to tutor you?

377
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,079
I'll think about it.

378
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,359
Come on Sa. Let's head to work.

379
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,599
Okay.

380
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,879
I'll take off now.

381
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,199
See ya.

382
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,119
Quickly court her.

383
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,399
Otherwise your brother is going to take her first.

384
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,199
What are you talking about Mom?

385
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,599
I know

386
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,159
that you have a crush on Usa for a very long time

387
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,519
But I give you the green light on her.

388
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,039
Because if you get to marry Usa

389
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,759
her father might push you to manage the company in Peem'splace.

390
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,359
In the end,

391
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,599
you only care about the company

392
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,839
and inheritance.

393
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,679
But it is a pity

394
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,519
that Usa

395
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,599
likes Peem instead!

396
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,839
Yeah I know.

397
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,239
I'll have my secretary handle it.

398
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,639
Well,did Pete decide to come back to school?

399
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,839
That's great!

400
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,279
Thank you so much for persuading Pete into going back to school.

401
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,319
Go.

402
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,559
You should get to work.

403
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,599
Okay.

404
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,599
I will make Peem see my worth on my own, Dad

405
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,399
Peem will see that I am better than that woman.

406
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,039
Hey.

407
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,079
Tre.

408
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,399
Why did you come so late?!

409
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,959
I have class in the morning!

410
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,679
Hey!

411
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,639
I came as quickly as I could!

412
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,799
It's fortunate that I woke up this early for you

413
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,359
Where did Plub go?

414
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,999
Why isn't she watching Grandma?

415
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,199
Plub has work.

416
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,959
Who would be available like you?

417
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,079
This boy!

418
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,879
Damn you Plub

419
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,759
I thought you said you love and care for Grandma?

420
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,039
I will submit the matter to the head office for you Plub

421
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,079
Yeah.

422
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,679
Thank you so much

423
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,599
But don't get your hopes up.

424
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,879
To be honest,

425
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,559
the economy isn't good right now.

426
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,719
Banks don't lend much because they're afraid of high debt.

427
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,159
I understand.

428
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,999
I'm going to go send the email now.

429
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,479
I think you'll get a response in the afternoon.

430
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,319
Thanks again.

431
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,399
What is it Kwang?

432
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,279
Took the whole day off.

433
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,239
Haven't had enough or what?

434
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,239
Peem.

435
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,639
Don't wake up the chicken.

436
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,719
Come in.

437
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,079
You're back to work?

438
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,519
Yes.

439
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,839
I'm sorry I took an abrupt leave.

440
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,199
-My gra --
-I saw your note.

441
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,079
It was an urgent matter.

442
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,199
I don't mind.

443
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,479
Okay.

444
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,359
But l won't let you take the day off today

445
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,839
because l have a job for you to do

446
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,119
What is it?

447
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,879
Is that you Tre?

448
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,359
Grandma.

449
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,959
You're awake?

450
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,638
Slowly.

451
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,279
Are you hungry?

452
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,799
I'm not.

453
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,638
Plub brought me breakfast this morning

454
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,559
When did you come?

455
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,879
A while.

456
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,359
How are you feeling?

457
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,079
I...

458
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,799
feel much better.

459
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,559
I haven't thanked you yet.

460
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,439
Thanked me?

461
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,959
For what Grandma?

462
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,719
About the money for the surgery.

463
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,479
Money for surgery?

464
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,158
Yeah.

465
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,678
Please tell Su the e I said thank you

466
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,399
Gosh, we still owe him from the previous loan.

467
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,039
Now he is lending us money for the surgery too.

468
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,239
What?!

469
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,639
Su the e lend you money for the surgery?!

470
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,439
Yes.

471
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,639
You didn't know about this?

472
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,719
Oh.

473
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,199
Right.

474
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,039
Su the e lend you the money for your surgery.

475
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,039
He's a very good man

476
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,679
A good husband.

477
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,439
You must take good care of him.

478
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,079
Yes.

479
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,399
Tong.

480
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,559
You're not going to school today?

481
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,039
The professor canceled class today.

482
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,959
Sol came back to keep you company.

483
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,879
Good.

484
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,639
Then...

485
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,799
Grandma.

486
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,399
I have errands to do.

487
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,079
Have Tong stay with you.

488
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,999
-I have to go.
-Tre.

489
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,999
My goodness.

490
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,399
This person comes, that person goes.

491
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,759
You siblings don't get to talk to each other

492
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,839
What's there to talk about Grandma?

493
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,399
Has Tre ever seen me as her brother?

494
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,439
Tong.

495
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,799
There's nothing more important than blood.

496
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,839
Don't talk like that.

497
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,399
It's true Grandma.

498
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,959
Just accept it.

499
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,399
Plub.

500
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,039
You ungrateful sister.

501
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,799
You must have begged Su thee until he gave you the money.

502
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,719
Good.

503
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,679
I'm not going to tolerate it today.

504
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,039
Kwang

505
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,559
The reason he won't let me take the day off

506
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,439
is because I have to follow him around like this?

507
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,239
Mr, Peem is usually not like this

508
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,239
Did you do something to upset him?

509
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,079
I didn't do anything

510
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,159
Whatever. It's better to endure than getting fired.

511
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,119
Endure it.

512
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,279
This zone here will be for display

513
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,119
It will be children's merchandise

514
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,839
to encourage children and parents to spend as much time in the mall as possible

515
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,679
While children are playing

516
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,959
the parents will spend money to stimulate our sales.

517
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,279
But I think putting this box here is dangerous

518
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,319
If a child runs and bumps into it,

519
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,479
what happens then?

520
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,239
I'll have them move it out.

521
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,279
No need.

522
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,799
For this simple task,

523
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,239
Ms. Plub pla can do it.

524
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,639
Pardon?

525
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,479
Can you move this box

526
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,879
to somewhere else?

527
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,039
I don't know an appropriate place for it.

528
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,479
Well,

529
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,039
use your senses.

530
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,679
Okay.

531
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,879
I'll give you

532
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,519
ten minutes.

533
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,199
There are a lot of people that could do this.

534
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,359
Why is it stuck?

535
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,679
What's this cord?

536
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,999
Why is it here?

537
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,119
Good thing there aren't kids around here

538
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,799
So long.

539
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,279
Just do what I told you to do.

540
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,359
I'm going to charge you more for this!

541
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,919
Stay here.

542
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,239
What are you doing?
