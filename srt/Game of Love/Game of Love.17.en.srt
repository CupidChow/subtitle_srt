1
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,509
Thank you.

2
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,094
I'll walk you out Officer.

3
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,095
This way please.

4
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,934
What did the police say?

5
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:29,231
The police said it was an act of intentional harm with intent of robbery

6
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,819
You're lucky Mr. Peem went to save you in time.

7
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,865
I guess the plan to go on a yacht to celebrate

8
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,200
is canceled then?

9
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,034
No!

10
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,371
I've prepared everything already

11
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,789
Tre.

12
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,457
Mr. Peem is injured.

13
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,210
How can he have fun celebrating?

14
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,004
It's okay.

15
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,964
I'm not in that much pain.

16
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,093
What yacht?

17
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:58,386
Yeah.

18
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:00,846
Well,

19
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,848
I wanted to thank you

20
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:06,227
for trusting my company to collaborate with you.

21
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,395
so,

22
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,397
Tre had an idea

23
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,315
She wants to celebrate on the boat

24
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,653
I've prepared everything for you already

25
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,987
Therefore,

26
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,698
it can not be canceled.

27
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,465
You're here.

28
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:37,550
Yes.

29
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,634
Where are the others?

30
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,637
I thought they would be coming with you?

31
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:43,931
No.

32
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:44,682
Really?

33
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,183
I'll call Tre.

34
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,312
Plub.

35
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,357
Can you go on behalf of me and Su thee

36
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,360
and take Mr. Peem on a yacht ride?

37
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:57,987
Tre.

38
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,282
Are you crazy? You're going to let me go on this boat ride with him alone?

39
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,033
It'll be fine.

40
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,076
Just go with that

41
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:11,876
I think

42
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,378
it's your sister'splan

43
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,046
to let us be together

44
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:24,346
But if you're uncomfortable to go on this ride with me, Ican go alone.

45
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,975
Uh...

46
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,935
That's okay.

47
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:30,895
I...

48
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,563
I have nothing to do anyway

49
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:34,523
Let's go.

50
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,150
Okay.

51
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,860
Where's...

52
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,903
the driver?

53
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,071
Me.

54
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,167
How can you let P lub

55
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,795
go to the beach with Peem alone Orn?!

56
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,254
Who says alone?

57
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,632
Tre and Su thee are probably there too by now

58
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,843
More importantly, they went there for work, not trip

59
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,178
N ARE LOVED What did you want me to do?

60
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,014
You don't know anything, do you?

61
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:08,766
It's...

62
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,267
Tre.

63
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,560
She's the troublemaker.

64
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,729
What do you mean?

65
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,439
Tre

66
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,318
is rooting for Plub to date Peem!

67
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,154
I knew it.

68
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,241
I was wondering why she wanted to take her son to the beach.

69
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,201
Excuses.

70
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,161
Hey.

71
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,247
Call Plub right now

72
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,457
Tell her to be careful.

73
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,919
Don't give herself a chance to be alone with Peem.

74
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,587
Wait.

75
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,713
If possible

76
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,757
have her come home right now

77
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,384
Call her!

78
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,183
Well?

79
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,895
It won't connect.

80
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,438
Did you dial the right number?!

81
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,190
I think there's no reception there.

82
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,734
I'll call.

83
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,874
Same thing for me

84
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,253
Where is Plub?

85
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,505
Why can't we get a hold of her?

86
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,430
Is this really a good l idea?

87
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,931
Yeah.

88
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,642
It feels rude for some reason.

89
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,811
We invited them.

90
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,439
Trust me.

91
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,108
Mr. Peem told me himself

92
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,861
he wants to spend alone time with Plub

93
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,738
He doesn't want us to go with them

94
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,408
I'm not hungry.

95
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,701
Excuse me.

96
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,335
You can keep feeding our son.

97
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,586
I'm not hungry either.

98
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,338
I'm gonna go discuss work.

99
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:04,798
Enjoy your food son.

100
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,228
What's wrong with both of them?

101
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,152
Your wife is doing too much

102
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,073
How can you just let her do whatever she wants?

103
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:36,288
I just think Mr Peem has feelings for Plub too.

104
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,334
Whether he does or doesn't.

105
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,628
we came here to work

106
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,340
Not come here to have your wife set her sister up with a rich man.

107
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,051
So disgusting.

108
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,531
It's okay.

109
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,700
Don't be in a bad mood.

110
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,369
I think it's a good thing

111
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,621
The two of us

112
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,666
haven't come to a romantic place like this in such a long time.

113
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,960
Opportunities like this

114
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,546
don't come around easily.

115
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,091
As for the other stuff,

116
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,634
just let it go.

117
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,513
Let's have our own happiness instead.

118
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,809
I...

119
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,144
will relieve your stress.

120
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,695
How could you fail with just one girl?!

121
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,740
Have your skills gone down now Was u?!

122
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,366
I'm sorry sir.

123
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,869
I don't know how Mr. Peem showed up

124
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,495
He saved her in time.

125
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,080
Damnit!

126
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,916
So what are we going to do next?

127
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,002
Do you want me to wait here

128
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,754
and find another way to handle her?

129
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:07,921
No.

130
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,299
It's too risky.

131
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,551
They're probably more cautious now.

132
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,344
You should come back.

133
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:15,596
Yes, sir.

134
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,564
What did you have Was u go do?

135
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,275
You don't need to know.

136
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,363
Be careful. It's almost election day.

137
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,491
I know!

138
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,661
How's our daughter?

139
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,872
Still moping in her room.

140
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:42,956
She refuses to come out.

141
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,821
This spot here is the most beautiful viewpoint on this gulf

142
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,198
I used to like coming here before

143
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,158
I would even sleep out here sometimes.

144
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,828
Right.

145
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,205
This area

146
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:25,332
is really beautiful.

147
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,252
Should we park here?

148
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,003
Sure.

149
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,489
Here, let me wipe it for you

150
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,121
Go play first.

151
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:05,914
Who is it?

152
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,085
Hello.

153
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,086
Tre.

154
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:12,629
It's me Yot.

155
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:14,590
Yot.

156
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,424
What do you want?

157
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,258
Tre.

158
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,593
Where's Plub?

159
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,344
Why can't I get a hold of her?

160
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,813
Plub is in the pool with her nephew.

161
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,856
Why?

162
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,068
Tre said

163
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,905
P lub is playing in the pool with Sako o

164
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,744
Tre.

165
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,205
P lub is really okay?

166
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,706
Yeah.

167
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:48,665
Okay.

168
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,792
When P lub is available,

169
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,044
have her...

170
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,837
call me back.

171
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,507
I know!

172
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,805
Why should I tell her?

173
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,398
Your sister prepared everything, food and drinks.

174
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,234
Thank you.

175
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,570
Well?

176
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,489
The sunset here is beautiful huh?

177
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,450
Yes.

178
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,455
When I feel uneasy or in distress,

179
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,707
I would come and get some natural energy here.

180
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,459
I think

181
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,630
the more we're closer to nature, the smaller we feel.

182
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,716
Same goes for suffering. It'll get smaller too.

183
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,595
I didn't know you had these kinds of thoughts

184
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,307
What do you see me as?

185
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,309
I'm kidding.

186
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,020
But thanks for the advice.

187
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,441
I think you do like her

188
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,495
You feel better now?

189
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:10,956
Yeah.

190
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,958
A little.

191
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:14,960
Hey.

192
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,628
If Plub comes back

193
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,839
we should try to convince her to quit her job

194
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,966
and apply somewhere else.

195
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,968
It's just..

196
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,553
I'm afraid

197
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,097
if she's still working for Peem,

198
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,349
someday she will let her guard down

199
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,309
Yot.

200
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,145
You don't think that

201
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,315
the reason Plub can't walk away from Peem

202
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,358
is because deep down

203
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,320
she likes him too?

204
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:42,654
Hey.

205
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,281
That Peem guy

206
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,867
will never like Plub sincerely

207
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,411
I won't let it happen either.

208
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,916
But you can't force love

209
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,836
You had that experience before.

210
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,049
She's the officer's giri friend?

211
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,641
Just smile a little!

212
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,978
Yeah.

213
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,355
I'll take off then.

214
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:18,940
Drive safe

215
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,860
Don't stress about it.

216
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:35,123
Eavesdropping on conversations is rude, Mr. Neighbor!

217
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,465
And someone who has a boyfriend already

218
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,009
but pretends to be single and flirt with other people,

219
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,512
they're called polite?

220
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,472
Who are you referring to?

221
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,768
Someone who pretended to drop their earring lin my car just to try to flirt with me.

222
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,561
Here you go.

223
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,192
It really did drop in your car.

224
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,864
Geez.

225
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,409
I don't know when that happened.

226
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,912
Probably when you hurried out the car.

227
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:19,626
Anyway, thank you for finding it.

228
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,919
No problem.

229
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,965
- Now if you'll excuse me.
-Since you're already here

230
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,801
would you like to have coffee with me?

231
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,762
Coffee?

232
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:32,055
Yes.

233
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:37,769
Sure.

234
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,070
You have a boyfriend and yet flirt around.

235
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,072
Women nowadays are scary

236
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,881
So you knew this whole time

237
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,341
but pretended not to?

238
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,395
My first time here

239
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,813
was with my mother.

240
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,942
But after that, I would come here often when I miss her.

241
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,239
You probably

242
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,699
love her a lot.

243
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,747
But she probably loves me less than she hates Dad.

244
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,540
That's why she never came back.

245
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,669
May be

246
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,880
your mother

247
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,217
has her own reason.

248
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,054
I tried thinking like that.

249
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,224
I don't want to be mad at her like lam with Dad.

250
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,271
I understand.

251
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,942
Even if we are mad at everyone in the world

252
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,236
it doesn't compare

253
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,074
to being mad at the person we love the most.

254
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,288
You understand?

255
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,881
I used to be mad at my mom

256
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,222
when she asked for a divorce from my dad when he was sick.

257
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,518
She gave me a choice

258
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,436
who lwanted to live with.

259
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,272
Tre chose to go live with...

260
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,610
Mom who has a rich husband and me and Tong

261
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,364
chose to live with Grandma and Dad.

262
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,455
And...

263
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,835
why didn't you choose to go live with your mother?

264
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,837
If your stepfather is rich,

265
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,505
you would have had an easy life

266
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:19,556
I think

267
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,809
being rich

268
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,478
doesn't always make you happy.

269
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,566
I think happiness

270
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,777
is where the heart is.

271
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,992
You're right.

272
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,497
was born into a family that is rich

273
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,292
I'm not happy.

274
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,630
Did you know

275
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,882
the first time l met you

276
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,635
I thought of you as a woman

277
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,887
who was after money

278
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,014
You would do everything

279
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,932
to get rich the quicker way

280
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,934
like certain women l don't like.

281
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,438
I know.

282
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,900
You were very obvious about it

283
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,570
But...

284
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,116
after getting to know you better,

285
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,663
you made me realize

286
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,041
not every woman has a life like yours

287
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,543
as I thought.

288
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,215
You changed my mind.

289
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,972
Should I be happy?

290
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,543
Plubpla.

291
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,212
I'm sorry

292
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:19,217
forever looking down on you

293
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,136
For mistreating you

294
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,930
Can you forgive me?

295
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,478
Sure.

296
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,691
But...

297
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,819
can you

298
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,322
stop pretending to pursue me as well?

299
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,244
You think

300
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,455
I'm...

301
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,999
pretending to court you for fun?

302
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,001
Yeah.

303
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,587
You

304
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:00,008
just wanted to pursue me to defeat your father, that's all.

305
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,553
At first, I did.

306
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,600
But right now I feel

307
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,060
I actually like you.

308
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,249
Mr. Peem.

309
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:34,626
We should head back

310
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,173
Why don't you'trust me?

311
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,927
I won't let you go either.

312
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,556
Until you believe that I really do like you

313
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,438
It's not that I don't believe.

314
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,651
But...

315
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,581
Mr. Peem don't.

316
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:15,583
Don't stop me.

317
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,214
I really do love you, Plubpla.

318
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,505
Please reciprocate my love, Plubpla.

319
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,715
The boat hasn't returned yet.

320
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,093
That means Plub and Mr. Peem

321
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,638
have gone far.

322
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,815
Can't you sleep here with me tonight?

323
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,193
I can't.

324
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,445
Tre will get suspicious.

325
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,410
There, there.

326
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,079
Don't sulk.

327
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,666
I'll find an excuse

328
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,751
to take a trip with you alone.

329
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,670
For one week.

330
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:25,505
Hmm?

331
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,761
I have to go now

332
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:34,639
Okay.

333
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:10,800
Hey.

334
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,802
You're not asleep yet?

335
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,847
What about you?

336
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,849
Where have you been all day?

337
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,644
I was working.

338
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,355
I just finished getting out of a meeting.

339
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,898
With Mr. Ohm?

340
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,483
The two of you?

341
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:30,945
Yes.

342
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,114
I brought work here with me.

343
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,824
I was busy.

344
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,950
Really?

345
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,245
You guys didn't go out and fool.

346
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,667
with those women wearing a two-piece on the beach?

347
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,504
Look.

348
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,340
Have lever took interest in those women?

349
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,260
Okay then.

350
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,598
It's late.

351
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,807
Mr. Peemand Plub

352
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,392
didn't come back yet?

353
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:02,935
Not yet.

354
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,646
Still?

355
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,315
It's really late.

356
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,275
Did something happen?

357
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,777
Try calling them.

358
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,111
Look S u thee.

359
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,363
We don't have to

360
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,533
They might just want to star gaze by themselves.

361
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,953
I know

362
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,997
that you like Mr, Peem.

363
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,083
You want him as your brother in law.

364
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,251
But your sister is a woman.

365
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,838
Letting her go out with a man at this hour,alone,

366
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,215
it doesn't look good.

367
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:35,093
So what? P lub is a grown up. She's not a kid anymore

368
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,053
I'm just worried about her.

369
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:38,387
Worried or jealous?

370
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,101
Okay.

371
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,812
Up to you. I won't get involved then.

372
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,396
She's your sister.

373
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,608
I'm going to go shower.

374
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,035
Let's wait until Plub and Mr. Peem sleep together first

375
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:03,955
Then you will have no more hope

376
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,284
Where are you going?

377
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,203
I won't let you go.

378
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,252
It's morning.

379
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:55,006
I think we should head back to the hotel.

380
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,467
What's the hurry?

381
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,303
We don't have anything to do today.

382
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,347
I still want to stay with you on this yacht.

383
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,558
still want.

384
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,394
Don't.

385
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:15,026
I don't want other people to suspect we spent the night

386
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,279
Why not?

387
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,448
We're adults.

388
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,825
It's too soon.

389
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,493
If we love someone,

390
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,995
there's no need

391
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,371
to hide it.

392
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,002
I don't think l it's too soon either.

393
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,295
Because...

394
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,965
it took you a long time to soften up to me.

395
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:54,899
What is it?

396
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:58,945
A braided ring.

397
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,322
I made it myself.

398
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:05,368
When did you had the time to do it?

399
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,205
When we were at the fishermen village.

400
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,874
I saw the kids doing it

401
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,335
sol made one for you

402
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,090
Why does it have to be a ring?

403
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:31,269
Well...

404
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:32,895
this ring will be

405
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,190
a promise

406
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,609
that I will love you forever

407
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,325
Thank you.

408
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,329
Your turn.

409
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:05,970
My ring is loose.

410
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,556
Squeeze it in more.

411
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,438
I'm sorry, I didn't take measurements first.

412
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,028
I love you too.

413
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,326
Peem!

414
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,051
Hey.

415
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,846
You came up with the plan to have me be alone with Mr, Peem,didn't you

416
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,930
What plan?

417
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,058
My son was whining

418
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,226
Sako o is scared of boats

419
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,394
He didn't want to get on

420
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,520
You're lying.

421
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,813
I don't believe you.

422
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,733
Fine.

423
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,611
Mr, Peem

424
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,239
asked me to help because he wanted to be alone with you.

425
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,325
Sol helped him. That is all!

426
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,245
-He said that?
-Yes!

427
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,123
He asked me to come talk to you

428
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,459
so you can come here with him alone.

429
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,755
I think Mr. Peem

430
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,715
is crazy about you

431
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,759
How did it go?

432
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,552
How far did you guys go?

433
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:29,887
Nothing.

434
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,099
Nothing happened between me and Mr Peem.

435
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,892
Just tell me.

436
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,227
I won't tell anyone.

437
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,437
I said nothing happened so nothing happened!

438
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:39,522
Fine!

439
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,982
I won't ask any more

440
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,237
But lill tell you something Plub.

441
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:48,697
If you get to be his wife.

442
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,784
you'll have it easy for the rest of your life.

443
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,121
Therefore, trap him

444
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,455
Got it?

445
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,878
Plub!

446
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:05,798
Pretending to be mad

447
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,176
I'm making your life better.

448
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,977
Peem.

449
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,979
Tre confessed to me

450
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,523
that you asked her to convince me to come here with you.

451
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:26,610
I'm sorry.

452
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,029
What about us being on the yacht together?

453
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,698
Was that your plan too?

454
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:32,950
No.

455
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,743
I don't know anything about that.

456
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,538
Are you sure?

457
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,332
Yes.

458
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,334
I wouldn't dare trick you to that extent.

459
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:51,177
I just want to spend some time with you

460
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,928
Don't be mad at me.

461
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,597
Please?

462
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,891
You understand right?

463
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,479
Don't do this again next time.

464
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,607
I don't like being deceived.

465
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,485
Okay.

466
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,197
I won't do this again, babe

467
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,283
Then...

468
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,871
I'll let you punish me.

469
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:21,916
How?

470
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:24,710
Like this.

471
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,592
Peem!

472
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,345
-Who punishes each other like this?!
-Why not?

473
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,973
I'm not staying here!

474
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,382
Why is it locked?

475
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,732
All done.

476
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,609
Now,

477
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:35,239
I just wait for Mr Peemand Plub to be alone together.

478
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,145
Gosh Yot!

479
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,813
Stop walking son

480
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,733
We're getting dizzy over here!

481
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,652
Plub will be back.

482
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,238
Come sit here and relax

483
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:17,906
Grandma.

484
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,994
Plub will be back today?

485
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,455
Of course.

486
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:28,208
Plub called earlier and said she left that place already

487
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,628
Be patient. She will be home.

488
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,046
She called earlier?

489
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,964
It's evening right now.

490
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,635
Rayong and Bangkok are close to each other.

491
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,263
What's the driver doing?

492
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,473
Why aren't they here yet?

493
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,904
. Hey Plub!

494
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,575
Look at him!

495
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,577
Right in front of Grandma T hip!

496
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,286
Look at him!

497
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,455
Look at what he did!

498
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,670
Thankyou for dropping me off

499
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,131
I don't want to part ways yet.

500
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,676
Let's go riding for a couple more rounds.

501
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,386
We can't.

502
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,512
Why?

503
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,889
I'm going inside the house

504
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:26,558
Then,

505
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,143
can l give you a kiss on the cheek?

506
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:45,160
Yot!

507
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,036
What are you doing to Plub?!

508
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,037
Yot!

509
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,415
Hey Yot!

510
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,332
-Yot!
-What the hell is wrong with you?!

511
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,083
What are you doing?!

512
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,042
Yot!

513
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,503
Stop it right now Yot!

514
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,757
What did he do to you?

515
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:01,719
Do what?

516
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:02,928
He --

517
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,763
I saw him reached over --

518
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,014
What's going on?!

519
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,975
What happened?!

520
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,394
-This guy was --
- Nothing happened Aunt Ta en!

521
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:12,229
Plub.

522
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,564
Go carry my bag.

523
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:19,361
Yot.

524
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,242
Hello.

525
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:31,206
You must be tired. Why don't you go inside and have some water.

526
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,000
That's okay Grandma

527
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,128
Mr, Peem has to get going.

528
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,047
Please.

529
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,799
Go. I'll call you.

530
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,099
I'll take off now.

531
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,809
-Bye.
-Bye.

532
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:18,212
Let's go.

533
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,755
Let's go inside

534
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,548
Come Grandma.

535
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,468
Let's go inside.

536
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,276
Yot.

537
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,028
There you are.

538
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,780
I thought you went home.

539
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,241
I was waiting for you

540
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,203
Do you have something to tell me?

541
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,623
No.

542
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:55,707
What is it?

543
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,251
Well,

544
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,212
what was Peem trying to do to you?

545
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,298
Do what?

546
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:07,594
The seat belt was stuck so he helped me out

547
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,388
Plub.

548
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,181
I'm going to warn you

549
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:12,891
as a friend.

550
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,020
I'maman.

551
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,023
I can see through other men.

552
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,902
Some men treat a woman well,

553
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,072
sweet talk,

554
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:28,365
say they love you

555
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:35,289
but it doesn't mean he will love that woman forever.

556
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,586
You need to be very careful

557
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:46,216
Okay.

558
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:50,387
Thank you so much for your concern.
