1
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,479
Are you sure

2
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,279
you didn't invite him out to talk?!

3
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,199
What hotel will you guys go to next?

4
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,999
P How much I hated you

5
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,239

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,839
I'm sorry.

13
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,239
When it comes to Kit.

14
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,839
I get shaken up.

15
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,839
I don't want you near him.

16
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,759
Because.

17
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,359
you're an employee in my company.

18
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,799
Do you know Mr. Peem

19
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,439
if you had any trust in me

20
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,879
it won't matter who I'm close to?

21
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,319
Plubpl a.

22
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,159
I won't do it again.

23
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,399
I'm sorry.

24
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,398
I won't do it again

25
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,319
What is it?

26
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,759
Pete and Tong?!

27
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,239
Sure!

28
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,199
We'll go there right now!

29
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,519
What's wrong with Tong?

30
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,399
Let's get going.

31
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,919
Excuse me.

32
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,759
What is it Vasu?

33
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,239
Pete fight back!

34
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,919
Get up Pete!

35
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,639
Pete.

36
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,079
What is your problem?!

37
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,719
You can't do that!

38
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,839
You're cheating!

39
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,359
There are no rules!

40
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,999
Alright?!

41
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,719
Bastard!

42
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,879
Tong!

43
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,919
Pete!

44
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,479
-Tong!
-Pete stop!

45
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,999
What the hell is wrong with you?!

46
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,319
-Stop!
-Tong!

47
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,879
- I said stop!
-Tong!

48
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,719
Pete!

49
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,159
I said stop!

50
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,839
Stop!

51
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,719
Pete!

52
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:08,919
Tong!

53
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,559
Stop! Do you not have any conscience right now?!

54
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,639
Stay still!

55
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,959
Tong!

56
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,079
Tat!

57
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,999
Call an ambulance!

58
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,559
Tong! Wake up!

59
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,959
Tong! Hang in there!

60
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,719
Plubpl a.

61
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,399
Excuse us please

62
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,119
Tong!

63
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,879
Excuse us.

64
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:51,839
Peem!

65
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,999
- Calm down!
- Why did you do it?!

66
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,479
Why are you causing problems for me?!

67
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,319
Didn't I tell you not to do this?!

68
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,559
Why don't you listen?!

69
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,119
She won't stop messing with Dad!

70
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,359
She doesn't want to do that.

71
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,119
She's only working for him

72
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,639
It hasn't been that long

73
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,799
and you're si dingiwith them?

74
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,999
I thought you said you will handle that girl?!

75
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,639
Unless...

76
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,079
you also fell for her charms?

77
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,199
Just like Dad.

78
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,479
I just don't like that you don't listen to me

79
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,879
I told you I will handle it

80
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,919
But you got involved and made everything complicated!

81
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,519
It's your fault.

82
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,359
8

83
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,799
I just thought this method will make things end quicker!

84
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,519
From now on

85
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,399
do not disobey my orders

86
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,319
Remember that!

87
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,359
I think someone called the police

88
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,399
What do we do Peem?

89
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,519
We should take Mr. Pete out of here first.

90
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,519
No.

91
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,079
No one is going anywhere

92
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,599
Peem!

93
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,439
The wrongdoer

94
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,759
must get punished

95
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,559
Su thee.

96
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,119
The party tonight was fun. I liked it.

97
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,959
Take me with you again next time.

98
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,039
Sure.

99
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,479
Tre.

100
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:44,959
Yes?

101
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,999
I found out P lub is working at Mr. Peem'scompany

102
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,679
That's right.

103
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,359
It was Mr. Puchong

104
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,599
that hired her.

105
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,319
Plub is talented!

106
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,359
She knows how to use her beauty

107
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,959
Mr. Puchong?

108
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,679
I thought it was Mr. Peem.

109
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,959
Hey.

110
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,479
It looked like Mr. Peem

111
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,839
like s Plub.

112
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,839
Really?!

113
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,399
That would be great

114
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,199
Plub would be lucky

115
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,559
Su thee.

116
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,559
I think

117
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,879
we shouldn't pay attention to other people.

118
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,359
Pay attention to us instead.

119
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,079
Tre.

120
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,679
What are you doing?

121
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,759
Geez.

122
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,679
We have n't made love to each other in so long.

123
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,399
I'm lonely.

124
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,799
Okay?

125
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,879
Tre!

126
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,799
No.

127
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,439
Our son might see us.

128
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,999
It's fine.

129
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,239
He's asleep.

130
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,079
Tre!

131
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,439
I said no.

132
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,919
Tre, no!

133
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,199
Don't.

134
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,439
Stay still.

135
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,039
I'll do it.

136
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,039
No Tre!

137
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,999
I said no Tre! No!

138
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,159
Su thee!

139
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,119
Tre.

140
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,479
Don't do this again.

141
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,439
I don't like it.

142
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,119
Dad.

143
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,159
Sako o.

144
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,879
What's wrong son?

145
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,519
Why are you crying?

146
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,679
I had a bad dream

147
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,199
It's just a bad dream

148
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,119
It's okay

149
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,399
I can sleep with you tonight if you want.

150
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,319
Let's go.

151
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,559
Don't cry.

152
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,399
Let's go.

153
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,839
Tong will be fine.

154
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,679
It's your guys'fault that my brother ended up like this!

155
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,559
You guys are evil!

156
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,999
All of you!

157
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,119
I'm sorry on Pete's behalf.

158
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,759
If something happens to my brother,

159
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,639
I will pursue the matter to the fullest!

160
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,319
No matter how rich you are,

161
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,159
how much power you have,

162
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,159
or use your connection to twist this case around, I am not going to allow it!

163
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,159
Don't worry.

164
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,919
That won't happen.

165
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,199
I'll make everything right.

166
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,879
I don't believe you!

167
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,399
Didn't you try to make things right before?

168
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,399
But this time,

169
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,319
I won't side with Pete.

170
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,999
If Pete is really at fault,

171
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,239
I will have him admit to everything.

172
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,839
I'll wait and see

173
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,839
Plub!

174
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,679
How is Tong?

175
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,479
I don't know.

176
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,999
Don't worry.

177
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,079
I will be your lawyer and fight this case to the fullest!

178
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,519
You don't need to be scared of anyone

179
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,599
Hey!

180
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,959
Don't think because you're rich, you can be above the law!

181
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,439
How did you know about this?

182
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,999
Yot called me.

183
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,919
I rushed here after finding out what hospital you went to.

184
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,119
How did Yot know?

185
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,719
I didn't call anyone.

186
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,559
How is my brother?

187
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,799
He's safe.

188
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,919
But the doctor wants him to spend the night

189
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,439
Tomorrow he will examine the patient again.

190
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,799
What's up?

191
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,479
Pete got in trouble again?!

192
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,279
If it was really a voluntary fight like you said

193
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,559
then why is only one party injured?

194
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,079
But you seem fine.

195
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,119
If you want my advice as your lawyer,

196
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,799
you should confess the truth.

197
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,279
Don't think just because you were born rich

198
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,999
have money, have power

199
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,199
being privileged, you can do whatever you want to anyone.

200
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,159
In the end, someone else has to come clean up your mess.

201
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,559
You thought wrong

202
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,399
I won't let this happen again.

203
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,959
You're really putting me in jail?!

204
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,519
Pete.

205
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,759
You have to admit your guilt

206
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,719
and learn how to fix it.

207
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,759
Otherwise you will be a cowardice bastard forever.

208
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,559
You really want to live like that?

209
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,399
Hm?

210
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,999
You really want to live that way?

211
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,719
Well?

212
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,039
It wasn't just a normal duel fighting.

213
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,239
I ordered the guys to lock Tong

214
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,559
so I can beat him.

215
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,319
Oh!

216
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,479
Hello Mr. Peem

217
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,159
We meet again.

218
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,359
I was assigned to take on this case

219
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,919
Right.

220
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,759
Feel free to do your job to the fullest.

221
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,519
That's for sure.

222
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,838
Because lam not scared of any one's influential powers.

223
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,759
Good.

224
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,719
Please take over.

225
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,799
Yes sir.

226
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,439
Tat.

227
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,079
Huh?

228
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,239
How did it go?

229
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,319
Pete confessed everything

230
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,639
I'm proud of you

231
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,599
Ill take Pete to apply for bail first.

232
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,359
I'll leave it to you.

233
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,239
Sure.

234
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,239
Come on.

235
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,879
What did you say?!

236
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,319
Pete confessed to bringing his people to beat Tong up?!

237
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,559
At first, I thought it was just a case of a voluntary fight.

238
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,959
But Mr. Pete confessed.

239
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,639
So the blame is entirely on Mr. Pete.

240
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,399
Peem.

241
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,199
It had to be him.

242
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,279
He told Pete to do that.

243
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,199
But Mr, Peem had Mr, Tat post bail for him already.

244
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,639
Peem doesn't wish Pete well like that.

245
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,799
Don't be stupid.

246
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,439
Peem wants Pete to look bad in front of his father and the shareholders.

247
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,879
He gains from this

248
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,999
It probably involves Plubpl a

249
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,839
Plubpl a?

250
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,639
Our source that is at the hospital where Tong is getting treated

251
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,599
said Mr, Peem looked very concern for Plubpl a

252
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,479
It's because of Plubpl a?

253
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,759
Of course.

254
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,799
The person I need to take care of before Peem

255
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,279
are those people

256
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,639
Yes.

257
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,679
I'll go there right now.

258
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,159
Su's secretary.

259
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,319
That means she knows about Pete.

260
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,559
Plubpl a.

261
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,239
Tong.

262
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,719
Rest first.

263
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,679
You should stay at the hospital another night.

264
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,599
The doctor said I'm fine

265
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,799
You should go check on Grandma.

266
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,879
How will you stay here by yourself?

267
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,759
I said I'm fine.

268
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,639
Aunt Tae n is with Grandma.

269
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,839
Don't worry about her.

270
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,159
Why did you do it?

271
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,279
Why go fight those people again?

272
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,679
Pete challenged me first.

273
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,159
He challenged you?

274
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,559
If you didn't care,

275
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,679
he couldn't do anything no?

276
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,839
He said --

277
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,719
Said what?

278
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,759
Gosh! Forget it!

279
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,279
Tong.

280
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,599
Did he threaten you?

281
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,039
He didn't.

282
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,839
He just challenged me.

283
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,999
I didn't like that!

284
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,999
When will you stop misbehaving so I don't worry?

285
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,639
Hey!

286
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,759
Ms. Supang!

287
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,279
What are you doing here?

288
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,679
I heard your brother got injured.

289
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,399
Sol came to visit.

290
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,639
Hey.

291
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,759
What are you going to do to my brother?!

292
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,679
Hey!

293
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,199
Let go!

294
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,679
Hey!

295
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,799
You dare do this in my house?!

296
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,279
I can do more

297
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,759
for my son!

298
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,399
Let go!

299
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,079
Tong!

300
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,599
Hey!

301
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,279
Don't hurt my brother!

302
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,199
Don't be scared.

303
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,999
I just came to see

304
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,799
if your brother

305
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,759
is really injured or not.

306
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,759
But from the looks of it, he seems fine.

307
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,439
Pete got more injured than this.

308
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,719
Do you not remember?

309
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,199
Let go!

310
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,159
Your whole family are thugs!

311
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,239
Plub!

312
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,599
Tong!

313
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,199
Let go!

314
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,919
Tong!

315
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,919
Bye.

316
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,839
Sir.

317
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,399
Kom san.

318
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,519
That bastard son caused trouble again!

319
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,719
You have a smart mouth, don't you?

320
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,199
It's too bad I'm not in a good mood today

321
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,359
If you don't want to get hurt,

322
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,279
withdraw the lawsuit against my son

323
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,359
Call your lawyer right now!

324
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,119
Have you never read a book?

325
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,599
Criminal cases can't be settled out of court!

326
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,839
You have a smart mouth!

327
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,599
-You want to try me?!
-Let Plubpl a go right now!

328
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,879
I said let Plubpl ago

329
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,039
Did you not hear me?!

330
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,639
Let go!

331
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,359
Peem.

332
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,639
Don't get involved in this!

333
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,799
Let Plubpl a go.

334
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,519
If there's nothing else,

335
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,639
I'd like to take my client now.

336
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,079
Go ahead.

337
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,359
Let's go Pete.

338
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,679
Wait.

339
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,399
Yes?

340
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,039
Next time,

341
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,839
he gets into another fight,

342
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,039
he can't post bail.

343
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,839
Pete.

344
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,239
Where did Peem go?

345
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,079
How are you?

346
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,239
I'm fine.

347
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,199
Tong.

348
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,079
So it's like this

349
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,759
Careful.

350
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,839
Are you okay Tong?

351
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,439
The problem that we have

352
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,879
isn't enough for you yet,

353
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,919
that you had to come cause trouble at their house?

354
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,479
I came here to talk to P lub pla

355
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,279
I wanted to help my son.

356
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,919
But what you're doing

357
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,079
is making things worse.

358
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,559
You're not helping Pete

359
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,079
But you're hurting Pete.

360
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,679
Don't talk smart with me.

361
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,039
If not because of you,

362
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,159
Pete wouldn't give his statement to the police like that

363
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,999
You see that woman better than your brother!

364
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,799
Leave.

365
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,919
Don't bother this family again

366
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,119
Or else Dad will know about this.

367
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,719
If something happens to Pete because of this,

368
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,959
I will have you be responsible.

369
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,919
As for you two,

370
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,999
We'll see about this!

371
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,759
Are you guys okay?

372
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,679
Can we go talk?

373
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,679
Luckily.

374
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,279
you're okay.

375
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,919
Look Mr, Peem.

376
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,239
Don't think that

377
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,799
you doing this, it will change my mind not to sue your brother

378
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,679
You...

379
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,359
never see me in a good light

380
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,399
Because I..

381
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,919
figured you would help your brother regardless.

382
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,159
Yes.

383
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,679
I am going to help Pete regardless

384
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,399
And right now,

385
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,679
I am helping him.

386
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,239
Right.

387
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,479
That.

388
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,039
I am helping him not to become a worse person.

389
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,679
From now on, I won't protect my brother in the wrong way anymore.

390
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,999
As for the case,

391
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,999
you should do what you see fit

392
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,319
I'll leave everything according to the law

393
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,599
Are you serious?

394
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,799
It's my fault

395
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,479
for not being able to look after my brother

396
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,799
I'm sorry again Plubpl a

397
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,799
Does it hurt a lot?

398
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,919
I'm sorry

399
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,519
for getting you guys in trouble.

400
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,639
I won't let it happen again

401
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,319
I will protect you and your family

402
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,479
I promise.

403
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,239
It's fine.

404
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,439
All I'masking

405
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,679
is for your family not to bother mines.

406
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,879
Wait here.

407
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,919
This is Pete?

408
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,559
Who are you?

409
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,279
Someone who is here to teach a spoiled brat like you a lesson!

410
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,079
Privileged kids

411
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,519
who think they have rich.parents with money and power

412
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,719
Do you know how many people like this l've put in jail?

413
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,959
What is your problem Auntie?!

414
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,199
You think I'm scared?

415
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,079
Wai t! Hey! Miss!

416
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,279
You.

417
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,439
Are you here to threaten my client?

418
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,839
Threaten what?!

419
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,839
He was badmouthing me first!

420
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,719
That's not true!

421
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,519
I was just standing here

422
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,639
and then this auntie came out of nowhere and started scolding me!

423
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,119
Hey!

424
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,839
This is the police station

425
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,719
You can't come and cause trouble for my client.

426
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,319
The kid has an adult like you spoiling him like this!

427
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,959
Just wait and see

428
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,519
If you don't want to change yourself

429
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,439
you future will be in jail!

430
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,719
What's it to you Auntie?

431
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,519
Yeah, what's it to you?

432
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,599
I'm Tong's lawyer!

433
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,479
Am I involved now?

434
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,239
Just wait and see.

435
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,959
I will pursue this matter to the fullest!

436
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,239
Stupid child!

437
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,279
How can you make a confession like that?!

438
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,959
You doing that, made you the bad guy here!

439
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,719
Mom.

440
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,839
Peemis helping me

441
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,519
You --

442
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,479
Why are you so stupid?

443
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,119
You do everything Peem tells you to do?

444
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,919
Look!

445
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,599
Peem doesn't wish that well on you.

446
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,879
If you have a felony

447
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,399
the one who gains from this is him!

448
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,519
What do you mean?

449
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,159
Peem likes Plubpla.

450
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,199
He told you to confess

451
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,879
to please the person he wants!

452
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,279
You see?

453
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,759
He doesn't care about you at all

454
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,799
What are you talking about?

455
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,999
Peem...

456
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,639
Open your eyes now!

457
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,799
How many times do I have to say it

458
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,799
that Peem hates me?!

459
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,199
So how can he love you?!

460
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,719
That's not true!

461
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,399
Peem loves me

462
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,799
Peem said

463
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,039
he will handle that woman for me!

464
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,879
Gosh!

465
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,839
You still believe him?!

466
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,439
Your brother has fallen for her that he forgot what he promised you!

467
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,759
Enough Mom!

468
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,799
Don't instigate anything

469
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,199
I don't want to hear it!

470
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:20,879
You --

471
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,959
Pete!

472
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,759
Dad.

473
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,879
You caused trouble again?!

474
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,519
That's just wonderful

475
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,719
The old problem hasn't been settled

476
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,519
and now you caused another problem for me!

477
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,199
You are such a karma for me Pete!

478
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,719
Kom san.

479
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,719
Send someone to take care of the damages for Plubpl a's brother.

480
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,399
Tell them I will go apologize to them myself.

481
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,519
You're only concern about that girl's feelings.

482
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,599
Your son got injured too. Are you worried about him?

483
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,919
He started it so why should I worry?!

484
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,119
What if it wasn't that girl's brother that was fighting our son?

485
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,919
Will you be mad at him

486
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,399
and scold him like this?!

487
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,879
Don't talk back to me

488
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,239
You can't blame this all on Pete!

489
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,678
Because he has a mother like you

490
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,999
that's why he's spoiled!

491
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,158
Don't you ever think

492
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,839
my spoiled behavior

493
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,678
came from you?!

494
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,439
Pete!

495
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,919
You went over board!

496
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,079
You don't teach him!

497
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,079
So I have to teach him!

498
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,479
You think you're so great Dad?!

499
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,039
Are you suitable enough to teach other people?!

500
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,198
If you weren't trying to replace Mom with Tong'ssister,

501
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,519
I wouldn't have to mess with them!

502
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,199
Whatever I do is my business!

503
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,399
You have no right to interfere!

504
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,279
From now on,

505
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,959
I will keep you under my watch 24 hours a day to monitor your probation.

506
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,639
Dad!

507
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,799
Do not with me!

508
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,679
If you keep causing trouble for me,

509
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,959
I will disown you

510
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,039
and won't help you anymore!

511
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,239
You as well!

512
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,919
If you can't look after your son

513
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,199
you are useless to me too!

514
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,599
Why did you let them bail Pete out?

515
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,119
That kid confessed

516
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,959
to letting his friends lock Tong so he can beat him

517
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,879
Confessed?

518
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,559
Why did he confessed so easily?

519
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,919
I was surprised too.

520
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,399
There were no evidence

521
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,919
Yeah.

522
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,399
He could have said it was an intentional fight

523
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,519
The penalty will be reduced.

524
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:29,919
Yeah.

525
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,439
Unless...

526
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,439
it was the lawyer's plan?

527
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,719
I think the person controlling this game

528
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,199
is Peem.

529
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,079
There must be some hidden agenda

530
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,399
You should tell Plub to be careful

531
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,359
Yeah.

532
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,039
Luckily,

533
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,839
you're okay.

534
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,919
Does it hurt a lot?

535
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,519
Your heart can't waver Plubpl a
