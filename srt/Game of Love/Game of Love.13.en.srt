1
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,559
Your heart can't waver Plubpla.

2
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,719
Hey.

3
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,399
Is something wrong?

4
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,959
Um,

5
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,919
no.

6
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,719
so,

7
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,759
what did you talk to Mr, Peem about?

8
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,999
Well,

9
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,039
nothing I just...

10
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,999
told him to handle his family.

11
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,319
Not to bother us anymore.

12
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,199
That's all.

13
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,919
Is that so?

14
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,879
Yeah.

15
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,439
Really?

16
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,479
Yeah!

17
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,919
Why?

18
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,239
What?!

19
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,119
Huh?

20
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,399
Why are you staring so much?

21
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,759
Tong!

22
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,919
Pete.

23
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,239
How are you?

24
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,519
I just got home. I heard Dad scolded you?

25
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,239
Peem likes Plubpla

26
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,239
He told you to confess

27
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,919
to please the person he wants!

28
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,279
You see?

29
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,839
He doesn't care about you at all!

30
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,279
Are you okay?

31
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,439
stopped being sad about Dad a long time ago

32
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,999
I just

33
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,079
don't like when he criticizes Mom

34
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,159
I don't like it.

35
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,799
Pete.

36
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,799
Trust me.

37
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,479
I will handle this matter.

38
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,719
Don't bother Plubpla

39
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,879
and her family again

40
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,839
Okay?

41
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,039
You told me once

42
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,919
you would handle that woman

43
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,439
so she stops messing with Dad

44
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,239
You haven't forgotten, right?

45
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,759
I didn't forget.

46
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,759
I'm handling it right now.

47
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,199
Why are you asking me that?

48
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,759
You don't think

49
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,239
that woman

50
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,319
and Tong

51
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,319
are better than me, right?

52
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,399
Pete.

53
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,439
You're my brother.

54
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,079
How can I think other people are better than you?

55
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,959
Then.

56
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,359
I will trust you.

57
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,479
called everyone here today

58
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,999
to allow both parties to come to an agreement and mediate

59
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,239
Most importantly

60
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,319
the perpetrator

61
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,159
would like to'apologize for what happened

62
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,399
For.everything in the past

63
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,359
it was my fault.

64
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,239
I'm sorry.

65
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,039
Can you forgive me?

66
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,239
Sure.

67
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,879
But you need to promise me first,

68
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,999
you won't bother my sister again

69
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,399
Yeah.

70
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,399
I promise.

71
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,959
Even if he's forgiven,

72
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,879
it doesn't mean we won't take legal actions

73
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,999
In a criminal case,

74
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,839
there is no compromise

75
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,279
Yes.

76
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,039
We understand that.

77
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,959
As for damages, your party can claim them as appropriate.

78
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,319
Let's just say

79
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,559
this is over now?

80
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,479
Yes.

81
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,279
Okay.

82
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,079
Here.

83
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,639
The other party was willing to pay for the medical expenses as we requested!

84
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,199
As for the case,

85
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,999
since Tong wasn't critically injured

86
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,639
that party was willing to pay the fine

87
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,959
So case closed

88
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,799
Are you okay with that?

89
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,959
I just want them not to mess with Tong and Grandma again.

90
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,079
I think that little devil kid won't dare do anything violent anymore

91
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,079
Yeah.

92
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,479
If he causes trouble again

93
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,639
he will go to jail.

94
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,199
Anyway, thank you both so much for helping

95
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,399
It's finally over.

96
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,079
Yeah.

97
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,039
I hope so.

98
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,399
Pete

99
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,599
Don't forget to do what you promised.

100
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,759
What promise?

101
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,799
Hey.

102
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,199
Who's speaking?

103
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,359
Plubpla.

104
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,679
Tong's sister.

105
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,079
The root cause of it all.

106
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,039
Look Pete

107
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,839
You promised in front of the cop you won't mess with Tong again.

108
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,799
So why are you calling?

109
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,839
What about Tong losing

110
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,839
and he didn't do as promised?

111
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,039
So why should I keep my promise?

112
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,919
Look Pete.

113
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,999
Don't mess with Tong again.

114
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,759
Or else don't say I didn't warn you.

115
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,239
If you want me to stop messing with Tong,

116
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,039
stop messing with my dad then.

117
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,319
I never got involved with your dad

118
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,039
You're misunderstanding me

119
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,399
2 A woman like you can say anything

120
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,239
I believe people'sactions

121
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,319
Not words.

122
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,119
And remember this

123
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,239
if you are'still the cause to make my mom cry,

124
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,039
Tong will not just get injured

125
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,879
am gonna kill him!

126
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,559
If you want me to stop messing with Tong

127
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,199
stop messing with my dad then.

128
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,479
And remember this,

129
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,159
if you are still the cause to make my mom cry.

130
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,559
Tong will not just get injured.

131
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,479
I am gonna kill him!

132
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,399
It's my fault.

133
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,599
I made the wrong decision.

134
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,439
So now you got in trouble because of it

135
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,399
I'm sorry Tong.

136
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,759
I won't let you and Grandma risk your lives anymore.

137
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,359
Mr. Peem.

138
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,639
What...

139
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,319
What are you doing here?

140
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,999
Eat it.

141
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,399
I waited in line since 5am to buy it.

142
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,359
They said it's good for your body

143
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,239
Why are you

144
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,319
being good to me?

145
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,239
My brother hurt you

146
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,559
I'm his older brother so I have to take responsibility

147
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,959
Really?

148
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,559
Not because...

149
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,439
of my sister?

150
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,399
You're paranoid just like your sister.

151
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,199
Just eat it.

152
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,439
so,

153
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,079
where's your sister?

154
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,199
Still asleep?

155
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,039
Plub went to work

156
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,839
Work?

157
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,599
I told her to take a leave of absence so she can keep you company until you've recovered

158
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,079
Why did she go?

159
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,159
Plubp la is here waiting to see the chairman in his office.

160
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,399
She dare go see Puchong at his office?!

161
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,079
Yes.

162
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,479
Keep an eye on her.

163
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,959
Then report back to me

164
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,239
Sure.

165
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,319
You really like to seek trouble for yourself.

166
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,119
Plubpla.

167
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,479
Chairman.

168
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,519
Oh, Plubpla.

169
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,599
I was going to go visit your brother.

170
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,599
Let's talk inside.

171
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,319
That's okay.

172
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,999
We can talk here.

173
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,519
In case the employee that is spying can hear us as well

174
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,759
So there's no time wasted

175
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,759
I was on my way to use the restroom

176
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,839
Excuse me.

177
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,679
I just found out about your brother and my son.

178
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,839
I'm really sorry.

179
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,439
As for the damages, I will have Kom san handle it.

180
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,879
I think we should let the legal process take its course.

181
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,159
But I came here to inform you of something

182
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,879
What is it?

183
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,559
You're the one that hired me.

184
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,759
Out of courtesy, I should inform you

185
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,119
I...

186
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,759
would like to resign

187
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,159
Resign?

188
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,319
Yes.

189
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,079
Have you thought this through?

190
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,119
It's hard to find jobs nowadays.

191
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,279
I've thought it through.

192
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,119
You probably have your reasons.

193
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,359
But l wish you luck and l hope you find a new job soon

194
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,119
Thank you so much for your kindness.

195
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,679
Excuse me

196
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,759
Sir.

197
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,159
You're really going to let Ms. Plub pla walk away?

198
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,799
Or are you not interested in her anymore?

199
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,079
Who said?

200
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,399
It's good to let her resign. It's good for her.

201
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,399
At least she can stay away from Peem.

202
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,119
Hey Kom san.

203
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,479
Find a new job for Plubpla

204
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,239
Sure.

205
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,599
With Plubpla quitting,

206
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,079
Peem will be squirming.

207
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,119
I think I need to go save him.

208
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,679
Even though Pete'scase ended with us paying a fine,

209
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,319
but you need to remind him not to get into any more fights

210
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,239
He will go to jail this time

211
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,639
-Mr. Peem.
. Okay

212
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,319
Um...

213
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,359
Peem.

214
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,359
It ended in good terms

215
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,959
Okay.

216
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,279
Why did you come to work?

217
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,959
I told you..

218
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,039
Usa.

219
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,759
Peem!

220
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,039
Uncle had me come be your new secretary

221
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,719
In Plubpla's place?

222
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,759
What do you mean?

223
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,279
Plub resigned.

224
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,599
You didn't know?

225
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,759
Kwang.

226
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,399
Where is Plubpla?

227
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,879
She left.

228
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,159
How?!

229
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,239
Who authorized it?!

230
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,919
What rights do you have

231
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,719
to authorize my employee's resignation?

232
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,999
Huh Dad?

233
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,119
What rights do you have?

234
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,399
If you're talking about Plubpla.

235
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,399
she resigned on her own.

236
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,999
But Plubp la is my employee

237
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,559
The person that can authorize her resignation

238
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,679
is me not you!

239
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,519
Why are you fussing?

240
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,719
You wanted her to quit before

241
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,479
You should be happy she quit.

242
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,439
Don't even think I don't know your agenda

243
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,879
You immediately authorized it

244
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,599
because you gain from it.

245
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,639
Correct!

246
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,319
You're right!

247
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,239
Hmm?!

248
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,879
I don't want Plub pla to be near you

249
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,679
Throughout the past, you were always trying to take Plubp la from me

250
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,919
Just because you wanted to defeat me.

251
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,839
But let me tell you

252
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,999
I'm not like you.

253
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,159
I really like her.

254
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,599
What are you saying?

255
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,559
You hurt Mom's feelings for over ten years.

256
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,199
Mom had to leave and you haven't repented?!

257
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,319
Enough Peem!

258
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,039
Stop talking about this!

259
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,639
Okay?

260
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,839
Your mother's situation is different from this situation!

261
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,319
Stop messing with her. Don't ruin her life.

262
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,359
You stop messing with Plubpla!

263
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,039
You are causing Plubp la and her family trouble!

264
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,439
Do you not realize it?!

265
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,119
You will never win Plubpla's heart!

266
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,799
You're threatening me

267
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,359
or comforting yourself?

268
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,439
I'll tell you something

269
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,519
People like challenges.

270
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,679
The more challenging.

271
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,439
the more I want to win.

272
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,519
You heard that?

273
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,159
Now do you know

274
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,799
why I don't want you and Pete to mess with Plubpla?

275
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,519
Because sometimes pushing the enemy away from us

276
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,639
will give you a disadvantage.

277
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,719
Let me warn you again.

278
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,839
Do not mess with Plubpla again.

279
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,639
She's mine.

280
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,239
Hey.

281
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,759
I quit.

282
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,479
Oh!

283
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,559
Why?!

284
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,879
The job was good.

285
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,199
It's...

286
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,119
A lot has happened

287
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,599
When.:

288
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,119
I see you, I will tell you about it.

289
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,039
If there's any jobs,

290
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,999
I et me know

291
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,599
Yeah, okay.

292
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,799
No problem.

293
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,679
But it's good that you called to let me know.

294
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,919
If there's any job for you

295
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,359
I will call you immediately

296
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,159
Okay?

297
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,519
Mm.

298
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,519
Thank you so much.

299
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,199
I can always rely on you when'm inneed of help.

300
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,679
Of course!

301
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,799
I only have you, nobody else!

302
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,639
Good luck!

303
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,519
Okay, bye!

304
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,719
You still look fresh.

305
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,439
I'm still feeling tired.

306
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,199
Yes.

307
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,919
Oh, Plub.

308
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,239
You're not working today?

309
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,719
Oh,

310
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,919
the company is having me work from home.

311
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,559
Oh.

312
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,279
Hello Aunt Kaew, Uncle Dec h.

313
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,559
Hello.

314
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,959
I thought I wouldn't see you again

315
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,719
You're being discharged today?

316
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,999
I'm going to get treated at a hospital near my house

317
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,519
It's just...

318
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,239
too expensive with the treatment and travel expense here

319
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,399
Sol came to say goodbye

320
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,679
to your grandmother and you

321
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,759
I guess I won't be seeing you two anymore.

322
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,839
Plub.

323
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,359
When you're available,you can invite your grandmother and brother

324
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,679
over to my house.

325
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,159
I will leave our contact info with you

326
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,319
and you can come over when you have time

327
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,799
Sure.

328
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,279
In that case, Grandma needs to get better soon.

329
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,079
So we can go attack Aunt Kaew and Uncle Dec h's house.

330
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,159

331
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,799

Plus,you'll get free fruits

333
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,119
Excuse me

334
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,159
It's time to take your blood pressure and take your medicine.

335
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,679
I'll take my leave now.

336
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,799

Plub.

345
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,759
Don't forget your promise.

346

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,559
Don't be stubborn to your doctors.

349
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,959
So you can get healthy soon.

350
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,559
Okay.

351
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,159

Bye bye.

356
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,199
Mr. Peem.

357
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,719
Plubpla.

358
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,039
What are you doing here?

359
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,399
What's the matter?

360
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,839
Nothing.

361
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,239
It's nothing.

362
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,599
Why did you quit?

363
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,999
You should be happy.

364
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,599
Before this,

365
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,319
you wanted to get me fired, didn't you?

366
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,639
I won't let you quit.

367
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,039
Go back to work.

368
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,519
The chairman authorized it.

369
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,719
If you feel uneasy about Pete,

370
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,879
I will handle it.

371
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,679
I won't let Pete mess with Tong again

372
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,679
You can't control your brother.

373
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,199
Why do you think like that?

374
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,399
If you feel uneasy,

375
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,359
I will have --

376
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,839
Your brother called to threaten me.

377
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,239
Pete?

378
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,239
Yes.

379
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,879
He pretended to apologize

380
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,479
Once I compromised,

381
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,279
your brother called to threaten me.

382
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,599
I'm sorry.

383
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,839
I will deal with this matter decisively.

384
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,079
I won't let Pete bother you again.

385
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,999
Enough Mr Peem

386
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,399
I can't take any more risks.

387
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,599
So...

388
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,279
what job will you do?

389
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,439
Don't forget

390
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,679
you have your grandmother and brother.

391
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,319
You're not alone.

392
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,759
Huh?!

393
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,999
What?!

394
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,679
Got sick?!

395
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,839
That's right.

396
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,079
We were walking together and she just fainted.

397
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,279
But the staff took her to see a doctor already

398
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,959
Gosh!

399
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,999
So we're missing a person.

400
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,239
Yes.

401
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,039
Oh my goodness!

402
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,799
The owner of the event is going to kill me!

403
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,239
What do I do?!

404
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,959
What's up?

405
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,799
Right now?

406
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:36,999
Okay.

407
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,759
I'll be there in30 minutes.

408
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,759
Bye.

409
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,879
I won't starve to death Mr. Peem

410
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,239
Cha Cha!

411
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,839
Plub!

412
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,679
Thank you so much for coming!

413
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,519
I'm really sorry, It's urgent.

414
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,079
One of my girls got sick.

415
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,639
So we're missing one person

416
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,239
It's okay.

417
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,719
Your work helps extend my life.

418
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,159
So what do you want me to do today?

419
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,279
So gorgeous!

420
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,759
So freaking cute.

421
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,399
What the hell?!

422
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,079
A good gentleman doesn't do this.

423
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,359
Show some respect.

424
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,639
What's it to you?

425
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,599
She's my giri friend.

426
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,719
Does it involves me now?

427
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,199
Please give an applause!

428
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,119
First off, hello to all honorable guests.

429
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,919
Since today is our first opening day of the shop,

430
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,879
we have set up activities

431
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,519
Who ever gets a haircut.

432
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,999
you will get your hair shampooed with these beautiful ladies!

433
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,479
Not to waste any more time,

434
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,559
get in line for your number!

435
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,079
What's your name?

436
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,199
Plubpla.

437
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,879
What the hell?!

438
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,519
You cut me!

439
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,639
Yeah.

440
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,959
Get to the back of the line

441
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,719
How about this?

442
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,519
I will pay for everyone's hair wash

443
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,599
for the rest of the year!

444
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,719
But everyone

445
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,119
must get your hair washed with someone else,not her.

446
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,359
What do we do?

447
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,399
Well?

448
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,919
That's a lot of money we will save though

449
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,639
What are we gonna do?

450
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,759
Let's pick another girl.

451
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,999
Mr. Peem!

452
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,519
Why are you bothering me?!

453
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,639
If you won't go back to work with me,

454
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,799
I'll bother you even more.

455
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,879
Hey!

456
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,759
Hey! Don't touch me!

457
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,599
As of now,

458
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,879
you're all mine.

459
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,319
You said

460
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,239
Plubpla

461
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,119
quit Peem'scompany?

462
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,999
Yes.

463
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,439
I found out this morning

464
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,999
I remembered you know her so I wanted to inform you

465
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,239
In case your company has any opening positions,

466
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,239
you can offer her one.

467
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,399
I pity her.

468
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,359
It's hard to find a job nowadays

469
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,079
Sure.

470
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,999
Thank you so much.

471
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,799
Hard to find jobs?

472
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,519
Probably not for Plubpla.

473
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,039
Come on.

474
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,999
Let's get my hair washed.

475
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,839
Okay.

476
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,559
So relaxing.

477
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,839
Your hands are soft

478
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:39,839
Oh,

479
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,079
this is my first compliment of having soft hands

480
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,198
Why is it you?!

481
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,479
Where's Plubp la?!

482
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:54,638
The owner had Plubplago wash a very very VIP customer.

483
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,919
V VIP?

484
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,919
Who?

485
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,879
What a surprise

486
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,159
to see you here

487
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,279
So,

488
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,519
you're not working for Peemany more?

489
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,239
Well,

490
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,559
I just quit.

491
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,359
Is that so?

492
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,159
Can l ask

493
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,879
Why you quit?

494
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,119
That place

495
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,279
doesn't suit mel guess

496
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,719
I didn't do a good enough job there.

497
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,679
If you're no longer working for Peem,

498
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,719
l am interested

499
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,319
in having you be my secretary.

500
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,639
Who said Plubpla doesn't work for me anymore?

501
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,759
Mr. Peem.

502
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,959
Sir!

503
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,719
Your hair isn't done

504
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,239
Oh hey Peem

505
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,279
You came here too?

506
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,999
After I'm done washing my hair with Plub,

507
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,159
you can go next

508
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,199
It's so relaxing.

509
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,079
Come here.

510
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,559
Hey Mr. Peem!

511
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,719
I'm not done washing Mr Vi kit's hair!

512
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,719
Let go!

513
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,799
Peem!

514
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,199
What the hell are you doing?!

515
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,879
Now you're done

516
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:30,759
Hey!

517
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,919
What are you doing?!

518
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,959
What is going on?!

519
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,839
I'll bring you a towel.

520
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,759
Plub can drive you this crazy?

521
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,799
It's getting more interesting now.

522
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,999
Mr. Peem.

523
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,159
Let go!

524
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,879
Mr. Peem!

525
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,279
You really like it.

526
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,839
Getting close to men and selling your sexiness!

527
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,679
Hey!

528
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,159
Whatever I sell is my business!

529
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,359
It doesn't involve you!

530
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,719
Then sell it to me.

531
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,439
I'm ready to pay whatever amount!

532
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,839
Peem.

533
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,679
Stop doing these kinds of jobs

534
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,119
What rights do you have to stop me?

535
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,119
I'm not your secretary anymore.

536
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,199
Fine

537
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,799
Then pay backthe debt you owe for Grand ma Thip's surgery

538
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,919
Didn't we agree

539
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,239
you will pay me back through your monthly salary?

540
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,439
Fine.

541
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,359
I will gradually pay you back

542
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,439
like we agreed.

543
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:44,999
Okay?

544
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:45,999
Not okay.

545
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,959
I want all the money back right now, this instant!

546
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,279
Hey.

547
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,119
When I loaned you the money, you were my employee.

548
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,399
I had to help my employee.

549
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,079
But you don't work for me now.

550
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,999
It's right of you to pay me back all the money.

551
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,159
But if you change your mind

552
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,479
and come back to work with me,

553
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,559
our deal will remain the same.

554
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,439
Are you crazy?!

555
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,519
What is your problem?! What do you want?!

556
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,439
When will you let me go?!

557
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,919
Whatever I want

558
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,279
I shall get!

559
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,759
Are you crazy?! Let go!

560
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,519
I won't let go!

561
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,399
Let Plub go Peem!

562
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,319
It doesn't involve you

563
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,199
I'm talking to my secretary!

564
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,559
Former you mean.

565
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,079
Plub doesn't work for you right now

566
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,039
Plub.

567
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,839
If you agree to come work for me,

568
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,559
the debt you owe Peem

569
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,399
will be paid off by me.
