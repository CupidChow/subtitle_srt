1
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,759
It won't easily change either.

2
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,479
Pala pol told the police that

3
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,919
he attacked Pete

4
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,079
because he was upset when he saw Pete committing an indecent act.

5
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,439
He used his phone to take photos of a woman using the restroom.

6
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:18,919
4 Photo

7
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,639
How did it go?

8
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,439
Check all nearby surveillance cameras

9
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,399
Buy all of it.

10
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,919
Don't let Pete be in the headlines.

11
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,319
So it's true then?

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,879
Pete is still a kid. I'll discipline him

13
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,839
If we let this get to the press

14
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,559
it'll affect the company.

15
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,799
I can't let that happen.

16
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,199
-Do you understand me?
- Yeah l understand

17
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,239
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

18
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,239
Thanks.

19
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,959
Go bail Tong out

20
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,359
Thank you Su the e. I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

21
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,399
You don't have to if you don't have money

22
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,399
I don't mind.

23
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,199
I can't. Money is money.

24
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,559
That's right.

25
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,719
Plu b hasn't even paid you back the money she owed you from last time

26
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,959
Plu b.

27
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,799
Don't forget you still owe him.

28
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,239
Alright.

29
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,119
When you do have the money.

30
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,919
you can pay me back

31
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,919
Okay. I have to go now.

32
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,239
Thank you once again.

33
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,279
Hey Plu b!

34
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,439
Orn.

35
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,639
Sorry I'm late.

36
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,839
I just got done with my other case.

37
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,959
But I rushed over here after I saw your text.

38
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,759
It's fine. Thanks.

39
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,239
Yeah.

40
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,959
How are you?

41
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,719
Were you able to bail Tong out?

42
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,559
Do you want me to do it?

43
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,319
It's fine. I submit the paper already.

44
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,999
Just waiting on result.

45
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,919
How did it go Yot?

46
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,359
The relative of the person Tong attacked

47
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,799
opposed his bail.

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,079
Do you know

49
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,679
who your brother attacked?

50
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,999
He messed with someone of that status

51
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,399
Who?

52
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,079
He's the youngest son

53
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,839
of the owner of PP World.

54
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,599
What?

55
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,439
You!

56
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,919
You opposed bail on the kid who was fighting Pete?!

57
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,039
That's a strange question to ask.

58
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,679
He hurt Pete.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,319
He needs to compensate.

60
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,959
Shouldn't you ask Pete first

61
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,199
about what happened?

62
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,959
Not blame the other party like this.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,679
Pete has done nothing wrong. Why should I ask?

64
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,799
This is what they call

65
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,199
" My parents bullied me."

66
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,639
As a mother,

67
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,199
what did I do wrong

68
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,519
for protecting Pete?

69
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,399
If this had happened to you

70
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,479
I would have protected you too.

71
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,279
Unnecessary.

72
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,079
You're not my mother!

73
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,679
A woman like you have no right to compare yourself to my mother!

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,639
Remember that!

75
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,319
Of course.

76
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,519
How can I compare to your mother?

77
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,679
A person like me

78
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,759
isn't someone who would abandon her own child like that

79
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,439
You!

80
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,839
Am I wrong?

81
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,639
As a mother

82
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,719
whether we're physically suffering

83
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,719
or emotionally suffering

84
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,839
what a mother should never do

85
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,439
is abandon her own child

86
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,519
peem.

87
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,959
Sa.

88
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,759
Have you had breakfast yet?

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,159
We have your favorite, bak kut teh, for you today.

90
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,439
Sol had Sa go invite you to come over.

91
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,159
Wow. What a treat for my mouth.

92
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,799
Where's Uncle Thaw ip?

93
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,519
Dad went on a business trip.

94
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,399
Have a seat.

95
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,719
Here peem, I'll scoop some for you.

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,799
The flavor I've been longing for.

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,239
No bak kut teh is as delicious as yours Aunt P on.

98
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,079
You're a sweet talker peem.

99
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,279
But I didn't make it today.

100
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,439
She did.

101
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,639
Wow! What a surprise!

102
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,399
Her skills

103
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,319
are just the same as yours Aunt P on

104
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,199
It's very delicious Sa

105
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,319
I've passed on my skills to my heiress.

106
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,799
From now on, you can come over to eat at this house

107
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,679
til old age.

108
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,759
I would feel considerate of Sa's future boyfriend

109
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,479
of having an old brother dining together with them

110
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,279
No one would take interest in Sa then

111
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,719
Sa.

112
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,039
Let's just eat.

113
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,359
It'll get cold.

114
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,279
Sure.

115
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,679
Quickly eat. I'll drop you off at school.

116
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,759
Okay.

117
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,079
Grandma.

118
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,719
Where are you going?

119
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,239
I...

120
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,918
I have to go apologize

121
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,199
to the parents

122
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,599
of the person Tong hit.

123
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,159
In case they will soften up

124
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,159
and release Tong.

125
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,999
It's my fault for not raising Tong good enough

126
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,999
I have to go apologize to his parents.

127
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,359
In case they will let us bail Tong out.

128
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,839
Plu b,do you know

129
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,039
where they live?

130
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,759
Hmm?

131
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,599
You're at PP World?!

132
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,119
Why would you go there? Get out of there!

133
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,239
If I don't come, my grandmother will.

134
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,879
I won't let her do that

135
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,399
So you're going to go apologize to them yourself?

136
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,279
What do you want me to do?

137
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,439
My brother hurt him.

138
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,159
Whatever I can do to help Tong, I will do it.

139
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,159
I just called to tell you where I'm at.

140
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,719
In case I go missing.

141
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,839
Hey, you crazy girl!

142
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,799
Okay When I'm done here

143
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,079
I'll call you.

144
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,239
As a mother,

145
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,359
whether we're physically suffering

146
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,359
or emotionally suffering,

147
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,479
what a mother should never do

148
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,959
is abandon her own child.

149
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,759
Mom.

150
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,559
Mr. peem.

151
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,719
You're back from camping?

152
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,439
Give me your bag.

153
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,439
Where's Mom?

154
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,479
What are you talking about?

155
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,959
Where did Mom go?

156
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,319
I don't know.

157
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,799
I came home and she was already gone with her things.

158
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,879
She only left this letter.

159
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,839
I'm sorry for doing this

160
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,559
But if you stay with your father,

161
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,039
it would be better than you having to struggle with me.

162
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,519
But when everything falls into place,

163
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,439
I will come get you to come live with me.

164
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,799
Please forgive me

165
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,639
for only tolerating this much

166
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,879
Why did you

167
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,879
surrender to a worthless woman like Su?!

168
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,239
But I won't.

169
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,719
I hate this kind of woman the most!

170
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,719
Come in!

171
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,159
Mr, peem. Someone is here to see you.

172
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,079
Who?

173
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,079
Her name is Plu bpl a

174
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,399
This woman is no different from Su

175
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,759
Disgusting!

176
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,999
came to negotiate

177
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,799
and apologize

178
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,199
and clear up everything

179
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,879
Is this...

180
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,119
how someone who came to apologize behaves?

181
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,519
I can't sense any remorse from you at all.

182
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,399
I'm sorry on behalf of my brother.

183
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,519
That's it?

184
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,719
You apologize and end of story?

185
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,399
You're not acting tough like you did when you bad mouthed me at the event

186
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,999
I heard that

187
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,279
family is like a tree

188
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,479
Although branches grow different ways

189
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,999
but they were born from the same root.

190
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,439
If one of them does wrong,

191
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,079
the family must take responsibility together.

192
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,399
I didn't take good care of my brother.

193
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,079
That is my fault.

194
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,879
You...

195
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,119
have a good sense of humor

196
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,319
But I'm sorry.

197
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,439
I'm not the man who easily falls for a woman's trick

198
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,799
Just tell me how you want me to compensate

199
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,879
Are you trying to throw money at me?

200
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,279
You think you have enough money?

201
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,359
Mr. peem.

202
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,199
I haven't said a word about money yet.

203
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,039
I know my money can't compensate for you.

204
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,919
Especially someone rich like you

205
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,839
You are...

206
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,759
really smooth

207
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,759
So are you here to negotiate

208
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,159
or upset me even more?

209
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,799
Well,

210
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,959
all I'masking

211
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,679
is for you to tell me how you want me to compensate for you.

212
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,959
In that case,

213
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,079
do what..

214
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,519
a woman like you are good at then.

215
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,159
Sleep with me.

216
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,599
Hey!

217
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,839
I was just thinking about the words

218
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,519
that you announced

219
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,439
in front of meat the event. Do you remember?

220
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,639
Remember-this.

221
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,639
Someone like me,

222
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,279
even if you bring all the money in the world

223
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,639
you will never get to touch me!

224
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,239
In front of other people

225
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,279
you act like a good woman who wouldn't sell your own dignity

226
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,439
But behind closed doors,you act the opposite

227
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,159
Plus you had the nerves to badmouth me in front of everyone

228
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,399
You think I would forget that so easily?

229
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,199
This is the time

230
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,679
that I can teach a woman like you a lesson as well!

231
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,119
You really are a jerk.

232
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,679
I think

233
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,039
you should keep your mouth shut.

234
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,719
Before I have a condition that's more difficult for you

235
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,719
Go home and think about whether or not you'll do as I say.

236
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,759
I'll give you

237
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,799
until midnight.

238
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,719
Or else

239
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,079
be prepared to send your brother off

240
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,159
to prison.

241
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,559
Tong.

242
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,879
Plu b.

243
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,519
I still can't bail you out.

244
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,399
The other party refuses.

245
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,599
Forget about that.

246
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,999
How's that bastard doing?

247
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,959
Still unconscious at the hospital

248
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,119
Didn't I tell you

249
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,639
to go straight home after school?

250
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,639
Why were you at a pub?

251
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,959
Plu b.

252
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,879
I just went to celebrate for finishing my exams.

253
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,879
Why are you complaining?

254
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,159
I'm only complaining

255
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,399
and you're already giving me and Grandma headaches.

256
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,838
What if I don't complain?

257
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,399
Plu b.

258
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,439
When you get here,

259
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,159
can you ask me first

260
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,078
about what happened?!

261
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,078
You complain the moment you go t here!

262
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,999
I don't want to complain Tong!

263
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,399
But these days

264
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,759
all you do is create problems for me to fix!

265
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,759
Alright.

266
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,159
Calm down.

267
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,999
Both of you take it easy.

268
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,919
So what happened?

269
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,999
Why were you hitting him?

270
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,999
I told the police everything already

271
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,719
But I don't understand why it's not his fault?

272
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,559
Why am I the only one getting punished?

273
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,679
Because we don't have evidence to incriminate him

274
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,119
They denied every accusations you made

275
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,679
Hey Tong.

276
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,119
So,

277
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,399
is there anyone who can be our witness?

278
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,559
Someone who saw those guys taking photos of the woman?

279
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,559
It was just them. No one else

280
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,999
In that case,

281
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,399
the only way I can help you

282
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,479
is find evidence of them taking photos of the woman, right?

283
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,639
Wait Plu b.

284
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,199
Where will you find the evidence?

285
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,559
I don't know yet.

286
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,279
But I won't allow this.

287
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,559
Pete be careful!

288
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,839
Hey don't!

289
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,119
Don't get involved!

290
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,639
Pete!

291
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,719
Tong!

292
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,719
-Pete!
-Tong!

293
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,439
Pete!

294
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,639
Tong!
-Pete!

295
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,359
Wake up!

296
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,519
Pete!

297
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,639
Please be okay!

298
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,999
That's all we have Lawyer.

299
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,039
Did anyone see when they started the fight from outside?

300
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,399
No.

301
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,319
And this Pete guy

302
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,479
and his friends are regular customers

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,199
They're all close

304
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,999
They've never had any problems with anyone before.

305
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,479
I think

306
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,599
you should ask your brother's friends instead

307
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,519
I didn't see anything

308
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,159
I walked in and saw the guy passed out already.

309
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,639
I'm so pissed.

310
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,679
If you had recorded what he threatened you with,

311
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,399
by now he would become famous across the nation and future ruined for sure!

312
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,759
Asshole!

313
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,479
Whatever.

314
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,479
My dad taught me that

315
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,199
if you haven't done your best, do not give up.

316
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,639
Even though we can't find a solution,
it doesn't mean there is none.

317
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,119
Anyway I will..

318
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,159
fight til the end!

319
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,039
Hey, I'm going to get a drink.

320
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,159
You want anything?

321
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:39,959
No.

322
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,559
You only have a few hours left. See you soon.

323
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,839
0

324
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,279
Two more minutes left

325
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,839
Deal.

326
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,839
Sol guess

327
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,079
this is your true color.

328
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,919
Come in.

329
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,919
You're such a good big sister

330
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,319
Willing to be a free product

331
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,639
in exchange for his freedom.

332
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,599
Oh I forgot.

333
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,559
You're probably used to solving life's problems so easily like this

334
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,719
In the past you probably

335
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,359
end the problem by exchanging your body like this I suppose

336
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,799
Being a woman like you

337
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,679
makes life so simple.

338
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,559
It's probably because

339
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,119
I can't choose my birth

340
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,319
In that case, shall we start?

341
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,279
The truth is

342
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,039
I never take interest

343
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,759
in a woman like you.

344
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,359
But this time

345
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,479
consider this a lesson for a woman like you

346
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,559
I think

347
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,799
this is a lesson for you

348
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,479
Pete!

349
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,799
If the reporters get a hold of this clip

350
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,159
of your brother...

351
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,879
taking photos of a woman using the restroom,
what would happen?

352
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,039
Not only will your company have problems,

353
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,039
your family's reputation would be ruined.

354
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,279
People might think you guys are a perverted family

355
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,759
How did you get this clip?

356
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,799
Excuse me.

357
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,639
Can I take a look at your dash cam?

358
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,159
My brother got arrested so I need to see your dash cam in order to help him

359
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,439
Sure.

360
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,199
Thank you.

361
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,599
Now do you see

362
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,039
who needs the lesson here?

363
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,319
Give me that!

364
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,759
Stop!

365
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,759
The truth is

366
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,559
the one who acts so low isn't my younger brother.

367
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,999
But it's you and your brother instead!

368
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,679
So what's it gonna be? Still want to pursue the matter?

369
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,359
What do you want in exchange for this clip?

370
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,319
You're a businessman.

371
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,679
You're good at negotiating

372
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,679
I don't need to tell you what I want

373
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,079
You want me

374
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,879
not to take legal action against your brother?

375
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,399
Yes.

376
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,759
This is a criminal case.

377
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,839
Even if I don't take legal action.

378
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,759
the police would

379
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,839
because your brother assualt ed my brother.

380
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,279
But punishment shouldn't be so severe

381
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,079
My brother shouldn't go to jail. I should at least be able to bail him out

382
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,199
Okay?

383
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,559
Deal.

384
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,399
What now?

385
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,759
That was about my brother.

386
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,959
Now, it's about you and me.

387
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,959
Why are you taking pictures of me?!

388
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,279
Hey, go stand out on the balcony

389
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,359
What?

390
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,119
Will you walk over there

391
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,719
or do you want me to accidentally post your photos?

392
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,439
Hmm?

393
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,399
Will you walk over there?

394
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,519
Go!

395
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,999
Open the door and walk out to the balcony.

396
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,279
Huh?!

397
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,399
Out to the balcony?!

398
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,119
Yes.

399
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,599
Hurry!

400
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,879
Or else I will post.

401
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,359
I will post.

402
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,919
Are you satisfied?

403
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,839
No.

404
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,719
What now?

405
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,879
Take off your boxer

406
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,159
Huh?!

407
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,079
Take off your boxer

408
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,679
Are you crazy?!

409
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,959
I'm not crazy.

410
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,399
Are you gonna do it or do you want me?

411
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,439
Hurry! Take it off. I'm counting to three.

412
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,279
One,

413
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,599
-two...
-Enough!

414
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,239
three.

415
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,759
You're crazy!

416
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,239
I took it off.

417
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,759
Are you satisfied?!

418
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,479
Almost.

419
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,559
Just a little more.

420
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,119
Stop!

421
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,679
Hey!

422
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,999
-Open the door!
-No.

423
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,399
-Open it!
-No.

424
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,199
I said open it right now!

425
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,079
No pictures!

426
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,959
Is the weather nice?

427
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,239
It's Mr. peem!

428
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,799
I think it's been long already

429
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,879
We should go in there

430
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,719
Come on!
-Mm.

431
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,359
Oh, Plub!

432
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,199
How did it go?

433
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,479
Right now? He probably regrets it

434
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,919
Why don't you just give the cops the footage and sue him?

435
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,559
Also file a report against him for having you come to a hotel

436
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,799
I'll be your lawyer.

437
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,919
I'm afraid it won't be worth it.

438
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,999
Rich people have the money and power.

439
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,119
I think these people won't be destroyed that easily.

440
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,919
Besides, that kid got assaulted by Tong

441
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,199
I think it's best thing s end this way.

442
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,199
Yeah.

443
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,639
What Plu b said is right

444
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,759
Our goal right now

445
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,159
is to go bail Tong out

446
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,839
Mm.

447
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,919
As for the rest, I think we should leave it according to karma

448
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,199
Evil people

449
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,439
will lose to themselves. I believe in that.

450
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,719
Yes!

451
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,519
Before he gets defeated

452
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,559
I hope he is allergic to the weather and dies!

453
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,399
You're bad.

454
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,119
Tat!

455
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,479
Open the door for me!

456
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,359
peem!

457
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,759
Hey Tat!

458
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,239
Open the door for me!

459
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,239
Good thing I noticed

460
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,239
Or else you would be sleeping out there with the dew.

461
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,559
This is what you get for trying to have her sleep with you.

462
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,079
I would be mad too.

463
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,679
You already know lim not interested in that kind of woman

464
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,559
I was just trying to mess with her for humiliating me lin front of other people

465
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,319
I wasn't trying to really sleep with her.

466
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,839
lim so pissed!

467
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,839
I thought after pulling a prank on her, I would call to mock my father.

468
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,479
It looks too much of an investment, no?

469
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,479
Do you actually like her?

470
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,199
Stop teasing me.

471
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,399
I don't have feelings for that kind of woman for sure!

472
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,639
I just want to prove to my father that I wasn't wrong.

473
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,839
Tong!

474
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,839
My grandson!

475
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,999
Tong!

476
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,319
May all your good spirits come back.

477
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,039
May all your good spirits come back and bad spirits go away

478
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,759
I'll spritz you with holy water

479
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,279
May you...

480
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,399
be free from all sufferings

481
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,359
Be safe.

482
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,319
Be healthy.

483
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,679
I hope that guy

484
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,479
won't do some voodoo stuff on me

485
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,639
Mr. peem.

486
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,239
An officer was here to see you earlier

487
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,679
I think his name is Yot or something like that.

488
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,159
He asked me to give you this.

489
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,559
I did as promised.

490
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,439
I hope you don't forget our deal.

491
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,079
After this, I hope we can live our separate lives.

492
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,799
No more problems.

493
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,919
I don't want to bother you either!

494
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,039
peem!

495
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,199
You told our lawyer

496
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,999
not to take legal action against Pete's attacker?

497
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,039
Yes.

498
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,239
Why?!

499
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,119
If you want to know

500
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,359
watch the clip.

501
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:30,999
Pete!

502
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,799
Why is the hotel renovation project in Phuket still not signed?

503
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,519
Hmm?

504
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,599
I'm still not done looking over the paperwork

505
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,439
I'm the CEO. I've looked over it.

506
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,359
Just sign the paper.

507
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,039
Pete is awake.

508
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,879
You're not going to go visit him?

509
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,239
He'll feel disheartened

510
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,519
I'm your father, Don't give me orders.

511
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,399
I only have good intentions.

512
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,399
I just don't want Pete to have bad feelings about his father

513
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,879
like I do.

514
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,159
Mr. peem.

515
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,119
You won't have any breakfast?

516
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,079
Sorry, I'm not hungry.

517
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,919
You guys can only say a few words to each other.

518
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,639
Look at him!

519
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,119
Always starting a fight with me!

520
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,519
-You're always seeking problems for me!
-Mom!

521
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,199
Why are you hitting me?!

522
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,039
I'm still injured!

523
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,879
Look!

524
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,839
If your father finds out.

525
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,519
he will be very upset!

526
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,479
Good if he gets upset

527
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,919
I think

528
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,759
Dad wouldn't care.

529
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,559
You're his son.

530
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,239
Why wouldn't hecare?

531
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,839
Mom.

532
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,679
I'm a child that he conceived by mistake.

533
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,599
I'm just his mistake!

534
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,919
Don't forget

535
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,439
without me,

536
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,839
peem's mother wouldn't have left him.

537
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,039
When will you stop thinking like that?

538
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,879
It's true Mom

539
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,399
Do you know how guilty I feel towards peem?

540
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,159
He's very good to me.

541
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,759
But in the end

542
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,039
I'm the cause to have his mother abandon him

543
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,359
You idiot!

544
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,799
peem isonly pretending to be good to you

545
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,999
because he wants you to be a subordinate

546
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,039
A pawn in his hands

547
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,239
So you wouldn't dare take the inheritance from him!

548
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,239
He doesn't really love you!

549
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,879
So why do you feel guilty?!

550
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,519
That's not true Mom. Don't lie!

551
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,759
peem loves me.

552
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,399
Why would he love you when he hates me?!

553
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,839
Use your brain to think!

554
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,639
I have a child not to my desire!

555
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,879
I told the lawyer to try to mediate this matter as quickly as possible.

556
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,159
Including deleting the clip

557
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,959
Good.

558
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,239
Pete is my son after all

559
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,759
The girl who was able to handle peem in this situation

560
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,159
is quite interesting.
