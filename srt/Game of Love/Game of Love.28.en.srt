1
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,399
We shouldn't judge someone

2
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,159
based on their actions.

3
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,479
We need to look at their intentions too.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,599
Intentions?

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,799
It's too late.

6
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,999
Please keep my mom'ssituation a secret.

7
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,359
Can you not tell anyone about my mother?

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,999
I'm scared she might be in danger.

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,199
You don't need to tell me.

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,759
I know.

11
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,159
I don't know.

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,879
I have to be careful

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,679
Because right now,both you

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,719
and your husband are ready to attack me at any time

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,919
I just want to tell you

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,919
you can hurt me all you want.

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,159
But don't bring my mom into the mix.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,679
I'm begging you

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,079
I know how to differentiate.

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,079
I'm worried about Aunt Kaew too

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,599
Thank you.

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,199
Do you know

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,279
who attacked Aunt Kaew?

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,279
There's only one person that benefits from it if my mom disappears

25
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,479
Who are you referring to?

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,199
Au nt Su.

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,959
For the sake of our relationship in the past.

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,399
This will be my last time helping you

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,679
Gosh sir

30
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,999
Why do you talk as if you're cutting all ties and leaving no feelings behind?

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,199
You're not young like before any more.

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,159
You can't use the same old tricks with me again.

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,399
But regardless

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,999
T have to thankyou for helping me

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,799
So you're really not going to tell me

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,799
what you're being blackmail for?

37
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,799
I'm embarrassed

38
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,999
It's best that you don't know

39
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,559
Someone like you

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,519
shouldn't get blackmailed that easily

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,079
But whatever.

42
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,639
It's fine if you won't tell me

43
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,199
It has nothing to do with me anyway.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,199
Right.

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,799
Someone like me

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,079
shouldn't get blackmailed so easily

47
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,919
For Aunt Kaew's safety.

48
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,559
I agree that we should keep this a secret.

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,999
Don't worry.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,479
I won't tell anyone about this.

51
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,479
Thank you once again.

52
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,799
Peem went there too?

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,639
I know.

54
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,999
I have to go.

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,559
Vi kit.

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,759
You're not asleep yet?

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,759
Not yet.

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,119
I was waiting for you

59
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,999
Why are you back so late?

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,839
It's just...

61
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,959
I was busy talking to Aunt Kaew,the owner's wife, and forgot the time.

62
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,439
Really?

63
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,439
What did they say?

64
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,639
Are they going to sell the land to us?

65
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,239
At first it looked like they were but.

66
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,799
Uncle Dec h wants to think it over

67
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,399
Why?

68
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,359
He probably...

69
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,919
have...

70
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,759
a lot of things to think about.

71
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,479
Like what?

72
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,039
Is it because of Peem's company?

73
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,559
It's their family's matter

74
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,199
I'm going to check on our son.

75
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,399
I wonder if he fell asleep or not

76
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,599
Plub.

77
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,519
Are you hiding something from me?

78
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,319
Peem!

79
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,199
It's late. Why aren't you asleep?

80
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,799
Don't walk away from me!

81
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,999
Let me go!

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,519
Someone might see!

83
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,239
That's good if they do

84
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,479
Pete!

85
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,479
Don't do this!

86
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,319
Why not?

87
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,759
I've done more than kiss you, no?

88
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,399
But right now,

89
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,159
I'm your sister in law.

90
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,639
You have no right to be rude to me

91
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,199
Peem!

92
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,719
This is actually great

93
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,279
Peem!

94
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,879
Peem, why are you home so late?

95
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,039
Did you eat yet?

96
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,719
Peem!

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,719
Why didn't you tell me you went out of town?

98
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,279
I could have gone with you

99
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,399
We could have taken the chance

100
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,199
to go on our honeymoon.

101
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,559
Or should we start planning our honeymoon?

102
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,999
Let's go to.

103
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,639
Peem!

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,639
Peem! You can't do this to me!

105
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,599
Is this the kind of marriage you wanted?

106
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,279
Hey!

107
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,079
Why are you home so late?

108
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,959
When did we date?

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,159
Huh?

110
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,479
Are you crazy? Who's dating you?

111
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,359
You're acting like my girlfriend.

112
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,319
Waiting for me to come home and all.

113
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,879
I need to talk to you

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,439
What is it that you need to talk about?

115
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,359
I think l know who leaked the clip four years ago

116
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,439
Who?

117
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,919
Who is this?

118
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,439
Hello.

119
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,559
Hello, Mr s. Trepradu b

120
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,399
I'm Mrs. Su pang's secretary.

121
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,999
Yes.

122
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,999
What's the matter?

123
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,959
She asked me to call you about the clip

124
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,239
She asked me to handle the rest of your payment

125
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,719
I thought she doesn't have any money right now?

126
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,919
She has it now.

127
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,199
Mrs. Su is ready

128
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,279
and wants you to bring the clip with you

129
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,279
She has a copy so why should I bring it?!

130
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,799
Well, she lost her copy.

131
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,879
Why does she want it again?!

132
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,879
Is it not chaotic enough?!

133
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,559
When do you want me to bring you the money?

134
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,519
Today is fine.

135
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,719
Yes!

136
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,999
Okay.

137
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,519
Ill send you the location

138
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,039
Yes ma'am.

139
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,199
Thank you.

140
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,839
Yes!

141
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,159
Is it possible that

142
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,999
Pl ub'ssister

143
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,399
was the one who recorded that clip?

144
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,639
And the one who leaked the clip was Mrs. Supan g, Peem's step mom.

145
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,759
Most likely possible

146
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,519
Okay.

147
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,719
We have to find a way for Mr s. Trepradu b

148
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,519
to admit the truth

149
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,079
Let's MOU.

150
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,239
Peem.

151
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,239
When I had you go check the land,

152
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,319
how did it go?

153
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,319
Save that for later.

154
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,479
I have something more important than that.

155
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,679
I found Mom.

156
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,559
She's back in Thailand? When did she get back?

157
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,599
Where is she?

158
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,159
Where has she been all these years?
Why didn't she call us?

159
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,279
Huh?

160
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,799
Who are they talking about?

161
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,599
I can't tell you right now.

162
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,999
Why can't you tell me right now?

163
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,799
There's one thing you should know first.

164
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,439
What is it?

165
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,759
-It's about -
-Mrs. Su!

166
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,399
What can I do for you?

167
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,839
Why are you asking me now?!

168
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,279
Just go do your job!

169
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,199
Yes ma'am.

170
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,879
I came to get you to go have some snacks.

171
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,799
Peem is also here

172
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,199
Let's go have some snacks together.

173
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,279
That's okay.

174
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,719
I have errands I need to do with Dad

175
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,359
Let's go Dad

176
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,159
Let's.

177
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,599
Where is Peem going with Dad?

178
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,999
I don't know either.

179
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,359
Peem didn't tell you anything?

180
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,839
You're his wife.

181
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,999
Dad didn't tell you either.

182
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,039
What's strange about that?

183
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,039
Excuse me.

184
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,039
Regarding you and Pete

185
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,639
it's more than just friends isn't it?

186
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,399
Pete told you?

187
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,119
No.

188
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,759
I heard it myself

189
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,319
So?

190
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,479
It's over between him and I.

191
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,319
But if Peem knows about this

192
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,119
what will happen?

193
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,959
Are you threatening me?

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,159
If you don't want Peem to know about this

195
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,599
you should already know

196
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,879
you should be nice and obedient to me.

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,039
Do you know

198
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,039
why I didn't choose Pete?

199
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,199
Because Pete

200
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,959
has a mother who'sa mistress

201
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,559
Just calling you mom

202
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,519
already makes me disgusted.

203
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,599
Get over Usa.

204
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,399
But before this,

205
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,519
you told me to try to win her over.

206
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,239
That's before she was considered your brother'swife

207
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,719
But right now,

208
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,399
even though she's Mr. Thaw ip's daughter,

209
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,039
have a powerful father and a rich family

210
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,039
a woman who marries the older brother

211
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,919
but sleeps with the younger brother,

212
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,559
that woman isn't suitable for you.

213
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,559
I don't want that woman to be my daughter in law

214
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,399
I just want to make the most of her.

215
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,599
So that you can beat Peem, understood?

216
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,919
I'll make this decision on my own

217
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,359
Not you.

218
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,119
Gosh this boy!

219
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,199
Target is here!

220
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,759
Mrs. Tre.

221
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,519
Hello Mr s. Trepradu b.

222
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,519
Where's the money?

223
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,999
Oh.

224
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,039
M rs. Susaid if she doesn't get the original copy of the clip

225
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,479
we might not be able to pay you

226
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,119
That's too much!

227
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,719
This is bad then!

228
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,599
Well,

229
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,479
Mrs. Su doesn't trust you.

230
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,559
I'm the one

231
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,919
that shouldn't trust that madam lady!

232
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,199
She tricked me once four years ago

233
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,359
What did she trick you about?

234
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,519
The clip.

235
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,439
Don't worry

236
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,879
I know that Mrs. Sup ang was the one who leaked the clip four years ago.

237
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,959
Am I right?

238
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,679
Yes.

239
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,959
Why do you ask if you know?

240
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,599
So that means

241
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,759
Mrs. Sup ang was the one who leaked the clip

242
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,559
and made Grandma die.

243
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,999
Is that correct?

244
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,399
Yeah.

245
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,599
In that case you

246
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,039
were the one who recorded that clip,

247
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,799
am I right?

248
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,599
Wait.

249
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,999
This is none of your business

250
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,599
Why do you want to know?

251
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,999
Well?! Where's the money?!

252
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,999
You're not falling for the trick Tre

253
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,279
Start plan B

254
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,759
M rs. Su said if you won't admit to recording that clip

255
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,319
we can't give you the money.

256
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,079
What is your problem?!

257
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,079
Gosh,

258
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,719
think about it.

259
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,598
If someone makes a threat with the clip

260
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,598
and says she recorded it,

261
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,159
Mrs. Su will be in trouble.

262
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,359
You guys are...

263
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,199
Yes Madam?

264
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,039
You're so stingy.

265
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,199
What are you talking about?

266
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,039
Well,

267
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,559
your secretary said he won't give me the money

268
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,719
if I don't send you the original copy of the clip

269
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,239
Let me ask you Madam

270
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,399
Why do you want the original clip?

271
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,799
Tell me!

272
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,239
What did you say?

273
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,039
My secretary went to get the clip?

274
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,559
And also brought you the money?

275
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,719
There's no way, Impossible.

276
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,199
Is that so?

277
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,799
Hello?!

278
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,839
What is this?

279
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,279
Who are you?

280
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,999
Madam said she didn't send anyone here

281
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,999
Well?!

282
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,199
I'm Mr. Peem's secretary.

283
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,719
What?!

284
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,879
You can confess now

285
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,959
Mr s. Trepradu b

286
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,119
What now?

287
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,319
I don't know.

288
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,879
What now?

289
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,679
Yes Orn?

290
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,399
What's up?

291
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,399
What?!

292
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,399
Tat knows about this now?!

293
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,279
So what are we gonna do?!

294
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,519
If it's turning out like this

295
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,519
find your way out of this.

296
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,199
Every man for himself!

297
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,919
What about the rest of my money?!

298
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,679
Gosh! You still think I'm going to pay you?

299
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,519
Disgusting!

300
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,639
Hello?!

301
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,119
Hey.

302
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,679
Your mother has always lived here

303
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,719
and didn't went overseas like we understood?

304
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,079
Yes.

305
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,999
Mom was attacked and has amnesia

306
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,199
She didn't leave us like we understood.

307
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,479
Attacked?

308
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,639
Gosh Man ee.

309
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,879
I'm going to go see her.

310
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,359
Wait Dad.

311
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,319
There's one thing

312
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,999
that you should know.

313
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,199
What?

314
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,199
Well,

315
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,879
Mom got remarried.

316
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,399
Huh?

317
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,599
She has a new husband.

318
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,919
Mr. Puchong.

319
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,879
Hello.

320
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,879
Plubpl a.

321
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,759
Why are you here?

322
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,159
When I came here to negotiate about the land,

323
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,159
Plubpl a found out the same time as me.

324
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,199
Aunt Kaew said

325
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,439
you were bringing Mr, Puchong here.

326
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,079
So she asked me to come keep her company

327
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,079
She's waiting inside

328
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,399
Let's head in.

329
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,159
Peeman d Mr. Puchong are here

330
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,599
Man ee.

331
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,799
It really is you.

332
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,399
It is you.

333
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,119
Do you know that I've been searching for you all this time?

334
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,799
Hello.

335
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,279
Are you...

336
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,639
Peem's father?

337
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,479
Mom.

338
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,479
You can't remember Dad?

339
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,479
I'm Puchong

340
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,639
your husband

341
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,599
I don't remember you

342
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,479
This is Dec h.

343
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,199
My husband.

344
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,039
Everyone,

345
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,719
think we should let Kaew talk to Mr. Puchong in private.

346
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,359
Let's wait outside.

347
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,999
I think we should go wait for them at the pavilion

348
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,839
That's okay

349
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,519
IJ just want to walk around

350
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,919
Excuse me.

351
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,199
I'll be back.

352
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,759
You really can't remember who I am?

353
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,719
You can't remember me but how can you remember Peem?

354
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,079
The doctor told me

355
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,239
in addition to my brain being damaged and losing my memory.

356
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,239
there is another cause

357
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,959
It might be because

358
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,559
of my body's defense mechanisms

359
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,839
making me unable to remember the painful events from my past.

360
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,999
I'm really sorry for everything l've done.

361
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,559
I'm sorry.

362
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,999
Peem.

363
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,199
If you walk away from me again,

364
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,359
I'm going to think you still care about me.

365
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,359
O just

366
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,839
don't want to make us uncomfortable

367
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,679
But I don't feel that way

368
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,999
If you don't want to see me,

369
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,839
Why come here?

370
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,559
You already know you're going to have to see me if you come here

371
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,119
I came here because of Aunt Kaew.

372
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,199
Nothing to do with you.

373
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,999
I'm happy

374
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,199
that you like my mom.

375
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,959
I like your mom

376
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,879
but it doesn't mean l have to stop hating you

377
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,239
I wasn't counting on it.

378
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,039
But in this life,

379
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,999
are we ever going to get along?

380
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,439
Get along with someone like you?

381
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,999
I rather die and go reincarnate.

382
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,519
Plub.

383
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,599
Peem.

384
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,319
Let go.

385
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,799
Plub!

386
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,519
What's up Kit?

387
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,519
You secretly followed Plub here?

388
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,879
Why does it have to be a secret?

389
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,039
Plub told me she was coming here.

390
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,839
Did you need something coming all the way here?

391
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,559
I want to help you earn points from Mr, Dec h

392
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,799
So he can finally make a decision on the land.

393
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,959
Actually today.

394
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,599
I didn't come here regarding the land.

395
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,919
Aunt Kaew, Uncle Dec h's wife,needed my help.

396
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,679
Right.

397
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,999
You told me.

398
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,199
But no matter what it is,

399
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,199
I still want to help you

400
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,879
You don't trust your wife or what?

401
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,439
Or are you scared Plubp la is still in love with me?

402
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,679
Peem!

403
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,799
Vi kit.

404
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,559
I will not go back to loving the man who ruined my life

405
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,559
I told you already.

406
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,559
He's someone I hate the most.

407
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,159
Most importantly,

408
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,999
I will never leave you.

409
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,519
I trust you.

410
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,639
In that case, I'll take my leave

411
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,159
Drive safe.

412
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,199
I will.

413
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,199
Oh.

414
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,599
Here you guys are.

415
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,319
Kaew has finished talking to your father.

416
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,639
So I came to get you.

417
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:06,959
Thank you.

418
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,039
Let's go.

419
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,639
Do you remember the culprit's face?

420
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,359
I can only remember

421
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,399
I wanted to come here

422
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,279
for vacation.

423
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,359
so,

424
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,359
do you remember how you came here

425
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,559
or who knew that you were coming here?

426
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,399
Right.

427
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,679
I came here with Ump on

428
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,399
Aunt Um pon, Sa's mother?

429
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,319
Yes.

430
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,479
Ump on is my best friend.

431
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,919
After you went missing,

432
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,079
she never told us about this.

433
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,519
Are you mistaken Mom?

434
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,999
No.

435
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,959
I really came here with Ump on

436
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,599
In that case,

437
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,479
if you guys were together and you went missing

438
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,279
Aunt Ump on should have told us Dad.

439
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,279
Yes. She never told us about this

440
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,119
Then have you ever had any problems with her Auntie?

441
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,959
There was one thing.

442
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,239
Are you having an affair with Thaw ip?!

443
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,759
What are you talking about?!

444
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,959
This Here's the proof!

445
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,359
Just admit it!

446
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,199
I admit I did go there that day.

447
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,079
But I went to eat out with my friend.

448
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,999
It's not what you think.

449
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,519
If it's not you,

450
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,279
then who is that woman?!

451
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,519
Think about it.

452
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,159
Your husband is a public figure

453
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,999
If he wants to take his mistress to a hotel,

454
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,639
would they dare walk in together like that?

455
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,999
People wil I just have fun gossiping.

456
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,599
Ump on.

457
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,159
We've been friends for a long time

458
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,599
You don't trust me?

459
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,439
If not you,

460
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,839
then who is that woman?

461
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,599
Hey.

462
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,199
Mr Thaw ip is cheating on you?

463
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,919
He's changed a lot lately

464
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,359
I suspect he has another woman.

465
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,599
Sol had an investigator-follow him.

466
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,239
I found out he went into a hotel with a woman.

467
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,919
The investigator told me he went up an elevator with a woman but couldn't take a picture in time.

468
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,359
Until one day,

469
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,679
someone sent these photos to me.

470
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,799
If it's not you,

471
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,199
then who is this woman?!

472
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,199
Huh?!

473
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,999
Who is she?!

474
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,279
Ump on.

475
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,719
Calm down.

476
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,679
After I cleared things up with Ump on

477
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,599
she left.

478
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,599
The next day

479
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,999
I was attacked.

480
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,839
The person that sent the guy to harm you

481
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,919
was Aunt Ump on?

482
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,159
I'm...

483
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,399
I'm not so sure.

484
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,679
The only way to know the truth

485
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,639
is make Aunt Ump on confess

486
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:58,999
Ying.

487
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,719
If Su thee asks, tell him I went to go visit our son.

488
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,199
Yes ma'am.

489
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,399
Tong.

490
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,399
Where are you going?

491
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,199
My business. Don't meddle.

492
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,799
Tre.

493
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,359
-Tong!
- You can't go anywhere yet!

494
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,519
We need to talk!

495
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,439
Can we save it for later? I'm in a hurry!

496
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,879
Let go of me Tong!

497
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,039
Tre!
Don't bother me!

498
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,319
What about us?

499
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,999
Do you have time to talk to us?

500
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,559
Plub.

501
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:40,839
Yes?

502
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,119
Thank you so much for coming

503
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:43,879
Sure.

504
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,599
Let me know if you need any help

505
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,519
Don't feel considerate

506
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,799
Okay.

507
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,279
You sure you can go home on your own?

508
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,119
Do you want me to follow you home?

509
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,239
I can manage

510
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,919
In that case,

511
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,639
I'll take my leave.

512
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,959
Bye.

513
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,599
Peem.

514
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,999
Yes?

515
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,639
Safe travels son.

516
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,119
Call me when you've reached home.

517
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,359
Sure.

518
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,199
Let's go Dad.

519
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,159
Let's go home

520
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,239
I'll come by to visit again when I get the chance.

521
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,479
Okay.

522
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,799
Goodbye Mr. Dec h

523
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,359
Bye :

524
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,279
Let's go.

525
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,719
In that case you

526
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,599
were the one who recorded that clip,

527
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,439
aml right?

528
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,359
Well Tre?

529
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,519
Will you answer my question now?

530
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,519
Yes.

531
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,678
I did it!

532
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,239
How could you do this?!

533
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,719
You're here too?

534
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,678
What are you doing here?

535
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,439
Peem.

536
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,678
Plub.

537
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,479
Orn.

538
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,959
What's going on?

539
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,559
Why is Peem here?

540
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,439
This involves him too.

541
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,198
He deserves to know about this as much as you

542
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,719
So I had Tat call him here as well

543
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,359
What's going on?

544
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,999
Go inside.

545
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,039
You'll know soon.

546
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,119
Mr. Peem.

547
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,279
Tre.

548
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,559
Tong.

549
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,159
What's going on?

550
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,519
Will you tell them

551
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,599
or do you want me to?

552
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,999
It's...

553
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,759
Plub, Mr, Peem, I...

554
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,239
-Tre here...

555
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,239
was the one who recorded that clip of you two

556
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,479
four years ago.

557
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,479
What?!

558
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,399
Is it true?

559
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,839
Plub.

560
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,599
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

561
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,119
You have to believe me.

562
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,719
Do you realize how much damage you've done on Plubpl a?!

563
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,999
She's your sister!

564
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,879
Weren't you getting engaged to another woman?!

565
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,559
You already slept with my sister!
That's why l had to do that!

566
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,919
The news of Peem getting engaged

567
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,919
was after you recorded them!

568
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,319
Tre.

569
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,039
You really did it?

570
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,239
It wasn't just me

571
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,999
Mr. Peem's step mother was the one who leaked it.

572
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,399
What?

573
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,959
Au nt Su did?!

574
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,519
Yes!

575
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,639
I was going to use the clip to seek justice for Plub

576
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,319
but your step mother tricked me and leaked the clip!

577
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,439
Plub.

578
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,039
You have to believe me.

579
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,039
I really didn't mean to hurt you.

580
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,319
You have to believe me!

581
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,319
Tre.

582
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,879
Stop saying that you did everything for Plub!

583
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,999
I know what kind of person you are!

584
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,759
You wanted to use that clip to blackmail and get the money from Peem didn't you?!

585
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,759
Gosh!

586
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,759
Tong!

587
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,679
Isn't it better than your beloved sister losing her virginity for free?!

588
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,399
If your beloved sister

589
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,599
wasn't so easy to sleep with a man and allowed this to happen, I wouldn't have done it!

590
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,639
So you can't blame me for all of this!

591
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,479
Tre!

592
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,919
You made Grandma die!

593
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,919
You put the blame on me

594
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,799
and made me feel guilty!

595
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,399
I will never forgive you!

596
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,719
From this day forward

597
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,079
we're not sisters anymore!

598
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,439
Plubpl a!

599
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,399
Someone like you

600
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,519
is a lost cause!

601
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,399
P lub is right.

602
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,799
I hope you

603
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,799
pay for your karma

604
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,479
for causing Grandma to die.

605
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,399
I hope you suffer and die alone!

606
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,679
Gosh!

607
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,959
Why is everyone blaming me?!

608
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,359
What did I do wrong?!

609
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,559
Plub!

610
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,799
Isn't she my sister?

611
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,999
If she can hurt you this much

612
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,559
she probably doesn't consider you family
