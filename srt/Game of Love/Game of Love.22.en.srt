1
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,479
You're the best decision

2
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,039
that I've ever made

3
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,959
I'm happy

4
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,359
that you chose me to be right here.

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,399
I'm so happy

6
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,719
to have you

7
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,639
and Putter

8
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,199
as my family.

9
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,119
Even though

10
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,959
it's

11
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,679
it's...

12
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,279
a fake family.

13
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,999
But I hope that one day

14
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,679
we'll be a reall one.

15
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,239
Right now I...

16
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,399
You don't have to give me an answer right now.

17
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,719
I understand.

18
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,119
When everything ends

19
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,839
you can give me an answer then.

20
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,399
In the meantime,

21
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,159
give me this chance for me to earn brownie points from you

22
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,039
Who...

23
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,799
wants to go to the mall with me tomorrow?

24
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,199
Me. I want to go buy a robot.

25
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,239
You want to buy a robot?

26
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,519
Should I buy it for you?

27
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,239
You have to come see me if you want it.

28
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,559
Quickly.

29
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,679
I'm counting to three.

30
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,759
One...

31
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,359
two...

32
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,279
Come.

33
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,159
Gosh! You ire starting to get heavy now

34
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,679
What did you want?

35
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,319
Robot.

36
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,839
Sure. I'll buy it for you.

37
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,399
Also,

38
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,479
I want you to go too

39
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,999
I'm going to...

40
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,319
introduce you to Mr. Mark

41
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,319
As...

42
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,199
the company's new marketing manager.

43
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,239
Marketing manager?

44
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,479
Yes.

45
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,039

46
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,719
start working at the company tomorrow

47
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,199
What about Putter?

48
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,559
Will he not bother you?

49
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,959
It's okay.

50
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,319
He won't.

51
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,279
Right?

52
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,079
What did you want?

53
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,559
Robot.

54
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,959
What kind of robot?

55
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,799

Okay.

59
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,519

00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,919
So many toys.

61
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,199
We're here Putter

62
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,399
Wow! I can play all of this?

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,879
You can play them but only the ones Aunt Ta en says yes to.

64
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,839

Don't be mischievous

68
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,079

00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,919

We should get going

74
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,959
It's almost time to meet Mr Mark

75
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:14,959
Okay.

76
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,319
Mr, Mark.

77
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,839
Hello.

78
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,599
I'm Peem from PP World

79
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,519
Oh.

80
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,639
You're him.

81
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,239
What can I do for you?

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,159
I want to apologize for missing the appointment.

83
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,039
I really had an important matter to attend.

84
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,799
Right.

85
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,999
It's okay.

86
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,719
Hey.

87
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,839
That's Peem

88
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,279
Mr. Mark

89
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,439
What do we do?

90
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,599
You and Tong hide first, I'll handle it.

91
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,119
Wait Mr. Mark.

92
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,439
-l have a project pro --
Mr. Peem.

93
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,959
Please have some manners.

94
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,119
You're going to do it this way?

95
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,439
As if you've never done this before.

96
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,679
Mr. Mark.

97
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,919
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,839
But I made a deal with VGroup already

99
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,119
Thailand is one of the top tourist destinations in the world.

100
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,519
A world-famous hotel like Mark is opening a branch

101
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,719
I think

102
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,239
there shouldn't only be one branch

103
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,399
I have a new project proposal

104
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,439
I guarantee you will be impressed.

105
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,759
Mr, Mark.

106
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,799
It's time for our meeting.

107
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,959
I'll have my secretary contact you

108
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,479
This is your last chance

109
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,159
Thank you so much.

110
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,199
Let's go.

111
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,359
What...

112
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,879
What color do you want?

113
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,839
Are you having fun Putter?

114
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,039
Yes but I'm thirsty

115
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,919
Thirsty?

116
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,639
Let's go buy a drink over there.

117
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,079
Come.

118
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,639
No.

119
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,079
Oh you want to stay and play, You don't want to go.

120
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,158
Then wait here for me

121
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,439
Do not go anywhere.

122
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,399
I will go buy you a drink okay?

123
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,879
Yes.
. Okay.

124
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,559
Wait here. Don't,go anywhere.

125
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,038
Okay.

126
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,679
I'll be right back.

127
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,559
Excuse me.

128
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,519
Can l have one of this?

129
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,039
Also...

130
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,199
one of this dessert.

131
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,719
Mom!

132
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,159
Thank you.

133
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,919
Putter!

134
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,599
Where are you Putter?!

135
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,959
Putter!

136
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,039
Oh my god!

137
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,639
Where did you go?!

138
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,519
Putter!

139
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,599
Aunt Ta en.

140
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,479
Where's Putter?

141
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,039
Well.

142
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,119
I just went to buy a drink real quick.

143
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,879
When I got back, Putter was gone.

144
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,999
What?!

145
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,999
I don't know where he went.

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,399
Quickly go find him!

147
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,119
- Right now Auntie!
-Okay!

148
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,159
Oh my!

149
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,319
Putter!

150
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,959
Mom!

151
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,159
It's not Mom.

152
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,239
Where is Mom?

153
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,479
Tong.

154
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,839
Did you find him?

155
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:16,959
Did you?

156
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,159
Did you find him Aunt Ta en?
-No.

157
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,319
He's not over there either.

158
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,639
I think they should announce a missing kid.

159
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,279
The securities can help look for him too.

160
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,559
Go do it then.

161
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,679
Aunt Ta en, can you go look for him over there?

162
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,399
Sure.

163
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,639
I'll go this way.

164
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,679
Putter!

165
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,199
Where are you?

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,759
Putter!

167
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,239
Mom!

168
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,359
Little kid!

169
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,919
You can't go down there

170
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,679
It's going up, not down.

171
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,919
You'll fall down.

172
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,119
I'm going to go see Mom.

173
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,519
Mom is down there.

174
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,599
Your mom is down there?

175
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:40,999
Yes.

176
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,919
What?

177
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,479
How can she let a kid be alone like this?

178
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,119
Brave One.

179
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,839
What is your name?

180
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,439
My name is Putter.

181
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,239
Your name is Putter?

182
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,879
Brave One.

183
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,119
I will take you to your mom then.

184
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,079
Okay.

185
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,559
Let's go.

186
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,839
Putter.

187
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,759
Where?

188
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,239
Where is your mom?

189
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,839
Mom was just here

190
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,559
Really?

191
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,119
It's okay.

192
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,479
I will help you look for her.

193
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,319
Okay.

194
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,279
Where is she?

195
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,719
Where is Mom? You want to ask the bear?

196
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,919
Where is Mom?

197
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,199
Thank you so much Mr, Mark.

198
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,559
It's a pleasure to be working with a talented person like you.

199
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,319
Likewise.

200
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,839
Please

201
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,119
Kit! Kit!

202
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,359
What is it Tong?

203
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,559
Putter is missing

204
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,959
What?!

205
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,679
Putter is missing?!

206
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,319
Plub and Aunt Ta en are looking for him right now.

207
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,599
Tell all securities to look for my son

208
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,119
Sure.

209
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,679
We should go look for him too.

210
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,479
Where is she?

211
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,039
Do you see your mom Putter?

212
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,439
No I don't.

213
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,839
Putter.

214
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,799
Should we go look for her over there?

215
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,479
Okay.

216
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,159
Let's go.

217
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,519
Let's go find your mom!

218
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,559
Plub!

219
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,799
Plub, did you find him?

220
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,319
Aunt Ta en.

221
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,679
Well?

222
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,719
Is your mom around here?

223
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,399
No.

224
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,519
What do we do?

225
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,839
In that case,

226
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,799
I will go tell the officials and have them

227
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,799
look for your mom, okay?

228
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,399
Okay.

229
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,799
What's your mom's name?

230
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,559
Her name is Plub --

231
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,159
Putter!

232
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,439
There you are!

233
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,519
Aunt Ta en!

234
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,439
Come with Grandmas on

235
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,399
Wait.

236
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,839
He's your grandson?

237
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,799
Yes.

238
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,679
Come on.

239
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,599
M r. Yot got married?

240
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,079
It's none of your business. Don't meddle!

241
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,079
Let's go son.

242
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,679
l've been looking everywhere for you

243
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,719
Mom!

244
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,799
Putter!

245
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:04,959
Aunt Ta en.

246
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,359
Where did you find him at?

247
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,359
The children's zone

248
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,559
He was with Mr. Peem

249
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,559
-Does he know that Put --
-No he doesn't.

250
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,119
I told him he was my grandson

251
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,999
Plub.

252
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,399
Yes?

253
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,479
want to talk to you

254
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,359
Can you watch Putter?

255
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:43,799
Sure.

256
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,039
Don't worry.

257
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,919
Let's go To ng.

258
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,279
I think

259
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,439
it's time that we face Peem

260
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,039
You mean...

261
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,199
I will introduce you and Putter

262
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,839
as my wife

263
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,039
and son.

264
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,359
Putter too?

265
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,959
-I think --
-Plub.

266
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,679
We can't hide Putter.

267
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,959
The more we try to hide him,some day

268
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,759
if Peem knows that he's your son,

269
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,999
he will get even more suspicious

270
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,639
What if Peem...

271
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,719
gets suspicious of Putter?

272
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,039
He can only suspect.

273
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,679
If you confirm to him that Putter is our son,

274
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,679
he can't do anything about it.

275
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,959
Geez, you're in a good mood.

276
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,759
Mr, Mark was willing to talk to you?

277
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,679
Yes but the reason I'm in a good mood

278
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,039
is not because of that

279
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,319
met Aunt Tae n's grandson today.

280
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,839
The kid was so adorable.

281
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,959
Aunt Tae n's grandson?

282
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,039
Yeah.

283
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,719
That cop's son.

284
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,439
Yot right?

285
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,159
I think so.

286
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,519
But his giri friend lives in the same condo as me.

287
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,599
didn't see her getting pregnant.

288
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,519
Maybe he...

289
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,679
had a kid with another woman.

290
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,759
I guess that girl got cheated on.

291
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,039
T at, this is the first time

292
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,919
I feel like l want to have a child.

293
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,279
You think if I have a kid with Plubpl a.

294
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,759
how do you think the kid will look like?

295
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,119
Hey, I think you should reconcile with her first.

296
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,959
Do not skip steps

297
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,839
Geez!

298
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,639
This fool!

299
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,639
You --

300
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,199
The one who likes to obstruct happiness!

301
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,199
I don't know what to do any more

302
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,359
Peem is always avoiding me

303
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,119
I go to see him and help with work,

304
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,839
but he's still unhappy.

305
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,359
That woman left years ago.

306
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,199
But Peem is still like this.

307
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,199
No.

308
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,879
I need to have a word with Mr. Puchong.

309
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,239
Calm down.

310
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,159
We're the ones that insisted on this engagement.

311
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,039
So what do I have to do?

312
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,799
What do I do to have Peem stop thinking about Plubpl a

313
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,479
and acknowledge me as his fiancee?

314
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,839
Did you know

315
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,479
people are talking about how l got dumped by Peem before we even got married?

316
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,039
I don't know where to put my face

317
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,999
Damn Peem.

318
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,879
He should be respectful.

319
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,039
How about this?

320
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,559
There's going to be a charity gala dinner.

321
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,159
You're attending.

322
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,679
Yes. So?

323
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,319
We can have our daughter dressed beautifully and take Peem

324
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,559
So they can shut those gossip ers up

325
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,279
Will Peem go?

326
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,199
Peem has to go regardless.

327
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,719
If he doesn't,

328
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,399
I will make him go.

329
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,999
You want me to take Sa to a charity gala dinner?

330
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,079
Yes.

331
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,799
Mr. Thaw ip has been scolding you for not paying attention to his daughter lately

332
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,319
Why do I have to pay attention? I didn't want to get engaged to her.

333
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,759
Mr. Thaw ip forced me to get engaged to her.

334
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,399
But Sa didn't do anything wrong

335
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,599
Fine.

336
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,079
I will fulfill my duty as Sa's fiance one last time.

337
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,399
Last time?

338
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,679
What do you mean?

339
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,879
You're going to call off the engagement?

340
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,119
Yes.

341
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,919
It's time that l call it off

342
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,639
Hey! Wait Peem!

343
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,799
Think carefully before you do anything

344
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,359
If we become enemies with Mr Thaw ip

345
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,959
there will be problems for our company.

346
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,199
That can't be helped.

347
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,039
Let's just say

348
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,639
it's time for you to show your skills in protecting our company.

349
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,479
Because I can't help anyway

350
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,319
Why are you saying this?!

351
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,599
Peem!

352
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,359
I'm sorry son.

353
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,879
That despicable man shouldn't be your father

354
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,399
I will protect you.

355
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,119
Dad.

356
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,599
Do I look handsome?

357
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,279
Let me take a look

358
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,919
Wow!

359
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,439
Very handsome!

360
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,439
What about me?

361
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,439
You look handsome too.

362
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,759
Uncle Tong too.

363
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,039
And..

364
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,359
your mom?

365
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,399
Mom looks pretty like a princess.

366
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,719
Putter.

367
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,879
How do I look?

368
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,359
Pretty like a princess.

369
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,279
Sweet talking like this,

370
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,279
the ladies will be swarming you soon.

371
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,359
But...

372
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,319
Putter is right.

373
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,319
You look very beautiful

374
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,959
Thank you.

375
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,439
Putter.

376
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,519
We should go wait in the car, Come on.

377
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,119
Are you ready?

378
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,039
I'm ready

379
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,439
Don't worry.

380
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,559
No matter what happens,

381
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,079
my hand will always reach out to you

382
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,839
I will never let go of your hand.

383
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,119
Thank you.

384
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,159
Are you doing well?

385
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,879
I am.
- That's good.

386
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,999
Mr. Puchong

387
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,719
Hello Mr. Thawip, Mrs. Umpon

388
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,079
-Hello.
--Are you doing well?

389
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,719
am well.

390
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,919
It's just.

391
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,919
Peem went to go pick Sa up at the house.
They'll be here soon.

392
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,799
Right. They're meeting us here

393
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,439
I got impatient so I came here first

394
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,039
Besides, women tend to get ready slow

395
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,319
I get tired of waiting

396
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,079
Yes.

397
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,759
Have you been well, Mr s. Umpon?

398
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,719
It's been a while since I last saw you

399
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,519
I'm well.

400
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,239
Keep being arrogant.

401
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,599
You think your husband is head over heels for you?

402
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,719
Pete!

403
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,559
This way son.

404
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,119
Greet Mr. Thawip and Mrs. Umpon first

405
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,599
Hello.

406
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,399
You've grown so much Pete

407
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,879
You're a young man now.

408
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,799
He's working at the company now

409
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,399
Peem and Saare here

410
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,759
- Ms. Sa, look over here please.
-Hello.

411
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,559
Please scoot closer together.

412
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,879
Nice. Beautiful.

413
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,919
Okay, one more.

414
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,199
One, two, three

415
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,959

416
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,319
- On e, two--
-lf you'll excuse me.

417
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,039
Hello.

418
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,359
- Hello.
-Peem.

419
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,119
You look beautiful Sa.

420
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,159
Am I right Pete?

421
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,519
Yeah.

422
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,519
Usa looks very beautiful.

423
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,759
There's Mr. Mark

424
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,559
I'm going to go say hi to him.

425
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,759
Sa.

426
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,639
Go get to know his business partner

427
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,519
Sure.

428
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,079
Hello.

429
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,759
Oh! Mr. Peem!

430
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,839
Hello.

431
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,759
saw him in the front

432
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,679
Oh.

433
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,679
You two seem close

434
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,639
Tat isn't just my assistant.

435
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,399
He's my best friend that I trust the most.

436
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,639
Oh.

437
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,159
That's why.

438
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,799
Yes.

439
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,399
Peem.

440
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,559
Hello Mr. Mark

441
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,919
Who is this young woman?

442
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,599
I'm Sa.

443
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,279
Peem's fiancee.

444
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,279
You're all here as a couple today

445
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,759
I heard Mr. Vik it will be bringing his wife and child to this function as well

446
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,319
When did Kit get married and have a child?

447
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,159
didn't know

448
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,639
If you don't know, how would I know?

449
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,279
You guys are friends, correct?

450
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,039
Yes.

451
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,159
Oh, speaking of the devil!

452
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,159
Mr. Vi kit!

453
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,959
Plubpl a.

454
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,399
-Hello Mr. Mark-Hello.

455
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,079
Hello Mr. Mark

456
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,759
- Hello.
-Hey.

457
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,079
This is Plubpl a

458
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,359
My wife.

459
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,759
It's nice to meet you

460
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,639
Your wife is very beautiful.

461
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,639
Yes.

462
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,959
For me,

463
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,639
she is the gift from God.

464
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,359
Stay calm Peem

465
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,279
Hold it in.

466
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,039
You'll ruin it.

467
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,839
Right.

468
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,839
You guys are friends, right?

469
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,559
That's right.

470
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,519
We were friends since high school

471
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,319
My apologies

472
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,439
I have to go greet an acquaintance.

473
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,239
You guys go ahead and talk

474
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,199
Sure.

475
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,439
What's up Peem?

476
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,399
We meet again, Mr. Peem

477
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,679
That's...

478
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,199
Plubpl a.

479
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,399
She was once in the headline with Peem

480
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,639
So how did she ended up with Kit?

481
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,719
It looks like...

482
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,239
Kit brought her here to introduce to everyone

483
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,559
If that's the case.

484
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,199
it's fine.

485
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,999
I think we shouldn't pay attention to the children.

486
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,679
We should discuss about the project in Phuket instead

487
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,319
I thought you wouldn't be attending to night's function

488
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,319
You usually don't like them

489
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,319
Yes.

490
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,159
I usually don't like these events.

491
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,999
But if Sa like s it, I am willing to'come.

492
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,999
I can do it for Sa

493
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,639
When's the wedding?

494
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,239
Soon.

495
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,319
Invite me.

496
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,479
Sure.

497
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,919
I won't have any surprises like you and Plubpl a.

498
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,719
Yeah.

499
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,319
When did you get married and have a child together?

500
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,559
We didn't know about it.

501
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,199
Never mind married

502
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,199
When did you guys even dated?

503
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,639
We dated when l went to study in America

504
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,639
Yes.

505
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,319
We met there

506
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,519
until our relationship progressed and got married

507
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,279
That's strange.

508
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,639
Women dreams of having a fancy wedding

509
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,919
very grand, in which you can give her that.

510
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,559
But why didn't you? Why was the wedding a secret?

511
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,759
It wasn't a secret

512
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,079
But Plub wanted privacy

513
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,439
So we had a wedding where guests weren't invited!

514
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,999
It's still strange

515
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,039
Is there another reason?

516
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,479
Or...

517
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,359
you quickly got married to Vi kit

518
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,159
because you were hurt that I was getting engaged to Sa?

519
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,319
Peem.

520
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,559
Please respect my wife

521
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,559
Hey.

522
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,959
I'm just teasing

523
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,679
my former secretary

524
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,319
Don't over think it.

525
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,199
- Peem!
- That's okay Vi kit

526
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,599
Let Mr. Peem think whatever he wants to think

527
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,039
The last time l saw him, he wasn't acting like this.

528
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,039
I was concern at first

529
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,839
Uncle Peem!

530
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,359
Putter.

531
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,879
Why are you here?

532
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,199
I came with my mom and dad

533
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,519
Come here son

534
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,719
What is this?

535
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,519
You know my friend?

536
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,839
Uncle Peem helped me look for Mom at them all

537
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,799
So it was Uncle Peem.

538
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,039
Thank you

539
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,879
for helping our son.

540
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,559
Putter.

541
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,999
Say thank you to Uncle Peem again.

542
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,079
Thank you.

543
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,439
Mrs. Rak.

544
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,319
Hi.

545
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,079
This is Plubpl a

546
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,239
My wife.

547
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,799
J see you on TV quite often. You're a very talented businesswoman.

548
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,799
Thank you.

549
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,519
You two look very compatible with each other.

550
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,159
Thank you.

551
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,759
Mrs. Rak.

552
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,519
I have something to discuss with you.

553
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,559
Was she the one in the news with Mr. Peem?

554
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,639
Yeah.

555
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,639
She married Mr. Vi kit

556
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,359
She doesn't seem ordinary

557
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,199
I think she's quite bad, don't you think so?

558
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,359
I think so.

559
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,919
Plub.

560
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,599
Are you okay?

561
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,759
I've been through the most painful thing in my life

562
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,039
Just the glares and gossips here

563
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,679
don't hurt me.

564
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,439
You haven't blinked at all

565
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,879
Still yearning for her?

566
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,079
Don't start with me

567
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,479
I'm just reminding you

568
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,638
I don't want other people

569
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,719
to think you're a pedophile

570
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,959
Regretting someone's wife like a young boy.

571
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,158
Hey!

572
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,158
I can tell how you look at her

573
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,839
I can see it from Mars.

574
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,039
IJ just pity my son

575
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,999
Oh really?

576
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,279
As if!

577
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:07,719
Didn't I tell you I will back away if Peem really loves this woman?

578
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:15,039
I stopped taking interest in Plubpl a ever since I found out Peem loved her.

579
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,679
Better be true.

580
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,319
True or not, that's your opinion. It's none of my business.

581
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,359
No matter what,

582
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,999
you're not my lawful wife anyway.

583
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,759
Puchong!

584
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,119
It would have been nice if you thought of Plubp la like this from the beginning.

585
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,839
But I still don't trust you.

586
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,879
Just accept it Peem

587
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,639
They're married and have a child together.

588
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,319
I know.

589
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,439
I'm just hurt.

590
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,479
I understand.

591
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,519
I'll get something cold for you to drink.

592
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,159
You'll be in a better mood

593
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,199
Keep it together.

594
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,559
Don't forget

595
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,559
you're still my fiance.

596
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,399
If I wasn't thinking about our engagement.

597
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,679
I wouldn't be standing here

598
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,879
Good.

599
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,519
In that case, do your best as the fiance

600
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,279
Don't humiliate yourself for losing to Kit

601
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,519
Honorable guests

602
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,919
Next up is a special awards ceremony

603
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,359
to the philanthropist who donated the most money to our association for the year

604
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,839
Mr. Peem Pattaratrakul!

605
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,079
Let's go do our job as an engaged couple then.

606
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,239
Please say a few words Mr. Peem.

607
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,159
The truth is

608
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,319
I didn't do charity to get an award

609
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,039
But thank you so much for the award

610
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,159
Before this,

611
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,999
I was a self-absorbed person

612
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,079
But four years ago

613
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,559
I met a woman

614
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,159
who I once insulted

615
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,679
and misunderstood her

616
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,319
Shortly after getting to know her

617
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,439
I saw that she did everything

618
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,519
for others before herself

619
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,719
As long as what she was doing was right

620
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,439
I really feel guilty

621
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,839
Who would believe that a woman of her size

622
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,319
that l once insulted

623
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,119
changed my life til now?

624
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,799
That woman

625
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,999
made me a better person.

626
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,039
I'm ready Plub

627
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,959
What's next?

628
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,519
Plub.

629
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,719
You want to change your mind?

630
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,119
Do it.
