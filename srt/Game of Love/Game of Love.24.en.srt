1
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,799
Peem

2
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,799
The board called an urgent meeting.

3
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,759
It's about renewing the lease

4
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,159
I think we shouldn't there new the lease with PP World

5
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,399
Because the benefits we will receive

6
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,719
isn't worth the risk.

7
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,879
I'd like everyone to vote

8
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,839
whether we want PP World

9
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,239
to renew their lease contract with us or not.

10
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,719
Thankyou for letting me know.

11
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,919
How did it go?

12
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,639
The meeting

13
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,439
has approved us of renewing our lease, my friend.

14
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,239
It's a success!

15
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,079
We have a problem Mr. Peem.

16
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,079
What is it Kwang?

17
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,479
The Saan Fun restaurant we were making a deal with changed their mind!

18
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,079
Huh?

19
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,199
Why?

20
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,479
I don't know.

21
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,279
But our people found out that VGroup was also trying to make a deal with this restaurant.

22
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,799
VGroup

23
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,879
That means Kit knows we are trying to negotiate a deal with this restaurant.

24
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,759
He knows we are trying to open a franchise

25
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,239
Is he trying to take everything from me?

26
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,119
The marketing department has already talked to the owner.

27
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,879
It didn't seem to work.

28
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,359
It's fine.

29
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,359
I'll handle this matter.

30
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,799
You're doing this yourself?

31
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,759
Yes.

32
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,959
It'll slow things down if I let someone else go.

33
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,799
If I go, I can make the decision right there regarding their conditions.

34
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,599
I am not going to lose to Kit again.

35
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,599
SAAN FUN

36
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,199
-Hello.
-Hello.

37
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,239
My employee said you wanted to see my father?

38
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,159
This is my father

39
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,319
Saan, the owner of this restaurant

40
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,719
I'm Peem Pattaratrakul

41
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,159
The owner of PP World.

42
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,679
Oh, you're here in person?

43
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,839
I understand you might not be satisfied with our offer

44
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,279
so we can agree to a new deal.

45
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,519
You're also here?

46
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,039
Even if you came here in person,
I'm not going to change my mind

47
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,319
Leave!

48
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,959
I'm not going to do that damn franchise!

49
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,639
Who else is here?

50
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,519
Hello Mr. Singh!

51
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,319
Hello.

52
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,999
Peem!

53
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,359
Plubpl a.

54
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,799
Why are you here?

55
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,799
I came here for work

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,319
I'm VGroup'smarketing manager.

57
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,959
I'll be honest.

58
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,119
It's not that my father doesn't want to sell his shares to you to go do a franchise.

59
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,439
So why did he change his mind?

60
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,439
Yeah.

61
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,839
This restaurant was my mother's
dream who passed away.

62
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,239
They build this restaurant up until it became famous

63
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,239
Dad was afraid that

64
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,199
if it becomes a franchise with many branches out there,

65
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,559
it might lack quality.

66
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,119
Dad believes that

67
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,559
no one knows and loves this restaurant better than us.

68
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,199
If you're worried about this matter,

69
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,639
you don't have to.

70
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,439
VGroup has someone to supervise the quality of the franchise all the time.

71
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,159
PP World

72
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,679
is good at making top brands.

73
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,159
We did this before.

74
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,319
Please let Uncle know

75
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,879
not to worry.

76
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,679
Just because it's done before,
it doesn't mean that it's better.

77
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,159
May be the company that came after makes more profit.

78
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,039
Profits

79
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,839
aren't measured by quality

80
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,679
I think you both should stay calm.

81
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,159
It's pointless talking to me right now

82
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,679
It's my father's decision.

83
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,359
In that case, I will make him change his mind

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,999
Me too.

85
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,719
What are you guys going to do?

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,719
-I'm going to come train here.
- I'd like to train --

87
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,519
You're going to go work at Uncle
Saan'ssteak restaurant?

88
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,639
Yes.

89
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,479
For awhile.

90
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,199
I want to show Uncle Saan

91
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,879
that we will make the restaurant he loves

92
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,439
better than him.

93
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,439
I just want to learn the work here.

94
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,439
I want to show Uncle that

95
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,839
VGroup can do it too

96
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,639
But you can let someone else do it.

97
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,639
Why not?

98
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,199
Plubp la is here.

99
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,159
Huh?!

100
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,319
The woman love became my friend'swife

101
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,399
Now she's also my business rival.

102
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,639
How do you think l should feel?

103
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,439
Gosh Peem.

104
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,279
That's why I can't lose

105
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,959
Can you let Kit know?

106
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,679
I have to go.

107
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,038
Why Kit?

108
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,918
What's your problem?

109
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,239
You married Kit

110
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,959
not because you love him.

111
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,119
But you want to get revenge on me.

112
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,959
You chose Kit

113
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,999
because you think he will help you get your revenge.

114
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,639
Am I right?

115
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,319
How could you think that?

116
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,879
You think

117
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,399
I married Kit

118
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,679
because of you?

119
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,439
You...

120
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,439
are still delusional

121
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,999
thinking this universe revolves around you.

122
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,999
But you changed so much Plubpl a

123
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,719
if you already gave yourself a way for what you want.

124
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,759
What did l say wrong?

125
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,559
I still believe the reason you married Kit

126
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,439
is because you want to get revenge on me.

127
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,719
The one to pity here is Putter.

128
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,879
A child who wasn't conceived with love.

129
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,719
How would he feel when he grows up and finds out?

130
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,759
How pitiful!

131
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,119
Putter was conceived with love.

132
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,839
You have no right to talk about my son like this

133
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,639
Plubpl a.

134
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,759
Send a message to Kit

135
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,079
that even though he sent you here,

136
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,199
I will not surrender to him!

137
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,519
Great.

138
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,679
I will also do everything

139
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,199
to beat you as well.

140
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,679
It's a pleasure to be working with you

141
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,239
Yes.

142
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,599
I have to thank you and Mr. Mark

143
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,599
for trusting me to join this project

144
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,559
Your company has work that fits our concept.

145
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,399
Am I right Mr. Mark?

146
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,639
Yes.

147
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,479
I like your design work

148
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,919
Thank you.

149
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,999
If you like it,

150
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,479
why don't you have Mr. Su the e's company

151
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,759
build a hotel in Rayong for Peem's company too?

152
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,439
Or...

153
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,519
does he have his own construction company already?

154
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,079
Who said?

155
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,359
Seems like they're having issues with the lease

156
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,999
Is that so?

157
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,639
Okay.

158
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,279
If we're all done here

159
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,519
will you excuse me now?

160
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,119
Sure.

161
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,119
Thank you. Thank you

162
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,479
Bye.
-Bye.

163
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,559
What's the matter?

164
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,559
Plub had me come tell you she'll be working off site for a few days

165
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,119
Work off site?

166
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,319
What work?

167
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,039
Dad.

168
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,279
Hello.

169
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,599
CW GANIC STEAK Why are you guys dressed like that?

170
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,399
They want to come try working at the restaurant Dad.

171
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,399
Wait.

172
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,759
Didn't I tell you guys

173
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,119
I won't sell my shares for you to do some franchise.

174
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,959
Please hear them out

175
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,559
Uncle.

176
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,919
I know that you love this restaurant very much.

177
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,439
You probably won't trust anyone else to manage this restaurant.

178
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,839
But l want to prove to you

179
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,839
not only do I like the concept of this restaurant,

180
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,319
but I intend to devote myself to develop this restaurant.

181
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,359
Just like you.

182
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,919
Sometimes words aren't as important as actions.

183
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,279
I will show you the suitable company

184
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,679
that will continue your dream is my company

185
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,999
Why don't we invest together

186
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,399
and develop this restaurant together while you're still healthy?

187
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,039
To leave an inheritance for your children and grandchildren.

188
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,679
That's right.

189
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,919
Your son lives overseas and has a good job over there.

190
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,759
He probably won't have time to manage the restaurant.

191
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,399
In the future this restaurant will probably close down

192
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,879
Or you need to find someone to lease the restaurant or manage it instead.

193
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,599
I agree with them Dad.

194
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,359
The truth is

195
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,519
I want you to come live with me.

196
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,719
Alright.

197
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,999
Let's give it a try then.

198
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,839
Let's see which one of you suits more to invest with me.

199
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,119
Or...

200
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,159
none of you suit it.

201
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,159
You want me to train in the kitchen?

202
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,039
Isn't that too hard?

203
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,439
I can't even do it.

204
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,279
If you want to be the owner,

205
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,359
you need to start in the kitchen.

206
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,399
I used to help my grandmother in the kitchen often.

207
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,679
This is easy.

208
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,719
Kitchen at home and kitchen at a restaurant

209
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,039
can't be compared.

210
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,279
Someone who's never been in the kitchen shouldn't say anything.

211
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,479
Luckily when l was studying overseas,
I usually cook for myself.

212
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,879
So what do you want us to do Uncle?

213
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,879
Your jobs

214
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,039
are to help the cold kitchen

215
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,919
Your first task is to make salad.

216
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,759
Salad?

217
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,679
Yes.

218
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,719
Do you think l would let you do important tasks

219
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,439
and steal my recipe?

220
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,519
It's not that Uncle. I just think

221
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,599
salad is too easy.

222
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,799
We'll see if it's easy or not.

223
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,119
I'll have someone from the company

224
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,119
go help Plub

225
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,319
In that case, I'll go.

226
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,119
Sure.

227
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,399
Find someone you can trust

228
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,039
to look after Plubp la at the steak restaurant

229
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,759
Report to me periodically

230
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,479
Okay. Sure.

231
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,759
Yes.

232
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,599
Oh Tong.

233
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,919
You picked up Putter from school already?

234
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,919
He's missing his mom.

235
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,239
The teacher comforted him but he won't stop crying.

236
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,479
They were scared he might be sick so they called to come pick him up

237
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,959
I want to see Mom

238
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,519
What do we do?

239
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,399
Plub isn't here either.

240
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,199
She's not?

241
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,719
She's working off site

242
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,319
I want to see Mom

243
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,199
Okay.

244
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,839
What do we do?

245
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,919
First,you must wash these greens thoroughly

246
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,519
ORGANIC & STEAK I'm timing you.

247
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,599
What?

248
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,719
Start.

249
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,159
Our greens are organic.

250
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,039
So there is no need to worry about chemical residue.

251
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,039
What's important about washing them

252
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,719
is not only do you have to wash them properly

253
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,399
you must be careful not to bruise them.

254
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,078
It'll look fresh

255
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,919
and crunchy

256
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,959
Time's up.

257
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,679
Next is preparation.

258
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,039
You must cut the greens according to the example.

259
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,479
Carrots and onions

260
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,199
must be cut into strips like this.

261
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,239
Can you do it?

262
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,119
Yes.

263
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,359
Good.

264
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,839
I'll give you five minutes.

265
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,879
Five minutes?

266
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,359
Only?

267
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,759
Just arrange the salad.

268
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,479
You don't need to do the dressing.

269
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,639
Five minutes is considered long already

270
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,079
Don't forget customers are waiting for you.

271
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,799
Yes.

272
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,159
Slice the vegetables in five minutes.

273
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,199
Easy.

274
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,119
I told you when I was living in America,

275
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,679
I cooked my own food.

276
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,639
I didn't ask.

277
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,439
Just letting you know

278
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,399
Hey.

279
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,879
Are you okay?

280
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,999
Don't bother me!

281
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,559
Watch out!

282
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,279
Hey.

283
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,119
Are you okay?

284
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,919
Did you get burn?

285
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,639
No.

286
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,679
I'm fine.

287
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,199
Can you get water so I can wash my eyes?!

288
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,999
Come here.

289
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,759
- Don't bother me!l can do it!
-Stay still!

290
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,919
-Don't!
-This is why you got hurt because you're stubborn!

291
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,639
P But the closer I get to you &

292
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:57,479
P The more I know I've done wrong and made mistakes &

293
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,639
P Can you please forgive me

294
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,319
P How much I hated you

295
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,239
SI can love you even more &

296
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,279
PI'm sorry for all the mistakes &

297
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,079
PI want you to try to accept the love that comes from me

298
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,679
PI will give you everything

299
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,079
You sure you're okay?
PI will give you everything

300
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,479
PI will give you everything

301
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,279
P I lose to you in every way &

302
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,919

303
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,079
P I lose to you in every way &

304
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:34,879
P Can I make amends? Let me fix it by asking for your love &

305
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,159
Wait.

306
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,439
-What?
- Give me that.

307
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,959
What are you doing?

308
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,239
The sharpness of the knife and acidity of the lime

309
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,679
can help reduce the volatile substance in onions

310
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,999
Why are you trying to take this project from me?

311
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,199
I told you already

312
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,679
I will destroy you in every way

313
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,999
I will push my husband to beat you in everything

314
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,519
that he wants.

315
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,879
You must love Kit so much

316
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,399
I love him very much.

317
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,039
I love him even more

318
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,239
after our son was born.

319
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,239
I'll tell you something.

320
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,039
There's no way I'm losing to Kit again

321
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,599
I'll wait and see.

322
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,599
Come

323
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,919
There you go.

324
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,079
You!

325
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,119
Why are you here?

326
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,679
Don't tell me

327
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,479
your friend is also here?

328
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,279
Then.

329
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,799
your friend is also here

330
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,559
Decent.

331
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,079
You guys have cooking skills

332
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,399
Alright.

333
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,479
That's enough for today.

334
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,159
There's nothing else for us to do?

335
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,599
Yeah.

336
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,999
I can still do it.

337
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,599
The customers that made reservation is almost here

338
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,239
They need to use the kitchen.

339
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,599
You two wil I just get in their way.

340
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,359
Right.
Right.

341
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,919
Hey!

342
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,639
Orn.

343
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,559
Mom!

344
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,959
Putter!

345
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,119
Why are you here?

346
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,399
Hmm?

347
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,759
He's been crying.

348
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,879
He wanted to see his mom

349
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,439
Putter!

350
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,599
Uncle Peem!

351
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,439
Come here!

352
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,239
Son.

353
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,079
Don't bother him.

354
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,399
Why?

355
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,599
Yeah.

356
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,799
You act like I'm a disease

357
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,079
that your son can't come near.

358
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,799
You're worse than a disease

359
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,679
Plub.

360
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,199
Why is Peem here?

361
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,039
It's a long story

362
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,479
I'll tell you when we get back.

363
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,399
Why are you here?

364
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,559
Vik it was worried about you so he had me come see you.

365
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,639
Iim done so we should go home

366
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,399
Let's go.

367
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:17,959
Tat.

368
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,679
Let'sstay and eat here

369
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,319
May be I can talk to Uncle Saan some more.

370
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,439
Sure.

371
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,079
-Or n.
-Hmm?

372
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,519
It's time for Putter to have lunch.

373
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,679
We should eat here

374
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,719
You want that?

375
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,319
Yeah.

376
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,079
I'm sorry

377
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,879
All tables have been reserved except for one

378
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,559
I'll have to let you guys sit at the same table.

379
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,279
No problem.

380
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,359
But I'm just afraid someone might lose their appetite.

381
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,999
Don't flatter yourself

382
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,639
I have no problem

383
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,319
Just eating food cooked by Uncle is enough

384
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,719
Okay.

385
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,279
Wait a moment then.

386
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,279
Ill gradually bring the food out

387
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,679
Please sit.

388
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,479
Thank you.

389
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,519
Geez, you're willing to sit at the same table.

390
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,679
Scared you're gonna lose?

391
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,759
I just don't want someone who plays dirty tricks like you

392
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,879
to get the chance to talk to Uncle alone.

393
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,879
Who is playing dirty here?

394
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,279
I think it's your husband

395
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,119
Hey!

396
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,639
Don't talk about my husband!

397
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,239
Why?

398
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,479
" What's it to you?
-Why not?!

399
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,919
I think that's enough

400
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,319
Yes.

401
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,119
Putter is sitting here

402
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,719
I'm talking to you Plub

403
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,399
Don't argue with other people in front of your son.

404
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,919
Looks delicious!

405
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,399
My dad went in the kitchen and cooked the food himself for you guys.

406
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,759
Please tell him we said thank you.

407
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,039
I will definitely enjoy the food.

408
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,159
Will we get to see him again?

409
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,679
I want to thank him.

410
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,199
It's a pity.

411
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,079
He hardly comes see people when he works.

412
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,479
If you will excuse me now

413
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,639
Enjoy.

414
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,799
-Yes.
-Yes.

415
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,439
Putter,

416
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,559
Is it delicious?

417
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,959
Delicious.

418
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,479
Eat a lot son.

419
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,159
Putter.

420
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,759
Eat your carrots.

421
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,439
I don't like carrots.

422
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,959
No you have to.

423
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,199
Carrots will make you grow

424
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,319
But l don't like carrots

425
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,839
You can still grow

426
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,759
without having to eat carrots like me.

427
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,079
I don't like carrots either.

428
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,039
Here.

429
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,159
No to carrots!

430
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,599
Eat the shrimp

431
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,799
Exactly alike.

432
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,999
Hey.

433
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,639
Can you not teach my son to have bad habits like you?

434
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,799
You don't like carrots right?

435
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,319
I'll help you take them out.

436
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,079
Here.

437
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,159
Don't bother!

438
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,199
Your son doesn't like it so why are you forcing him?

439
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,679
Why not?

440
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,719
Wow Putter!

441
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,799
You're such an eater.

442
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,199
But l want to go play outside.

443
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,679
Finish your food first. There's a little bit left.

444
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,679
Putter!

445
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,639
Putter!
-Plub.

446
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,559
I'll watch him.

447
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,399
I'm full.

448
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,319
Putter Prepare to catch my ball

449
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,239
Take that!

450
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,119
You guys are having fun

451
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,319
I brought you snacks and drinks.

452
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,479
Thank you.

453
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,319
You're welcome.

454
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,199
Which way is the restroom?

455
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,199
Upstairs to your left.

456
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,879
In that case,

457
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,439
can you watch Putter?

458
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,279
Sure.

459
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,679
Putter.

460
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,479
Stay here with Uncle Singh

461
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,359
Okay.

462
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,959
What are you playing?

463
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,599
Balls everywhere!

464
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,039
Putter.

465
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,159
What are you doing?

466
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,959
Hmm?

467
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,039
What are you doing?

468
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,159
Playing sand?

469
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,079
Yes.

470
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,759
Putter.

471
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,359
Which one is the red ball?

472
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,399
Putter!

473
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,679
- Thank you Mr, Singh.
-You're welcome.

474
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,079
Bye.

475
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,399
Let's go.

476
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,999
Here's your change

477
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,399
- The food was delicious.
Thank you.

478
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,319
But the vibe here is bad

479
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,559
Due to people at the table.

480
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,039
ill come back another time

481
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,359
Yes. Thank you.

482
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,399
Wait.

483
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,919
What do you want?

484
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,359
I want to talk to you.

485
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,399
About four years ago.

486
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,919
Stop.

487
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,679
If you're here to make excuses for your friend, just stop!

488
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,839
I'm tired of listening to it.

489
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,839
But it really was a misunderstanding.

490
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,039
Think about it.

491
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,439
Who would leak a clip that has themselves in it like that?

492
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,999
So?

493
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,999
Your friend i might not be the one that leaked it

494
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,959
but was the one that recorded it for keepsakes!

495
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,359
Huh?

496
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,199
Why would you think that?

497
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,199
Why can't I?

498
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,839
J once encountered.a case where my client was secretly filmed by her boyfriend during sex.

499
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,039
He sent it to his other friends and it got shared around

500
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,639
A bad man like your friend only sees women as toys.

501
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,799
They enjoy stepping on women's dignity and love.

502
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,799
Such a feminist.

503
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,879
People like that deserve to be punished by the law.

504
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,759
If the law can't do anything,

505
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,439
it's women like us

506
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,199
that will handle you men!

507
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,199
Remember that!

508
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,679
Dramatic exit

509
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,959
I think Putter is my son

510
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,679
Huh?

511
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,759
Peem.

512
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,639
I understand you're really sad about Plubpl a.

513
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,199
But imagining someone else's son as your own,

514
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,799
you're delusional

515
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,159
You idiot!

516
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,559
I'm not delusional!

517
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,959
I'm being serious.

518
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,799
Think about it.

519
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,519
Between me and Kit,

520
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,759
who does Putter look more like?

521
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,479
Like...

522
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,159
you.

523
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,839
There you go.

524
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,119
I've been thinking about it.

525
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,279
Putter is around..

526
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,079
three years old.

527
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,639
Plubpl a went missing for four years.

528
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,199
If you exclude the time of her pregnancy.

529
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,399
Plubp la would have been pregnant with me.

530
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,079
Hold on.

531
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,959
You can't claim him as your son just because he looks like you.

532
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,959
Think about it

533
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,599
What if she got with Kit right after she left you?

534
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,639
It's possible that the kid is Kit's.

535
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,959
I'm certain that Putter is my son.

536
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,759
I need to find out the truth.

537
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,119
And how will you do that?

538
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,079
Plubp la is very protective of her son.

539
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,839
As if you can approach Putter that easily

540
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,199
There has to be away

541
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,319
If he knows,

542
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,519
what am I going to do?

543
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,678
Hello.

544
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,079
Say hi to the teacher Putter.

545
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,079
Hello.

546
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,279
Be good in school today

547
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,638
Have fun playing with your friends and l'll be back later to pick you up

548
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,559
Please watch him

549
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,559
Don't worry.

550
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,559
Say bye to your mother Putter.

551
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,439
Bye bye!

552
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,879
Hello.

553
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,039
Sure. Hello.

554
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,559
Hello.

555
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,639
Calm down Kit

556
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,679
Plub will never fall for Peem's tricks again

557
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,719
I need to trust her.

558
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,559
Come in.

559
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,079
You have a guest.

560
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,839
Who?

561
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,919
Me.

562
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,479
Pete.

563
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,639

Putter didn't come with you?

591
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,119
Why are you asking about my son?

592
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,039
Why do you have to make that face? I just adore him.

593
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,119
I can't do that?

594
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,559
My son doesn't need your adoration.

595
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,919
Don't mess with my son

596
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,679
Or else don't say that I didn't warn you.

597
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,079
How scary.

598
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,559
You've been warned.

599
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,159
