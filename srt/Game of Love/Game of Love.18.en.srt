1
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,999
Oh, hey, Dad!

2
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,759
Hello Mr. Komsan.

3
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,479
You went to check out the land, Mr. Peem?

4
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,239
Not just the land.

5
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,039
I took a trip with my giri friend as well.

6
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,279
It's new.

7
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,119
We agreed to officially date each other.

8
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,959
So we wanted to spend time together where there's just us

9
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,799
Do you want to know who my girlfriend is?

10
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,719
Should I tell you?

11
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,639
I'm afraid someone here might go into shock and die

12
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,719
I pity the old man.

13
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,439
Sir.

14
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,959
You're not going to talk to Mr. Peem?

15
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,159
I have nothing to say.
-

16
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,719
It's pointless talking to him.

17
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,799
The person I should warn is Plubpl a

18
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,399
Hey Plub.

19
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:49,919
Hmm?

20
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,039
Ever since you got back from the beach,

21
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,599
I feel you are much happier

22
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,759
Really?

23
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,479
Hmm?

24
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,159
Did something happen?

25
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,159
You can tell me.

26
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,759
In your opinion,

27
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,839
if I...

28
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,679
decide to date Mr Peem,

29
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,119
what will you say about it?

30
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,599
Well,

31
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,799
I won't say anything

32
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,039
If you love him and he loves you.

33
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,999
Although he seems like a kid with issues,

34
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,879
but deep down I think he'sa good person.

35
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,999
He will take very good care of you.

36
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,319
You don't think

37
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,599
our statuses are too different from each other?

38
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,239
Yeah, if we look at it from the outside.

39
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,559
Our'status is very different from his.

40
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,879
It's right of you to be concern

41
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,559
But Plub,

42
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,839
do you know that love

43
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,119
needs the heart before reasons?

44
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,359
My Plub issmart and has a very beautiful heart.

45
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,359
Your goodness

46
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,079
will make other people know that

47
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,199
you love Mr. Peem for him and not for his status.

48
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,359
More importantly, it's not about other people's opinions.

49
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,919
It's yours and the person you love.
That's what is important.

50
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,119
You can't stop what others are thinking

51
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,599
Understood?

52
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,799
Now do you feel much better?

53
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,039
I feel much better.

54
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,879
I thought you said you would call.

55
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,799
Hello Peem.

56
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,119
I thought you said you would call.

57
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,399
Do you know that I haven't seen you for two hours and I'm already missing you so much?

58
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,879
I just got done talking to Grandma

59
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,479
Did you tell her about us?

60
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,679
Why do I have to tell her?

61
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,599
Well...

62
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,559
I want to tell everyone actually

63
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,959
Look.

64
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,039
Don't say anything. I'm not ready

65
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,559
In that case,

66
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,839
can I tell my dad?

67
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,399
So he can stop bothering you

68
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,639
Okay?

69
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,519
Peem.

70
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,679
I think...

71
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,839
he doesn't like me for me

72
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,519
What do you mean?

73
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,839
He told me

74
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,399
I look like your mother.

75
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,879
So I think he's interested in me

76
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,319
might be because he misses her.

77
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,959
Man ee.

78
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,999
If it weren't for you leaving me.

79
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,199
I wouldn't have tried to find someone to replace you

80
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,639
Our son Peem wouldn't have to do this either.

81
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,279
I will fix this so that he doesn't make any more mistakes

82
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,039
My dad told Plub that she looks like my mom

83
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,839
Huh?

84
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,599
She believes that Dad might just miss Mom.

85
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,999
What do you think?

86
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,759
Gosh Tat.

87
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,959
It's my dad's way of hitting on women.
Only crazy people would believe it.

88
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,319
If my dad really misses my mom,

89
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,399
why won't he stop messing with these women and go bring my mom back?

90
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,479
I think sometimes your dad is just like you.

91
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,359
People who like to do the opposite of their own feelings.

92
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,959
What?

93
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,559
Why is this about me now?

94
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,839
Peem.

95
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,439
Plubpla this, Plubpla that.

96
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,479
Ever since you got back from the beach,you talked about her nonstop

97
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,159
Now do you admit that you like her?

98
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,599
You're here too Peem?

99
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,039
I want to see your face when'the judge reads the verdict.

100
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,879
Really?

101
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,519
But I want to see your face when you hear about another news

102
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,239
What news?

103
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,799
It won't be fun if I tell you now

104
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,119
For get him.

105
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,839
Kit is just threatening you

106
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,079
Let's go.

107
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,679
Don't forget to turn off your phone

108
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,199
Who is texting me what right now?

109
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,559
Did you see this yet?

110
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,239
ENGAGED!

111
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,479
It's Ms. Usa and Mr. Peem!

112
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,759
Hey.

113
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,199
Didn't he take a trip with Plub over the weekend?

114
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,879
Now there's news of him getting engaged to Ms. Usa?

115
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,199
How would I know?!

116
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,879
I'm seeing this just now like you!

117
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,639
Is this true?

118
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,039
Hey.

119
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,559
Ms. Usa is coming.

120
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,999
Ms. Usa.

121
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,839
I just saw the news.

122
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,879
Congratulations on your engagement.

123
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,519
Yes. Congratulations!
-Look at you.

124
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,959
The aura bride is shining right through you.

125
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,919
You're already glowing Ms. Usa!

126
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,199
Gosh!

127
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,959
It's already out there?

128
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,679
I actually wanted to have a private ceremony.

129
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,479
You want me to leak your engagement news?

130
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,079
Please help me.

131
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,919
Did Peem agree on this engagement?

132
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,719
It doesn't matter.

133
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,719
The elders from both sides agreed on it already

134
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,279
Sa.

135
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,679
Someone like Peem isn't going to let anyone force him to do things.

136
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,879
If he says no,

137
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,639
won't it look bad for you?

138
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,279
I don't care.

139
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,439
As long as I can stop Peem.

140
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,479
Aren't you worried about Plub too?

141
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,279
You see?lt's okay on both sides.

142
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,319
You like Peem?

143
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,439
Yes.

144
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,999
I don't want to lose him

145
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,719
You have to help me.

146
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,559
Please?

147
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,959
Congratulations.

148
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,519
This is such big news!

149
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,879
Right girls?

150
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,839
Yes!

151
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,079
You guys are a perfect match!

152
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,479
Look at this.

153
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,839
Such wonderful news of this morning

154
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,959
Plub.

155
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,639
Hello.

156
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,559
Are you not going to congratulate Ms. Usa?

157
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,359
For what?

158
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,799
Gosh Plub!

159
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,159
You're not uptodate.

160
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,999
You're so bad!

161
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,799
Why don't you know about your boss's news?

162
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,799
My boss?

163
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,639
Yes.

164
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,079
I'm annoyed now.

165
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,079
Where have you been?

166
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,759
Mr. Peeman d Ms. Usa

167
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,999
are about to get engaged!

168
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,719
Look at you!

169
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,399
So beautiful.

170
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,519
Engaged?

171
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,239
The elders have been talking for a while now.

172
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,399
Peem said yes as well.

173
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,399
We grew up together

174
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,119
We've known each other for a long time.

175
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,199
So the elders thought it was time.

176
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,079
When we have the date,

177
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,639
I would like to invite all of you.

178
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,599
It is our honor Ms. Usa!

179
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,519
Thank you so much.

180
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,839
Beautiful and kind

181
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,399
Plub.

182
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,479
You have to go to our engagement.

183
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,159
Yes.

184
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,159
Oh!

185
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,999
Your hand is so cold.

186
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,279
Why do you look pale?

187
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,639
Is something wrong?

188
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,319
Are you sick?

189
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,359
I'm fine.

190
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,399
I feel dizzy. If you'll excuse me.

191
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,399
Take some medicine!

192
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,079
Is she okay?

193
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,679
You have to go to our engagement.

194
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,599
There is no response from the number you called.

195
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,719
Please call back again.

196
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,079
It's so hot outside.

197
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,759
Hey.

198
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,039
Plub went so far as to seduce Mr Peemat the beach

199
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,319
She even leaked her own photos online.

200
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,639
She probably tried to up her life

201
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,279
from dirt to star.

202
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,919
But it turns out,

203
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,999
the man doesn't want her!

204
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,079
It's obvious.

205
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,359
He has a diamond like Ms. Usa already.

206
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,079
Why would he even pick out gravel from the ground?

207
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,279
Yeah.

208
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,879
Mr. Peem isn't crazy.

209
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,999
If it were me, Iwould have covered my face with a veil already.

210
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,319
How pitiful of her though

211
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,119
But you know what they say..

212
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,239
Ms. Plub pla.

213
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,599
Are you free?

214
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,199
The chairman has called for you.

215
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,159
Yes.

216
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,279
Please.

217
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,919
Why did you call me over sir?

218
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,159
I called you here to apologize to you

219
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,879
Apologize to me?

220
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,199
For what?

221
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,399
It was Peem's doing

222
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,839
He only did this to defeat me

223
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,039
He probably intentionally leaked them

224
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,079
so I would find out about it

225
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,399
If he did this,

226
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,519
he went over board.

227
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,479
I'm sorry Plubpl a

228
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,399
It's all because of me.

229
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,599
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

230
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,919
The defendant's actions are guilty of fraudulent sales

231
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,319
I order the defendant to pay damages to the plaintiff

232
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,359
in the amount of ten million baht

233
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,919
with legal interest from the date of filing.

234
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,079
You look happy

235
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,479
to be paying the fine to my company

236
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,719
It's just ten million.

237
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,799
Take it as my engagement gift for you.

238
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,399
What engagement?

239
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,879
Hey.

240
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,119
You don't have to hide it anymore.

241
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,719
The whole country knows now

242
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,319
that you're getting engaged to Sa.

243
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,599
Congratulations

244
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,079
Peem.

245
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,999
It's on the news.

246
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,759
Peem

247
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,399
Oh no!

248
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,799
Kit!

249
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,719
Peem!

250
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,719
The news of my engagement was your doing, wasn't it?!

251
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,319
heard about it

252
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,199
so I wanted other people to congratulate you on it.

253
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,359
What do you want?!

254
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,559
Calm down Peem!

255
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,599
We're at the courthouse!

256
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,639
Why are you doing this?! What do you want?! Be honest with me!

257
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,079
I want you to stop bothering a good woman like Plub!

258
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,079
I know you tried to win her over

259
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,239
because you know I'm interested in her!

260
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,439
You'want to defeat me!

261
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,159
Don't flatter yourself!

262
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,159
You were never in my sight!

263
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,759
So you're telling me you really like Plub?

264
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,039
Or...

265
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,239
you forgot your own words?

266
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,199
I won't be a man like Dad

267
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,839
I will not get involved with that kind of woman.

268
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,159
In truth,

269
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,359
you really got your father's blood.

270
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,079
In the end,

271
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,559
the mighty Mr. Peem

272
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,639
is just like his father.

273
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,399
Kit!

274
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,999
Hey! That's enough!

275
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,319
Peem! Kit!

276
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,999
That's enough!

277
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,959
This is the courthouse!

278
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,679
Have respect for it!

279
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,159
If you won't stop, I'm having you both arrested!

280
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,159
Stop bothering Plub!

281
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,599
I know you don't really like her.

282
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,839
It's you.

283
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,759
You have no right to get involved in my business!

284
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,839
Remember that!

285
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,599
Peem.

286
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,439
Why didn't you tell Kit how you feel about Plub?

287
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,359
I don't know.

288
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,679
I couldn't say it at first

289
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,639
That's why I'm mad at myself.

290
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,999
Why didn't I just say that I like Plubpl a?

291
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,399
Hey wait up.

292
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,479
So you're finally admitting it?

293
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,199
Huh?

294
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,159
Yeah.

295
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,719
I like Plubpl a.

296
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,919
I love Plubpl a!

297
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,319
Why are you here blaming yourself?

298
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,559
Plub probably knows about the engagement now

299
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,559
Go explain it to her.

300
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,839
You're right.

301
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,719
Peem! Wait up!

302
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,119
Kwang.

303
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,479
Where's Plubp la?

304
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,359
She took a sick leave.

305
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,999
Do you need something?

306
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,639
No.

307
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,759
The number you called can not be reached.

308
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,879
Please call back again.

309
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,839
I can't get a hold of her

310
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,399
I llgo see her at her house

311
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,399
I ill leave you to handle things here

312
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,039
Sure.

313
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,959
Don't worry.

314
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,119
Mr. Peem

315
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,319
asked me to help because he wanted to be alone with you.

316
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,599
So I helped him.

317
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,799
Plub went so far as to seduce Mr Peemat the beach.

318
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,519
She even leaked her own photos online

319
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,519
She probably tried to up her life

320
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,999
from dirt to star

321
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,719
But it turns out,

322
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,719
the man doesn't want her!

323
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,519
He has a diamond like Ms. Usa already.

324
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,399
Why would he even pick out gravel from the ground?

325
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,839
Plub.

326
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,359
Why are you back so soon?

327
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,959
feel kind of sick.

328
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,399
Sol took the day off

329
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,079
Going to work?

330
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,959
Yeah.

331
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,719
So,

332
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,359
how are you? Do you want me to take you to see a doctor?

333
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,759
It's fine.

334
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,319
I'll feel better after I sleep.

335
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,839
D
Peem.

336
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,239
Plubpl a

337
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,039
You should get to work.

338
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,839
Yeah.

339
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,919
Let's go talk.

340
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,919
You probably heard

341
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,559
about my engagement to Sa.

342
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,359
But rest assured.

343
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,599
I talked with my dad

344
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,159
I won't get engage to her.

345
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,639
Are you mad at me?

346
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,559
Yes.

347
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,479
But not about that.

348
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,439
Then...

349
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,599
what are you mad at?

350
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,759
You did this, didn't you?

351
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,719
Plub.

352
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,039
It's...

353
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,679
I just want...

354
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,199
my dad to stop bothering you

355
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,599
So the chairman was right.

356
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,719
You just want to defeat him.

357
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,279
You never cared about anyone else.

358
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,759
Have you ever thought

359
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,759
that what you'redoing

360
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,319
is damaging for me?

361
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,479
Plubpl a.

362
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,879
I'm sorry.

363
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,239
I don't know right now

364
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,039
I'm not sure how you feel about me

365
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,719
Plubpl a.

366
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,679
I...

367
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,479
Can l have some time to think?

368
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,119
Give me time to think about whether I can still trust you or not.

369
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,439
It looks like these two

370
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,439
are arguing, sir.

371
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,959
That's good!

372
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,599
Keep an eye on them.

373
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,239
If this woman doesn't stop,

374
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,159
handle her again

375
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,439
Yes, sir.

376
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,159
Honey!

377
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,559
You can leave

378
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,559
Okay.

379
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,079
Did you see the news?

380
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,559
What news?

381
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,999
Peem'sengagement to our daughter.

382
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,559
Peem just had photos of him on the beach with another woman.

383
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,439
So what's going on?

384
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,239
Who leaked the news?

385
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,999
Yeah.

386
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,959
Who leaked the news?

387
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,919
Peem must be going crazy

388
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,279
after seeing this news.

389
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,199
How satisfying!

390
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,919
I got back at him!

391
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,679
Sa :

392
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,079
I'm sorry.

393
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,839
It's fine.

394
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,439
Anyway,

395
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,959
I have to accept the truth.

396
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,439
I'm worried about you.

397
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,999
I'm not sure now

398
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,759
if this will be good for you or not.

399
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,399
I've thought it through

400
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,919
I know what Dad is like.

401
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,759
If Dad knows about the news,

402
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,279
I believe

403
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,719
he will do everything in his power

404
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,879
to make us get engaged for real.

405
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,199
Dad will not let me get humiliated.

406
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,839
Just wait and see.

407
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,759
Tat.

408
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,959
You're here?

409
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,079
What Plubpl a said was true.

410
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,039
I was so busy trying to defeat Dad

411
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,719
that I forgot to think

412
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,559
what I'm doing is hurting her or not.

413
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,759
I'm so awful.

414
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,439
It's okay.

415
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,439
People make mistakes.

416
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,239
I didn't imagine it either.

417
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,519
But I don't think it was a mistake

418
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,879
Peem did it intentionally.

419
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,399
What if..

420
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,279
he did it to protect me?

421
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,839
Nonsense!

422
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,119
Why would that guy protect you?

423
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,399
Don't tell me

424
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,799
you think he really likes you?

425
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,719
Right now I...

426
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,559
am not sure.

427
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,079
Wait.

428
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,359
You mean you used to believe him?

429
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,999
At...

430
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,239
the beach,

431
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,599
he told me he loved me

432
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,279
He's lying.

433
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,839
He got into an argument with Mr. Vik it today

434
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,079
He didn't even say one word that he likes you

435
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,799
They argued?

436
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,679
Yeah.

437
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,279
The one that leaked the news was probably Mr Vi kit

438
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,079
I think he likes you too.

439
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,839
When Peem found out, he got really upset.

440
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,319
They almost got into a fight at the courthouse

441
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,799
So Mr. Vi kit asked Peem

442
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,919
if he likes you or not

443
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,399
But you know

444
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,719
that Peem guy

445
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,439
refused to say anything?

446
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,159
Hey.

447
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,759
Plub.

448
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,919
Don't believe what Peem says to you

449
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,319
He might be saying it just to get in bed with you.

450
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,479
You need to be careful!

451
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,879
Keep your distance from him.

452
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,079
What should I do

453
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,279
to have Plubpl a forgive me?

454
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,479
Right now, there's photos that you leaked

455
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,799
and

456
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,439
your engagement news with Sa.

457
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,199
I think P lub is confused that you might deceive her again

458
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,879
But Tat..

459
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,359
I'm serious about Plubpl a

460
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,759
Yeah.

461
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,479
Right now I..

462
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,359
am really in love with her.

463
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,599
I know.

464
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,638
Therefore,

465
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,678
you need to show your sincerity to her.

466
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,319
Show her you're not deceiving her.

467
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,119
You found out about Mr. Peem's engagement?

468
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,399
From now on,

469
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,239
don't try to set up Plub with Mr. Peem anymore

470
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,599
He has a fiancee.

471
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,719
Pity your sister.

472
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,479
I'm not going to let it end like this.

473
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,039
Regardless,

474
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,879
Mr. Peem must take responsibility of my sister.

475
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,799
You think

476
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,919
I'm...

477
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,399
pretending to court you for fun?

478
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,439
Yeah.

479
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,039
You

480
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,239
just wanted to pursue me to defeat your father,that's all

481
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,919
At first, I did.

482
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,439
But right now

483
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,039
I feel

484
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,279
l actually like you.

485
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,759
He only did this to defeat me

486
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,879
Should I keep trusting you, Peem?

487
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,399
I did not leak the news, sir.

488
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,199
I don't know how it got out!

489
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,719
It's okay Mr, Puchong

490
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,999
The kids has to get engaged anyway

491
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,399
It's good that the news got out

492
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,519
We should start finding a date for the engagement.

493
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,959
I'm not so sure now that Peem will allow this.

494
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,319
Wait.

495
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,399
What do you mean?

496
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,279
Here's the thing sir.

497
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,239
I talked about this matter with Peem already.

498
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,239
He told me he will not get engaged to Usa because he only sees her as a sister.

499
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,759
I don't care

500
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,359
whether Peem wants to get engaged or not.

501
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,639
But the news is out there now.

502
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,399
It'll look bad for me.

503
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,719
Peem has to get engaged to me.

504
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,399
Dad.

505
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,759
That's right.

506
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,999
I don't care what method you use.

507
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,439
You have to make Peem get engaged to my daughter.

508
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,719
Otherwise,

509
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,359
we will become enemies.

510
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,199
Welcome.

511
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,919
The house is more fancy than Su the e's house.

512
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,159
Please have a seat at the sofa

513
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,599
Yeah.

514
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,679
She's here to meet the chairman.

515
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,599
Who are you?

516
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,559
My name i s Trepradu b

517
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,559
I'm Plubp la's older sister

518
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,119
Plubpl a's sister?

519
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,799
Yes.

520
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,799
I came here because

521
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,319
I have something important to discuss with Mr. Puchong.

522
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,879
He's not here.

523
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,919
You can talk to me about your business.

524
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,959
. I'm his wife.

525
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,159
Plubpl a.

526
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,079
I came to pick you up to go to work together

527
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,119
It's not suitable.

528
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,799
The boss can't come pick up his subordinate to work.

529
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,199
Plubpl a.

530
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,359
Let's go to work together.

531
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,879
Peem.

532
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,159
You don't think before you act like usual.
