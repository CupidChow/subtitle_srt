1
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,839
Easy for you to say

2
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,519
You guys got more than us.

3
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,599
That's enough Mom

4
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,959
If you're not satisfied

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,159
you can sue

6
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,119
I apologize on Mom's behalf

7
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,399
Mom!

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,999
Damn it!

9
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,999
How can it be like this?!

10
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,319
Damn you Puchong!

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,599
You never acknowledge me!

12
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,959
Even when you're dead!

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,199
Mom.

14
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,759
I want to talk to you.

15
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,959
Mom.

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,839
Come out and talk to me.

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,839
I won't let Peem take what is ours!

18
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,799
I will protect everything that is yours, Pete!

19
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,759
Don't worry Peem

20
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,479
The officers have been taking turns looking after me

21
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,919
Moreover,

22
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,959
me and the workers from the orchard

23
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,159
are taking turns looking after your mother as well!

24
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,919
We're not leaving her out of our sight

25
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,079
Thank you so much Mr. Dec h

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,039
I feel at ease that Mom is with you

27
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,159
Peem.

28
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,279
You need to be careful too.

29
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,279
Peem.

30
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,439
Yes?

31
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,559
Be careful of Sup ang

32
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,639
I know this woman well

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,759
She's greedy.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,199
She doesn't know when to stop

35
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,519
She will do anything

36
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,879
to get what she wants

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,919
With your father's will opened today,

38
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,679
it might have disappointed her.

39
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,519
I know Mom

40
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,039
Bye.

41
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,559
Let's go.

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,319
After you.

43
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,959
Hi V i kit.

44
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,959
Can we talk?

45
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,959
Plub.

46
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,159
About the other day

47
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,439
I know I was wrong.

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,639
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,919
I thought

50
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,879
if l have done that

51
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,959
I wouldn't lose you and our son.

52
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,519
I was stupid.

53
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,559
Please forgive me.

54
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,398
You and our son

55
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,078
are the only family I have left

56
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,079
I can't live without you guys

57
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,919
Please forgive me.

58
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,639
Yes.

59
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,319
I forgive you.

60
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,679
But I'm only for giving you

61
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,119
because I was also wrong

62
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,119
for making you this way.

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,879
I dragged you into this game

64
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,359
Just for revenge

65
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,279
and to get back at Peem

66
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,759
If l hadn't started it,

67
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,999
no one would get hurt like this

68
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,679
I'm sorry too.

69
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,359
Plub.

70
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,679
Don't waste any more of your time with me.

71
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,239
You should be with someone you love

72
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,599
and get to finally live your life

73
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,519
Let's get a divorce

74
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,079
Oh hey Su thee.

75
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,279
Why are you home late today?

76
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,839
Mr Ohm has been waiting to see you

77
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,759
Why are you here?

78
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,799
He came to visit

79
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,079
I just got back from visiting my hometown.

80
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,599
So I came to drop off gifts

81
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,839
Mr, Ohm resigned.

82
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,879
Why didn't you tell me?

83
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,999
I did.

84
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,639
I must have forgotten then.

85
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,719
My apologies.

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,399
How's your new secretary?

87
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,519
Are they good?

88
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,839
I can train them if you want.

89
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,239
I have the time now.

90
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,799
That's okay.

91
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,639
I'm also confident

92
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,639
that nobody knows you better than me.

93
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,719
Perhaps

94
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,719
I know you better than Mr s. Trepradu b.

95
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,039
I'm talking about work.

96
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,279
Ohm.

97
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,319
I need to talk to you about work

98
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,639
Can we step out?

99
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,199
Tre.

100
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,959
You don't have to wait upon me for dinner.

101
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,639
You go ahead.

102
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,919
Okay.

103
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,239
Excuse me now.

104
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,519
The dessert was delicious.

105
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,519
Sure.

106
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,519
What are you trying to do?

107
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,559
I told you not to go to my house again!

108
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,559
But if I don't go there

109
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,239
will l get to see you?

110
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,119
I miss you.

111
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,679
Ohm.

112
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,439
We broke up

113
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,559
You broke up with me.

114
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,839
I didn't agree to it.

115
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,879
Hey.

116
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,199
We don't have to really break up.

117
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,759
I promise

118
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,039
I will stay quiet in my place

119
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,639
Ohm.

120
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,679
Don't do this

121
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,359
I can't live without you.

122
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,559
Ohm!

123
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,799
Don't do this!

124
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,439
I can't choose you regardless.

125
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,519
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,839
In that case,

127
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,799
want us to spend one last time together

128
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,399
Just one week is fine

129
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,799
Please?

130
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,519
I promise you

131
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,079
I will end it.

132
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,919
I won't bother you

133
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,999
and your family anymore

134
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,159
Let's endon a good note

135
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,239
May be you're over thinking this

136
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,839
I don't mean that Putter's feelings aren't important

137
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,159
But sometimes kids understand things easier than adults.

138
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,799
What should I do Putter?

139
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,999
Here.

140
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,239
Uncle Peem!

141
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,279
Putter.

142
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,919
Do you miss me?

143
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,999
The most in the world!

144
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,679
I miss you the most in the world too!

145
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,359
Can I charge my energy from you?!

146
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,239
Are you feeling uneasy about something?

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,639
Yes.

148
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,279
Just like you told me

149
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,679
If we're too focused on Aunt Ump on being the suspect when it can be someone else,

150
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,959
it might be a mistake.

151
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,479
I've been thinking about it

152
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,199
Au nt Su

153
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,679
might want Mom dead too.

154
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,839
So you suspect that

155
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,159
Mrs. Sup ang might have hired Was u?

156
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,319
Yes.

157
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,239
Other than Aunt Umponand Mr. Thawip,

158
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,199
Aunt Su is the other person I suspect.

159
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,519
But we don't have evidence to connect it to Au nt Su.

160
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,039
Why don't you try

161
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,799
investigating from Was u's death?

162
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,719
Mrs. Sup ang is really involved,

163
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,519
the one who killed Was u might have been her people

164
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,519
Or herself.

165
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,439
You're right.

166
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,479
I figured it out.

167
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,839
What?

168
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,039
You suspect that your stepmother Mrs. Sup ang

169
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,999
was the one that hired Was u?

170
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,439
Yes.

171
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,639
Why would she kill the chairman?

172
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,639
It's obvious that

173
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,799
if your father dies,you will have more power in the company

174
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,999
What if it was a mistake?

175
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,679
Yes.

176
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,959
Don't forget.

177
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,879
The person Was u was trying to shoot at was my mom.

178
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,719
Yeah.

179
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,079
You're right.

180
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,199
Most importantly,

181
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,199
at Dad's funeral.

182
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,599
Pete.

183
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,039
Where did Aunt Su go?

184
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,719
Mom said

185
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,879
her friend got lost finding the place

186
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,639
She probably went to go pick them up.

187
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,399
Is that so?

188
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,399
The night Was u was killed

189
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,519
saw her acting suspicious and left the temple alone

190
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,239
You suspect that

191
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,799
Mrs. Su

192
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,599
killed Was u before the police got to him?

193
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,959
It's possible.

194
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,359
She was n't at the funeral service that night.

195
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,239
Yes.

196
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,679
What Peem said is a possibility Yot.

197
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,719
Mr. Peem's house is close to Mr. Thaw ip's house

198
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,359
The two families are pretty tight.

199
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,799
Ever since the past.

200
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,799
Therefore,

201
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,679
it's possible that Mrs. Sup ang and Was uk new each other.

202
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,759
From Was u's profile,

203
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,519
he likes to gamble.

204
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,159
He was in debt.

205
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,119
It's possible that

206
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,599
Mrs. Sup ang knew about this

207
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,719
and hired him to work for her.

208
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,439
She is very suspicious at the moment

209
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,359
lill check the surveillance cameras of that night to see which route she took

210
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,039
Please do.

211
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,679
No problem.

212
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,439
It looks like

213
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,599
we are getting close to the perpetrator.

214
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,599
You never loved me

215
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,079
It's actually good

216
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,919
I won't have to feel guilty

217
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,479
for causing your death

218
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,039
Just wait a little.

219
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,759
Soon,

220
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,159
I will send your beloved wife

221
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,519
and your beloved son

222
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,199
to go be with you

223
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,879
Get over her.

224
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,919
Don't force it.

225
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,999
What are you referring to?

226
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,559
Plubpl a.

227
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,279
That woman

228
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,079
doesn't love you.

229
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,399
I will make her change her mind

230
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,799
I will not lose to Peem over this matter

231
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,799
You're wrong.

232
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,199
Love

233
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,639
is the one thing you can never win!

234
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,479
No!

235
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,279
I will be at Peem!

236
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,559
I have to beat him in everything, no?

237
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,959
You told me that!

238
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,799
The reason I'm like this

239
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,559
is because of you

240
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,639
And now

241
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,479
you're telling me to give up?

242
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,639
Never!

243
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,079
I will not lose my family

244
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,479
I will never.

245
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,799
It's my fault

246
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,319
It's because of me

247
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,999
that made you this way!

248
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,679
You asked Kit for a divorce?!

249
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,399
Yeah.

250
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,399
I want him

251
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,399
to meet someone that will love him

252
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,159
and have an actual family

253
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,239
What about you and Peem?

254
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,519
What's next?

255
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,119
Are you insane?

256
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,479
I'm not divorcing Kit to go back to Peem.

257
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,479
Peem and Usa are...

258
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,719
married.

259
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,159
He doesn't love her.

260
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,919
He married her

261
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,919
because of you

262
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,759
What do you mean?

263
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,679
Well,

264
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,279
Tat told me when you were gone,

265
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,559
Peem looked everywhere for you but he couldn't find you.

266
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,519
Then suddenly.

267
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,079
Mr. Thaw ip threatened Peem with your photos.

268
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,359
If he refuses to get engaged to Usa,

269
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,799
he was going to kill you.

270
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,279
What?!

271
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,359
I think

272
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,039
Peem loves you very much

273
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,039
Now that you know this

274
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,519
I think you should give him a chance

275
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,559
and yourself a chance.

276
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,479
I can't do that.

277
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,159
Peem and Usa are husband and wife now

278
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,279
I don't even have the right to think that.

279
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,599
Did you get it?

280
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,879
Give it to me!

281
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,359
Don't tell anyone about this

282
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:02,999
Okay.

283
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,599
Mr. Pete.

284
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,439
What did you give to Sa?

285
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,479
I can't tell you

286
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,839
Mrs. Usa told me not to.

287
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,199
If you won't tell me, ill tell Mom to fire you.

288
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,839
It can't be.

289
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,879
Please don't tell Mrs. Usa that I told you.

290
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,039
I noticed that she's been feeling nauseous and throwing up for days now.

291
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,999
I think you're going to have a niece or nephew.

292
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,799
You can go now.

293
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,399
Hello.

294
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,759
Drunk?!

295
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,799
Okay, okay

296
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,359
You think I'm just going to give up on you?

297
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,039
Go sh Suthee!

298
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,239
You're drunk but making things difficult for me.

299
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,839
Got it.

300
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,759
It's this room.

301
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,999
Su thee!

302
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,359
Tre!

303
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,239
Su thee!

304
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,759
To ng, Plub.

305
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,919
How is Tre?

306
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,879
The doctor said Tre had a sudden cerebral hemorrhage.

307
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,319
She's having surgery at the moment.

308
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,799
What happened? Why did this happen to her?

309
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,839
Well...

310
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,959
If I were to guess,

311
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,839
Tre knows doesn't she?

312
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,079
About you and that secretary.

313
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,439
What's going on?

314
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,159
I can't let Peem know that lim pregnant

315
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,759
What do I do?

316
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,519
Peem.

317
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,639
The maid said you were back so I came to check on you

318
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,239
Well,

319
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,359
I'm still your wife

320
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,879
Why can't I come back to my husband's house?

321
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,999
Sa.

322
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,879
I need to talk to you

323
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,599
Come talk with me

324
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,399
Peem.

325
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,359
What do you want to talk about?

326
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,759
I want to talk to you about our divorce

327
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,279
Divorce?

328
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,999
What divorce?

329
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,159
If it's about my parents

330
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,559
they already told you they know nothing.

331
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,919
My mom isn't guilty!

332
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,319
Let's leave that to the police

333
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,879
But our situation has nothing to do with them

334
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,479
You already know

335
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,519
I don't love you and I will never be able to love you

336
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,479
I don't care

337
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,239
if you love me or not.

338
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,919
But I won't get a divorce!

339
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,719
Sa.

340
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,479
Let's just settle this nicely

341
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,959
and not go to court to cause an embarrassment.

342
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,639
Are you threatening me?!

343
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,639
I'm not.

344
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,719
But I will do it.

345
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,239
Go for it.

346
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,519
If I'm not happy,

347
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,839
don't even hope that you can.

348
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,839
Sa is pregnant.

349
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,719
Peem!

350
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,679
Have you see n Sa?

351
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,039
She left.

352
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,119
What's wrong?

353
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,159
Sa is pregnant.

354
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,199
She's pregnant with me.

355
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,199
If I'm not happy,

356
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,199
don't even hope that you can.

357
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,039
Unless...

358
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,399
Plubpl a.

359
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,679
Where are you going?

360
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,999
Talk to P lub pla.

361
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,239
I think Sa is heading over there.

362
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,359
I'm coming too

363
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,519
Usa is pregnant with Pete's baby?

364
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,879
Now I can handle things more easily.

365
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,719
Putter.

366
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,479
Mom!

367
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,919
You're home.

368
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,719
Hey.

369
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,719
Were you being naughty with Auntie Orn?

370
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,599
No.

371
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,879
Thanks Orn for watching Putter.

372
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,999
Why are you thanking me?

373
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,759
Your son is like my son.

374
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,599
How's Tre doing?

375
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,439
Oh.

376
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,039
Surgery is done.

377
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,559
She's safe.

378
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,479
But she needs to recover at the hospital.

379
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,279
So Pluband l had to come home

380
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,079
Yeah.

381
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,479
I don't know

382
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,479
when she wakes up,

383
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,439
how she will react seeing herself in that state.

384
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,199
This'is karma for her.

385
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,279
Well, come in and get your rest.

386
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,159
Come on.

387
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,279
Let's go.

388
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,879
What's the matter?

389
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,199
Did Sa come here?

390
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,159
No.

391
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,079
What's the matter?

392
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,679
Nothing.

393
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,999
I'll go out and look for her then.

394
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,119
Excuse me

395
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,439
You sure everything is okay?

396
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,479
Tong and I will take Putter inside then.

397
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,079
Yeah.

398
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,719
Come on Putter.

399
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,519
Hello.

400
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,159
What?!

401
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,839
Tre is awake?!

402
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,719
Ye s, I'monmy way

403
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,959
What's wrong with Tre?

404
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,119
Tre.

405
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,959
You're awake.

406
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,679
How are you?

407
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,799
You had a cerebral hemorrhage.

408
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,959
You had surgery.

409
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,319
You're okay now.

410
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,759
You're...

411
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,359
You're paralyzed.

412
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,799
I'm sorry.

413
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,159
Tre.

414
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,079
Hey, calm down Tre.

415
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,439
Tong.

416
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,519
Take S u thee out of here

417
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,039
Tre, I'm sorry.

418
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,359
Let's go Su thee

419
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,519
-Tre.
-Get out of here first!

420
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,159
Tre!

421
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,999
Calm down!

422
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,639
Su thee left.

423
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,639
Hey Plub.

424
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,559
How is Tre?

425
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,359
The doctor just gave her some medicine.

426
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,599
She's calmed down now.

427
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,359
Can I go in and see her?

428
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,159
You can't.

429
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,479
Tre isn't ready to see you right now.

430
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,159
Do you know

431
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,279
I'm very disappointed in you?

432
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,959
I'm sorry.

433
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,839
But I didn't want it to be like this.

434
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,239
Yeah.

435
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,559
You loving the same sex

436
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,079
isn't wrong.

437
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,839
But what's wrong is

438
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,039
you're too weak to admit the truth.

439
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,999
You chose to lie

440
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,759
and married Tre when you don't even love her

441
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,959
You doing this makes Tr every pitiful

442
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,919
I know I'm wrong.

443
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,639
I always felt guilty.

444
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,799
But I'm ready to take responsibility of everything

445
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,399
for-my actions.

446
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,079
I will look after Tre

447
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,399
and ours on the best that I can

448
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,559
But Tong and I

449
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,839
made a decision.

450
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,359
I'm going to have our lawyer file a lawsuit against Mr. Ohm

451
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,479
Please send him the message.

452
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,439
Are you okay?

453
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,919
I feel sorry for Tre.

454
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,479
You for gave her already?

455
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,079
No.

456
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,519
I'm still mad

457
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,639
and I don't know if I can forgive her.

458
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,479
But seeing her like this,

459
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,919
I can't just stand idly.

460
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,919
I understand.

461
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,999
How many people

462
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,959
can cut ties from their siblings and be truly happy?

463
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,679
Tre pra dub is getting her karma.

464
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,519
Why did you do it?!

465
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,519
You called Tre over

466
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,559
to let her know about us?

467
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,639
Do you know what has happened to her now?!

468
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,839
She deserved it.

469
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,119
You think I'm willing to get hurt alone

470
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,519
and let you guys be happy?

471
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,839
If I'm hurt.

472
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,479
you guys will get hurt a hundred times more!

473
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,479
Then it'll be fair!

474
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,399
It's my fault.

475
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,559
I deserve this karma

476
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,799
We all have to get our own karma for our actions.

477
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,719
You as well

478
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,519
What do you mean?

479
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,199
Tre's family

480
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,119
will sue you for adultery.

481
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,879
What?!

482
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,559
Pete.

483
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,359
Did you find Sa?

484
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,079
No.

485
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,559
I looked everywhere but couldn't find her

486
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,359
She won't answer my calls either.

487
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,359
I'm scared that...

488
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,079
Sa will do something awful and hurt the baby.

489
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:26,999
No Pete.

490
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,399
I believe that

491
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,999
Sa has some good conscience in her

492
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,759
Sa wouldn't...

493
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,119
go to that extent.

494
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,479
You're awake?

495
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,719
Sa.

496
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,719
When did you get here?

497
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,759
Since noon.

498
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,159
I came and saw you in this state.

499
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,719
What happened?

500
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,319
What?!

501
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,759
Plubpl a also asked to get a divorce from you?

502
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,319
Yeah.

503
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,919
Those two are probably planning to get back together

504
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,239
I won't allow it.

505
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,719
Kit.

506
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,199
Right now,

507
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,399
I'm...

508
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,519
I'm pregnant with Peem's baby

509
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,279
What?!

510
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,839
Even when you're pregnant

511
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,639
Peem still wants to divorce you?!

512
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,319
Yes.

513
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,319
Kit.

514
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,839
You need to help me

515
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,519
I can't divorce him.

516
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,559
I won't let my child be fatherless.

517
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,639
You have to help me.

518
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,399
Sa.

519
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,679
Don't worry.

520
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,439
I won't let that happen.

521
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,599
In that case, what should we do?

522
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,959
Since doing good doesn't work,

523
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,679
we should try a different route then.

524
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,359
Putter.

525
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,519
Dad!

526
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,479
What are you doing?

527
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,679
Auntie Orn is teaching me how to draw

528
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,639
Where did everyone go?

529
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,719
Plub isn't home?

530
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,839
Pluband Tong went to the hospital.

531
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,319
little

532
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,759
Who got hurt?

533
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,119
Something happened to Tre.

534
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,839
little

535
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,199
She's been like this.

536
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,799
The doctor said

537
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,319
depression can happen

538
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,879
after encountering something traumatic in life.

539
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,959
We probably...

540
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,599
have to give her emotional support as we go.

541
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,079
Okay.

542
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,159
I'm on my way.

543
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,639
What happened?

544
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,999
The company called me in.

545
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,319
Isn't it your day off today?

546
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,879
Is it urgent?

547
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,119
Do you want me to give them a call?

548
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,119
That's okay.

549
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:31,479
But lill have to leave Putter with you until Tong and Plubare back.

550
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,159
It's my job anyway.

551
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,799
Putter is my son

552
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,879
Sorry to bother you.

553
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,439
Putter.

554
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,119
Stay with your dad first.

555
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,759
Okay.

556
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,119
Thank you.

557
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,559
Or a wee left.

558
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,559
You did well.

559
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,119
I will not lose you.
