1
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,679
Who knows, if this is a success,

2
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,959
everyone might accept the skills of your new secretary.

3
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,159
Why would Peem want to prove my abilities?

4
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,519
Or...

5
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,879
he has some kind of plan?

6
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,759
Plub, you don't need to do it.

7
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,279
You just got home. You should go rest.

8
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,279
I can do these work

9
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,559
It's okay Grandma

10
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,519
How can you do it yourself?

11
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,239
These things are heavy

12
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,399
If you want to lift something,

13
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,679
wait for me and Tong to be home then.

14
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,399
You have to go work at the convenient store soon.

15
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,399
Won't you get tired?

16
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,559
Hmm?

17
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,279
How about this,

18
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,879
you should quit the job at the convenient store.

19
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,319
You have a permanent job at the company now.

20
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,999
I can't Grandma.

21
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,839
I don't even know if I will survive

22
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,559
at this company

23
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,519
I should have another job just in case.

24
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,239
Like people these days that say they have a full time and part time job?

25
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,279
Yes.

26
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,679
It's called diversification.

27
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,479
My granddaughter is smart and skilled.

28
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,239
And thoughtful.

29
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,959
You taught me well!

30
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,359
How's it going?

31
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,159
As you can see.

32
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,079
I'm not dead yet.

33
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,078
Take it as a life lesson not to do this again.

34
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,239
How fortunate that the woman settled and didn't take any further action?

35
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,839
But that kid shouldn't hurt Pete to this extent.

36
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,319
He deserves it so he can learn from his mistake!

37
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,479
If I was the one that saw you you still wouldn't be awake right now.

38
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,079
You're already siding with the boy that hurt our son?

39
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,999
Geez!

40
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,519
That's great.

41
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,319
The brother is out on bail.

42
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,879
The sister got to be the chairman's
secretary at the company.

43
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,959
While her brother almost killed our son!

44
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,119
What Mom?

45
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,159
What do you mean?

46
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,279
Who's Dad's secretary?

47
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,999
The sister of the boy who beat you up!

48
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,919
Is that true?

49
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,679
I had to hire his sister

50
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,999
to compensate for what you have caused!

51
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,719
Gosh.

52
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,439
That sounds like a reasonable answer.

53
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,119
But is that really it?

54
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,039
It's not because she's beautiful

55
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,399
that you want her to be a snack for you?

56
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,759
Hey.

57
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,799
Dad!

58
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,279
That guy hurt me!

59
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,399
I watched the footage and saw that you started it.

60
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,759
Most importantly,

61
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,199
you're the one that caused all of this, no?

62
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,239
It's all your fault.

63
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,839
If you didn't pick a fight with that kid,

64
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,559
your father wouldn't have met his sister.

65
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,159
He wouldn't have fallen for her youth and beauty

66
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,759
that he had to hire her!

67
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,879
All of this

68
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,679
is your fault!

69
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,319
It's your fault! It's all your fault!

70
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,279
Everything is all your fault!

71
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,679
Mom.

72
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,919
Don't you ever think

73
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,639
that it's your fault?

74
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,519
Karma.

75
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,119
You stole Dad from Peem'smother.

76
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,199
Pete!

77
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,239
Remember this,

78
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,839
if your father leaves me,

79
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,799
and replace that girl with me,

80
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,519
it's because of you!

81
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,879
Your fault!

82
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,479
Understood?! It will be your fault!

83
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,719
Hey buddy.

84
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,079
Go investigate that guy that had a fight with me the other day.

85
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,279
I dropped out of school and started working because

86
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,119
I want you to be able to graduate

87
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,319
Have a good job and career.

88
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,639
Can you do that for me?

89
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,199
Who told you to make the sacrifice?!

90
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,679
Here you go.

91
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,839
The Chinese herbal stewed chicken that you asked me to do

92
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,319
Thank you Aunt Lek

93
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,799
Sure.

94
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,079
Who are you giving it to?

95
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,879
I'm giving it to someone who helped get my senses back.

96
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,559
Okay.

97
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,239
Where is Plub,your beloved granddaughter Grandma?

98
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,319
She went to charm Suthee and made me havel issues with him!

99
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,039
Plub would do that?

100
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,439
Charm Su thee?

101
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,279
Wouldn't it be better for her to find a single sugar daddy instead?!

102
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,079
She owed Su thee money

103
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,239
She went to be g Suthee to prolong paying him back

104
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,279
What's next you ask?

105
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,479
I don't know if she offered herself to Su thee or not!

106
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,039
Tre!

107
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,959
Don't speak ill of your sister like that!

108
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,159
It's true Grandma!

109
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,479
She's jealous of me that I have a rich husband!

110
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,199
Who knows,maybe she desperately want my husband!

111
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,359
Grandma!

112
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,319
This is where

113
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,479
Plubpla lives?

114
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,639
Yes.

115
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,599
She lives with her old granny

116
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,079
and her younger brother.

117
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,879
Because she's poor like this

118
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,439
her granddaughter is ambitious.

119
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,679
She wants things she shouldn't be wanting

120
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,039
I sympathize her.

121
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,919
But your granddaughter is stupid

122
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,719
for choosing the wrong person

123
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,039
by messing with my people

124
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,799
So now you will take the heat for it.

125
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,399
It can't be helped

126
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,879
Excuse me.

127
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,959
Do you know where Grand ma Thip flower shop is at?

128
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,279
The flower shop? It's right over there.

129
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,279
Thank you.

130
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,399
Did you come to check out the plants?

131
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,359
What kind do you like?

132
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,239
Feel free to look around

133
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,279
You can look around.

134
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,039
What is this?!

135
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,719
What are you doing to my shop?!

136
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,639
Stop destroying my shop!

137
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,319
Take that!

138
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,159
Don't!

139
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,639
- Stop destroying my plants!
-Stop!

140
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,519
Listen!

141
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,799
Warn your granddaughter not to mess with people's husbands!

142
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,759
Otherwise,

143
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,159
it will be worse for you!

144
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,839
Understood?!

145
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,119
Go!

146
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,719
Grandma!

147
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,679
Destroy everything!

148
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,519
What happened?!

149
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,919
That's...

150
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,679
That's Mr. Peem

151
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,199
How did he get here?

152
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,479
I said stop!

153
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,679
-Stop!
-Stop!

154
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,239
Is aids top!

155
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,439
Stop?

156
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,999
Don't!

157
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,439
Stop!

158
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,679
What do we do?

159
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,199
Don't!

160
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,879
Tell them to back away.

161
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,079
Don't make this a big issue.

162
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,519
-Okay.
- That's enough!

163
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,959
- You!
-Stop!

164
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,039
Boss said to stop.

165
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,999
Let's go!

166
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,479
Leave!

167
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,439
Don't!

168
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,159
Hurry!

169
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,079
Move!

170
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,319
-Don't!
-Let's go!

171
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,799
Don't son. Don't mess with them!

172
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,279
Su.

173
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,119
Grandma!

174
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,719
How are you?

175
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,799
I don't know. It hurts right here

176
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,719
Grandma.

177
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,719
Peem!

178
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,639
Grandma!

179
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,879
Peem!

180
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,079
What did you do to my grandmother?!

181
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,079
Peem.

182
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,719
Why did you hire those thugs to destroy my grandmother'sshop?!

183
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,559
Did you know that was my house?

184
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,239
If you don't like me,you're unhappy with me, why don't you put it out on me?!

185
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,559
Why put it out on my grandmother?!

186
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,879
Why do you have to be this violent?!

187
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,359
Listen.

188
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,639
I don't know anything about those thugs.

189
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,199
They were already destroying the shop when l got there.

190
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,919
So lwent to help her.

191
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,799
Do you understand Thai?

192
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,039
The word "help "?!

193
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,839
I don't believe you

194
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,959
You hired those thugs to stage everything

195
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,919
What do you want?

196
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,839
If I hired those guys,

197
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,519
why would I be there to have you suspect me?

198
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,039
Then why did you go over there?

199
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,999
I went to visit Grand ma Thip.

200
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,719
You went to visit my grandmother?

201
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,959
I don't believe you

202
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,519
Look Peem.

203
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,879
I don't care how much power you have.

204
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,519
But if something happens to my grandmother,

205
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,039
I will kill you.

206
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,239
Mr s. Thip's relative?

207
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,719
How is Grandma?

208
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,959
The patient is awake.

209
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,639
She might just feel tired and stressed.

210
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,719
So she fainted.

211
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,919
But I want her to get some rest so I can examine her in more details.

212
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,919
Well..

213
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,599
I found some abnormalities.

214
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,759
We found that the patient's heart is abnormal.

215
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,719
So lim concern that the patient might have a disease related to her coronary arteries

216
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,039
P But the closer l get to you

217
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:47,159
P The morel know I've done wrong and made mistakes &

218
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,359
Can you please forgive me

219
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,839
P How much I hated you

220
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,319
PIc an love you even more

221
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,999
PI'msorry for all the mistakes &

222
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,119
PI want you to try to accept the love that comes from me

223
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,999
PI will give you everything

224
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,759
PIlose to you in every way

225
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:24,799
P Can I make amends? Let me fix it by asking for your love &

226
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,879
Grandma.

227
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,239
I think I feel much better now.

228
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,879
I can just go home

229
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,839
Being in the hospital like this,

230
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,679
the longer I stay, the more money wasted

231
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,879
You can't go home yet.

232
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,879
The doctor said

233
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,519
you need to get examined again

234
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,239
I think you have to stay here for two more nights

235
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,199
A private hospital

236
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,279
is expensive.

237
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,639
You shouldn't have brought me to this hospital.

238
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,279
It was an emergency

239
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,039
Whichever is close,

240
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,679
I take you to that one

241
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,719
It's okay.

242
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,999
I have some money to pay for it.

243
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,479
I'm better now, I'm cured.

244
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,759
Peem!

245
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,479
Why did you come in here?!

246
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,479
Young man.

247
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,879
You followed me all the way to the hospital?

248
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,319
I came to visit Grandma

249
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,079
Leave. She needs to rest.

250
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,199
Plub!

251
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,239
Don't chase him away like that. Don't say that.

252
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,559
You know him?

253
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,039
I met him the other day.

254
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,399
We got along.

255
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,239
So I...

256
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,839
I invited him over to the flower shop.

257
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,039
Pardon me.

258
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,959
Are you feeling better now Grandma?

259
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,039
I'm much better now.

260
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,199
I haven't thanked you yet for helping me.

261
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,239
He helped you?

262
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,359
Mm.

263
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,679
That's right.

264
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,479
It was him. Those thugs that came to destroy my shop

265
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,399
I told them to stop but they wouldn't listen.

266
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,159
It was this young man here that chased them away

267
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,039
And...

268
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,639
who were they?

269
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,319
Do you know Grandma?

270
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,199
I don't know.

271
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,039
And...

272
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,399
did they say anything to you?

273
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,039
He...

274
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,119
That's right.

275
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,439
Do you...

276
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,839
remember so we can have a clue as to who hired them?

277
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,199
I think

278
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,479
they didn't say anything

279
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,879
Stop!

280
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,999
Listen!

281
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,959
Warn your granddaughter not to mess with people's husbands!

282
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,799
Otherwise,

283
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,279
it will be worse for you!

284
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,039
Even though they didn't say anything to give out a clue,

285
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,359
that's fine.

286
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,519
I discussed it with Yot

287
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,919
He said we can file a report.

288
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,679
Yot will investigate

289
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,079
and catch the person that hired those thugs

290
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,079
What a shame for these plants. Everything is destroyed

291
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,039
Why didn't they talk it out? Why destroy things?

292
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,159
I pity Grandma

293
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,079
What happened?

294
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,199
This morning some thugs came and destroyed Grand ma Thip's shop.

295
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,599
I don't know.

296
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,679
Maybe she owed money so they came to collect the debt.

297
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,439
The police are still investigating

298
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,199
Is anyone hurt?

299
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,119
I heard Grand ma Th ip fainted and got sent to the hospital.

300
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,559
I wonder how she's doing. She's
old so she probably got startled!

301
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,479
She is old.

302
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,399
It's evidence.

303
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,279
Auntie.

304
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,799
What was that man doing here?

305
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,759
I don't know.

306
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,759
He came to ask questions. I don't know where he's from.

307
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,639
Hello sir.

308
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,879
Ana.

309
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,799
If Plubpla comes.

310
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,239
please tell her to present me the welcoming plan for Mr. Zhang

311
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,439
Plub asked to take a sick leave.

312
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,479
Her grandmother fell ill and is hospitalized

313
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,359
Oh really?

314
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,799
Yes.

315
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,679
Kom san.

316
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,999
Call to check

317
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,559
if Plubp la needs any help with her grandmother or not

318
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,319
Take care of everything for her

319
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,719
Yes sir.

320
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,319
Ms. Su.

321
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,519
I have something to report

322
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,839
I think I should send a'gift basket to Plub pla's grandmother.

323
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,799
So I can earn points to have Plubp la be even more impressed.

324
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,159
Do you think that's a good idea?

325
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,879
Go handle it for me

326
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,839
If you're really interested in Ms. Plub pla

327
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,239
you don't need to invest this much.

328
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,639
You offered her a job

329
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,879
If you want to please her

330
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,959
I think right now she's having financial issues

331
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,279
If you offer her money to financially support her,

332
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,319
I think that would suffice.

333
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,879
You are starting to judge women just like Peem is.

334
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,839
A good woman like Plubpla

335
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,599
can't easily be bought with money

336
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,919
Why would she even bother working so hard then?

337
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,359
You're right.

338
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,919
Most importantly

339
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,399
I want to show Peem that there is a woman out there

340
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,399
that will love me for me

341
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,799
and not my money

342
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,919
So he can stop belittling me

343
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,239
Hey Peem!

344
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,799
You staged all of this, didn't you?

345
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,079
Staged?

346
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,159
Are you watching too much TV?

347
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,839
Why would I do that?

348
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,799
To have my grandma trust you.

349
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,959
And what do I get from your grandmother trusting me?

350
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:37,959
Well..

351
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,439
so you can oppress me to scare me.

352
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,959
I'm not someone who thinks so shallow like that

353
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,599
If I was shallow, my plan would be

354
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,199
much complex than this.

355
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,239
Most importantly, I didn't even know that Grand ma Thip was your grandmother.

356
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,239
I don't believe you

357
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,199
Up to you then.

358
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,079
But let me tell you,

359
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,239
I know who did it.

360
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,799
Who?

361
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,679
Hey!

362
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,919
Peem!

363
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,199
Well?

364
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,519
Did Peem come back yet?

365
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,759
Did he see me?

366
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,879
What did he say?!

367
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,559
Mr, Peem isn't back yet.

368
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,639
What do l do?

369
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,599
What if he tells Puchong?

370
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,279
Don't over think it yet.

371
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,199
We already know that throughout the past, Mr. Peem never bothered us.

372
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,759
No matter how much we mess with the chairman's women.

373
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,479
Mr. Peem wouldn't care this time either.

374
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,039
Why did Peem go over to that girl's house?

375
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,479
Peem!

376
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,399
Hey Peem, stop!

377
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,479
Tell me who did it.

378
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,239
When I got there,

379
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,839
Is a w Su'scar

380
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,839
parking near your grandmother'sshop

381
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,279
Ms, Supang?

382
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,719
That's not true.

383
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,639
Why would Ms. Supang do that?

384
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,999
She doesn't like any woman that comes near my father.

385
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,519
So? I'm just working for your father, I didn't do --

386
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,119
You just started working. What do you understand?

387
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,199
Su is a very jealous person.

388
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,279
She doesn't like any woman that comes near my father, No matter who it is.

389
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,559
Most importantly,

390
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,399
you were able to come work here

391
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,599
because of my father, no?

392
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,599
I don't believe you

393
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,959
I believe that you planned everything and is blaming it on Ms. Supang.

394
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,399
You want to threaten me so I can quit, right?

395
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,719
But if you don't want to quit

396
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,559
do you want to come work with me instead of my father?

397
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:51,759
Hey.

398
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,519
You're offering me a job

399
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,799
when you wanted to fire me prior to this, no?

400
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,399
I want to know

401
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,399
what my father sees in you

402
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,159
that he wants you to go work with him.

403
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,639
You have that much skills?

404
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,359
It's because the chairman was kind and gave me an opportunity

405
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,999
Kind?

406
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,479
What if...

407
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,839
I was kind and wanted to give you an opportunity?

408
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,639
Who will you choose?

409
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,319
I can pay you double what my father is paying you

410
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,159
Are you interested?

411
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,919
It's true money is important to me.

412
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,919
But what's more important than that

413
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,999
is how I got the money.

414
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,599
You mean

415
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,519
you choose Dad and not me?

416
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,279
I don't want to be called

417
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,359
an ungrateful person

418
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,719
to a kind person like the chairman.

419
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,839
Up to you then.

420
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,559
Be prepared to go against Su then.

421
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,559
If you won't stop associating with my father,

422
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,079
she won't stop bothering you.

423
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,519
Yes.

424
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,839
Thanks for your concern.

425
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,799
If Ms. Supang misunderstood me like you said,

426
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,559
I will fix the problem myself.

427
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,559
Arrogant and cocky.

428
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,799
You think being my dad's mistress it will be worth the risk?

429
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,159
You will soon find out.

430
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,679
The only way to defeat the other party

431
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:49,359
is to find information that VGroup came up with this product first.

432
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,399
Gosh!

433
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,879
Where do I find it?!

434
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,319
That's...

435
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,599
Mr. Perfect Man!

436
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,959
You're a lawyer too?

437
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,039
What do I do to get to know him?

438
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,119
Are you hurt?

439
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,439
I'm sorry.

440
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,759
I didn't see your car coming.

441
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,679
It's okay.

442
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,559
It's you.

443
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,879
We met a few days ago at them all.

444
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,359
You don't remember?

445
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,119
I can't remember

446
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,559
Geez!

447
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,999
Are you saying I'm not memorable?

448
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,399
I'm kidding. I do remember.

449
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,399
You thought I scolded your nephew, right?

450
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,159
Wow!

451
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,559
Such details you have.

452
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,839
What are you doing here?

453
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,399
I'm a lawyer.

454
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,079
And...you?

455
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,999
I'm a lawyer too.

456
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,919
What a coincident!

457
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,959
Mr. Tat, do you want me to call insurance?

458
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,719
Sure. Go ahead

459
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,359
You won't call your insurance?

460
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,519
Oh!

461
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,839
Yes.

462
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,479
33160

463
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,399
Insurance 33160

464
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,519
What's up?

465
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,319
What?!

466
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,239
There's been an accident.

467
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,479
Oh.

468
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,239
No rush. I can wait.

469
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,999
Oh.

470
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,959
Where did he go?

471
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,999
Oh, the owner of the car?

472
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,519
He had an urgent matter.

473
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,719
I can handle this

474
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,519
Okay.

475
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,999
How's Grandma's condition?

476
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,679
The patient has coronary artery disease

477
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,879
Coronary artery disease?

478
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,439
Yes.

479
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,959
Caused by narrowing of the coronary arteries

480
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,319
because they are fatty deposits and plaques stuck in the blood vessels.

481
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,119
This results in the amount of blood sent to the heart muscles being insufficient to meet the needs.

482
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,919
So how do we treat it?

483
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,839
Initially, I will treat it with medication and schedule regular check-ups to monitor her symptoms.

484
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,879
But if she doesn't get better,

485
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,639
it may be necessary to consider balloon angioplasty

486
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,639
and a coronary artery bypass graft.

487
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,799
Hey.

488
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,559
How did you miss?

489
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,439
I told you to look after that family

490
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,119
I'm sorry.

491
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,919
I'm really sorry.

492
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,519
Thank you

493
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,439
Why so expensive?

494
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,039
I probably won't pay Su thee back this month.

495
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,719
Tre is going to scold me.

496
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,919
Are you alright?

497
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,279
I feel a little dizzy.

498
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,319
Kaew,

499
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,639
You look pale. What's wrong?

500
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,399
I wanted to use the restroom

501
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,399
but almost fainted.

502
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,799
This young lady helped me in time.

503
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,479
Thank you so much dear.

504
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,319
No problem.

505
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,799
Kaew, the doctor called your name. We should go.

506
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,559
Thank you so much

507
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:38,959
Sure.

508
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,199
Can you manage? Take it slow.

509
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,279
So beautiful!

510
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,359
That woman looks...

511
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,519
Or aml mistaken?

512
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,919
Hello M r. Komsan.

513
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,439
What are you doing here?

514
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,439
Mr Puchong found out about your grandmother being hospitalized.

515
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,599
He asked me to send you a gift basket

516
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,319
Please tell him thank you.

517
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,359
May he prosper.

518
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,919
I never thought

519
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,359
my granddaughter would have a good boss like this.

520
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,759
I feel so considerate

521
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,799
Yeah.

522
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,519
I took a sick leave too.

523
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,439
Mr. Puchong also said

524
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,879
regarding the hospital expenses

525
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,679
if you need his help, please let him know

526
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,199
Please tell the chairman thank you but..

527
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,599
I won't bother him.

528
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,079
It's too much money.

529
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,759
When you can't manage anymore,

530
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,719
come tell me

531
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,879
It's going to be hard to find those thugs

532
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,879
that destroyed Grandma's shop

533
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,599
We all know

534
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,319
we have no surveillance cameras in that area.

535
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,599
It's fine Yot.

536
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,799
Even if we know who it is

537
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,999
it's still hard to hold the person who hired them accountable.

538
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,999
Wait Plub

539
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,799
You talk as if

540
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,399
you know who it is.

541
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,199
Just a suspicion.

542
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,519
I'm not sure yet.

543
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,159
Who is it?

544
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,799
The chairman's wife.

545
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,399
Ms. Supang

546
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,879
Hold on.

547
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,319
And...

548
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,719
why does she have to come attack you?

549
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,719
I don't know.

550
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,479
I heard that

551
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,159
she's a very jealous person.

552
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,959
I only got a job at the company

553
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,199
because Mr. Puchong hired me himself

554
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,719
She might be misunderstanding me.

555
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,559
Plub.

556
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,519
I'm getting more worried about you now.

557
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,719
You shouldn't even be working there.

558
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,759
So?

559
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,279
I don't have that many option.

560
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,159
I don't know.

561
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,519
I already chose this path

562
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,119
I'm not going to surrender to life just because one person is misunderstanding me

563
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,439
I'm going to keep fighting

564
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,799
Plub.

565
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,959
You do know right

566
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,039
that I'm right here?

567
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,599
I'm always by your side.

568
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,319
Whenever you turn around

569
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,079
you will see me standing here

570
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,719
Mm.

571
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,759
I'll always be by your side too

572
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,239
Friends don't abandon each other.

573
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,959
I'm going to go check on Grandma now.

574
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,799
It's late so you should go home too.

575
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,319
Okay.

576
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,359
When will you finally understand how I feel?

577
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,639
Peem.

578
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,079
-I know.

579
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,719
Tat.

580
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,399
Your person really failed this time.

581
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,399
If I didn't happen to come by.

582
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,119
things would have been worse.

583
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,719
I'm really sorry

584
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,719
You know what's really unexpected?

585
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,279
Grand ma Thip

586
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,119
is Plubpla's grandmother.

587
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,719
The grandmother you told me about?

588
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,559
It's unbelievable that that gentle grandmother

589
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,119
is Plubpla's grandmother.

590
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,239
But yeah,

591
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,799
people in the same family don't necessarily have to be equally good

592
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,479
If anything happens to Grand ma Thip,

593
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,759
I would feel really guilty.

594
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,879
I never thought Ms. Su would go that far.

595
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,919
My stepmother isn't ordinary like you think

596
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,599
Otherwise she wouldn't have made my mom lose her patience

597
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,199
and leave like that.

598
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,679
Hello Ms. Su.

599
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,999
What's on Puchong's schedule today?

600
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,639
Yes.

601
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,999
He has paperwork to sign in the morning

602
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,919
In the afternoon, there'sa grand opening for the new coffee shop

603
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,719
In the evening, he has a dinner appointment.

604
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,919
Did that girl come to work yet?

605
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,719
It's Plubpla.

606
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,039
Hello Ms. Supang.

607
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,039
I'm Plubp la,

608
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,239
Mr, Puchong's new secretary.

609
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,959
But you know that already, don't you?
