1
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,119
It's Plub plan.

2
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,839
You found her?

3
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,479
If I did,

4
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,479
I wouldn't have to get engaged to Sa like this

5
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,599
You mean

6
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,799
Mr Thawipfound Plubpla

7
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,279
and used this to threaten you to get engaged to Sa?

8
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,759
1..

9
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,039
want you to give these photos to our investigator.

10
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,599
I have to know where Plubp la is at.

11
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,519
From these photos,

12
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,279
I don't know where.

13
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,319
But definitely not Thailand.

14
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,479
It'll be difficult.

15
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,519
No matter how hard it is,

16
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,199
or no matter how many years it takes

17
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,999
I have to see her.

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,799
In the mean ti me, I probably have to get engaged to Sa tojust stall time.

19
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,439
When I find Plubpl a,

20
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,919
I will call off the engagement.

21
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,759
It's been four years

22
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,839
Where are you, Plubpl a?

23
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,439
What is it Tat?

24
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,679
Peem.

25
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,919
Our investigator found Plubpl a

26
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,119
Where?

27
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,479
Tat, where is she?

28
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,759
Peem!

29
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,439
Hey!

30
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,679
Pull yourself together

31
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,079
Today is very important.

32
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,199
Mr Mark is the owner of a world-class hotel brand

33
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,599
If this plot of land that we offered gets to invest with him

34
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,599
it will benefit our company greatly

35
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,239
l also heard

36
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,039
Kit will also be submitting his bidding price to Mr. Mark as well.

37
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,399
Do not mess up.

38
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,279
It was a struggle setting an appointment with Mr. Mark for you.

39
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,239
I know, That's why I came.

40
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,239
When my heart actually wants to go see Plub pla in America instead

41
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,319
About that, I think

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,359
you should wait until our investigator confirms it.

43
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,239
I won't wait any more.

44
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,239
I want to go see Plubpl a myself.

45
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,239
Up to you then.

46
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,199
Wait here.

47
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,279
Finally.

48
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,679
I know where you're at.

49
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,279
Plubpl a.

50
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,199
Peem!

51
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,559
Yes, hello.

52
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,679
Sure.

53
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,079
We're heading in right now.

54
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,959
Or was I too happy that I'm seeing things?

55
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,239
Okay.

56
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,319
I'll be right in.

57
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,599
I'm sorry

58
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,519
Plubpl a!

59
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,239
Are you okay?!

60
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,439
I'm okay, I just feel a little dizzy

61
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,759
Plubpl a.

62
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,599
Sit here and rest

63
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,879
Damn you Peem!

64
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,439
When will you get here?

65
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,119
How's it going Tat?

66
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,599
Kit.

67
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,399
so,

68
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,679
your boss didn't come with you?

69
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,879
Is Peem scared

70
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,239
to offer his bidding to Mr, Mark to compete with me on his own?

71
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,039
He'll be here

72
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,279
Better be true

73
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,079
Mr. Mark

74
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,719
Hello.

75
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,639
This is Mr Vi kit, CEO of V Group

76
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,119
It's nice to meet you.

77
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:09,879
Likewise.

78
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,599
This is..

79
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,039
I'm Tat.

80
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,159
I'm PPWorld's legal advisor and

81
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,999
Mr. Peem's secretary.

82
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,479
I think

83
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,639
your boss should be here to discuss work with me in person.

84
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,639
Mr. Mark --

85
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,639
In that case,

86
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,038
please come to my room and let's discuss.
a

87
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,038
My pleasure.

88
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,439
This way.

89
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,079
Mr. Mark.

90
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,519
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,039
You should leave.

92
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,999
Damn it!

93
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,519
Where the hell did you go?!

94
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,359
Plub.

95
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,239
Are you sure

96
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,479
you're ready to face your past?

97
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,399
I am strong enough now

98
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,639
Let's go.

99
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,839
Have some sweet drink first.

100
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,039
Thank you.

101
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,359
How do you feel?

102
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,599
Better.

103
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,959
I don't want to believe that it's really you.

104
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,839
I'm so happy to see you.

105
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,199
I heard that

106
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,959
you went to America.

107
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,959
I was going to fly there to see you but

108
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,479
I found you here instead.

109
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,239
I just got back

110
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,839
If you go there.

111
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,239
we probably won't see each other

112
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,719
Plubpl a.

113
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,319
For the past four years,

114
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,359
I was so worried about you.

115
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,719
I've been looking for you all the time

116
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,919
Why didn't you tell me you were leaving?

117
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,039
Why...

118
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,879
were you looking for me?

119
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,719
Plubpl a.

120
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,119
About your grandmother,

121
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,479
I want to tell you

122
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,839
-lm really sorry.
-Hey.

123
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,519
You...

124
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,119
should stop talking about the past

125
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,119
I don't want to be reminded of it.

126
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,239
But I want to explain

127
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,239
But I don't want to hear it right now

128
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,959
Anyway.

129
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,839
congratulations on your engagement to Ms. Usa

130
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,159
When's the wedding?

131
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,479
It's not what you think

132
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,639
The truth is

133
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,639
I didn't want to get engaged to her.

134
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,759
Hey.

135
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,559
I'm really happy for you.

136
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,199
I have no grudge s. I'mokay

137
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,399
Our relationship..

138
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,159
ended.

139
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,719
I'm serious.

140
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,719
I think about you all the time

141
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,519
I Peem.

142
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,439
Whatever you say.

143
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,719
please respect Ms. Usa.

144
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,839
She is your fiancee right now

145
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,959
Then wait for me.

146
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,719
Once l take care of Us a's situation,

147
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,079
we can start over

148
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,199
Okay?

149
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,399
Everything is done

150
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,559
Peem

151
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,559
I have to excuse myself

152
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,799
I'm meeting a friend.

153
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,639
Wait.

154
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,119
I'll send you off.

155
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,039
That's okay.
-You...

156
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,279
just fainted.

157
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,879
It's okay. I didn't park far, I'll be fine.

158
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,919
This time

159
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,159
can't let you leave me

160
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,279
Then...

161
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,719
do you want my number?

162
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,719
-Peem!
-Plubpla.

163
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,479
Peem!

164
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,399
Yot!

165
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,879
Let Plub go right now!

166
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,159
Yot.

167
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,439
I'll handle it.

168
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,599
Don't worry

169
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,639
We'll be seeing each other again

170
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,439
I won't go anywhere this time.

171
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,839
I'll be waiting.

172
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,919
Let's go Yot.

173
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,119
I never thought I would pull him out that easily

174
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,239
actually had a second plan.

175
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,399
Plub.

176
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,959
So,

177
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,959
are you okay?

178
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,839
No.

179
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,239
You know what he said?

180
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,079
He said he missed me.

181
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,239
He will call off the engagement

182
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,079
so he can start fresh with me

183
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,159
What the hell is he thinking?

184
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,519
He's the murderer that killed Grandma.

185
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,519
He also ruined my life.

186
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,119
Now he's going to hurt another woman's feelings

187
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,879
He has n't changed.

188
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,279
He probably thinks

189
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,199
he can easily fool me like before

190
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,319
But this time

191
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,919
I won't be the bait for him to deceive a second time.

192
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,719
Wait.

193
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,799
Just relax.

194
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,519
Pull yourself together.

195
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,599
Can I be alone?

196
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,519
Where the hell were you?

197
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,479
Why didn't you go see Mr. Mark?

198
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,479
I had an important matter.

199
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,919
Did you know that VGroup signed a contract with him to build the first hotel in Asia with him?

200
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,439
Is that so?

201
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,359
Why...

202
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,119
are you so chilled about this?

203
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,279
When...

204
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,799
the company lost a big opportunity in profit like this.

205
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,399
Yeah.

206
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,439
Do you not feel guilty at all?

207
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,119
My matter

208
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,439
is more important than your money worth millions.

209
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,079
What was the matter?!

210
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,319
You don't need to know.

211
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,119
Is this all you want to complain about?

212
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,799
I'll take my leave.

213
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,919
Wait!

214
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,399
Go clear this up with Mr. Mark

215
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,159
I will not lose an important business partner.

216
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,199
Handle how Dad?

217
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,119
His company already signed a contract with Kit's company.

218
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,759
I think

219
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,519
Peem lost.

220
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,159
It's too late to do anything about it now.

221
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,719
Actually,

222
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,119
don't we have a project in Rayong?

223
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,319
If we get to invest

224
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,279
with a world-class hotel,

225
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,719
it would be nice

226
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,439
That's true.

227
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,519
The plot of land there is suitable to build a six star hotel.

228
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,999
Let me be in charge of it Dad.

229
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,639
You're interested in the company's work Pete?

230
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,599
I've grown up Dad

231
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,199
Whatever Peem can do

232
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,319
I think I can do it too.

233
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,919
That sounds good Dad.

234
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,719
He can train as well.

235
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,719
No.

236
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,119
He can't be training for an important project like this.

237
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,759
You do it.

238
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,319
Go handle this project Peem.

239
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,239
Pete wait.

240
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,479
What is it?

241
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,519
If you want to learn the ropes,

242
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,519
you can be my assistant.

243
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,199
If I work with you

244
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,919
I'll only be your shadow

245
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,799
Pete.

246
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,079
What's wrong with you?

247
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,399
If you're unhappy about Sa, I...

248
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,079
I'm fine.

249
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,279
O just...

250
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,879
don't want to walk behind you anymore

251
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,079
I want my own path

252
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,319
Gosh Pete.

253
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,479
I thought it was something else.

254
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,879
You really have grown up.

255
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,279
My path

256
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,479
is to defeat you

257
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,119
Peem!

258
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,519
Where have you been?

259
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,279
Why didn't you go talk to Mr, Mark?

260
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,439
You're nagging like Dad.

261
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,279
Where were you?

262
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,199
Did something happened?

263
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,119
I found Plubpl a

264
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,399
I never thought I would see her there.

265
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,879
At the hotel?

266
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,679
I got to talk to her too.

267
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,039
Plubpl a'snew number

268
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,799
I think

269
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,199
it's too much of a coincidence.

270
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,679
You've been looking for her for four years.

271
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,679
All of a sudden you found her.

272
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,959
Plus...

273
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,679
you found her on an important business day too.

274
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,839
What's your deal?

275
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,479
I think it's odd

276
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,639
Don't over think it. I think..

277
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,559
you should help me think

278
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,039
about what to say to her.

279
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,839
I want to meet up with her

280
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,799
and apologize to her

281
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,279
I want to explain to her.

282
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,719
Why didn't you do that today?

283
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,079
l actually

284
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,639
want ed to but it seemed like shewasn't ready

285
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,079
But whatever

286
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,799
She's back now

287
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,679
I think I still have a chance

288
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,679
Sure.

289
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,079
Help me think.

290
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,519
What should I say to her?

291
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,759
Grandma.

292
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,319
Are you hungry?

293
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,399
No.

294
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,199
I'm tired. Can I rest first?

295
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,359
Did you know you're like my charger?

296
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,959
What?

297
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,879
When I'm tired,

298
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,199
after hugging you

299
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,519
I would have full energy!

300
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,719
Grandma's cooking is the best!

301
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,119
Don't eat so much.

302
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,799
You'll be fat like a pig.

303
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,079
You won't get a man.

304
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,479
Tong

305
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,079
Your face is fat and you have the nerves to criticize me?!

306
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,359
What?!

307
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,159
Just eat.

308
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,159
After you finished eating,

309
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,159
I mademayom chit loy kaew

310
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,679
It's in the fridge.

311
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,519
Isn't it both your favorites?

312
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,039
I will never forgive him Grandma.

313
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,279
Never.

314
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,759
Vi kit.

315
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,679
I was worried.

316
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,199
I figured you would be here so I came.

317
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,359
Are you okay?

318
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,479
I almost couldn't hold it in.

319
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,679
I shouldn't have let you go see Peem.

320
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,719
It's not your fault.

321
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,279
It was my fault

322
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,639
I'm not good at controlling my emotions

323
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,879
I will try harder.

324
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,079
So we can follow the plan we have

325
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,799
But if you can't manage

326
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,599
we can call it off.

327
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,279
-There are other ways to get --
-No.

328
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,719
I want to get back at him on my own terms.

329
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,719
You...

330
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,479
can trust me.

331
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,159
I won't be weak again.

332
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,559
Okay.

333
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,599
Let's go home then.

334
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,439
Okay.

335
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,039
She's back

336
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,559
but she doesn't live here

337
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,159
Where is she living at?

338
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,199
What is it Peem?

339
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,199
What do you want?

340
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,159
Tat.

341
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,439
I want to know where Plubp la is living at. She's not at her old place anymore.

342
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,759
Can you find out'for me?

343
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,159
You fool!

344
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,359
Go ask the investigator. How would I know?

345
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,839
Ms. Or a wee, her best friend

346
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,519
Don't you live in the same condo as her?

347
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,359
Yeah but --
-Okay.

348
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,959
Find out for me.

349
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:24,959
Hey.

350
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,159
Peem!

351
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,039
Jerk.

352
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,159
Hey.

353
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,719
I heard

354
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,279
Plubp la is back

355
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,759
So?

356
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,559
Whether my friend is back or not.

357
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,679
What's it to you?

358
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,679
The moment she got back

359
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,759
she caused Peem's company to miss out on a big project.

360
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,159
Is your friend scheming something?

361
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,319
You work at Kit's company.

362
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,999
Are you guys scheming something?

363
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,639
Don't accuse my friend

364
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,439
If you're innocent.

365
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,159
tell me where P lub is at

366
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,159
Why should I?

367
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,759
Peem wants to know

368
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,119
He's worried about her

369
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,119
Worried?

370
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,119
Shameless of him to say.

371
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,239
It's true.

372
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,639
Peem told me --

373
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,919
What's wrong with the elevator?

374
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,919
I think it's stuck

375
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,479
Excuse me!

376
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,479
Is anybody outside?!

377
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,799
We're stuck in here!

378
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,559
Excuse me!

379
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,759
Can anyone hear me?!

380
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,439
We're stuck in here!

381
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,039
The elevator is stuck?

382
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,039
I'm fixing it right now.

383
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,119
Wait a moment please.

384
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,399
Okay.

385
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,399
Alright.

386
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,239
He heard us

387
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,079
Hey, are you okay?

388
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,199
I'm claustrophobic.

389
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,559
Hey.

390
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,799
You're claustrophobic?

391
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,719
Okay.

392
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,359
Alright.

393
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,639
Just relax.

394
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,639
Slowly take your breaths.

395
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,439
Inhale.

396
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,839
Exhale slowly

397
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,759
Okay.

398
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,359
Just relax. Don't stress.

399
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,679
Inhale slowly.

400
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,359
Okay.

401
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,719
Exhale slowly

402
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,759
Good.

403
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,159
Inhale.

404
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,479
How are you feeling?

405
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,959
I'm okay now.

406
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,479
I thought I was going to die

407
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,359
You're claustrophobic

408
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,599
so why buy a condo?

409
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,799
You knew you have to take the elevator.

410
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,519
Was I able to choose?

411
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,719
Houses around here are expensive

412
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,759
Why are you complaining?

413
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,359
I was about to pass out

414
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,559
Sorry.

415
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,919
You sure you're okay?

416
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:05,999
Yes.

417
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,399
Thank you.

418
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,759
In that case

419
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,959
I'll take off.

420
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,799
If you're in trouble again

421
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,159
call me.

422
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,279
If something happens,

423
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,879
how can I call?

424
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,759
But.

425
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,479
I can rely on him for these things.

426
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,799
This man.

427
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,079
Five, six, seven.

428
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,439
Putter.

429
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,559
So,

430
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,559
how are you?

431
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,359
Were you naughty with Uncle Tong?

432
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,959
No, I wasn't naughty.

433
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,599
Sure you weren't.

434
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,639
Were you crying?

435
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,239
No.

436
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,999
Dust got in my eyes.

437
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,319
Did you prank Mom, Dad?

438
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,559
I didn't.

439
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,559
Mom is mean.

440
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,559
I don't dare prank her.

441
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,879
I'm not crying.

442
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,679
Putter.

443
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,599
Come play with me instead.

444
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,959
-Okay.
-We should let Mom go wash up.

445
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,599
She's been tired all day.

446
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,439
Stay with your dad.

447
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,919
-Okay.
-Okay.

448
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,959
I went to your old house.

449
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,439
But it's still closed. Where are you right now?

450
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,879
Soon,

451
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,239
You will know.

452
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,239
What are you thinking about?

453
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,479
I was thinking

454
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,159
if it wasn't for you then,

455
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,519
I don't know how I would get through those times :

456
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,599
I bought this house when l came to study for my master'shere.

457
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,959
Hey.

458
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,359
I never imagined i myself to live in a house overseas like this

459
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,599
Oh.

460
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,159
So,

461
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,279
the university to which we submitted the credit to be transferred to for both of yours

462
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,439
have replied back.

463
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,799
In that case,

464
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,799
we can start when the semester starts?

465
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,799
Yes.

466
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,399
You guys can study the language in the mean time.

467
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,599
But...

468
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,479
I'm still curious

469
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,439
why did we have to come all the way here?

470
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,479
If you're still in Thailand,

471
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,999
Peem will know no matter what.

472
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,599
To get revenge on Mr Peem Pattaratrakul

473
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,999
we need to be a new person

474
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,919
New person? How?

475
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,759
Someone who's powerful enough

476
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,799
to go against Peem

477
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:21,919
I understand.

478
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,839
I'm gonna go check upstairs

479
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,719
Your room is to the left.

480
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,638
Okay.

481
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,959
want to thankyou for helping us

482
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,158
I will not forget your gratitude

483
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,399
I promise

484
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,319
I will repay you

485
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,839
If you need my help in anything, please let me know.

486
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,319
It's okay.

487
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,639
Just you by my side

488
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,759
is considered repaying me.

489
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,199
Yes.

490
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,519
In the past,

491
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,119
I felt l was all alone

492
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,959
I have a father but feels like I don't.

493
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,679
My friends

494
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,799
especially Tat sided with Peem.

495
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,879
I'm proba bly a stranger to them.

496
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,519
So they all left me.

497
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,799
Whatever they think, just let them be

498
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,239
To me,

499
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,639
you're a good person.

500
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,079
Thank you so much

501
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,879
What are you going to do?

502
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,599
Do what?

503
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,519
At first,

504
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,479
I just wanted to defeat Peem.

505
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,639
But now,

506
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,799
I think l...

507
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,799
am falling for you.

508
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,479
Peem-Usa, the billionaire heirs are engaged!

509
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,519
Plub.

510
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,799
Vi kit.

511
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,239
Plub.

512
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,759
found out from Tong already.

513
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,039
What are you going to do?

514
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,479
I probably will keep the baby

515
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,799
and raise him the best that I can.

516
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,599
He is my child after all.

517
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,319
No matter what you decide.

518
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,199
I will always be on your side.

519
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,959
So,

520
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,479
do you still

521
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,759
want to get revenge on Peem?

522
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,399
I want to even more.

523
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,079
Then,

524
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,279
let's register our marriage.

525
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,519
I will be the father of this baby.

526
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,359
But...

527
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,919
Just in name.

528
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,239
Please don't say no.

529
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,639
Consider it revenge

530
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,959
am so grateful.

531
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,399
If I can go sell your gratefulness,

532
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,159
I think

533
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,159
I'd be very rich.

534
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,839
You've thanked me like a million times already.

535
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,959
Or two million may be

536
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,479
I am grateful.

537
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,559
You're the best decision

538
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,999
that I've ever made
