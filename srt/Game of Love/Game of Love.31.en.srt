1
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,359
Who's calling Mom?

2
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,479
Nobody.

3
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,879
Just my friend

4
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,919
Probably can't find the temple

5
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,359
I'll go talk to them

6
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,639
You stay and greet the guests

7
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,679
Where the hell have you been?!

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,599
I'm being hunted by the cops!

9
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,119
I know!

10
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,759
I have to escape.

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,199
If I don't get away, you won't get away either.

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,159
You need to bring me the money.

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,639
Sure.

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,039
How much do you want?

15
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,079
Five million.

16
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,479
No problem.

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,719
I'll see you soon

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,799
Pete.

19
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,159
Where did Aunt Su go?

20
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,679
Mom said

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,799
her friend got lost finding the place.

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,639
She probably went to go pick them up.

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,239
Is that so?

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,959
Pete.

25
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,079
Greet the guest

26
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,799
-Hello.
Hello.

27
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,919
This way please

28
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,839
Mr. Peem.

29
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,119
M r. Yot.

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,559
Hello.

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,399
My condolences to you again

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,519
Thank you.

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,319
M r. Yot.

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,239
Plub and Orn are over there

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,079
I'll take you to them

36
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,439
Okay.

37
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,119
Let's go.

38
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,879
Excuse me.

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,639
What is it?

40
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,719
Our IT tea m jus t got a ping on
Wasu's cell phone just now.

41
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,159
Where?

42
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,479
Excuse me then.

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,119
Sure.

44
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,759
Let's go.

45
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,359
Are you sure no one followed you?

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,079
I'm not stupid to let the police catch me

47
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,599
Where's my money?

48
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,799
You!

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,639
You tricked me here to get killed?

50
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,519
You messed this up.

51
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,879
It can't be helped.

52
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,039
You caused Puchong to die

53
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,599
You'even let the cops catch you in the act!

54
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,279
I have to nip it in the bud

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,759
before they trace it back to me!

56
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,519
Mrs. Su, calm down please

57
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,959
You know I work for Mr. Thaw ip

58
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,239
but why are you doing this?!

59
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,599
Did you forget

60
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,999
that I saved your life?

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,959
Not Mr. Thaw ip!

62
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,719
If it wasn't for my money

63
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,719
you would've been killed by those loan sharks!

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,999
Consider this..

65
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,679
even for the both of us!

66
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,599
Don't.

67
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,519
The truth is

68
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,599
1..

69
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,879
will regret your skills.

70
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,159
But it really can't be helped.

71
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,439
It's necessary

72
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,959
Do you hear me? It's necessary!

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,519
Do you hear me?!

74
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,719
Open the door.

75
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,839
Clear!

76
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,439
Follow me!

77
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,959
Go!

78
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,359
Split up and find the perpetrator

79
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,359
Yes, sir!

80
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,119
Yot is here!

81
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,119
M r. Yot.

82
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,439
How did it go?

83
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,399
When I got there

84
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,559
Was u already got silenced

85
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,119
Thank you for updating me

86
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,359
Peem.

87
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,599
I found out about Was u from Orn already

88
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,799
I'm so tired Plub

89
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,119
My grandmother once told me

90
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,559
no one can run from their karma.

91
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,319
Sooner or later

92
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,719
the wrongdoer will get their karma.

93
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,639
That's Mr. Thaw ip's right hand man.

94
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,359
What does Mom want with him?

95
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,079
Mom!

96
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,999
Peem...

97
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,319
Peem just called and said

98
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,759
Puchong!

99
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,959
I didn't even tell Mom about Dad yet

100
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,359
How did she know?

101
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,799
Pete.

102
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,879
It's late. You're not asleep yet?

103
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,839
Where have you been?

104
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,479
You disappeared before the monks did their recitals.

105
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,239
Oh.

106
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,959
Well,

107
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,519
when..

108
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,159
when I told you

109
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,039
that my friend got lost and couldn't find the temple

110
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,559
I went to go check on them.

111
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,999
But when I came back, the monks were done reciting

112
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,759
So I took them to go eat

113
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,239
Because they..

114
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,359
they came in from out of town

115
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,279
I'm now just finding out you have friends from out of town

116
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,039
They just moved there

117
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,999
Hey.

118
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,159
Why are you asking so many questions?

119
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,839
Is there a problem?

120
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,079
I have something to ask

121
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,239
What is it?

122
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,239
Did you know about Dad

123
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,639
before l told you?

124
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,479
Why are you asking that?

125
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,319
How would I know before you?

126
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,799
I found out when you told me

127
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,919
But from what I remember,

128
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,119
I didn't mention Dad yet.

129
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,479
But you knew already.

130
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,999
Well,

131
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,079
I saw you acting like that

132
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,479
So I took a guess

133
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,959
that something bad happened to him.

134
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,079
Really?

135
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,439
Then...

136
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,239
you also know this Was u guy?

137
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,799
Why are you asking me these questions?

138
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,879
Is something wrong?

139
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,919
I saw you talking to him once

140
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,279
Well,

141
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,679
I talk to him sometimes because

142
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,599
he's Mr. Thaw ip's right hand man

143
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,319
And we live close to each other.

144
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,639
Of course I talk to him.

145
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,719
What's strange about that?

146
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,279
Don't tell me

147
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,239
that...

148
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,199
you suspect me?

149
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,679
Did you do it?

150
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,199
Did you kill Dad?

151
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,719
Pete!

152
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,719
Why would you ask that?!

153
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,839
Why would I do it?!

154
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,239
Why would I kill Puchong?!

155
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,079
Puchong

156
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,879
was your father!

157
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,199
Are you suspicious of me?

158
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,359
You think I'm that evil?!

159
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,759
I'm just...

160
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,079
I'm just scared that you might commit a crime for me again.

161
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,359
Pete!

162
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,319
You have to believe me!

163
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,279
I would never do that!

164
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,759
You have to believe me Pete! You have to!

165
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,879
Yes Mom.

166
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,439
I believe you.

167
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,439
It's late.

168
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,759
Go get some rest.

169
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,359
Thank you so much

170
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,079
You go get some rest too.

171
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,479
Damnit!

172
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,199
Was u dying like this

173
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,959
Peem and the cops won't stop being suspicious of us.

174
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,519
Peem will keep trying to pursue the matter with us!

175
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,359
Dad, Peem is just misunderstanding you.

176
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,399
Can you stop siding with him?!

177
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,119
Peem is trying to put your mother in prison!
Do you not see it?!

178
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,879
Who do you think Was u worked for?

179
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,439
What the hell is going on?!

180
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,519
Those two have made up.

181
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,879
What do you mean?

182
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,199
The person who leaked their clip

183
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,199
was Mrs. Sup ang,

184
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,799
Peem's step mom.

185
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,319
And Mr s. Trepradu b

186
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,279
Plubpl a's older sister.

187
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,759
That means

188
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,839
they're getting back together?!

189
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,679
I won't let that happen.

190
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,719
I won't either.

191
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,719
Then we need to help each other.

192
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,319
I won't give Peem back to you Plubpl a!

193
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,679
I questioned Mrs. I Umpon and Mr. Thawipsome more.

194
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,279
But both still say

195
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,679
they know nothing about Was u's death.

196
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,199
Of course.

197
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,559
Who would admit so easily " I killed someone "?

198
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,439
Yeah.

199
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,239
If it's not them then who?

200
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,598
What can we do right now?

201
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,159
Even though we don't have evidence to arrest the two

202
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,439
but I had my guys keep an eye on them

203
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,879
way before Was u even died.

204
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,799
But..

205
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,879
no suspicious activities yet.

206
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,479
If Mr s. Umpon is really the perpetrator

207
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,119
why did she choose to attack when you and Mr. Puchong were suspicious of her?

208
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,239
You're telling me the perpetrator might be someone else?

209
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,799
I just don't want you to solely focus on Mr s. Umpon

210
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,519
If the perpetrator is someone else,

211
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,479
you might mess this up

212
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,199
Do you feel better?

213
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,519
Yeah.

214
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,279
I was just thinking

215
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,159
about what you said

216
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,719
If the perpetrator isn't Aunt Umpon and Mr. Thawip.

217
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,959
then it could be someone else.

218
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,399
Thank you

219
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,559
for reminding my conscience

220
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,519
I understand

221
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,239
I was irrational about Grandma too.

222
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,839
It made me misunderstand you

223
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,439
It's also

224
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,279
the one thing I feel most guilty about til this day

225
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,159
I also

226
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,119
am getting karma from my actions

227
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,919
Plub.

228
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,679
I don't want you to mess it up like me

229
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,799
I won't.

230
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,999
I will find the perpetrator

231
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,999
that killed my father

232
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,879
I believe you can do it.

233
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,919
Thank you Plubpl a

234
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,519
for staying by my side

235
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,479
Without you,

236
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,319
I don't know

237
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,479
how lill get through this

238
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,959
Hey.

239
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,399
You have to stay strong

240
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,119
There's still a lot of things you need to do for Mr, Puchong.

241
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,959
I will stay strong for Dad

242
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,319
Plub

243
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,319
How...

244
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,799
How long were you here?

245
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,279
Just a minute ago.

246
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,759
I miss you and our son

247
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,759
Regarding your dad's funeral.

248
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,959
I et me know if there's anything I can do to help

249
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,079
Pluband Iare happy to help

250
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,599
You should go inside

251
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,599
I'm about to leave.

252
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,119
Okay.

253
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,319
Let's go.

254
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,279
Yes.

255
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,599
Vi kit!

256
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,119
Where did you go with Peem?!

257
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,559
Putter.

258
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,799
Let's go to your room.

259
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,399
Well Plub?!

260
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,959
Where did you go?!

261
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,199
Was u,

262
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,519
the gun man who killed Mr. Puchong

263
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,959
was murdered!

264
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,799
So I went to go talk to the police with Peem.

265
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,359
How are you involved?!

266
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,959
I was worried about Peem

267
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,399
Why are you worried about him?!

268
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,639
You have the right to do that?!

269
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,839
Let go! You're hurting me!

270
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,039
Peem isn't your husband.

271
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,959
am.

272
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,119
I'm your lawful husband

273
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,599
The person you married!

274
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,919
The father of your son!

275
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,079
For the past years,

276
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,519
I've respected you by never touching you!

277
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,239
Because I thought that one day

278
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,559
you would love me.

279
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,439
Why would I do that?

280
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,959
What did I get in return?!

281
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,759
I'm sorry.

282
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,639
I don't want an apology

283
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,159
But I want you!

284
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,039
Vi kit!

285
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,759
What are you -- Vi kit!

286
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,799
Hey!

287
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,319
-Vi kit!
-Kit!

288
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,919
Peem!

289
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,399
You have no right to do this to Plub pla!

290
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,719
Of course l do!

291
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,839
I'm Plubp la's husband!

292
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,639
Vi kit!

293
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,679
Peem!

294
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,279
Stop Vi kit!

295
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,599
Kit!

296
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,239
Peem! Vikit! Stop!

297
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,599
Hey!

298
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,879
Peem! Vikit!

299
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,119
Vi kit!

300
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,279
Peem!

301
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,719
Peem! Vikit! Stop!

302
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,799
Peem!

303
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,319
Go wait outside!

304
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,999
But.

305
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,999
I'll handle it.

306
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,079
Pl ub, I--

307
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,119
You really want me to love you?

308
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,119
When will you people understand?

309
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,439
There isn't a woman in this world

310
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,039
that will love someone that forces themselves on her.

311
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,279
By you doing this

312
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,479
I probably can't love you.

313
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,359
Plub.

314
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,559
I'm sorry.

315
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,359
You should leave

316
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,279
I want to be alone

317
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,439
Kit!

318
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,559
Don't do that to Plub pla again!

319
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,359
P lub is my lawful wife

320
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,239
You have no right to give me orders.

321
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,759
Understand it correctly.

322
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,839
Marriage

323
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,199
doesn't mean you own someone

324
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,319
or can hurt the person you'remarried to

325
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,239
Even though you're the lawful husband!

326
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,959
physically or emotionally, you have no right to hurt Plubpl a!

327
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,199
I will take Plubp la and my son back!

328
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,679
It won't be that easy.

329
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,719
I won't allow it!

330
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,839
I also won't allow Plubp la and my son

331
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,839
to live with someone like you either.

332
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,559
Once Dad's situation is done with

333
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,279
you and our son will be my first priority, Plubpl a

334
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,199
Dad!

335
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,759
Thank you

336
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,439
for doing so much for me, Puchong.

337
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,359
Puchong!

338
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,839
Leaving me and our son like this,

339
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,999
how are we going to live now?!

340
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,079
Don't worry.

341
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,119
Since you love Mane ewan so much that you're willing to risk your life to save hers,

342
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,999
I will send her to go be with you!

343
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,239
I'm sorry Dad.

344
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,279
I might not have been a good sonin the past

345
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,639
But I love you.

346
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,319
Puchong!

347
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,399
Don't worry Dad

348
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,119
I will take care of our family

349
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,399
I will find the perpetrator

350
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,079
that made you die and have them be punished

351
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,759
Dad.

352
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,599
Mom didn't really do it right?

353
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,119
I can'trust her, right?

354
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,679
If Mom really did it,

355
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,919
What do I do?

356
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,079
What should I do?

357
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,999
Pete.

358
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,439
You miss Dad?

359
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,919
I miss him too.

360
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,239
I haven't been a good son to him

361
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,679
Me too.

362
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,039
Dad was the type that.

363
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,839
was stubborn

364
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,319
and wasn't great at showing his love

365
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,199
But he loved us very much

366
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,199
You know that?

367
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,239
Good.

368
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,639
Peem.

369
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,279
Im really sorry on Mom's behalf about the clip

370
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,359
It's in the past now

371
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,559
No matter how mad I am

372
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,639
I can't go back and fix it.

373
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,599
Peem.

374
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,999
Don't stress about it

375
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,479
Aunt Su is your mother.

376
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,759
I understand.

377
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,759
Don't stay up late

378
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,479
Peem!

379
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,759
What?

380
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,679
Pete!

You have to believe me! You have to!

384
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,639
Nothing.

385
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,319

00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,479

424
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,359
all the remaining shares and all rights to manage the company,

425
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,759
I hereby give it to Mr. Peem Pattaratrakul.

426
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,199
I hereby certify that while l am writing this will.

427
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,359
I did it voluntarily

428
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,479
and have complete awareness in every respect.

429
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,679
Therefore, I signed my name as evidence in front of the witnesses.

430
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,039
What the hell kind of will is this?!

431
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,199
It's unfair!

432
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,439
Nobody writes their will like this!

433
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,879
Pete should be given equal shares.

434
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,439
Mom calm down

435
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,879
How can I calm down?!

436
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,759
We don't know if that's the real will or not!

437
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,359
If you want to inspect the will, you can

438
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,519
Oh I will.

439
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,679
Don't worry!

440
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:59,119
We can confirm that the content of the will iswhat Mr. Puchong wrote.

441
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,839
But Pete is also his son!

442
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,879
Why is he giving more to the oldest son?

443
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,479
This isn't fair!

444
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,759
This is Mr. Puchong's assets.

445
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,679
Whoever he gives it to,

446
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,359
how much to any child,

447
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,159
is his rights.

448
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,199
Easy for you to say.

449
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,879
You guys got more than us.

450
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,959
That's enough Mom

451
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,879
If you're not satisfied

452
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,039
you can sue.
