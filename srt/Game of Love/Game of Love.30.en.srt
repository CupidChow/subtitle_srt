1
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,639
I already sent a bouquet to Aunt Ump on to see her reaction just like you asked me to.

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,239
Yeah.

3
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,719
But...

4
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,479
she has n't made a move yet.

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,159
The only way we can do is threaten the culprit to confess.

6
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,519
Mane ewan isn't dead yet?

7
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,719
How can that be?!

8
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,159
Peem, Mr. Puchong,you're here early

9
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,439
Yes.

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,199
Mr, Thaw ip left for work already?

11
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,159
Yes.

12
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,479
There's a meeting with his political party today.

13
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,639
What's the matter?

14
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,199
I have something to talk to you about.

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,199
Sure, What is it?

16
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,239
Over-ten years ago,

17
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,479
before my mom disappeared,

18
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,479
she went to Rayong with you, didn't she?

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,479
Yes.

20
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,759
Who told you this?

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,079
My mom.

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,519
Mane ewan is back.

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,199
Pardon me

24
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,759
Why have you never told me and Peem about this?

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,079
Because I thought Mane ewan doesn't want anyone to find her.

26
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,319
So I didn't.

27
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,679
It isn't because you're scared people will suspect

28
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,679
you killed Mane ewan?

29
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,519
What are you talking about?!

30
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,759
Something happened to her?

31
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,319
Yes,

32
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,039
Someone tried to kill my mom

33
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,919
so she had to go into hiding

34
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,439
But she didn't die

35
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,439
-The person she suspects

36
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,279
is you.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,319
Mane ewan is really alive!

38
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,719
What do you want me to do?

39
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,799
Right now,

40
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,959
they are suspect in g Umpon

41
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,759
We should use this opportunity

42
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,759
to successfully get rid of Mane ewan.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,759
Okay.

44
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,559
Yes.

45
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,359
I was suspicious

46
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,079
that Mane ewan was having an affair with Mr. Thaw ip

47
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,799
Hmm?

48
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,439
An affair?

49
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,479
Yes.

50
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,279
But after that we came to an understanding

51
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,959
I left back to Bangkok

52
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,159
and then later found out she took off

53
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,959
I was very upset

54
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,799
I thought she lied to me and was ashamed of herself so she took off.

55
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,679
I wasn't really trying to kill her.

56
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,479
How can we believe you?

57
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,919
I know that my words

58
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,239
aren't believable to the two of you

59
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,519
But if there's proof

60
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,679
that lam the culprit

61
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,398
you can come arrest me.

62
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,799
I won't run away.

63
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,119
Do you think Aunt Ump on was telling the truth?

64
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,599
We won't know until Man ee remembers more.

65
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,999
What if the culprit isn't Aunt Ump on

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,719
then who can it be?

67
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,279
Mom.

68
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,399
Yes Mom?

69
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,559
Peem.

70
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,799
Are you and your father available today?

71
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,799
I need to talk to you guys.

72
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,559
Yes.

73
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,559
We will go to you right now.

74
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,799
Mom called and said

75
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,199
she needed to talk to us

76
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,759
Let's go then.

77
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,079
All done?

78
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,799
Let's go.

79
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,839
What is it?

80
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,759
Where are you?

81
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,759
You can go wait upstairs first

82
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,559
I'll be right up soon

83
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,839
So people won't notice.

84
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,559
It looks like Mr s. Umpon is suspicious now

85
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,119
that Mr. Thaw ip is having an affair

86
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,439
So you're trying to find a scapegoat?

87
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,039
Yes.

88
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,279
If Mr s. Umpon still doesn't know who it is,

89
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,479
she won't stop stalking him.

90
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,639
Here.

91
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,679
Give this to Mr s. Umpon.

92
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,999
Most importantly

93
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,359
I will use this opportunity

94
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,519
to get rid of the thorn in my heart like Mane ewan!

95
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,719
I know you've always had another woman!

96
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,719
But I never thought it would be Mane ewan!

97
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,319
What is your problem?

98
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,079
Your mistress is Mane ewan isn't it?!

99
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,119
Are you crazy?!

100
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,639
Where did you get this crazy idea from?!

101
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,959
You won't tell me the truth?!

102
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,799
Stop being ridiculous!

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,319
It was just a coincidence.

104
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,319
We coincidentally met at a hotel!

105
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:31,959
Fine!

106
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,399
If you won't tell me the truth,

107
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,639
then l'llget the truth from Mane ewan!

108
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,879
If it's not you,

109
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,319
then who is this woman?!

110
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,439
Huh?!

111
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,159
Who is she?!

112
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,599
Finish the job.

113
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,239
If you succeed,

114
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,959
I'll wire you the money.

115
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,039
I messed up once.

116
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,719
This time, I won't mess up again!

117
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,199
It's pra pai dessert that you like.

118
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,599
You remember now?!

119
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,679
Actually I remembered you

120
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,038
from our first meeting.

121
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,039
I'm sorry

122
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,799
that I lied.

123
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,359
I understand.

124
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,919
You must hate me very much

125
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,919
l admit

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,319
that I still can't forgive you.

127
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,639
But I'm trying.

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,479
I intend

129
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,999
to forgive you.

130
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,879
Someday

131
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,519
we will be good friends

132
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,599
and do our jobs as parents

133
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,799
for our son.

134
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,479
l would appreciate that very much

135
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,159
I know that

136
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,159
throughout the past

137
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,199
I've done you and our son wrong

138
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,799
I'm not sure that in this life

139
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,959
I would be able to pay it all back or not

140
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,439
This wouldn't happen to you if it wasn't because of me

141
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,159
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,639
I really am sorry.

143
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,479
You too Peem

144
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,839
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,839
I know that in the past I wasn't a good father to you

146
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,439
As...

147
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,879
As long as you've repented

148
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,279
I'm no longer mad at you

149
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,319
I know

150
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,359
our family

151
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,399
can't go back to the way it was anymore.

152
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,999
But I'm happy

153
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,319
I'm very happy

154
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,519
that today

155
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,119
the three of us

156
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,159
are all together again

157
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,959
Just this...

158
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,319
I can rest in peace now without any concern

159
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,879
No Dad.

160
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,959
Today is a good day.

161
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,319
Why would you say something like that?

162
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,239
I'm just happy

163
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,119
I'm really happy

164
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,399
Maybe some other day

165
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,999
we...

166
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,719
should meet up again because I have..

167
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,319
two important people l want to introduce to you both

168
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,239
Let me guess.

169
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,599
One of them is.

170
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,639
Plub?

171
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,479
Hmm?

172
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,319
What about the other person?

173
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,279
The other person.

174
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,879
If l tell you,

175
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,439
it wouldn't be a surprise.

176
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,559
But I'm the happiest today

177
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,119
Both you and our son are already busy with work

178
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,999
You came here as soon as I called you

179
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,239
Thank you so much.

180
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,639
Iim the one that has to thank you for thinking of me

181
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,679
I'll go wait in the car.

182
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,239
Mom.

183
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,479
See you soon.

184
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,319
Bye.

185
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,079
I want to wish you

186
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,439
and Mr. Dec h

187
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,999
to have lots of happiness together

188
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,919
Puchong.

189
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,399
I'm being sincere

190
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,159
He's a very good person.

191
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,719

220
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,559

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,679

225
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,039

How's it going?

238
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,279
The officials are doing an autopsy on my dad right now

239
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,079
And...

240
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,879

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,279
She's under police protection right now

242
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,199
The culprit was trying to kill her.

243
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,279
But my dad saved her life

244
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,919
Dad and I

245
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,279
just recently reconciled.

246
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,559
I just got my family back

247
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,879
We've only just been together for a short while.

248
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,799
Why did this have to happen?!

249
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,759
Peem...

250
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,759
Why did this have to happen?

251
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,359
Calm down.

252
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,399

253
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,239

257
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,959
What happened? Why did Dad get shot?!

258
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,199
Who hurt him?!

259
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,279
Yeah.

260
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,119
What did the police say?

261
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,119
Do they know who the culprit is?

262
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,799
Do you know who did it?

263
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,679
Sa.

264
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,399
Where's your mom?!

265
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,599
Pardon?

266
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,719
I asked where is your mom?!

267
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,239
At home

268
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,159
-Peem!
-Come with me!

269
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,639
Peem! Where are you taking me?!
-Peem!

270
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,799
He must be on his way to see Mr s. Umpon.

271
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,799
Quickly follow him!

272
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,159
Peem!

273
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,399
-Sa!
-Pete!

274
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,959
Don't follow them!

275
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,199
What is going on Mom?!

276
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,639
Peem!

277
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,799
What's wrong?!

278
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,319
Let me go! You're hurting me!

279
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,359
Peem!

280
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,359
-Sa!
-Why did you kill my dad?!

281
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,719
Hold on Peem

282
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,999
What's going on?

283
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,039
You're an elder that I love and respect.

284
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,479
Ever since my mom disappeared,

285
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,399
I thought you would have mercy on me that my mom left me!

286
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,319
But all of it was ailie!

287
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,679
Peem.

288
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,519
I really don't know what you're talking about.

289
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,519
You have the nerves to deny it?!

290
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,759
You were trying to kill my mom

291
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,239
but instead killed my father!

292
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,959
Dad, what's going on?

293
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,199
I don't know.

294
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,559
Peem.

295
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,199
Why would I do that?

296
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,079
Why would I kill Mr, Puchong?!

297
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,559
Yeah.

298
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,319
Maybe you misunderstood something.

299
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,199
You already know what the reason is!

300
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,199
But you must be disappointed

301
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,239
that my mom isn't dead!

302
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,399
Wait Peem.

303
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,039
Don't accuse us like this

304
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,199
I can sue you!

305
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,239
Go ahead!

306
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,719
I'm not scared of you guys!

307
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,439
I will put all of you in prison!

308
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,599
Peem! Stop!

309
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,319
-Let Mom go!
-Peem!

310
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,359
Peem! Calm down!

311
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,959
Peem!

312
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,559
We don't have proof! They can sue us!

313
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,639
I don't care! I'm putting them in prison!

314
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,999
-Peem!
-Calm down!

315
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,919
Pull yourself together Peem!

316
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,159
You doing this wil I just escalate more problems!

317
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,759
Yeah!

318
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,279
Peem.

319
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,439
You still have things to do for Mr Puchong

320
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,759
Calm down.

321
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,119
We should leave

322
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,839
Let's go Peem.

323
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,559
-Peem.
-Usa.

324
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,559
Oh.

325
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,479
Yot.

326
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,839
Excuse me.

327
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,519
Hello.

328
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,319
We're here from the Central Investigation Bureau.

329
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,799
We got assigned to work on Mr. Puchong's murder case.

330
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,239
We are here to take the suspect in for questioning

331
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,119
Hold on.

332
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,919
Who's the suspect you're referring to?

333
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,119
We have traced the incident from Cc TV footage at the scene.

334
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,879
We found Was u,

335
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,079
the suspect.

336
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,159
He's the gun man who shot Mr, Puchong

337
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,719
Was u?

338
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,079
Yes.

339
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,439
We are searching for him at the moment

340
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,679
I'd like to ask you

341
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,999
and Mr s. Umpon

342
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,959
to go in for questioning

343
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,679
What?!

344
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,679
They know who the gunman is?!

345
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,559
Peem told me

346
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,359
they're on their way to the station for questioning

347
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,599
He asked us to take care of Dad's situation here.

348
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,319
So who is the culprit?

349
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,719
Peem said

350
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,479
it was Mr. Thaw ip's assistant

351
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,839
A guy named Was u

352
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,839
Hey.

353
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,839
What's wrong Mom?

354
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,039
I'm fine.

355
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,559
I suddenly feel.

356
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,559
dizzy and sick

357
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,959
Is it serious?

358
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,599
No.

359
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,039
I'mprobably stressed about your father.

360
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,359
Can you..

361
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,079
handle things here?

362
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,039
I need to go rest

363
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,239
Sure.

364
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,439
I think

365
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,039
it's going to be a while

366
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,359
You can go rest.

367
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,999
I'll walk you out

368
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,719
No, that's okay!

369
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,959
I can go on my own

370
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,879
It's okay.

371
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:30,919
Mom.

372
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,479
Why are you here?

373
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,119
The police called me in for questioning

374
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,359

375
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,879

You don't look happy to see me

380

Are you disappointed?

381
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,599
You're misunderstanding

382
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,519
- I can explain.
- That will be unnecessary

383
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,959
Explain yourself to the police.

384
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,439
Let's go.

385
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,399
The number you dialed can not be reached.

386
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,479
Please dial again

387
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,919
The number you dialed can not be reached.

388
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,519
Please dial again

389
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,679
Where the hell is he?!

390
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,279
This is a footage from Cc TV in an area at Mr. Dec h's orchard

391
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,599
It caught the culprit very clear

392
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,639
That is Was u.

393
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,599
How can it be him?

394
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,719
This man...

395
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,639
What about him?

396
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,679
Mom.

397
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,599
Don't hurt me!

398
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,479
Don't follow me!

399
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,919
Don't hurt me!

400
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,479
It's you!

401
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,479
Who sent you here?!

402
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,199
Was it Ump on?!

403
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,239
Don't!

404
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,319
Stop!

405
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,279
I remember now Peem!

406
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,759
This man was the culprit

407
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,919
that tried to kill me over ten years ago.

408
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,559
Peem.

409
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,119
How did it go?

410
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,239
Thank you for your cooperation.

411
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,119
No problem.

412
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,399
You're just doing your job

413
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,159
Peem!

414
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,879
Stop!

415
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,199
Usa.

416
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,399
Let's go home

417
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,719
Was u is Mr. Tahwip's assistant.

418
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,319
It's obvious the person that hired him is Aunt Ump on.

419
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,199
Or maybe Mr. Thaw ip was in on this too. Why did you let them go?!

420
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,239
We don't have enough evidence

421
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,119
to connect it to Mrs. Umpon and Mr, Thawip

422
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,239
Evidence?

423
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,119
A person is dead! What more evidence do you need?!

424
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,439
Peem.

425
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,439
Calm down son

426
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,999
The police are doing their best.

427
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,519
Yes Peem.

428
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,679
Mr. Thaw ip is a powerful man.

429
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,519
Whatever you do, you need to stay calm.

430
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,039
Don't worry about it.

431
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,959
I will quickly find Was u and bring him in.

432
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,279
I'm sorry M r. Yot.

433
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,999
I just want to quickly catch the culprit who killed my father.

434
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,279
l understand

435
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,239
If you'll excuse me now.

436
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,479
Thank you Yot.

437
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,159
What is it Pete?

438
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,839
Sure.

439
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,439
I'm on my way to the temple.

440
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,159
See you there.

441
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,759
They're done with the autopsy.

442
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,239
We can proceed with his funeral.

443
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,839
Pete is taking Dad to the temple at the moment

444
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,839
We should get going then.

445
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,039
Wait Mom

446
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,559
I think you shouldn't go

447
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,559
Why not?

448
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,839
You're still a target for the culprit right now.

449
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,079
Until we're certain that place is safe,

450
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,599
I think you should go stay at the safe house with the police

451
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,879
Please look after her Mr. Dec h

452
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,079
Plub.

453
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,039
You and Orn can leave too.

454
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,879
But.

455
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,079
Don't forget

456
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,719
you're still considered

457
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,919
Kit's wife right now.

458
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,319
I know you're worried about me

459
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,319
but I'm worried about you too.

460
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,119
I don't want people to think bad of you.

461
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,679
Okay.

462
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,879
Tat.

463
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,399
We should go.

464
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,319
Okay

465
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,959
In times like this.

466
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,919
you must want to be by Peem's side huh?

467
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,039
Why don't you just get back with him?

468
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,079
Finish handling the situation with Kit.

469
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,959
I know you don't love him.

470
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,679
Most importantly.

471
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,999
you and him are married in name only.

472
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,839
Look Orn.

473
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,359
It's not as easy as you make it seem.

474
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,479
I'ma mother now.

475
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,279
The first person l must consider is my child!

476
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,759
You want me to tell Putter that

477
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,719
Vik it isn't his real father.

478
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,639
How sad do you think Putter will be?

479
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,679
May be you're over thinking this.

480
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,319
I don't mean that Putter's feelings aren't important.

481
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,119
But sometimes kids understand things easier than adults.

482
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,519
I'm scared.

483
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,519
Most importantly

484
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,439
Vik it is my benefactor.

485
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,359
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

486
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,159
You don't want to hurt other people's feelings

487
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,999
but would rather hurt your own feelings?

488
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,679
Gosh Plub!

489
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,679
Hello.

490
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,799
Sure. See you soon

491
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,079
What's wrong?

492
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,559
Vi kit said

493
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,639
he will take me to Mr, Puchong's service.

494
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,479
Then l'lldrop you off at home.

495
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,039
Hello.

496
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,239
My condolences

497
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,439
Uncle Peem!

498
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,519
Putter,

499
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,319
Stay with me.

500
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,839
Thank you Kit for coming

501
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,119
This morning

502
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:44,319
Plub went to give her moral support for us

503
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,039
when she's not even family

504
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,959
I'm touched.

505
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,959
Sa!

506
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,759
As Dad's daughter in law.

507
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,159
I just want to thank Plub

508
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,679
No problem.

509
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,799
Mr. Puchong was my benefactor.

510
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,999
Let me know if you need my help with anything

511
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,799
Let's go.

512
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,839
Let's go inside.

513
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,759
Sa.

514
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,079
This is my dad's funeral service.

515
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,319
Try to be respectful!

516
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,959
Why?

517
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,439
What about Plubpl a showing up when it's not even her job?

518
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,039
Who gave me respect?

519
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,158
Putter.

520
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,919
Pay your respect to Grandpa

521
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,359
This is him Dad!

522
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,479
My other important person I wanted you to meet

523
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,719
Putter is your grandson.

524
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,999
Let's go.

525
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,039
Isn't this your father's funeral service?

526
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,759
Try to be considerate.

527
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,439
Mom, Dad.

528
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,599
Why are you here?!

529
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,479
I came to prove my innocence

530
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,599
Thank you for daring to come.

531
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,399
I've done nothing wrong

532
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,879
Why should I be scared?

533
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,959
If it wasn't you

534
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,959
or anyone close to you

535
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,479
I am praying that the police catches Was u soon.

536
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,199
I will believe you

537
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,999
when Was u says that

538
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,719
you're not involved in this matter.

539
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,399
I'm happy

540
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,879
that you're back

541
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,999
But judging from your face

542
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,399
it's the opposite of happy

543
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,679
Mom.

544
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,159
Go pay your respect.

545
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,399
You see?

546
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,959
I told you not to come.

547
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,679
If we don't come, people will suspect us even more

548
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,119
Mom is right Dad

549
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,039
Go have a seat

550
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,879
That's Peem's mother?

551
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,999
Yes.

552
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,599
These people make me angry.

553
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,119
It has n't been long since her return.

554
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,199
Mane ewan is already acting unctuous!

555
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,439
You need to be careful Pete

556
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,559
Don't let Peem

557
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,919
take all the inheritance and rights at the company for himself

558
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,879
Got it?!

559
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,399
Hey.

560
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,359
Dad just died.

561
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,039
You're thinking about this already?

562
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,079
I have be cautious first!

563
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,079
Who's calling?
