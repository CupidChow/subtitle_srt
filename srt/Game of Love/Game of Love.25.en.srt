1
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,439
What?

2
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,359
You're going to have Sako o move back to Thailand for his studies?

3
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,079
Yes!

4
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,479
We don't have the money to pay for his studies abroad anymore.

5
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,719
There's his tuition,

6
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,159
his accommodation,

7
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,479
and babysitter too.

8
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,119
But...

9
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,319
he just went there for only a year.

10
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,319
In Thailand,

11
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,239
there are a lot of international schools for him too.

12
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,559
It's best that we bring him back here

13
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,559
In that case,

14
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,159
why don't you ask your parents to help?

15
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,959
He's their only grandchild

16
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,679
I thought they love him?

17
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,159
They should help him.

18
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,839
Tre.

19
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,319
My parents

20
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,039
helped me a lot already

21
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,759
Ever since the company started having problems

22
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,359
they've been helping out financially

23
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,799
I don't want to bother them again

24
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,879
This is embarrassing if anyone were to find out

25
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,439
How do I face the other parents?

26
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,279
Huh?!

27
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,359
Do you want to sell your handbags

28
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,399
that you've collected?

29
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,759
You can help me pay for our son's tuition with that.

30
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,919
Are you crazy?!

31
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,439
You can't sell a lot with used bags

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,799
It won't be enough

33
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,119
Then choose.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,639
If you're embarrassed to have him come back to Thailand for school,

35
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,359
then help me make money to pay for his tuition and other expenses

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,639
Hey.

37
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,839
Su thee!

38
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,479
Hey!

39
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,919
Gosh!

40
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,039
Where do I get the money?!

41
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,279
Just thinking about makes me pissed at Plubpl a

42
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,159
Instead of helping me,

43
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,639
you want me to get a job?!

44
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,999
Ungrateful sister!

45
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,959
Hey.

46
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,319
Don't do this.

47
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,319
Go get changed.

48
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,879
This shirt is ugly

49
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,519
Okay?

50
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,799
Can I not change?

51
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,519
Hey, don't be stubborn.

52
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,319
Or else I'm gonna kiss you.

53
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,599
I won't change!

54
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,839
That's enough

55
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,719
Someone might see

56
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,159
Who's that?!

57
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,759
Tong!

58
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,479
The meeting room is ready Mr. Su thee.

59
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,759
They're here Dad

60
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,919
-Hello.
-Hello.

61
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,879
What do you want us to do today Uncle?

62
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,279
In the kitchen again?

63
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,479
I'm ready.

64
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,399
Not anymore.

65
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,679
You just have to answer my question

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,239
What's your question?

67
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,999
From my experience in the food business

68
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,359
the problem with franchise restaurant is that

69
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,679
the main restaurant will be crowded with customers almost every day.

70
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,759
But once it's turned into a franchise, it goes south

71
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,679
Because of easy accessibility

72
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,359
and much easier to make a living from

73
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,079
Devaluing the main restaurant.

74
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,639
I'll be honest.

75
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,119
This is the main issue my father has

76
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,399
If one of you can answer my father,

77
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,959
my father will choose that company

78
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,399
We will resolve the issue

79
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,839
by making the restaurant special

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,399
and different from the franchise.

81
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,839
Special?

82
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,759
Yes.

83
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,359
The main restaurant must be different and way special

84
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,559
Whether it's the menu or inside decor.

85
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,159
Even with the seasonal menu,

86
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,319
the main restaurant must be more special than the franchise.

87
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,799
Therefore, the franchise is like a place where we allow customers to try our food first.

88
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,799
Then forward it to the main restaurant

89
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,239
To put it simple,

90
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,799
the franchise

91
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,639
will be an advertising point that makes people want to come and eat at the main restaurant.

92
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,039
These two have very similar answer

93
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,039
So who are you going to pick as the winner?

94
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,559
I can't decide yet

95
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,319
Oh

96
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,559
It depends on who will give us a better offer, no?

97
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,359
True.

98
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,839
I'm sorry.

99
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,159
I can't help you

100
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,399
Why not?

101
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,239
Even though Peem is my business rival

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,199
but him and I used to be best friends.

103
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,679
I know he loves you very much Pete.

104
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,679
Most importantly

105
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,319
I don't want to see two brothers fighting over the inheritance.

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,679
I might not have siblings

107
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,399
but it's pathetic to see

108
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,639
You can leave.

109
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,159
I'll pretend you didn't come see me today

110
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,679
It's not about the inheritance.

111
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,119
It's about something else

112
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,719
O just

113
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,719
want to show someone that

114
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,479
I'm just as worthy as Peem

115
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,759
The only way

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,399
I can show that person

117
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,319
is to beat Peem

118
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,919
Just once.

119
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,199
That is all.

120
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,319
Did you have fun today?

121
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,319
You look so cool Uncle Peem!

122
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,399
Do you like it?

123
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,599
Do you want to sit on it?

124
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,759
Yes

125
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,439
You can't Putter!

126
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,239
Hey!

127
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,999
You followed me here?

128
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,359
What do you mean follow?

129
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,439
You saw that I've been cutting in front of your car so many times.

130
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,199
Don't make excuses.

131
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,759
This is a coincidence

132
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,319
Putter.

133
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,319
Do you want to take a ride with me to go eat at that l ice cream shop over there?

134
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,399
Yes!

135
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,079
Come!

136
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,559
You can't Putter!

137
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,559
But I want to ride on Uncle Peem's cool bike.

138
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,839
It's cool right?

139
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,479
Women don't understand what men like, right?

140
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,319
You see?

141
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,319
Hey.

142
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,319
Are you trying to lure my son with your motorcycle?

143
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,399
Hey.

144
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,919
Why would I do that?

145
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,279
You can't Putter.

146
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,239
The bike is big

147
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,159
It's dangerous.

148
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,159
I can just go eat ice cream then

149
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,399
Come.

150
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,399
Let's go eat ice cream.

151
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,839
Don't!

152
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,959
Don't bother my son!

153
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,719
Don't hit Uncle Peem

154
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,639
I didn't hit him!

155
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,759
It was just a tap

156
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,879
Putter.

157
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,119
I'm hurt.

158
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,879
Can you blow on the wound for me?

159
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,279
Presto!

160
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,639
Wow!

161
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,399
I'm cured.

162
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,239
You're so kind. Thank you.

163
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,999
Uncle Peem is cured now.

164
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,399
I told you don't bother my son.

165
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,639
Okay.

166
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,919
Then,

167
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,919
take him to go eat ice cream

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,959
Putter,

169
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,719
I have errands to do.

170
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,679
You go eat ice cream with your mom.

171
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,199
Okay.

172
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,799
You...

173
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,359
should take him to that ice cream shop over there.

174
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,679
I'm taking off now. Bye!

175
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,959
Bye!

176
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,439
Enjoy your ice cream.

177
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,839
I want this one

178
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,719
Sure. Wait one moment.

179
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,519
Okay.

180
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,239
Whose license plate is TT9887?

181
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,399
Mine.

182
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,399
What's the matter?

183
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,719
Your car got hit from the back.
You should go check it out.

184
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,519
I can watch him

185
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,199
You should go check your car.

186
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,479
Please watch him then.

187
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,279
Putter.

188
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,239
Stay here. Don't go anywhere

189
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,119
Okay.

190
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,479
This way.

191
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,759
She left.

192
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,239
Uncle Peem!

193
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,999
Where?

194
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,359
I don't see any marks.

195
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,919
I saw it earlier

196
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,919
I guess it's gone.

197
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,359
See if there's any dent somewhere else.

198
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,319
Go ahead.

199
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,879
Before you eat,did you clean your mouth yet? You'll get tooth decay.

200
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,959
Not yet.

201
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,959
Is it okay if I clean it for you?

202
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,799
Okay.

203
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,039
Open your mouth.

204
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,999
Good job!

205
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,359
Come.

206
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,519
I'll clean your mouth.

207
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,999
There's nothing.

208
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,279
I really did see them hit your car.

209
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,279
Maybe it's on the side.

210
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,359
Check first.

211
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,159
The other side.

212
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,759
Miss!

213
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,759
Oh, you're back.

214
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,519
How's your car?

215
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,519
It's fine.

216
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,199
I guess it was a misunderstanding

217
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,759
Oh.

218
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,959
Did anyone come see Putter while l was gone?

219
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,079
No.

220
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,519
What's the matter?

221
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,599
Nothing.

222
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,119
I can't accept it

223
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,519
I don't know what you're doing Mr Peem

224
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,119
but I'm sure you have your reason.

225
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,119
I just wanted to help you.

226
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,719
Thank you so much.

227
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,119
Okay.

228
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,119
If there's no more questions

229
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,119
that'll be all for today

230
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,079
Can you let Mr. Vi kit and Mr. Mark know?

231
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,279
Yes.

232
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,079
Alright everyone

233
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,279
Take a break.

234
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,839
Thank you so much.

235
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,239
Wait Tong

236
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,639
Can I talk to you?

237
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,479
Tong.

238
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,879
What you saw earlier

239
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,879
it's a misunderstanding.

240
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,479
Just tell me the truth.

241
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,919
Don't lie to me.

242
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,399
Okay.

243
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,999
Since you know

244
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,999
we'll tell you the truth

245
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,959
Su thee and I

246
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,559
have been in love for a long time.

247
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,279
Hey!

248
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,959
We can't hide it anymore.

249
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,359
We have to accept it

250
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,279
Right.

251
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,639
You have to accept the truth.

252
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,639
To be honest

253
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,199
don't hate the fact you guys are in love.

254
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,359
But...

255
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,919
can you be fair to my sister?

256
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,519
You don't like women, why marry one?!

257
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,318
Tong, it's...

258
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,159
...

259
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,039
His parents forced him to

260
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,639
I don't want to be this way To ng.

261
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,159
But..

262
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,759
my parents

263
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,759
want me to have children

264
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,399
That reason.

265
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,559
is freaking selfish!

266
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,199
Do you realize

267
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,159
you're destroying a woman's life?!

268
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,959
Destroying how?

269
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,039
The reason your sister married Su thee

270
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,759
was because of money.

271
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,239
Not love.

272
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,959
Once his parents offered her money,

273
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,479
she said yes to the marriage

274
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,639
They didn't even know each other then.

275
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,719
Whatever your reason to get married is...

276
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,999
never mind.

277
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,639
But you shouldn't deceive my sister like this.

278
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,719
Tong.

279
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,839
I know I'm wrong

280
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,119
I'm sorry.

281
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,839
Can you not tell Tre about this?

282
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,119
For Sako o'ssake.

283
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,439
I don't want him to have problems

284
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,199
Yeah.

285
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,719
For my nephew's sake.

286
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,599
Then...

287
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,199
I'll give you time to make a decision.

288
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,439
If you continue to keep this a secret,

289
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,839
stop fooling with him

290
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,199
Go take care of your family instead

291
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,839
But..

292
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,719
If you can't stop

293
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,599
I'm telling Tre.

294
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,159
Is that a threat?!

295
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,439
Tong.

296
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,679
Please don't do this

297
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,479
I'm begging you

298
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,599
There's no secret in this world.

299
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,959
You have to choose

300
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,839
Tong.

301
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,399
Hey.

302
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,799
What are we gonna do?

303
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,239
-Peem.
-Tat.

304
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,279
I heard you stepped out but didn't think you would come back.

305
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,279
I have a favor to ask

306
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,959
I don't trust anyone else.

307
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,119
What is it?

308
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,999
This is my and Putter's buccal mucosa

309
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,479
I want you to take it to a private DNA Iab that li contacted

310
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,479
They said I'll get the results in three days

311
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,799
I really respect your perseverance.

312
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,999
How did you get it?

313
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,319
Luck because my former secretary

314
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,879
opened an ice cream shop near Putter'sschool.

315
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,719
So she helped me out

316
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,159
I think you will get sued if Plubpl a finds out about this

317
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,479
I don't care.

318
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,839
I just want to know

319
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,759
if Putter is my son or not.

320
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,559
Let me ask you this

321
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,119
If you find out Putter is your son,

322
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,959
what will you do next?

323
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,559
I have to get custody.

324
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,239
It won't be that easy

325
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,519
Look, how you got the proof is illegal.

326
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,679
You can't file a lawsuit with anyone with this.

327
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,959
I know that.

328
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,999
But shouldn't I know if Putter is my son or not?

329
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,199
Sa.

330
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,239
Your secretary said you were here.

331
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,519
Sol came to see you

332
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,199
Come talk with me

333
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,639
in my office then

334
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,559
I'll leave you to it.

335
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,959
Sure.

336
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,319
I'm going to ask again.

337
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,159
You won't marry me, is that correct?

338
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,719
Sa.

339
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,879
You've been too spoiled

340
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,999
I want you to learn that in this world,

341
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,879
not everyone can please you

342
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,479
give in toyou every time

343
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,399
I'lteach you that lesson myself

344
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,639
Fine!

345
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,639
I will show you

346
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,639
that whatever I want.

347
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,839
I shall get!

348
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,519
My goodness Sa.

349
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,879
How did it go? Did talking to Peem not go well?

350
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,599
If it went well, would I be upset?!

351
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,639
What a stupid question!

352
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,279
Calm down.

353
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,559
She's married now

354
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,479
You still have a chance

355
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,839
I'll go convince Peem, sounds good?

356
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,799
It won't work.

357
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,119
Old flames are sparking again

358
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,439
He won't listen to you.

359
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,759
Old flames?

360
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,839
I had someone follow Peem. Take a look.

361
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,319
This woman.

362
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,799
Even with a husband and child,

363
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,519
she's still associating with Peem.

364
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,239
So evil!

365
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,719
Plubpl a!

366
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,199
Hey, can you leave first?

367
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,519
-But she --
- Just go. I'll handle it.

368
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,319
Usa.

369
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,399
I'm going to ask you one more time.

370
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,479
Knowing this,

371
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,759
do you still want to marry him?

372
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,399
The more I see this,

373
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,879
the more I need to marry Peem!

374
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,239
You have to help me

375
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,319
Just tell me

376
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,239
what you want me to do.

377
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,319
Since she still won't stop bothering my Peem,

378
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,679
she needs to be taught a lesson.

379
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:06,119
I want to know how it's coming along with that steak franchise restaurant.

380
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,919
The restaurant want to see what we have to offer

381
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,279
versus Kit's company.

382
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,279
Then he'll make another decision

383
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,359
Are you able to offer him a new deal?

384
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,199
All done.

385
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,919
Good.

386
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,959
Then forward it to Pete so he can take over.

387
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,679
Dad.

388
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,879
Pete is inexperienced

389
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,399
I'm worried that

390
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,759
he won't be able to compete with Kit

391
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,079
Are you worried about me or yourself?

392
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,759
you're scared

393
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,959
that Il ill steal the accomplishment from you?

394
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,199
Pete!

395
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,039
What problems are you two having?

396
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,919
- Nothing.
-Nothing.

397
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,039
Good then.

398
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,519
Just forward everything to Pete

399
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,119
As for you, you'll have time to go handle the land deed in Rayong

400
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,839
So we can finally sign the contract with Mr. Mark

401
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,559
Yes Dad.

402
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,879
This is the deal we're offering to Saan Fun Steak restaurant

403
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,039
I'll leave you to handle it.

404
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,279
It's your first task

405
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,079
Don't mess up

406
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,159
Don't worry, Peem.

407
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,159
Wait.

408
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,639
What?

409
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,239
So you're not going to talk to me at all?

410
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,799
What do you want me to say?

411
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,959
Thankyou for forwarding this project to me?

412
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,879
So you want to be my enemy

413
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,799
because of a woman?

414
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,759
I'm sorry.

415
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,239
Pete.

416
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,279
About Sa,

417
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,599
if you really love her

418
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,119
why don't you try winning her over?

419
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,039
I'm doing it right now

420
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,279
I hope you

421
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,879
succeed.

422
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,159
Peem!

423
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,119
I got --

424
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,599
Go Pete.

425
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,839
That'll be all

426
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,279
Get to work.

427
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,199
Bring me the offer Peem is offering to Saan Fun Steak

428
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,079
Then I'll help you.

429
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,559
I got what you wanted

430
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,479
Now,

431
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,199
you can help me?

432
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,959
DNA results are in.

433
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,399
Putter!

434
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,719
Tat!

435
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,599
Hey man!

436
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,039
Putter.

437
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,919
You don't like the snacks?

438
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,039
I do.

439
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,319
You like it

440
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,319
but why don't you eat it?
I LOVE LAD

441
00:29:59,320 --> 00:29:59,959
Hmm?

442
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,159
I have to clean my mouth first before my teeth decays

443
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,159
You want to brush your teeth?

444
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,199
Not brush my teeth.

445
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,439
We should clean our mouths first.

446
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,759
Who taught you this?

447
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,079
The teacher from school?

448
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,239
No.

449
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,999
Uncle Peem taught me

450
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,559
Putter.

451
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,559
Uncle Peem did?

452
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,399
Where did you meet him at?

453
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,439
When?

454
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,239
At the ice cream shop.

455
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,199
What's wrong?

456
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,079
Putter.

457
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,159
Can you tell me

458
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,079
what did he make you do

459
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,679
or can you explain to me in detail?

460
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,919
Uncle Peem told me to open my mouth

461
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,239
then used a cotton ball with a long stick

462
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,799
to clean my whole mouth.

463
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,839
Before he allowed me to eat the ice cream

464
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,639
Hey.

465
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,319
Don't tell me Peem...

466
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,639
You can't go inside sir!

467
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,959
Sir!

468
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,919
You can't go in!

469
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,039
He wanted to come inside.

470
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,359
I stopped him but he wouldn't listen.

471
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,559
Uncle Peem!

472
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,239
I need to talk to you too.

473
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,559
Hey.

474
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,519
Uncle Peem!

475
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,639
Stop.

476
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,719
It's an adult problem. It's not for kids

477
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,919
Stay here.

478
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,359
Kit.

479
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,559
There's a big problem

480
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,159
Peem is at the house?!

481
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,039
Okay

482
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,559
I'm coming home right now.

483
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,719
Peem!

484
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,839
What did you do to my son?

485
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,959
-Putter said you --
-Yes.

486
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,719
I swabbed his cheeks to get a DNA test.

487
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,399
What rights do you have to do that?!

488
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,439
You're a scumbag! I'm going to sue you!

489
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,679
Go ahead!

490
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,439
I want other people to know too

491
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,439
that Putter is my son.

492
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,359
I want to hear from you

493
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,599
that Putter is my son.

494
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,759
He's not your son

495
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,559
You're going to lie?

496
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,639
With this proof,

497
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,919
are you still going to lie to me?

498
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,879
Well?

499
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,039
Putter is my son, isn't he?

500
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,479
I told you Putter isn't your son!

501
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,879
You're still going to deny it?

502
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,239
No matter what the result says,

503
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,759
in the end Putter isn't your son!

504
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,079
Why isn't he Plubpl a?

505
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,279
Huh?

506
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,439
I said he's not!

507
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,199
Because according to the law,

508
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,399
mothers have legal rights to the child.

509
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,319
Even if you are Putter's father

510
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,359
but I signed the paternity certificate as his father.

511
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,239
Right now,

512
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,559
Putter is my son with Plubpl a.

513
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,719
Not yours!

514
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,919
Kit!

515
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,479
Stop!

516
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,239
Peem!

517
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,039
Don't mess with my husband!

518
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,519
I don't care about that law!

519
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,999
Putter is my son!

520
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,719
I'm taking him back!

521
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:09,919
Peem!

522
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,999
-Peem!
-Peem!

523
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,678
Peem!

524
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,439
Putter!

525
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,239
Peem!

526
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,079
Putter!

527
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,678
Peem!

528
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,279
Putter!

529
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,319
Where are you Putter?!

530
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,399
Stop it Peem!

531
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,279
Peem!

532
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,279
What are you doing?!

533
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,039
I'm going to tell him

534
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,919
that he's my son!

535
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,999
Not yours!

536
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,319
Peem

537
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,759
Hey! Peem!

538
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,519
Putter.

539
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,879
-Putter!
- Both of you stop it!

540
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,319
Peem! Vikit! Stop it right now!

541
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,919
Peem!

542
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,439
Putter!
-Peem!

543
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,319
Stop Putter!

544
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,279
Both of you stop!

545
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,119
Dad and Uncle Peem are fighting!

546
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,639
Putter.

547
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,959
Dad and Uncle Peem aren't fighting.

548
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,799
They're just being loud

549
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,599
Tong.

550
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,439
If you mess with Putter again,

551
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,679
I will kill you!

552
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,679
Putter is my son

553
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,999
What rights do you have to stop me?!

554
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,759
So?!

555
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,279
If you go tell Putter that you're his father,

556
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,519
have you ever thought how he will feel?

557
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,639
Putter has always understood

558
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,239
that Vik it is his father.

559
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,039
Don't confuse him

560
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,319
But Putter is my son!

561
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,999
So what?!

562
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,279
If you want to hurt his feelings,

563
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,879
go tell him then!

564
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,919
That this man here,

565
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,679
the person he loves,

566
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,919
the person he thought was his father

567
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,919
isn't his father.

568
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,839
If you want to hurt his feelings, you go tell him then!

569
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,559
But I..

570
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,959
should get the opportunity to see my son.

571
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,119
Even if it's not as his father

572
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,759
but as Uncle Peem will do

573
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,519
That won't be necessary

574
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,079
Putter has a good family now.

575
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,319
He has everything.

576
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,399
He's happy.

577
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,479
He doesn't need you in his life.

578
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,879
Plubpl a.

579
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,799
I'm begging you.

580
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,199
Just leave Peem

581
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,719
I said leave!
