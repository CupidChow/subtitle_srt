1
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:27,959
What?!

2
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,118
You're the one that leaked Peem's clip four years ago?

3
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,079
The reason Tat called your brother

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,759
was to probably talk about this matter.

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,759
Why would you do it Mom?!

6
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,239
Why are you asking me that?

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,519
I wanted you to end up with Sa.

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,039
Mom.

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,559
Don't you love her?

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,599
I just thought that

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,878
if I leak Peem's clip, it would change her mind

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,319
Who would have thought

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,359
that things would escalate like this?

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,799
It's okay Mom.

15
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,799
Don't worry about it

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,439
I won't let anyone hurt you.

17
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,039
I will protect you.

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,039
Oh.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,839
You're home?

20
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,879
Where's Peem?

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,679
Tat called him for an urgent matter.

22
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,079
He left after he dropped me off

23
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,839
He should have told me first!

24
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,559
I cooked a lot of food for him!

25
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,839
Alright.

26
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,959
If you'll excuse me.

27
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,159
What's the matter?

28
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,319
Nothing.

29
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,599
I'm just tired.

30
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,639
I'm going to go rest

31
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,999
I...

32
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,439
really have done you wrong.

33
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,439
Yes.

34
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,239
You did me wrong

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,759
and our son

36
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,319
More importantly

37
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,839
you did yourself wrong.

38
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,879
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,879
I know

40
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,399
you were hurt because of this too.

41
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,799
It's okay.

42
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,039
Let's forget the past together.

43
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,959
I love you Plubpl a

44
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,959
l also know

45
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,319
you still love me too.

46
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,839
Let's help resolve this issue together

47
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,518
S But the closer l get to you &

48
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:26,399
S The more Iknow I've done wrong and made mistakes

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,519
P Can you please forgive me

50
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,159
P How much I hated you d

51
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,639
PIc an love you even more

52
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,919

55
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,159
PIlose to you in every way

56
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:04,319
P Can I make amends? Let me fix it by asking for your love

57
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,399
It's too late Peem

58
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,599
The two of us has come a long way.

59
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,439
Why?

60
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,519
Why are you giving up?

61
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,359
You're just going to leave things just like this?

62
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,079
But this doesn't just involve us.

63
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,119
I think this is the best solution for us

64
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,279
I don't want Putter to be sad over this.

65
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,839
But we...

66
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,719
can explain to him

67
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,639
and have him understand it

68
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,919
We can't.

69
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,679
Putter loves Vi kit a lot.

70
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,559
Vik it is also my benefactor.

71
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,799
I can't hurt him.

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,759
Why do you have to care

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,439
about other-people's feelings?

74
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,159
What about my feelings?

75
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,719
And yours?

76
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,079
It's not important?

77
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,959
Don't make me do more wrong.

78
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,159
I don't want anyone else getting hurt over this

79
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,839
Especially our son

80
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,279
Putter!

81
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,319
We came to pick-you up

82
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,119
Yes.

83
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,879
How did you know I was here?

84
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,519
Putter was crying for you.

85
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,199
I called you but you didn't pick up so I called Tong

86
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,479
That's how I know you were here

87
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,719
Dad said he was going to take me out to eat

88
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,719
Come with us Mom.

89
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,519
Okay.

90
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,199
Hello Uncle Peem

91
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,079
I'm happy to see you

92
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,399
988

93
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,359
I'm happy too

94
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,879
that I got to see you

95
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,399
If you're done with things here, we should get going.

96
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,839
Yes.

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,959
Come on Putter.

98
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,559
Let's go.

99
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,479
Come on.

100
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,719
9887

101
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,279
Sooner or later Kit,

102
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,999
I am going to get my family back

103
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,359
Don't worry Mom

104
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,839
Hey!

105
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,959
Peem!

106
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,399
What are you going to do to Mom?!

107
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,439
Do you know what your mom did four years ago?!

108
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,879
I do!

109
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,439
But she did it for me!

110
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,479
I apologize on her behalf!

111
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,359
You're not the person that should be apologizing!

112
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,039
It's your mom!

113
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,039
I'm going to put you in prison!

114
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,039
Bas ed on Plubpla's sister's testimony?

115
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,159
Just that?!

116
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,879
That can put me in prison?!

117
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,999
So you don't feel any remorse?!

118
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,839
Huh?!

119
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,719
Stop! Don't hurt my mom!

120
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,519
Stop Pete!

121
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,759
Stop!

122
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,399
Don't hurt Peem!

123
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,479
Are you okay Peem?

124
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,759
If you're trying to hurt me

125
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,399
or the person I love again

126
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,399
I will not forgive you

127
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,759
Peem!

128
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,799
Uncle Tong!

129
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,399
Dad took me to go eat a big lobster today!

130
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,679
Really?!

131
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,319
Yes.

132
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,479
Tong.

133
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,119
Can you go take a bath for him?

134
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,279
Come on Putter

135
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,199
Let's go!

136
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,999
Let's go take your bath!

137
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,479
I'm sorry

138
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,039
that l didn't tell you l went to see Peem at Aunt Kaew's house today.

139
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,239
It's related to Aunt Kaew's safety

140
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,279
I promised her I wouldn't tell anyone

141
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,079
What do you mean?

142
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,519
Aunt Kaew and Peem

143
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,959
are related how?

144
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,879
Once things clear up

145
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,759
I will tell you everything.

146
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,519
Okay.

147
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,399
You must be tired. You should go rest.

148
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,559
We can talk later.

149
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,839
Thank you.

150
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,759
It's too late Peem

151
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,039
The two of us has come a long way.

152
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,919
I don't want anyone else getting hurt over this.

153
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,679
Especially our son.

154
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,679
No.

155
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,639
I won't allow it Plubpl a.

156
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,839
I'm going to get you and our son back

157
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,399
Why do you have to care

158
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,079
about other people's feelings?

159
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,999
What about my feelings?

160
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,559
And yours?

161
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,759
It's not important?

162
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,919
Mom!

163
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,719
Why are you crying?

164
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,879
Who bullied you?

165
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,839
No one.

166
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,599
I...

167
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,039
No one bullied me.

168
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,359
I'm just happy.

169
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,759
If you're happy

170
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,079
why are you crying then?

171
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,639
Sometimes

172
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,359
people cry when they're happy

173
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,599
But l don't want to see you cry.

174
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,879
Then I won't cry.

175
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,919
So your mom didn't leave you guys

176
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,199
but was attacked and had amnesia?

177
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,799
Yes.

178
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,999
I found her.

179
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,679
Dad and l are looking for the culprit right now.

180
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,879
That's why I came to tell you to help us out.

181
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,999
Just tell me what you want me to do

182
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,119
Thank s Tat.

183
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,439
Oh.

184
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,079
so,

185
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,239
who do you suspect?

186
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,519
Your step mom Mrs. Sup ang?

187
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,519
I did suspect her at first

188
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,199
But after talking to Mom

189
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,039
there's someone else that's suspicious

190
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,399
Who?

191
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,519
Aunt Ump on,

192
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,959
Usa's mother.

193
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,999
Huh?!

194
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,519
Is that possible?

195
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,599
You have a delivery ma'am

196
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,399
From who?

197
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,079
The messenger said there's a card and if you read it, you'll know who it's from.

198
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,399
Next time,don't accept anything if you don't know who it's from.

199
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,959
You can go now.

200
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,759
Yes ma'am.

201
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,359
I remember you like hydrangeas.

202
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,919
See you soon.

203
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,199
Mane ewan?!

204
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,159
You sent a bouquet to Mr s. Umpon

205
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,799
under your mom's name?

206
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,999
Yeah.

207
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,279
I want to know what she will do if she knows that Mom is still alive.

208
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,839
Dad and l have sent an investigator to follow Aunt Ump on around!

209
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,799
I never imagined

210
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,559
that a saint-like person like Mr s. Umpon

211
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,999
would kill someone

212
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,119
I don't want to believe it either

213
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,119
What about your situation'with Plubpl a?

214
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,199
Hello.

215
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,959
Hello Putter's mom.

216
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,559
Putter and his uncle are playing over there.

217
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,559
Uncle?

218
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,439
Yes.

219
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,879
Peem!

220
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,479
Putter, your mom is here!

221
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,919
Yay!

222
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,239
Hey.

223
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,759
Why are you here?

224
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,239
I thought you weren't going to confuse him?

225
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,039
That's before we found out the truth about what happened four years ago.

226
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,359
I have done nothing wrong to you.

227
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,839
So why should l lose you and our son?

228
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,239
We made a deal.

229
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,919
Hey.

230
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,639
You assumed and agreed on everything alone.

231
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,439
I made no such deal.

232
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,559
Putter.

233
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,159
Do you want to go eat ice cream?

234
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,199
Yes!

235
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,519
Do you like ice cream?

236
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,079
" I do!

237
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,519

00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,919
Let's go eat ice cream!

239
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,839

Be careful.

Get in!

245
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,318
Hey Peem.

246
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,879
You have no right to take my son anywhere without permission.

247
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,239
Why not?

248
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,318
He's my son too.

249
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,279
Get in. Let's go have ice cream.

250
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,479
Our son is waiting

251
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,359
2 U8377

252
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,479
2 U8377
Is it delicious?

253
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,039
Very delicious.

254
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,919
Then can l have some?!

255
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,439
It is delicious!

256
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,199
You have to put this on too.

257
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,959
You want this on?

258
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,959
I like it.

259
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,279
Putter.

260
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,919
Can you feed me?

261
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,519
Okay.

262
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,599
Thank you.

263
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,759
In that case,

264
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,519
we'll take our leave now.

265
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,279
Wait.

266
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,639
Do you want to play more games over there?

267
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,239
Yes.

268
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,719
Hey!

269
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,119
What is it?

270
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,999
I have to take him home. Where are you taking him?

271
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,279
Let's go play together.

272
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,119
Hey! Hey!

273
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,039
K INFO Peem!

274
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,879
It's here!

275
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,439
The purple one.

276
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,839
What about this one?

277
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,759
The blue one. Go for it.

278
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,639
The claw grabbed the arm.
-It did huh?

279
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,239
-Do over?
-It grabbed the arm earlier.

280
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:10,839
20

281
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,439
Take that!

282
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,399
Hurry Putter! Go! Go!

283
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,719
Iwon!

284
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,399
Let's go home now.

285
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,919
Did you have fun Putter?

286
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,239
I did.

287
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,999
But I wish Dad was here.

288
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,879
It would be much more fun

289
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,719
Then let's go home and see him.

290
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,159
I'll drop you off.

291
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,159
That's okay.

292
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,679
I had Tong pick us up already

293
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,799
He's waiting.

294
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,639
But...

295
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,599
That's enough Peem.

296
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,399
Don't even try.

297
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,279
I won't change my mind.

298
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,399
You should also respect Usa.

299
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,599
She is considered your lawful wife right now.

300
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,119
Let's go Putter.

301
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,199
Say bye to Uncle Peem

302
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,679
Go.

303
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,959
We can play again next time.

304
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,039
Okay.

305
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,199
Come on.

306
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,679
I'm not going to give up Putter

307
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,319
We will be together.

308
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,479
Dad!

309
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,559
Putter!

310
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,679
Why are you home so late today?

311
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,959
Where did you go?

312
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,799
Uncle Peem took me to go eat ice cream

313
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,239
Peem went to see Putter at school.

314
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,839
I tried to stop him

315
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,399
I understand.

316
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,519
I know what's he like

317
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,279
So,

318
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,559
was it delicious?

319
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,879
Yes but I wished you were there.

320
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,479
Putter.

321
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,479
Go play with Uncle Tong first.

322
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,679
I want to talk to your mom.

323
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,679
Okay.

324
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,319
Come on Putter

325
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,239
Let's go!

326
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,479
I want to know

327
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,399
how you feel about Peem right now

328
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,079
Do you still want to get revenge on him?

329
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,879
Regarding what happened four years ago,

330
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,239
Peem didn't do it.

331
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,359
I want to stop.

332
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,359
I can't hurt him anymore

333
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,479
You mean

334
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,279
you're going to leave me

335
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,719
and go back to Peem?

336
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,999
No.

337
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,479
I'm not going to go back to him.

338
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,759
Really?

339
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,679
Yes.

340
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,679
But l also...

341
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,999
can't be with you either.

342
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,439
What?

343
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,519
For me,

344
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,679
whether it's you or Peem,

345
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,439
I feel guilty towards both of you

346
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,479
Sol think

347
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,399
I'm going to take Putter and Tong back to live at Grandma's house.

348
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,799
Plub.

349
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,519
Hey.

350
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,519
You're going to divorce me?

351
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,159
It's up to you.

352
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,479
If you want to get a divorce then...

353
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,479
No.

354
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,599
I won't divorce you

355
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,479
I won't lose you

356
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,599
and our son.

357
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,039
Plub.

358
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,039
You and our son

359
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,359
are my family.

360
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,479
You're family to me too.

361
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,319
You're still Putter's father.

362
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,439
But I...

363
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,319
I can't bother you anymore.

364
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,279
You should

365
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,439
really live your life now

366
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,239
Don't let us be a burden for you.

367
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,799
No.

368
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,079
No Plub.

369
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,879
You and our son

370
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,319
aren't a burden for me.

371
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,679
I know you can't love me right now.

372
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,199
But I told you already

373
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,119
no matter how long it takes,

374
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,879
I will wait.

375
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,839
Don't waste your time.

376
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,959
We should

377
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,919
go back to living our lives as it should be.

378
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,799
I'm sorry.

379
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,879
Dad.

380
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,679
I've waited so long to see this day

381
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,879
Finally,

382
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,559
the day has come

383
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,999
Can you not start with me?

384
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,359
You lost to Peem again

385
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,359
How does it feel?

386
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,359
You're an idiot

387
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,879
for getting used by that woman!

388
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,079
Plub isn't what you think

389
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,079
You're still going to defend her?!

390
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,519
I can tell

391
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,639
that woman used sweet words to trick you.

392
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,479
So she can go back to being with Peem gracefully

393
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,159
Stop being stupid Kit

394
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,159
That woman

395
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,679
doesn't really love you.

396
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,719
Her son

397
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,359
isn't really your son.

398
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,679
I know it!

399
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,279
That kid

400
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,719
looks nothing like you!

401
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,119
Enough Dad!

402
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,279
What you just said, I know what is what!

403
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,839
You!

404
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,999
Dad.

405
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,239
Let me live my life.

406
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,279
Just once

407
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,399
Without having you controlling me!

408
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,319
You're sick.

409
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,479
Take care of yourself

410
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,959
If you really are a father,

411
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,159
you would know

412
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,559
there isn't a day

413
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,879
that a father doesn't worry about his son.

414
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,559
Kaew.

415
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,879
I'm going to ask you straightforward

416
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,439
You really don't remember Mr, Puchong?

417
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,239
No one can forget

418
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,239
the person that hurt them the most.

419
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,639
You remember him.

420
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,439
But you refused to forgive him

421
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,879
So you pretend you can't remember him.

422
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,359
remember everything in the past

423
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,359
since I saw Peem.

424
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,839
When I saw Puchong

425
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,559
I remember the pain from the past really well.

426
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,359
Hey.

427
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,559
Kaew.

428
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,439
I saw the way he looked at you.

429
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,279
I know he feels really guilty towards you

430
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,639
Is there away for you to forget

431
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,959
and forgive him?

432
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,159
You're not scared

433
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,199
that if I can forgive him

434
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,999
I would leave you?

435
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,119
I am.

436
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,279
I am scared.

437
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,919
But I want you to be happy

438
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,079
Believe me,

439
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,399
no matter which way you choose

440
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,039
I will understand.

441
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,759
Whether it's you or Peem,

442
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,279
I feel guilty towards both of you

443
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,679
I will not lose you and our son.

444
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,959
Plub!

445
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,279
Putter!

446
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,719
Where are you Putter?

447
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,559
Mr. Putter isn't home.

448
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,439
Where did he go?

449
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,239
His mother packed their belongings and left.

450
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,559
What?!

451
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,839
Mrs. Plubpl a left you a letter.

452
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,039
Why do we have to live here?

453
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,159
Because this place

454
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,359
is our real home

455
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,799
What about Dad? Will he come live with us?

456
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,039
Dad won't be living with us

457
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,199
He has his own home

458
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,039
I want to live with Dad

459
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,879
Why can't I live with him?

460
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,479
Let's...

461
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,399
wait until you're a bit older then I'll explain.

462
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,719
Let's go inside

463
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,919
Come Putter! Let's go inside!

464
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,239
Let's go inside!

465
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,639
Surprise!

466
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,479
Uncle Peem!

467
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,039
Welcome home Putter!

468
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,239
What is this?

469
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,239
Oh.

470
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,639
Peem and Tat knew that you were moving back

471
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,559
so they came to help me clean the place up

472
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,919
How is it?

473
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,679
We organized everything

474
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,359
Thank you.

475
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,479
How did you know I was moving back today?

476
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,719
Tong.

477
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,599
Sorry Plub.

478
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,439
But I wanted Putter to be present with his real family

479
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,079
Plub.

480
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,359
Plubpl a!

481
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,319
Peem!

482
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,959
Hey!

483
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,199
Peem, let go!

484
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,679
Plub.

485
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,839
I won't let you go again.

486
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,039
Are you crazy?!

487
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,839
Let go!

488
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,119
Plubpl a.

489
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,919
Peem.

490
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,399
I think we should stop being immoral.

491
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,198
Immoral?

492
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,678
What's immoral about us being in love?

493
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,119
It's immoral

494
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,759
because we're both married to someone else.

495
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,999
I'm going to divorce Usa.

496
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,559
You already know

497
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,399
I didn't want to marry her from from the beginning.

498
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,039
But I'm not going to divorce Vi kit.

499
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,678
Why not?

500
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,079
Because...

501
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,279
Vik it is the only person

502
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,999
that l ended me a hand when I was struggling

503
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,919
I can't do that to him.

504
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,319
Most importantly.

505
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,039
I don't want Putter to get hurt over this matter.

506
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,039
Plub.

507
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,599
I know

508
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,679
your love for me has never changed.

509
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,839
Even when you resented me,

510
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,399
you still loved me.

511
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,039
Am I right?

512
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,399
Right now,

513
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,479
I'm not worthy of loving you.

514
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,639
Plub.

515
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,039
You should leave.

516
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,799
I'm begging you.

517
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,319
Plub.

518
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,159
No.

519
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,839
I'm not giving up that easily

520
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,399
Kit.

521
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,759
What business do you have with me?

522
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,039
Peem.

523
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,039
Can't sleep?

524
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,159
Just thinking about your mother.

525
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,559
She must hate me so much.

526
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,959
Give her time.

527
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,839
It's karma

528
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,319
that I'must accept.

529
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,919
I hurt your mother so much

530
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,239
Dad.

531
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,239
It's in the past now

532
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,079
Let's not mention it anymore

533
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,639
Really?

534
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,279
Can it really be that way?

535
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,039
You also

536
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,239
have been mad at me.

537
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,639
Or am I wrong?

538
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,479
If you really have repented

539
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,599
you should

540
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,479
try to make it better then

541
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,359
I will find the culprit

542
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,919
that tried to kill your mother

543
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:17,039
I ill have them be punished to a tone for the sins that l've committed

544
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,759
Besides,

545
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:25,079
your mother won't have to live in hiding anymore.

546
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:31,359
I already sent a bouquet to Aunt Ump on to see her reaction just like you asked me to.

547
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,959
Yeah.

548
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,399
But...

549
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,079
she has n't made a move yet.

550
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,039
The only way we can do is threaten the culprit to confess.
