1
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,959
Stop.

2
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,599
What is it Grandma?

3
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:30,959
Where's Tre?

4
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,639
I haven't seen her.

5
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,319
I called her already

6
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,799
She'll be here soon.

7
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,119
Don't wait for her Grandma.

8
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,119
Grandma.

9
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,439
Tong and I will wait in front of the operating room until you come out.

10
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,919
No.

11
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,159
You don't have to wait.

12
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,399
Go wait in the room instead.

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,999
No.

14
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,839
I feel comfortable staying here instead.

15
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,479
I'll be right out.

16
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,999
Don't cry, Don't be sad.

17
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,399
You got this Grandma.

18
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,839
Plub.

19
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,359
Su thee.

20
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,799
Hello.

21
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,399
-Hello.
Tre.

22
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,199
IJ just found out about Grandma's
surgery this morning from Tre.

23
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,759
So I wanted to come with her.

24
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,919
I just saw your message.

25
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,039
Why is it so sudden Plub?

26
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,039
I wasn't prepared

27
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,559
Hey,are you getting the surgery that you have to prepare for it?

28
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,199
It's just..

29
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,559
my boss loaned me the money for the surgery.

30
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,599
The doctor wants her to get the surgery as soon as possible too

31
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,519
Why borrow money from someone else?

32
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,879
You could have borrowed it from me.

33
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,279
Tre said...

34
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,079
Yeah Plub

35
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,039
Why didn't you tell me?

36
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,639
I told you to let me know if you need help.

37
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,799
Yes.

38
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,839
I didn't want to bother you

39
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,199
Gosh.

40
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,759
We're family

41
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,359
She's like my grandmother too.

42
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,679
Why be considerate?

43
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,759
Yeah.

44
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,959
My sister is so stubborn.

45
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,159
Alright.

46
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,119
Next time tell me first if there's anything.

47
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,919
Got it?

48
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,919
Yes

49
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,199
Tong.

50
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,719
How's it going?

51
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,959
Long time no see.

52
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,999
Just Grandma and school

53
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,639
It'll be okay.

54
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,039
If you need anything, let me know.

55
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,199
You lied to me.

56
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,199
You didn't tell Su thee that I want to borrow money from him.

57
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,759
Why are you doing this?

58
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,359
You're not worried about Grandma?

59
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,359
This is a life death situation.

60
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,359
I know

61
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,519
you're not going to let Grandma die

62
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,919
Tre!

63
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,479
I'm in trouble too

64
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,039
It's because of you.

65
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,079
You keep borrowing money from Su thee.

66
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,359
His parents have a target on my back now.

67
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,959
Then you should have told me

68
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,999
Not lie.

69
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,279
If I tell you,

70
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,439
you would go tell Su thee.

71
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,959
Have lever done that?

72
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,639
Who knows?

73
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,839
Now do you believe me?

74
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,719
I never went behind your back and borrowed money from Su thee.

75
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,359
How would I know?

76
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,119
That's what Grandma told me

77
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,319
Then from now on,do not misunderstand me and Su the eagain.

78
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,719
Show some respect.

79
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,999
That's your husband and I'm your sister.

80
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,159
If there's anything, just ask me

81
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,199
Are you sure you don't like Su thee?

82
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,439
If you're trying to steal my husband,

83
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,959
I will kill you.

84
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,319
Here's your tea Mr. Peem.

85
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,439
Thank you Kwang.

86
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,839
Grand ma Thip must be in surgery right now.

87
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,359
Grandma will be fine.

88
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,239
Yeah.

89
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,279
Grand ma Thip will be safe.

90
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,759
Don't worry about it.

91
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,879
Take care of yourself.

92
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,239
Don't stress too much.

93
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,679
Do you have psychic powers

94
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,199
to know what others are thinking?

95
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,319
Hey.

96
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,919
Is Peem courting you?

97
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,919
That's crazy!

98
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,679
He's not.

99
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,319
Even if he is,

100
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,479
I don't care.

101
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,239
We're too different.

102
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,959
We won't last.

103
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,079
It's good you think like that.

104
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,679
Don't get involved with that family

105
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,559
I was thinking the same thing

106
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,839
Hello.

107
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,759
You and I

108
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,239
need to clear things up

109
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,239
Who's this?

110
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,038
Pete.

111
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,159
Hey.

112
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,559
You got me fired. What more do you want?

113
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,879
Your sister is still working at my dad's company.

114
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,039
She's still messing with my dad

115
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,039
How many times do I have to tell you

116
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,599
my sister has no feelings for your dad?!

117
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,639
When will you listen?!

118
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,479
Let's just clear it up

119
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,519
If I lose,

120
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,719
I will stop bothering you

121
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,839
and your sister.

122
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,439
Are you for real?

123
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,359
Yeah!

124
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,919
I'm tired of this.

125
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,479
Fine.

126
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,599
Deal.

127
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,759
Grand ma Thip's family

128
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,279
How is Grandma?

129
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,799
Surgery went well.

130
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,679
The patient is safe.

131
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,759
We moved her to the cc U to monitor her symptom up close for the night.

132
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,159
If there are no other complications,

133
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,159
we will move her to a regular recovery room tomorrow.

134
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,839
Thank you.

135
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,399
Tong.

136
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,039
I investigated it already.

137
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,759
The design company is said to have no credible identity.

138
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,319
We will be at Kit in this case for sure.

139
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,319
Good.

140
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,919
So Kit can stop using his thug ways to do business.

141
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,679
Kit is not going to stop.

142
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,879
I think they should be done by now.

143
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,599
Why isn't she updating me?

144
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,439
Whose call are you waiting on?

145
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,719
I see you keep staring at the phone for over an hour now.

146
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,519
Well..

147
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,599
I...

148
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,919
Grandma is out of surgery

149
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,999
wau wan She's safe

150
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,239
That's a relief.

151
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,959
Tat!

152
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,599
So you are worried about her.

153
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,959
I thought you were going to teach her a lesson?

154
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,839
How did that lesson become a concern?

155
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,959
Well...

156
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,919
I'm worried about Grand ma Thip.

157
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,359
I'm not worried about Plubpl a!

158
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,479
Can you differentiate?

159
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,799
Tell yourself that.

160
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,439
But for sure,

161
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,319
Plubp la is starting to have feelings for me.

162
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,439
What is your next plan?

163
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,119
Grandma

164
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,839
Hmm?

165
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,319
Mom said

166
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,159
to get well soon.

167
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,599
Mom is very lonely right now!

168
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,999
No one to gossip with her.

169
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,479
Tell her I said thank you.

170
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,719
Thanks Yot.

171
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,559
Well,

172
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,279
you're my friend, no?

173
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,479
It's what friends do.

174
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,759
Yeah.

175
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,879
Friends know each others thoughts There's no need to say thank you.

176
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,679
These are fruits.

177
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,399
It's for you Grandma

178
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,919
You went through the trouble.

179
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,839
Gosh.

180
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,639
No trouble at all

181
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,759
It's our day off. We should play catch up

182
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,359
Thank you so much dear.

183
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,159
I guess the nurse is here.

184
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,239
Yeah.

185
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,919
Oh.

186
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,239
Mr. Peem!

187
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,279
Hello Grandma.

188
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,199
Hello.

189
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,159
Mr. Peem.

190
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,159
Why did you buy so much stuff?

191
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,679
Did you buy everything in the store?

192
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,519
Whoa.

193
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,199
Yeah.

194
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,839
It's such a waste of money.

195
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,879
It's not a waste Grandma.

196
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,279
These gifts are appropriate for a recovering patient.

197
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,759
I want you to get the best nutrition.

198
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,479
So you can be healthy again

199
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,079
Show off.

200
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,799
Calm down! He's here visiting Grandma!

201
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,679
How are you feeling Grandma?

202
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,879
I'm feeling much better.

203
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,639
The doctor wants to monitor me for a few more days the nl can go home.

204
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,759
You're stronger than I thought Grandma.

205
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,079
Even the young ladies are ashamed!

206
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,919
My goodness.

207
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,679
Such a sweet talker you are! Comforting an old person!

208
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,679
More like kissing ass

209
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,359
Calm down!

210
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,439
Take it down a notch!

211
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,439
-Is it not true?
That's our friend's boss.

212
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,919
If kissing ass will make Grandma no longer sick

213
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,519
and will make her grandchild come back to work quicker,

214
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,079
I'm okay with that.

215
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,079
While you were gone,

216
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,079
Ive missed you so much

217
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,679
What are you saying?

218
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,439
People will misunderstand.

219
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,039
Why not?

220
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,279
The boss can't miss his subordinate?

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,799
Did you know when you were gone

222
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,959
no one was there to help me check the documents?

223
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,199
Do you only have one employee at the company?!

224
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,479
You're rich.

225
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,839
You can hire more people

226
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,599
Even if l hire more people

227
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,199
they won't be like Plubpl a.

228
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,879
Alright guys.

229
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,679
Hey.

230
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,639
Plubpl a.

231
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,759
You can go back to work tomorrow.

232
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,279
Okay?

233
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,079
You don't need to come watch over me.

234
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,479
I'm better now.

235
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,719
Okay.

236
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,759
Good.

237
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,599
Because tomorrow,

238
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,999
I have an important event for you to attend.

239
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,639
What event?

240
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,719
Did you wait long " Mr. Peem?

241
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,359
Plub finished getting dressed.

242
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,239
It wasn't long.

243
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,599
You're really stunned by Pl ub's beauty, Mr Peem

244
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,119
She is beautiful!

245
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,999
I'm so jealous. Flirting with each other in front of a single woman.

246
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,239
I'm serious.

247
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:28,839
CNA NEL

248
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,679

253
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,959
Mr. Peem.

254
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,999
I can't accept it. It's too expensive.

255
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,439
Besides,

256
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,279
I don't want to look after it.

257
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,359
I'm not giving it to you.

258
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,399
It's for you to borrow

259
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,799
You don't have to look after it.

260
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,239
I will do it.

261
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,719

Hello.

276
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,479
How are you? How's business nowadays?

277
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,759
Mr. Thaw ip.

278
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,959
-Ms. Amp on, hello-Hello.

279
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,519
Hello.

280
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,719
Mr. Thaw ip, Ms. Amp on

281
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,959
It's once in a while that we see you bring your wife and daughter out to events.

282
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,799
I had to beg to get them to come together.

283
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,839
Mr. Puchong.

284
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,759
I really have to thank you

285
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,079
for accepting my daughter

286
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,639
to go internat the company.

287
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,359
Never mind interning there

288
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,839
With a good degree like Usa

289
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,559
after she graduates, she should come work at the company.

290
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,479
What do you say?

291
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,919
The owner is inviting you.

292
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,599
I'm interested!

293
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,479
If there's an opening position, I am happy to.

294
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,599
Yes ma'am.

295
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,399
Peem didn't come to this event?

296
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,399
He'll be here soon.

297
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,639
That's a relief.

298
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,559
If Peem isn't coming

299
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,959
some child here would be moody

300
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,159
and have a sullen face.

301
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,679
Dad!

302
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,919
I only know Peem here.

303
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,439
I'll have someone to talk to if Peem is here.

304
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,799
Geez!

305
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,919
Speaking of the devil. Here he comes.

306
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,439
Mr. Peem.

307
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,799
I thought you said

308
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,599
other businessmen would bring their employees with them?

309
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,039
I don't see anyone.

310
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,839
You.

311
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,959
You're one of them

312
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,239
Hey!

313
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,999
You tricked me to come here?

314
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,479
If I told you the truth

315
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,119
would you have come?

316
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,959
I just want you to get to know my life better

317
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,879
Is it necessary?

318
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,439
Yes.

319
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,199
Because you're.

320
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,839
someone important to me

321
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,479
If you talk like this again, I'm really going home.

322
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,559
My goodness.

323
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,119
I just want you to broaden your circle.

324
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,519
Everyone in here are partners to the company

325
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,159
You're my secretary

326
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,799
You need to know them.

327
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,679
That's reasonable. Okay then.

328
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,199
Hello Ms. Plub pla.

329
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,599

Thank you.

332
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,759
Oh!

333
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,879
Peem!

334
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,759
You're here too?!

335
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,679
Sorry. I just saw you.

336
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,839
Do you want me to recommend you an eye doctor?

337
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,639
Your vision seems to be bad.

338
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,239
No need.

339
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,879
The reason I didn't see you is because.

340
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,759
of Ms. Plub pla

341
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:47,999
Peem!

342
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,799
You're here?

343
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,559
Hello Ms. Plub pla

344
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,559

345
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,559

346
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,519
There.

347
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,879
You see?

348
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,839
Go greet the elders.

349
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,679
Come on.

350
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,839
Hello Uncle, Auntie

351
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,839

I'm so happy to see you here.

356
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,079
Hello. Hello.

357
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,719
Hello.

358
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,479
Hello Mr. Peem.

359
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,999
Oh, you're so beautiful.

360
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,439
Is she your giri friend?

361
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,599
I hope she will be

362
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,079
But I don't know

363
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,879
when she will soften up to me

364
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,839
It's not like that. Mr. Peem was just kidding.

365
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,919
I'm just his secretary's assistant, that is all.

366
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,599
I wasn't kidding.

367
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,879
I'm pursuing her at the moment.

368
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,999
Gosh!

369
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,199
You're so adorable Peem.

370
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,319
I guess we need to debut our future daughter in law at this event, Puchong.

371
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,079
Excuse me sir.

372
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,079
The prime minister is here.

373
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,559
We should go greet the prime minister now.

374
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,839
Yes, we should.

375
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,119
You come with me.

376
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,239
Let's go.

377
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,279
Let's go say hi to the prime minister.

378
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,279
Plub.

379
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,719
Can you stay here with me?

380
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,799
It's just that..

381
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,799
I don't want to socialize with the elders.

382
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,439
Then...

383
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,879
stay here with Sa

384
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,079
Sure.

385
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,039
Let's go.

386
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,199
You brought Plubpl a here to mock me, didn't you?

387
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,839
Hmm?

388
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,719
The woman chose me Dad

389
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,999
Someone like Plubp la would choose you?

390
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,919
You forced her to come here.

391
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,879
have good things about me.

392
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,119
At least I am younger than you.

393
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,359
When it comes to strength

394
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,599
I'm strong enough and won't fall behind you

395
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,239
Peem.

396
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,159
Besides, I don't need to force Plubpl a

397
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,199
She is happy to come with me

398
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,479
Get over her.

399
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,439
Thank you.

400
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,599
That's Mr. Puchong

401
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,599
Tre, where are you going?!

402
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,519
Hello Mr. Puchong.

403
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,479
Who's that?

404
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,839
I'm Trepr a dub

405
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,679
Plubpl a's older sister.

406
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,759
Do you remember?

407
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,959
I remember now.

408
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,799
I came with my husband!

409
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,799
Hello Mr. Thaw ip

410
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,119
Hello Mr. Puchong

411
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,199
Hello.

412
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,639
Hello Mr. Peem, Mr. Tat.

413
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,359
Hello.

414
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,039
Mr. Puchong

415
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,879
This is Su thee.

416
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,439
my husband.

417
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,919
He owns a construction company.

418
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,239
Su thee Construction

419
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,639
We're working together.

420
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,679
That is correct.

421
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,559
I thought you got scared and wouldn't come after all.

422
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,359
Once we are clear

423
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,519
and I win.

424
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,559
you won't bother my family anymore?

425
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,999
For sure.

426
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,199
She's just a secretary

427
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,959
but wants to upgrade to PP World's daughter in law.

428
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,999
Yeah.

429
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,719
Mr. Peem has no taste.

430
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,319
Geez.

431
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,639
He got his father as his role model.

432
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,279
I will show you

433
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,639
that this isn't your place

434
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,359
Here you go.

435
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,599
Thank you.

436
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,399
Don't pay attention to them.

437
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,119
These people have their own circumference.

438
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,999
When they see people of lower status

439
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,559
who crosses the line a bit.

440
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,599
they can't stand it.

441
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,079
They think that

442
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,439
those people

443
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,039
are trying to upgrade their status

444
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,119
and compare themselves to them.

445
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,479
But not everyone are like that.

446
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,679
Am I right?

447
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,799
Yes.

448
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,079
I just think

449
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,959
why should poor people

450
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,839
stay poor forever?

451
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,039
If they want to get upgraded

452
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,399
want a better life,

453
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,199
is that wrong?

454
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,559
You're right.

455
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,919
It's not wrong

456
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,159
if they want to upgrade their status.

457
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,999
But it's the tactics they use.

458
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,759
If they use the wrong tactics

459
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,679
their lives will change

460
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,279
Am I right?

461
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,439
Usa.

462
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,919
Is there something you're upset with me about?

463
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,279
Plub.

464
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,599
Why would you think that?

465
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,039
I'm upset with you?

466
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,879
Don't over think it.

467
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,919
Okay.

468
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,159
She's not high-class no matter how I look at her

469
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,359
Peem was very bold.

470
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,719
It's a fancy event with high-class people

471
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,999
but still brought a former EN girl to debut.

472
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,759
Oh my god!

473
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,639
She's done that kind of job before?

474
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,959
Yes.
- Oh my goodness.

475
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,719
No wonder

476
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,199
Like I said.

477
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,559
- He's very bold.
-I agree.

478
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,199
Hey.

479
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,279
What era are we in?

480
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,319
I never thought

481
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,119
there will be people left in this world who like to look down on other people'scareers.

482
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,079
You can't blame them.

483
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,239
Each one of them looks like..

484
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,559
old nagging aunties

485
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,319
Don't mind them.

486
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,199
I don't care about them.

487
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,679
Old people with a coconut shell

488
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,119
Like to judge others by their own backwardness.

489
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,159
I don't care about them.

490
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,679
Hello Vi kit.

491
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,199
Hello Sa.

492
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,959
In that case,

493
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,159
I'm going to go out and get some fresh air.

494
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,319
I pity Plub so much

495
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,439
Must be very uncomfortable.

496
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,639
Excuse me.

497
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,359
Being outside like this.

498
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,799
I can breathe a sigh of relief.

499
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,239
Yes.

500
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,719
really hate these events where people just pretend with each other.

501
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,959
Really?

502
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,119
I thought a rich person like you would

503
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,159
enjoy these kinds of events

504
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,959
I don't.

505
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,399
I came because of business.

506
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,559
Being rich is such a struggle.

507
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,879
Very.

508
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,559
In conclusion,

509
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,198
Suthee is Plubpla's brother in law.

510
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,359
The person her sister slapped her for?

511
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,479
Yeah.

512
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,279
But.

513
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,279
we saw them leave together.

514
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,638
Su thee and Ohm are.

515
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,119
Aren't they?

516
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,279
I think

517
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,319
there's something off about this

518
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,599
Yeah.

519
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,198
Peem.

520
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,479
Do you think we're misunderstanding Plub right now?

521
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,719
Not sure.

522
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,638
Even if we misunderstand her regarding Su thee.

523
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,919
but we're not wrong regarding my dad

524
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,479
Tat.

525
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,439
I'll be back.

526
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:17,919
Okay.

527
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,119
Sa.

528
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,119
Here you are.

529
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,479
So...

530
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,159
where's Plubp la?

531
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,439
I saw her

532
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,799
invite Vi kit outside to talk

533
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,159
Kit?!

534
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,519
Yes.

535
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,879
By the way.

536
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,279
when did those two know each other?

537
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,319
They seemed close.

538
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,719
I'll be back.

539
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,639
Mr. Peem!

540
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,999
What tricks are you doing now?!

541
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,439
Well?

542
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,799
What information about my company are you trying to get now?!

543
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,199
Mr. Peem.

544
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,639
We're not talking about work at all.

545
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,559
He came to see

546
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,439
if you can be bought or not!

547
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,919
Mr. Peem!

548
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,519
Hey.

549
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,119
A woman like Plub

550
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,039
can't easily be bought with money

551
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,399
But if I use my heart to buy her.

552
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,639
that's uncertain

553
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,319
She's mine.

554
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,679
I'm not going to give her to you so easily

555
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,839
Are you sure

556
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,759
She's yours?

557
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,479
Mr. Peem.

558
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,759
I think we should go inside

559
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,999
Mr. Peem.

560
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,359
Mr. Vi kit.

561
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,839
Excuse us please

562
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,679
Mr. Peem.

563
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,559
Let's go inside Mr. Peem

564
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,799
Mr. Peem.

565
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,799
Can you calm down?!

566
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,919
Mr. Peem!

567
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,759
What's gotten into you?!

568
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,679
I was just talking to Mr. Vi kit!

00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,439
Why do you have to talk him alone in this kind of area?

570
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,039
I was uncomfortable.

571
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,519
Sol stepped out

572
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,519
I didn't know he was going to follow me

573
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,919
Are you sure

574
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,639
you didn't invite him out to talk?!

575
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,679
What hotel will you guys go to next?
