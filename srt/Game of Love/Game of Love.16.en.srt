1
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,509
What's the matter Pete?

2
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,139
I heard Dad said he wants you to get engaged to Peem.

3
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,769
Gosh Uncle Puchong

4
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,021
I thought they were joking.

5
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,109
If you're not okay with it or feel uncomfortable about it.

6
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,611
tell me

7
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,239
I will go tell Peem togo talk to Dad

8
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,407
You can't!

9
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,909
Why?

10
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,873
I think we should let the elders take care of it

11
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,502
We've passed the generation of them arranging marriages for us!

12
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,253
You can't give in!

13
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,840
Ill go talk to Peem

14
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,926
I like Peem!

15
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:25,663
But...

16
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,544
But Peem likes someone else.

17
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:36,966
Plubpla?

18
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,470
So you know.

19
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,181
So...

20
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,976
you still want to get engaged to Peem?

21
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,186
Yes.

22
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:55,234
Because l think a man like Peem won't be sincere with a woman like that.

23
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:01,949
Pete.

24
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,161
I really like Peem

25
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,873
I've liked him for a long time.

26
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,209
Pete.

27
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,045
Can't you help me get with him?

28
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:24,430
Pete!

29
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,148
That's not true

30
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,860
Sa would allow to get an arranged marriage?

31
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,282
You can't tell tha t Sa really likes you?

32
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:43,824
Hm?

33
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,161
Peem.

34
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,079
Come on.

35
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,665
Sa is perfect.

36
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,542
You're not dating anyone.

37
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,128
Try dating her and get engaged.

38
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,588
For the sake

39
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,131
of Mr s. Umpon.

40
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,885
You love and respect her, don't you?

41
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,304
For her sake?

42
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,515
Or for your sake?

43
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,351
You think I don't know?

44
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:12,645
You want me to get engaged to Sa

45
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,897
sol can stop bothering Plubpla.

46
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,982
Don't accuse me Peem!

47
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,029
I have to take responsibility for what you've done as a father!

48
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,532
But I'm dating Plubpla

49
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,658
You know that

50
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,159
I don't believe you.

51
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:29,787
Regardless,

52
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,956
I am not going to get engaged to Sa.

53
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,958
Don't even try Dad

54
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,087
You have to get engaged!

55
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,263
So that's the story.

56
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,390
No wonder Pete went crazy

57
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,269
How did it become like this?

58
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,037
How was your first day at work?

59
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,039
Pretty rough.

60
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,041
But I can manage.

61
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,003
Did you eat yet?

62
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,213
I had some boat noodles

63
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,341
Go shower and sleep

64
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,384
Okay

65
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:29,763
Plub.

66
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,101
What?

67
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:37,897
Nothing.

68
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:38,689
Forget it.

69
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,109
Be for real.

70
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,236
You want to talk about something?

71
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,367
When I do have something, I'll come find you

72
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:52,912
Okay.

73
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,288
I'm gonna go shower.

74
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:54,997
I'm tired.

75
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,425
For me,

76
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,344
siblings are like a roommate

77
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:09,887
that we can't choose.

78
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,597
We can't change them either

79
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,432
That's true.

80
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,727
When it comes to sister and brother problems,

81
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,729
sometimes we may not like them

82
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,024
or even hate them,

83
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,984
but we love them regardless

84
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,611
Love each other

85
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,948
but it doesn't mean we have to like each other.

86
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,575
A sibling relationship

87
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,035
is quite strange, don't you think?

88
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,042
If what Tre said is true

89
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,128
TRACK E IELD that Mr, Peem really likes you,

90
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,922
what do you think Plub?

91
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:48,801
That's crazy.

92
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,720
Someone like Peem would like me?

93
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,608
If Dad is gonna do this, that means he's not over Plubpla

94
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,194
What should I do?

95
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,411
So,

96
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,162
your dad

97
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,124
is forcing you to get engaged to Sa

98
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,001
to pull you away from Plub?

99
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,797
So then you are planning

100
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,299
to be alone with Plub?

101
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,136
So she can soften up to you?

102
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,262
Did I get it right?

103
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,014
Yes.

104
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,725
But if Plubpla doesn't soften up.

105
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,935
I want my news

106
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,812
that I went out of town and spent the night with Plubpla

107
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,565
to reach my dad.

108
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,859
So he will understand that she's mine now.

109
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,360
So he can stop bothering her.

110
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,530
What does it have to do with me?

111
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,115
Hey.

112
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,827
You woke me up early to listen to your plan

113
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:57,745
and for what?

114
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,623
have thought this plan out.

115
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,584
But I don't know

116
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,587
what to do to make Plubpla go out of town with me.

117
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,963
That's why I have to wake you up

118
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:08,922
to help me think

119
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:11,884
Reasonable.

120
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:13,927
Let me think

121
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,557
Be with you alone

122
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,275
I know.

123
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,362
What is it?

124
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,455
You want me to go to Rayong with Mr. Peem to check out a land?

125
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,414
Yes.

126
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,417
I heard Su thee will be going with Mr, Peem's team.

127
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,502
If you go,

128
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,756
I will have an excuse for Su thee to take our son to the beach.

129
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,132
Please Plub?

130
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,510
I want to take my son to the beach.

131
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,055
What can l do?

132
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,557
I'm only his secretary

133
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,976
I can't choose whether to go or not.

134
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,728
What's so difficult?

135
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,522
I ill call to ask Mr. Peem

136
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,147
Huh?

137
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,317
Tre!

138
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,276
What?!

139
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,864
Hello Mr. Peem

140
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,908
It's me Tre.

141
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,661
Why did you agree to go?!

142
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,996
You already know Peem is trying to sleep with you!

143
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,457
It's because of Tre

144
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,834
She gave me no options

145
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,336
She said Peem had to go talk to the land owner today

146
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,754
Sol have to go too.

147
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,506
It's work.

148
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,092
I didn't know how to say no either.

149
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,178
Hey, you'll be alone with him

150
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,430
Will you even make it back alive?

151
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,265
Hey!

152
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,016
Don't threaten me!

153
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,018
It's true!

154
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,813
Whatever, It's only for one day.

155
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,357
I think I can look after myself

156
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,817
Gosh!

157
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,069
If I didn't have to move condos,

158
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,904
I would have went to keep you company.

159
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,031
Just...

160
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,033
be careful Plub.

161
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,202
Okay, I have to go now.

162
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,495
Peem is here.

163
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,086
Plub.

164
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,922
I hope you will stay strong!

165
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,440
Thank you.

166
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,317
Grandma.

167
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,986
Take your medicine on time

168
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,321
Don't forget.

169
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,615
Sure dear

170
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,825
Don't worry.

171
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,452
Aunt Ta en will be here

172
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,163
I'll remind her.

173
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,206
Every time.

174
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:47,873
Okay?

175
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,292
Get going.

176
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,543
Go to work.

177
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,212
Don't worry about me

178
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,755
Take care of yourself.

179
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,007
Don't forget what I taught you

180
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:58,717
Yes.

181
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,885
Grandma!

182
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,262
Why are you so worried?

183
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,766
Su thee and I will go there tomorrow.

184
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,060
Besides,

185
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,522
Mr Peem will take good care of her

186
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,440
Am I right?

187
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,942
Yes.

188
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,280
I'll take off now.

189
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,325
Bye.

190
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,203
Bye Grandma.
-Don't worry about me.

191
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,704
By e Mrs. Tre.

192
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,375
You want me to go talk to that --

193
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,293
Plub

194
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:36,004
about going to Rayong with you?

195
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:36,964
That's right.

196
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,509
I'll be honest with you.

197
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,596
I want to be alone with Plubpla

198
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:49,309
So that Plubp la can soften up to me.

199
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,353
Gosh!

200
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,730
You're so sweet.

201
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,525
No problem. l'll take care of it.

202
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,117
Grandma.

203
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,163
If you get Mr, Peem Pattaratrakul
asyour grandson in law,

204
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,874
I think our family

205
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,210
will have it easy for the rest of our lives.

206
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,767
Okay.

207
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,394
You can put it down here.

208
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,063
Not so close to the wall though

209
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,525
Excuse me.

210
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,528
Can you put this box in the room?

211
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,821
Follow me.

212
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,072
Be careful.

213
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:53,915
Excuse me.

214
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,834
Someone is moving in?

215
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,544
Yes, that's right.

216
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:04,926
Goodbye peacefulness

217
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,273
From where I told you to that point over there by the tree.

218
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:22,652
Hi.

219
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:23,737
Hello.

220
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:24,738
How's it going?

221
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,281
I like it.

222
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,701
I'll have the construction company come check it out tomorrow again.

223
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,621
Sure. No problem at all!

224
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:36,083
If you'll excuse me I have other errands to do now.

225
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,544
You guys can walk around to check the land out

226
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,045
Yes.

227
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,380
It was nice to meet you

228
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,382
- Thank you.

229
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,347
Mr. Peem.

230
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:55,268
I think this place is quite far from the city and tourist attractions.

231
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,229
You're really going to build a resort here?

232
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,231
Yes, I want to build one here.

233
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,024
Make it a private resort

234
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,276
for customers who want quietness

235
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,446
and make it accessible to nature and community lifestyles.

236
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,200
It's suitable then

237
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:12,994
Do you want to know

238
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,080
why I like this place?

239
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,082
Why?

240
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:21,420
Uncle!

241
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,046
Did you just get back this morning?!

242
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,047
Yes, sir!

243
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,298
What did you get?!

244
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,801
Nothing, The water wasn't good.

245
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,679
Yo!

246
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:32,722
How's it going?!

247
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,436
Yay Peemis here!

248
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:41,106
Hello Peem!
-Hello! How are you?!

249
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,733
-Playing football.
-Are you?

250
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,110
Let me play too.

251
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,112
-Sure.
-Okay

252
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,989
Who's the best player?

253
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,158
When did you get here Mr. Peem?

254
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,744
Hello.

255
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,580
Hello. I just got here.

256
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,415
Aha.

257
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,083
Who is this? She's pretty

258
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,377
Is she your girlfriend?

259
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,717
No. I'm his secretary, I'm here on business with him.

260
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:13,555
You see Auntie? She's so stubborn and won't fall for my charms.

261
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,348
I ranout of tricks with her.

262
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,894
-That's not true.
-You are incompetent young man!

263
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,353
Uncle!

264
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,439
My wife gave in the first time!

265
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,196
Don't believe him. He blabber s too much.

266
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,167
Dear.

267
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,710
Coconut water.

268
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,170
Thank you.

269
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:48,924
This here

270
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,801
are fruits grown from a garden

271
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,304
The farmers gave some to me.

272
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,223
Give it a taste.

273
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,767
-Sure. I'll eat them at home-Okay.

274
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,396
Dear.

275
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,315
Working with Mr, Peem,

276
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:06,942
how is it?

277
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,360
He's a good person, right?'

278
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,698
Mr. Peem?

279
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,075
Well...

280
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,539
sometimes working with him is good.
Other times,a bit difficult

281
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,709
But without him.

282
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,879
the fishermen here wouldn't have a place to live.

283
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,423
Why?

284
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,969
Mr. Peem

285
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,471
came here last year

286
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,473
His boat died over there

287
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,268
My husband found him.

288
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,812
He brought the boat here to get fixed for days.-

289
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:47,732
The creditors came here

290
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,568
and threatened to burn the houses down

291
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,028
They kicked us out of this area.

292
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,614
Mr. Peem saw

293
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,783
and paid off our debt.

294
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,995
That's how we were able to continue living here

295
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,414
Mr Peem comes here often.

296
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,126
He buys the kids things all the time.

297
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:10,046
He even sent some of the kids to go to school in Bangkok.

298
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,673
He's the first person live met

299
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,926
that is a millionaire that is kind and down to earth

300
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,262
I thought they only exist in TV dramas.

301
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:24,102
Now do you know why I like it here?

302
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,313
Yes.

303
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,607
It might be far from the city

304
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,482
but...

305
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,985
it has its charm that I can't explain.

306
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:36,531
It would be nice if you can develop it into a tourist attraction.

307
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:37,699
Right?

308
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,452
If we build a resort here and attract tourists,

309
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:43,038
the villagers can come work at the resort

310
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,874
or make income from delivering produce to our resort.

311
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:47,334
Yeah.

312
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,712
If you can really develop it into a tourist attraction,

313
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,132
the villagers here can open a small homestay

314
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,259
to tourists that

315
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,971
like to stay in a community style.

316
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:00,722
Correct.

317
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:05,226
If fishermen only depend on fishes their hopes will be on the weather.

318
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,355
But if we give them other side jobs,

319
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,523
they won't have to worry about getting their land taken away.

320
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,527
It's unbelievable

321
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,698
that you care about other people too

322
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,033
Wait.

323
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,119
You're telling me Imac old-hearted businessman

324
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,371
who sees everything as money?

325
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:25,705
Yeah.

326
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,748
I can't help it.

327
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,584
You didn't make a good impression the first time l met you

328
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,752
How can I believe it?

329
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:35,006
But if what Is aid makes you feel uneasy,

330
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,050
I'm sorry.

331
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,677
Come here!

332
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,011
Mr. Peem!

333
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,600
You think'm a bad guy, don't you?

334
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,935
I'm bad?

335
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,061
No!

336
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,437
Mr Peem!

337
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,405
I'm bad?!

338
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,660
No!

339
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,297
Right now,

340
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,092
do you see me any better?

341
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:25,598
Hm?

342
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,778
Then...

343
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:41,823
you want to drink some smoothie?

344
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,158
So you can cool down.

345
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,118
A little.

346
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,329
So you can cool down

347
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,122
Please?

348
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,766
Shall we head back?

349
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,106
My sunglasses.

350
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:19,694
Should we go?

351
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,905
Let's go.

352
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,549
Hello Mr. Peem

353
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,343
Did anyone come see me?

354
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,136
They're waiting over there.

355
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,224
Can you take Plub pla to her room?l'llgo talk to them.

356
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,226
I'll help you carry.

357
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,186
This way, Ms. Plub pla

358
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,617
Hello Mr. Peem.

359
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:08,827
How did it go?

360
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:09,953
Here.

361
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:35,019
I've prepared a room for you

362
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,604
This is your room.

363
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,192
This is the best room we have at the resort.

364
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:43,236
Yes.

365
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:45,029
You want me to sleep here?

366
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,738
Yes.

367
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,616
Mr Peem has arranged the best room for you

368
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,494
Yes.

369
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,874
If you need anything, let the staff know.

370
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:56,749
Sure.

371
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,959
Thank you.

372
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,197
I want to thank you for coming to work with me on a weekend.

373
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,116
I hope you will like it.

374
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,159
From Peem.

375
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,622
You know how to say thank you?

376
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:47,884
I can't.

377
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,180
Orn warned me to stay strong

378
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,228
Finally done!

379
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,817
I wonder how P lub is doing.

380
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:06,861
I should call her

381
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,338
This is relaxing.

382
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,551
Turn that thing down!

383
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,013
Be considerate of your neighbor!

384
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,390
Someone moved in next door already!

385
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,391
Hey!

386
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,644
It's only us on this floor!

387
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,187
Can you be considerate?!

388
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,731
Hey!

389
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,197
You!

390
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,701
Why are you here?

391
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,956
Don't tell me

392
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,749
you're...

393
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,126
That's right.

394
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,919
I bought the condo next door.

395
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:08,840
Just my luck.

396
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,049
Wait.

397
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,342
Who's the one that has bad luck?

398
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,969
I just moved in here

399
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,721
and encountered a bad neighbor like you

400
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,683
I'm sorry.

401
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,395
No one informed me that someone moved in next door

402
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,063
So I thought this whole floor

403
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,898
was just me

404
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,276
Don't make excuses.

405
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,778
You should know the law really well.

406
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:35,033
According to Section 370 of the Criminal Code,

407
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,659
those who make noises,

408
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,869
make sounds,

409
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,579
or causes commotions

410
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,581
without reasonable cause,

411
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,417
causing people to be shocked or distressed,

412
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,044
be careful of fines!

413
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,296
I'm sorry.

414
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,381
I won't make noises again.

415
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,261
Alright.

416
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,721
I just moved in here.

417
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,181
I won't blame you this time.

418
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,224
But next time,

419
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,393
please respect other people'srights

420
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,771
like your own rights.

421
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,240
I have her as a neighbor now.

422
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:18,910
It's worse than bad luck

423
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,096
Peem.

424
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:38,846
Tat.

425
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,932
I want to know

426
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,852
who is the best gossip er at our company?

427
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,317
I think next time.

428
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,153
we should order together

429
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,280
I don't get full like this

430
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,533
I get small portions

431
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:01,786
-We should go shopping again next time.
-Yes, please!

432
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,372
Sure!
Today was so much fun!

433
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,833
-Who sent what?
-How are you going home?

434
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,962
Me? I'm going home with you, duh!

435
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,171
That's...

436
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,007
Oh my god!

437
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,551
What is it?!

438
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,679
Look for yourself

439
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,308
That's...

440
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,769
ten wick Big news!

441
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,068
It's not true!

442
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,113
Why is it like this?!

443
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:41,993
It's not true!
-Sa!

444
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,787
-It's not true!
-Sa! What's wrong dear?!

445
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,038
Why is it like this?!

446
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,373
Mom! Dad!

447
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,250
I was about to get engaged to Peem!

448
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,878
Calm down.

449
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:53,087
What's wrong?

450
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,757
Look!

451
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,928
Peem and that woman

452
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,264
went to the beach together

453
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,813
You told me

454
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,566
you won't get involved with the same woman as your son.

455
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:15,318
I hope you didn't forget

456
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,423
You sent the photos to Usa already?

457
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,592
I did.

458
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,011
Good.

459
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,022
I want to know

460
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,025
if Mr. Thaw ip saw those photos

461
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,945
does he still want his daughter

462
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,905
to get engaged to Peem?

463
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,667
I'm doing everything

464
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,002
for you Pete.

465
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,757
If you get to be Mr. Thaw ip's son in law,

466
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,720
the chances of you taking over the company

467
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,347
is high.

468
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:56,711
Sir.

469
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,301
You called me?

470
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:07,930
Was u.

471
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,809
I have an urgent job for you to do.

472
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,644
Crazy!

473
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,188
What am I thinking?

474
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,054
At first,

475
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,098
Peem warned me

476
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,350
to be careful and not associate with Plub.

477
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,852
Because a woman like Plub

478
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,521
does everything for money.

479
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,980
She's worthless.

480
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,275
The whole company saw and knows

481
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:46,070
Peem tried to kick her out of the company.

482
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,238
But.

483
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,490
when Peem knew

484
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,660
that you took interest in Plub

485
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:56,372
he became like this

486
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:03,796
I knew it.

487
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,341
Someone like Peem hates women like Plub.

488
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:11,095
Why did he try to make her go back to work with him?

489
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:13,556
This is why.

490
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,436
The reason he's trying to win her over

491
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,438
is probably because

492
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,773
he wants to defeat you

493
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,070
I just pity Plub.

494
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,281
She has to be a pawn for Peem

495
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,993
You need to pull her away from him.

496
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,995
I'm a woman.

497
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,164
I don't want to see her get hurt.

498
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,126
I will not let him defeat me

499
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,712
by making someone his pawn like this!

500
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:55,973
Aunt Plub!

501
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,141
Sako o!

502
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,060
How are you? Are you tired?

503
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,562
How's it going kiddo?

504
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,771
Was the ride he re tiring?

505
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,983
Say hello to Uncle Peem first.

506
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,985
Hello Uncle Peem.

507
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,487
Mr. Su thee.

508
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,738
Travels went smoothly?

509
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,864
Yes

510
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:13,741
Hey.

511
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,452
Sako o is very excited to be on this trip

512
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,328
Right son?

513
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:18,287
Yes.

514
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,915
Let's go inside.

515
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,416
I had them prepare your rooms.

516
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,460
We'll meet again in the afternoon.

517
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,878
Okay.
-Yay!

518
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,172
Let's go!

519
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:29,548
After you.

520
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,549
- Let's go.
-Yes.

521
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:31,550
Thank you.

522
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,222
Mr. Peem.

523
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,723
How's it going?

524
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,433
Has Pl ub soften up yet?

525
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,353
Not yet.

526
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,279
Damn Plub.

527
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,281
Keep playing hard to get!

528
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,135
How is it Mr. Su thee?

529
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,721
The land is very nice.

530
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,138
Location is excellent.

531
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:21,642
It's peaceful here

532
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,562
It does suit to build a resort here like you said

533
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:27,189
And...

534
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,732
what about construction?

535
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,651
If it's according to the design we discussed,

536
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:31,902
it shouldn't be difficult.

537
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:34,029
I'll ask the engineer once again.

538
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,243
I think we need to fill the ground

539
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,995
and make the ground firmer than before.

540
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,620
That's right.

541
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,039
I agree.

542
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,291
Yes.

543
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:50,212
I'll have someone come next week to handle the transfer.

544
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,754
Sure. My pleasure

545
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:52,423
Sure.

546
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,218
If there's nothing else now,

547
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,345
we should head back to the hotel.

548
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:03,058
I don't know where Tre took our son to.

549
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,563
We shouldn't have brought the child here in the first place.

550
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,524
We came here to work

551
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,452
Is a w Mrs. Trepradub take Sakoo
to the beach over there

552
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,665
Yes. I'll go find Tre then.

553
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,751
Okay,

554
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,969
Tre!

555
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,478
-Dad!
-Ohhey Sakoo!

556
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,063
How's it going?

557
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,815
Dad, I want to get in the water.

558
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,941
Sure!

559
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:55,277
I'll put sunscreen on you so you don't get tan.

560
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:57,863
Are you guys done with work?

561
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,156
Yes.

562
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,033
Where did you take our son?

563
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,534
I couldn't get a hold of you.

564
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,580
I charged my phone back at the resort.

565
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,001
Where's Plubp la?

566
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,419
Plub?

567
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,296
