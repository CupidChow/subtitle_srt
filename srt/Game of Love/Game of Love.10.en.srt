1
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,559
Have you never played this as a kid?

2
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,239
Why do you have to steal children's toys like this?

3
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,199
I'm...

4
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,319
I'm sorry!

5
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,479
Plub, Mr, Peem, are you guys okay?

6
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,959
Are you okay?

7
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,919
In addition to checking the electrical system

8
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,079
and security system,

9
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,359
the other thing I think we need to check really well is..

10
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,479
fire escape.

11
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,719
Yes.

12
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,559
- I'll have --
-No need.

13
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,479
This floor is okay.

14
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,599
Good.

15
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,919
Next floor.

16
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,039
Quickly.

17
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,439
Excuse me.

18
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,839
Wow!

19
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,879
It works.

20
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,559
Wow!

21
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,559
Okay!

22
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,359
Next floor.

23
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,879
'm sorry. Excuse me!

24
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,039
Wow.

25
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,839
This floor works too

26
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,319
Yes.

27
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,239
Wow!

28
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,359
It works.

29
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,239
Next.

30
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,239
But you're sweating

31
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,239
Do you want water?

32
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,519
What?

33
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,639
This floor is good.

34
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,519
Next.

35
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,839
Look.

36
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,599
I know you're pranking me

37
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,359
What do you mean prank?

38
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,399
What boss has the time to prank his subordinate?

39
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,239
A boss like you.

40
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,279
But you still have to do it.

41
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,399
Next.

42
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,119
Go!

43
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,879
Quickly!

44
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,959
You're too much in a hurry You'll get tired.

45
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,079
You need to hang in there Plubpl a

46
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,159
You can't get fired right now

47
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,679
You need the money for Grandma's treatment.

48
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,799
Come in.

49
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,359
Well?

50
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,119
You did some physical work today

51
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,639
do you feel refreshed?

52
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,479
It's okay.

53
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,519
Mr. Peem.

54
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,319
If you're mad that I took the day off abruptly..

55
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,439
I'm not mad.

56
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,879
I'm just possessive of what's mine.

57
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,519
Hey.

58
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,279
What are you talking about?

59
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,479
Who is yours now?

60
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,399
If you don't like it,

61
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,319
I'll rephrase it.

62
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,559
lam yours

63
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,158
What is your deal?

64
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,959
Don't play with me.

65
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,439
I won't fall for your tricks

66
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,679
You're so hard to pursue.

67
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,839
But I'll tell you something

68
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,919
I will not give up so easily

69
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,719
Okay.

70
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,599
Let's go eat.

71
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,359
I'm hungry.

72
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,319
I'm not going.

73
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,919
This is my lunch break

74
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,839
I prefer to eat without seeing my boss's face.

75
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,839
I'm tired.

76
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,679
I took a lot of steps.

77
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,119
Okay?

78
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,279
He smacks my head then rubs me in the back

79
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,919
Hello Tre, what is it?

80
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,799
Is Grandma okay?

81
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,759
Okay.

82
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,759
Tre.

83
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,439
Why did you come to my workplace? Everything okay?

84
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,759
Tre!

85
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,079
Why did you slap me?

86
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,119
This is considered nothing for a bad sister like you!

87
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,399
Plub,you evil girl!

88
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,279
You went and borrowed money from Su thee.

89
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,999
You probably begged him until he gave in and didn't tell me?!

90
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,919
Tre!

91
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,719
Tre, let go!

92
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,319
Borrowed what?! I don't know anything!

93
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,319
Don't talk!

94
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,079
I'm your sister.

95
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,879
How could you do this to me?!

96
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,199
Huh?! How could you?!

97
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,719
Stop it Tre!

98
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,279
Peem!

99
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,159
Don't get involved.

100
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,919
It's her family affair.

101
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,359
But this is my company.

102
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,599
Stop and let's just talk!

103
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,359
I won't talk to you!

104
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,599
You didn't even pay the previous debt and you went to borrow more money from him?!

105
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,239
You're probably going to borrow my husband next.

106
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,279
Don't tell me that you...

107
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,879
are trying to steal my husband?!

108
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,119
Huh Plub?!

109
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,839
Are you trying to steal Su thee?!

110
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,079
-Plub!
-Tre!

111
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,679
You're exaggerating! How could you think that?!

112
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,559
A prostitute like you

113
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,399
is capable of anything!

114
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,559
Look Tre!

115
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,559
Let me go!

116
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,399
You're fighting back?

117
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,199
Go ahead!

118
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,119
Slap me!

119
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,719
Let's see who wins in this fight!

120
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,999
Peem!

121
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,919
No!

122
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,319
I won't fight with my family!

123
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:29,839
Good.

124
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,919
You won't slap

125
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,159
then I will!

126
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,399
That's enough!

127
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,879
Hey!

128
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,079
Who are you?

129
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,079
Let go of me!

130
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,719
I'm going to teach my sister a lesson.

131
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,839
You're an outsider. This is a family matter!

132
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,279
Don't be barbaric in my company!

133
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,479
If you want to teach her,do it someplace else!

134
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,919
But not here.

135
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,639
Please leave.

136
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,119
Gosh! What is going on?!

137
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,199
Security!

138
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,319
Where are you security?!

139
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,319
Come arrest her!

140
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,319
Where did all the securities go?!

141
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,759
I'll leave then.

142
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,199
Plub.

143
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,839
You and I still have things to clear up.

144
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,039
This isn't over.

145
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,359
Are you okay?

146
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,239
Thank you for helping me.

147
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,079
Get back to work. Lunch break is over!

148
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,519
Plubp la is...

149
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,679
not ordinary like you warned me about.

150
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,439
She's even trying to take her brother in law.

151
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,319
This woman is quite scary.

152
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,239
If your boss didn't intervene,

153
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,319
you would have been dead Plub!

154
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,399
I better not catch you trying to steal my husband!

155
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,279
Hello.

156
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,479
Mr. Ohm?

157
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,239
Yes.

158
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,159
Do you need something Ms. Tre?

159
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,719
I want you to keep an eye on Su thee for me.

160
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,159
It's just that

161
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,079
I'm suspicious he might have another woman.

162
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,399
Esp ecially if it's Plub.

163
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,159
Plubpl a,

164
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,799
my own sister.

165
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,599
If you see those two together

166
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,519
you need to immediately tell me.

167
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,959
Sure.

168
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,559
Do not tell Su thee about this matter

169
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,759
Okay.

170
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,279
Bye.

171
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,039
Why did she call?

172
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,679
She's getting suspicious of you cheating

173
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,799
She wants me to keep an eye on you

174
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,319
What?

175
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,559
What are we going to do?

176
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,639
If Tre catches us...

177
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,799
It'll be fine.

178
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,879
Right now,

179
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,039
the person your wife suspects

180
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,799
is her own sister.

181
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,679
Plubpl a?

182
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,839
Yeah.

183
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,239
It's good to let her think that way.

184
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,999
So we'll have more time to spend together

185
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,839
The bank can not approve the loan.

186
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,439
33160

187
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,239
What's up?

188
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,639
Orn.

189
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,519
The bank didn't approve

190
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,359
Stay calm.

191
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,199
Don't stress. There has to be a way

192
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,799
Right!

193
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,079
Why don't you ask for an advance salary?

194
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,599
Can l do that?

195
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,679
Yes.

196
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,759
Some companies have a policy to help employees who are in financial distress

197
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,239
by providing them with salary advances.

198
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,799
Try talking to HR about it.

199
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,839
Oh.

200
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,719
Okay.

201
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,199
I'll talk to them.

202
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,479
Yeah.

203
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,319
Okay.

204
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,119
Thank you so much.

205
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,039
I have to go now.

206
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,039
I have an appointment to settle a case.

207
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,879
Plubp la is..

208
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,159
not ordinary like you warned me about.

209
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,999
She's even trying to take her brother in law.

210
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,759
This woman is quite scary.

211
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,559
This is why

212
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,399
I have to teach her a lesson.

213
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,519
Plubpl a came to ask for a salary advance.

214
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,399
She said she is in need of money.

215
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,639
But we can't approve it because she just started working here

216
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,519
Did she tell you

217
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,079
what she needs the money for?

218
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,439
She said she needed the money for her grandmother'ssurgery.

219
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,119
Thanks.

220
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,239
I guess the medications are n't working for Grand ma Thip.

221
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,719
That's why she needs surgery.

222
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,519
Come in Mr. Tat.

223
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,359
The lawyer is waiting for you.

224
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:06,959
Okay.

225
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,679
Thank you.

226
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,399
You.

227
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,599
Mr. Tat?

228
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,959
Oh, you two know each other?

229
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,319
From listening to you,

230
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,839
I think the weak point of this case is the design company.

231
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,199
Design company?

232
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,679
Yes.

233
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,039
If the defendant insists that they had no intention of copying

234
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,599
I think the problem lies with the design company.

235
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,879
That's true.

236
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,559
Yeah.

237
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,879
Come to think of it,

238
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,799
this case is similar to a case I'm working on.

239
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,559
Really?

240
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,399
I hope it isn't the same case.

241
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,639
But your case is overseas, no?

242
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,399
Yes.

243
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,599
Right.

244
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,799
There's no way it's the same case.

245
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,759
Yes.

246
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,879
Yeah.

247
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,959
Gosh! Why am I unlucky like this?!

248
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,959
It's over.

249
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,719
The man of my dream.

250
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,999
Was this your plan?

251
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,319
You knew that I represented PP World

252
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,079
No!

253
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,279
I was only joking then.

254
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,759
I didn't think it would be true.

255
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,759
I don't believe you.

256
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,759
You pretended to get close to me

257
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,999
just to get information from me, right?

258
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,239
Are you crazy?!

259
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,439
I didn't even know what case you were working on!

260
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,959
Most importantly,you're the one that gave me advice.

261
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,639
But you lied to me

262
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,159
You said it was an overseas case.

263
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,919
Well,

264
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,999
lawyers must protect their clients'information.

265
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,639
How can I tell you the truth?

266
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,519
You're good with making excuses.

267
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,319
But at least I now know your intention for approaching me.

268
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,159
That's good enough.

269
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,799
From now on,

270
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,559
other than the court,

271
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,799
I hope I don't see you anymore.

272
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,679
Excuse me.

273
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,559
You are excused!

274
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,959
When I finally like a guy

275
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,639
Why is my life tragic?

276
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,159
I guess I'm going to end up being a spinster like Plub

277
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,439
Where dol get the money for Grandma'ssurgery?

278
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,839
Why don't you borrow money from Mr Puchong?

279
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,679
He likes you, no?

280
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,839
He might even give you the money for free.

281
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,759
There's no such thing as free things Tre.

282
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,079
They always want something in return.

283
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,039
QUICK LOAN SERVICE

284
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,199
19,
Hello
149

285
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,479
19,
Is Grandmaokay?!
149

286
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,039
19,
149

287
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,599
Someone paid for my grandmother's surgery?

288
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,679
Yes.

289
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,799
The doctor came to examine the patient today.

290
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,799
Your grandmother is healthy and strong.

291
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,119
She's ready for the surgery.

292
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,399
The doctor has scheduled her surgery tomorrow.

293
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,559
Who paid for it?

294
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,399
The person visiting your grandmother.

295
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,279
He came to submit his intention

296
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,839
of being the person responsible for all the expenses.

297
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,879
I thought you knew.

298
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,239
The person visiting?

299
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:54,999
Yes.

300
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,239
Is he still here?

301
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,039
Yes.

302
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,439
Thank you.

303
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,959
Plub,who are you looking for?

304
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,919
Grandma.

305
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,079
The nurse said you have a visitor.

306
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,039
Yes.

307
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,119
Are you looking for me?

308
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,799
Here's your fruit Grandma.

309
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,719
Guaranteed sweet.

310
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,159
It's washed by the hands of a sweet person like me.

311
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,959
Look at you!

312
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,799
Sounds like you're courting a lady.

313
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,039
Who knows?

314
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,759
If Iwasborn 40years earlier,

315
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,199
I might have been a dangerous competitor with Plubpl a'sgrandfather.

316
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,119
Thank you so much.

317
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,599
You're the one

318
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,279
that paid for my grandmother's surgery?

319
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:15,999
Yes.

320
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,399
HR told me you came to ask for an advance salary.

321
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,359
But by the company's rule

322
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,959
employees who has n'tworked for a year can not apply for it.

323
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,919
That's how I found out you needed the money for your grandmother's surgery.

324
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,959
Why didn't you tell me?

325
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,039
Why do I have to?

326
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,879
Because I'm worried.

327
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,159
Look Mr. Peem.

328
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,959
The reason you helped me,

329
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,639
what do you really want from me?

330
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,839
I don't want anything.

331
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,759
I just want to help Grand ma Thip.

332
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,519
Just solely help her.

333
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,319
You're over thinking.

334
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,319
But...

335
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,679
that's a lot of money.

336
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,879
Right now,

337
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,079
there's nothing more important

338
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,879
than Grand ma Thip's life.

339
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,279
I know you still feel uneasy.

340
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,399
I won't give it to you for free.

341
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,799
It's a loan.

342
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,439
Feel better?

343
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,399
Yes.

344
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,639
In that case,

345
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,879
you can deduct it from my salary.

346
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,399
Up to you.

347
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,479
want to thank you for helping.

348
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,879
so,

349
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,879
now do you believe me

350
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,039
that I really like you?

351
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,039
-What is your deal?
-I'm kidding!

352
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,599
You're taking it serious again.

353
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,279
I thought you said you're just helping my grandmother and it has nothing to do with me?

354
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:09,999
Well,

355
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,079
people

356
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,799
need...

357
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,239
to have some hope.

358
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,279
Please?

359
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,319
Just a little

360
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,519
I think

361
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,679
you...you...you should go before you get stuck in traffic.

362
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,199
Go.

363
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,999
Honey

364
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,999
That's Plub.

365
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,639
Who was she talking to?

366
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,599
Her friend,may be

367
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,399
He looked handsome.

368
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,399
Must be her boyfriend.

369
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,519
I think what's important right now is that I took you out for a walk way too long.

370
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,919
You should go back to rest in your room.

371
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,719
Let's go.

372
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,879
Now do you believe me

373
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,159
that I really like you?

374
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,879
If you don't tell me,

375
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,679
I won't be able to sleep tonight

376
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,639
Please? Pretty please?

377
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,559
Please?

378
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,599
I don't believe you.

379
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,639
Mr. Peem!

380
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,479
What the hell are you doing?!

381
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,599
Why are you being shy?

382
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,999
Why are you some an like this?

383
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,359
I just helped your grandmother.

384
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,559
Why are you mean to me?

385
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,519
Look.

386
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,759
You're lucky that I'm not pressing charges for sexual assault right now!

387
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,959
If you're helping Grandma just because you want something in return..

388
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,439
Okay! Okay!

389
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,959
I don't want anything in return

390
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,239
You don't believe me that I like you.

391
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,039
So lproved it to you.

392
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,959
Hey.

393
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,319
Don't do this again

394
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,399
Okay.

395
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,719
Next time if I want to kiss you on the cheek

396
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,519
l'llask permission.

397
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,239
Mr, Peem! Do you understand what I'm saying to you?!

398
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,359
May l?

399
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,799
Plubpl a.

400
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,159
I give you permission to take a leave of absence

401
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,159
until your grandmother's surgery is done.

402
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,519
You don't need to go to work

403
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,439
Effective from tomorrow onwards

404
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,559
You get on my nerves!

405
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,239
Keep playing hard to get.

406
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,759
I'll make you fall for my charms.

407
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,959
Peem went ahead and paid for Plubpl a's
grandmother's surgery before I did?

408
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,399
I'm sorry sir.

409
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,759
I didn't think Mr. Peem would know about it too.

410
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:42,959
Also,

411
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,199
- I was --
Careless?

412
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,719
Useless!

413
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,519
Peem is trying to win Plubpl a's heart.

414
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,159
Wonderful.

415
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,119
Father and son fighting over the same woman.

416
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,399
Be careful

417
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,639
If that woman ends up being pregnant

418
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,359
the relatives won't be ranked correctly.

419
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,559
How are we going to address each other?

420
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,879
Dad?

421
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,559
Or Grandpa?

422
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,639
No one thinks as shamelessly as you

423
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,439
We're not animals that reproduce indiscriminately.

424
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,439
If Peem is serious about her, I'll back off

425
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,199
But he's just using her as a tool

426
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,119
to defeat me, that is all.

427
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,399
I don't want a good kid to get used.

428
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,719
You're good at playing the hero

429
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,159
But let your words align with your heart

430
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,559
Someone like you

431
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,319
would give that woman to Peem?

432
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,879
You're that good of a father?

433
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,199
Didn't I warn you

434
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,439
if you don't want any trouble, stay in your lane?

435
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,599
Don't meddle in my personal business

436
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,319
I don't want to meddle

437
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,199
if I didn't know that woman was being indiscriminate

438
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,279
Sleeping with the same man as her sister.

439
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,159
What are you talking about?

440
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,039
You don't know?

441
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,199
That precious woman of yours

442
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,759
got slapped by her sister at the company.

443
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,279
It was for having an affair with her own brother in law.

444
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,079
That's not true. You're misunderstanding.

445
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,959
Plubpl a isn't that kind of woman.

446
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,919
Whatever makes you sleep at night.

447
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,319
Serves you right!

448
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,079
You're so confident!

449
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,439
Why do we have to move hospitals?

450
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,879
I thought you said this hospital

451
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,519
has the best doctor already?

452
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,599
Well.

453
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,079
we have to move hospitals because...

454
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,279
because.

455
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,839
this doctor treats at many hospitals

456
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,599
I've talked with him about the hospital that l..

457
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,799
want you to transfer to, he works there.

458
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,079
The environment there is great.

459
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,079
He thinks it will suit you better there.

460
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,439
But I think

461
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,839
this hospital is already great.

462
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,239
Or.

463
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,119
is it too expensive?

464
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,679
Sort of the reason.

465
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,439
Gosh.

466
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,039
Why didn't you just tell me?

467
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,039
We can transfer.

468
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,319
Thank you for understanding.

469
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,719
I'm gonna step outside for a bit.

470
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,439
Special Interview with the Vice Chairman of PPWorld Peem Pattaratrakul

471
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,719
I'm sorry Kaew.

472
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,799
I don't want to lose you

473
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,119
So has Plubpla soften up to you yet?

474
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,719
I don't know.

475
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,999
She says no.

476
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,638
But her heart is uncertain

477
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,079
You're investing too much.

478
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,638
What happens if she doesn't pay you back?

479
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,519
That's fine.

480
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,158
I don't want the money back

481
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,079
really want to help Grand ma Thip

482
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,999
What is your deal?

483
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,919
You want to help the grandmother but teach the granddaughter a lesson?

484
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,198
They're different people

485
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,638
Grandma is Grandma.

486
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,919
Granddaughter is granddaughter

487
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,919
What about you?

488
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,919
How's the case coming along?

489
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,799
Thinking about it makes me angry.

490
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,039
Female lawyers are scary

491
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,479
What?

492
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,559
I thought you said you will definitely win?

493
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,479
That guy thinks it was my plan to investigate the case.

494
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,239
Disgusting!

495
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,159
How could he think that?

496
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,279
I'm a lawyer, not a criminal

497
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,439
Orn, calm down.

498
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,959
From listening to you,

499
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,519
the situation is easy to misunderstand

500
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,439
Yeah, yeah.

501
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,799
I'll take it as my bad luck.

502
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,679
Let's talk about you.

503
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,879
That Peem guy seems like a good person,
don't you think?

504
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,999
You can't tell over this

505
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,439
if he's good or not.

506
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,679
Maybe he's

507
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,159
doing good in hopes of something

508
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,399
I have to keep an eye out first.

509
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,759
Yeah.

510
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,759
You're right.

511
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,039
The only way for us women to know when the men approach us

512
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,799
is sincere or just wants sex,

513
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,519
is to stall time.

514
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,359
Learn about him as long as you can.

515
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,559
Yes,

516
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,759
Ms. Guru.

517
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,559
But yeah.

518
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,999
You don't need to worry.

519
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,439
Whether he's sincere or wants sex, regardless I...

520
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,479
will not let it happen to me

521
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,639
Yeah.

522
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,159
I have to go.

523
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,079
That's enough!

524
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,399
Hey!

525
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,639
Who are you?

526
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,559
Let go of me!

527
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,359
I'm going to teach my sister a lesson.

528
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,399
You're an outsider. This is a family matter!

529
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,799
Don't be barbaric in my company!

530
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,959
If you want to teach her,do it someplace else!

531
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,519
But not here.

532
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,199
Right now,

533
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,479
there's nothing more important

534
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,279
than Grand ma Thip's life.

535
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,679
So you can be a good person.

536
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,799
But from now on,

537
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,799
I will make you believe

538
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,999
that I really like you.

539
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,039
Like?

540
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,199
A man like that would really like someone like me?

541
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,639
Don't believe words from someone like that Plubpl a.

542
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,079
Stop thinking about him

543
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,839
Mr. Peem!

544
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,599
You have to make her like you.

545
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,079
not you like her!

546
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,399
Stop thinking about her!
