1
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,999
I don't think I have any work matter to discuss with you

2
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,559
Why did a small employee like you

3
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,879
come to see me?

4
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,279
Yesterday someone sent thugs to go destroy my grandmother's shop.

5
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,399
It got her hospitalized.

6
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,319
And?

7
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,519
Why are you telling me this?

8
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,159
What do I have to do with it?

9
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,279
Are you sure you're not involved?

10
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,559
What are you doing?

11
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,079
Chairman!

12
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,039
Hello.

13
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,759
What are you doing here?

14
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,319
Are you accusing me of doing it?

15
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:00,919
Hmm?

16
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,039
Because you are misunderstanding me with the chairman

17
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,119
You're unhappy that he hired me

18
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,359
so you sent those thugs to destroy my grandmother's shop.

19
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,479
Am I right?

20
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,479
What are you talking about?!

21
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,439
You can't find a culprit

22
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,879
so you're accusing me now?

23
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,359
It's fine if you won't admit to it.

24
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,799
I didn't come here to pursue the matter with you

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,559
But I came here to tell you

26
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,959
that there's nothing going on between me and the chairman.

27
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,239
He's the chairman and I'm the secretary.

28
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,399
Don't misunderstand me

29
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,319
Do not mess with my family.

30
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,919
Otherwise I will come after you.

31
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,079
You're crossing the line right now!

32
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,719
Puchong.

33
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,679
Puchong, I....

34
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,359
Su.

35
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,479
Let's go home and talk

36
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,559
Right now.

37
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,559
I think overall it's okay

38
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,879
It's good. You might have to add colors to make it more eye-catching

39
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,039
Looks okay.

40
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,959
Pardon me Mr. Peem

41
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,879
HR wants to bring the intern here to introduce them.

42
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,319
Oh, bring them in.

43
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,959
Okay.

44
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,599
Alright.

45
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,479
-Come in.
-Something like this.

46
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,479
Just fix what I recommended!

47
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,919
Oh!

48
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,519
Usa!

49
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,119
Hello Peem

50
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,479
Why didn't you tell me you were interning here?

51
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,879
ORI It's a small matter.

52
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,159
I can do it myself.

53
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,679
I didn't want to bother you.

54
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,279
You're busy.

55
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,839
What department do you want to work in?

56
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,639
I want to learn about everything

57
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,119
Soll know which job I like and what II'm good at.

58
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,439
Good.

59
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,519
Pardon me.

60
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,279
Peem.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,759
Tat.

62
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,839
-Hello.
-Hello.

63
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,439
Sa will be interning here.

64
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,839
Let me know if you need help with anything

65
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,439
Peem.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,079
Everyone.

67
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,919
Can we have a discussion for a moment?

68
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,119
Let me talk to him real quick.

69
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,479
-You can go outside-l'll be right back

70
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,319
PPW-Just add that.
-Okay.

71
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,919
Okay.

72
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,879
What's up?

73
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,679
The employees are gossiping

74
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,559
that your dad and Ms. Su are arguing.

75
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,599
Really?

76
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,199
They were walking out of the company as I was entering.

77
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,599
The chairman looked really angry.

78
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,719
Madam's face was also upset.

79
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,719
I think they got into an argument.

80
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,919
Do you know what it was about?

81
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,319
What else can it be?

82
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,799
It's about the new young front desk girl.

83
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,399
Come here.

84
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,319
Oh my!

85
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,639
So that means...

86
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,439
she's the chairman's mistress?

87
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,799
You guys.

88
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,759
Think about it. If she's not

89
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,319
would Ms. Su be that jealous?

90
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,119
You're right.

91
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,359
I figured.

92
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,239
Hey.

93
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,079
She keeps calling him too.

94
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,919
She even had me check the chairman's schedule

95
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,039
-But his new woman is beautiful though!
-Yeah she is.

96
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,359
So are you going to fix the problem

97
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,199
or make it a bigger problem?

98
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,919
Or did you purposely make my father and my step mother get into an argument?

99
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,639
You're pretty bad.

100
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,159
It's not like that

101
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,999
Whether it is or not.

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,399
half of the company already understood that you and my father

103
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,879
have something going on.

104
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,479
So?

105
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,479
No matter how well I do

106
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,759
not everyone will agree to it.

107
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,359
So why should l care about those people that don't know me well?

108
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,999
You're good at comforting yourself.

109
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,839
But if you want to change your mind

110
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,799
and want my help.

111
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,159
you can come see me.

112
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,079
I'll be waiting.

113
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,599
Hey.

114
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,679
Where have you been, Boss?

115
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,359
I went to send Usa off.

116
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,639
I went to check my accomplishment.

117
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,439
What accomplishment?

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,879
My plan of having Su as my helper

119
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,439
It worked better than l expected.

120
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,559
Mr. Pete.

121
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,039
-Welcome home.
- Thank you.

122
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,399
What's wrong?

123
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,679
No one is home?

124
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,798
Oh, they all went to work.

125
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,439
No one probably cares

126
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,479
that I got discharged from the hospital

127
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,999
Mr. Peem did tell me to tell you

128
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,239
he will be home to have dinner with you

129
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,799
He also asked me

130
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,639
to clean up your room before you got home.

131
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,199
Why can't I be born as Peem's son instead?

132
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,039
Ah, your parents are home

133
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,919
They probably remember that you would be home today.

134
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,319
Stop right there!

135
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,519
Don't walk away from me!

136
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,879
Do you have a conscience before you do something?!

137
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,639
Do you have a conscience

138
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,399
to hire that girl?

139
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,679
Or is it just filled with emotions and lust?

140
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,119
Don't you dare think I don't know that you like her.

141
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,319
Dad! Mom!

142
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,839
What's going on now?!

143
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,519
Keep talking smart

144
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,839
You want her as your other wife.

145
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,159
So what?

146
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,839
Whoever I like or love, it's my business.

147
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,079
Don't get involved!

148
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,519
Why can't I get involved?!

149
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,799
I'm your wife.

150
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,719
You have no right to mess with other women!

151
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,519
That is why I'm tired of you because you act this way!

152
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,319
Don't you dare think I don't know that you had someone follow me around!

153
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,239
Why?

154
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,519
I have the right.

155
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,399
What crazy right of yours is that?!

156
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,319
Man ee was my lawful wife

157
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,479
and she didn't go this far!

158
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,199
Lawful wife?

159
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,239
But she couldn't tolerate it so she left you!

160
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,039
Of course.

161
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,039
Who can live

162
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,399
with a player like you?

163
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,039
Watch your mouth

164
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,599
I'm speaking the truth!

165
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,439
The truth?!

166
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,959
You want to know another truth?!

167
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,239
The most thing l regret the most in my life was get involved with a woman like you!

168
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,519
How can you speak like that to me?!

169
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,359
You bastard!

170
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,399
-How can you speak to me like that?!
-Mom! Mom!

171
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,399
- How can you say that?!
Mom calm down!

172
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,279
Mom!

173
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,719
The reason Man ee ran away

174
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,359
is because of you!

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,999
Mom.

176
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,759
Stage 3 colon cancer is when the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes

177
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,959
We must surgically remove as many lymph nodes as much as possible

178
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,519
You will also need chemo

179
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,839
to prevent cancer from resurfacing and invading again.

180
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,839
It's you again.

181
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,959
It's grain drink.

182
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,399
Drinking it will make you healthy

183
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,519
Thank you so much.

184
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,039
My grandmother has coronary artery disease.

185
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,039
The doctor said if it can't be treated with medications

186
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,319
then she might need surgery.

187
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,079
At first I..

188
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,599
was concern how to tell her.

189
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,279
Does she know yet?

190
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,519
Yes.

191
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,319
I told her in the end.

192
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,159
How is she?

193
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,679
I think when it comes to these sicknesses,

194
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,159
it's already hurting our bodies enough

195
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,919
We shouldn't let it hurt our feelings as well

196
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,919
It's hard to comfort a sick patient.

197
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,439
Your grandmother is really strong.

198
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,119
You too.

199
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,199
Don't let anything hurt your feelings.

200
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,399
Thank you so much

201
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,999
for coming here to give me moral support

202
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,559
Sure.

203
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,799
Mom.

204
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,479
Do you want to eat something?

205
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,599
Where's your father?

206
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,639
Why do you care?

207
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,879
He hurt your feelings.

208
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,039
He doesn't seem to care about you.

209
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,479
But I care.

210
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,119
I spent as much times as your life

211
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,079
to come to this point.

212
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,919
I won't let anyone take that away from me.

213
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,039
It must be Plu bpl a's plan

214
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,439
You mean...

215
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,959
Tong's sister?

216
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,639
Yes.

217
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,639
She wants to steal your father from me.

218
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,599
She wants your father

219
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,159
to know that I

220
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,799
sent people to threaten her subtly

221
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,439
This girl

222
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,279
is really evil!

223
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,479
Do you have the address of the person named Tong yet?!

224
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,039
What are you gonna major in?

225
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,199
I don't know.

226
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,279
You want to go to class?

227
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,679
What is it Tong?

228
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,239
You get to school first. ill catch up.

229
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,519
You want to apply here?

230
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,759
Hey Tong.

231
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,479
You need to thank your sister.

232
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,838
Do you know how much trouble she went through just to help you?

233
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,279
That's right.

234
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,598
Thank you.

235
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,319
O just...

236
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,999
don't want to be seen as a burden.

237
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,879
I hope you get the job.

238
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,519
I came to get documents for the chairman

239
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,879
She's the chairman's new front desk?

240
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,959
New front desk or new woman?

241
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,039
Thank you.

242
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,839
It's good to be born beautiful.

243
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,079
You can use it as a ladder for your life

244
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,839
I'm sorry. I didn't see you

245
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,519
I hope you don't go tell the chairman to get me fired.

246
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,719
I'm so scared!

247
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,919
I have to go now.

248
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,999
Oops! I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

249
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,719
I didn't mean to!

250
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,799
Hey, don't tell Ms. Supang this.

251
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,319
I'm scared.

252
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,999
You!

253
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,919
If you're nice to me, I'll be nicer.

254
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,759
But if you're bad to me, I'll be much worse to you!

255
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,999
I'll get you later!

256
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,399
I'll help you.

257
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,639
Thank you.

258
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,159
Don't pay attention to them.

259
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,119
Some people if they get to gossip or criticize others,

260
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,119
it's considered their accomplishment.

261
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,319
Because that's all they can do

262
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,519
I always think

263
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,599
other people'swords can hurt you if

264
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,799
you take it to heart.

265
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,959
I don't care about them.

266
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,679
Good.

267
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,639
Thank you so much Usa for...

268
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,319
comforting me

269
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,559
When we only just met.

270
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,519
It's fine.

271
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,479
I'm the only intern here.

272
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,399
I'm actually looking for a friend.

273
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,959
Then shall we be friends?

274
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,799
Oh!

275
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,439
Peem.

276
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,239
You and I seem to always compete with each other.

277
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,679
I never saw you as my competition.

278
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,679
How did it turn out like this?!

279
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,719
Didn't I tell you not to lose to him?!

280
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,519
Damn it!

281
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,039
I told you

282
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,439
I never saw you as my competition.

283
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,959
I heard Kit spent a lot of money

284
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,319
to find out what the numbers in the bid envelopes from our company are.

285
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,799
Kit probably didn't expect that we would i release fake news even to people in our own company.

286
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,079
He must be really pissed right now

287
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,039
I can't help it.

288
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,719
Oh hey Peem!

289
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,159
I'm sorry. I guess I have to call you Vice Chairman here.

290
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,239
For you,

291
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,679
you can call me anything

292
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,159
Sa.

293
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,119
It's noon. Do you want to have lunch with me?

294
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,039
I am already going to have lunch with Plu b

295
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,959
It's okay Usa.

296
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,479
You can go with the Vice Chairman.

297
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,039
-But -
- It's really fine.

298
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,119
I just want to eat something simple so l can get back'to work.

299
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,359
No wonder my father likes you

300
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,119
You're diligent like this.

301
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,719
Enjoy your lunch.

302
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,839
Excuse me.

303
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,719
Peem.

304
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,799
Why tea se Plub like that?

305
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,599
She's already stressed out about it.

306
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,199
Tat.

307
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,559
Come join us.

308
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,959
I'll excuse myself

309
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,119
I need to go get my car from the shop.

310
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,239
See ya.

311
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,959
Just us two now.

312
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,839
That's right.

313
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,839
Let's go eat.

314
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,959
I'm hungry now.

315
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,119
Usa.

316
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,599
I want to...

317
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,599
warn you about something.

318
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,079
What about?

319
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,079
About being friends with people

320
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,999
Who are you referring to?

321
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,319
Plu bpl a.

322
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,719
I think this woman is conniving

323
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,559
and very smart.

324
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,119
I think

325
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,239
she isn't that kind of person.

326
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,679
You just met her.

327
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,599
Just wait and see.

328
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,079
Then decide.

329
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,119
But seems like you already made your decision on her

330
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:07,999
Sa.

331
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,359
Are you mocking me?

332
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,799
It's not like that.

333
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,999
She just started working here.

334
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,599
You just met her too.

335
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,599
Sa.

336
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,399
I've met a lot of people

337
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,119
I can read people

338
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,959
That kind of woman

339
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,679
is ambitious.

340
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,879
I've known you since you were a child.

341
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,039
I know you have a kind heart.

342
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,879
I don't want a bad woman to deceive you for her own benefit

343
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,319
Okay.

344
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,359
l understand

345
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,959
I will be careful

346
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,799
You lost to him again!

347
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,559
I won't mess up again Dad.

348
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,679
Don't lose again.

349
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,439
Don't make me more disappointed in you

350
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,679
Otherwise

351
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,599
I will take back all the positions from you!

352
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,799
Yes, Dad.

353
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,599
Damn it!

354
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,639
Peem!

355
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,679
All good?

356
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,799
Yes.

357
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,279
Wait one moment while I go get your key

358
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,999
Sure.

359
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,959
Oh hey.

360
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,839
You came to fix your car too?

361
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,999
Yes.

362
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,079
I came to fix it just like you.

363
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,999
Oh okay.

364
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,839
I have no knowledge on mechanical things.

365
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,159
Also, I don't have a regular shop to go to so I just follow the other person.

366
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,239
Okay.

367
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,359
My car is fixed.

368
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,519
I have nothing else here.

369
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,359
Wait!

370
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,879
Do you want to have a meal together?

371
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,519
My treat.

372
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,679
Consider it an apology for not allowing you to use your car for days.

373
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,079
Sure.

374
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,319
I can push her.

375
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,919
He can push for you right?

376
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,639
Let's go.

377
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,879
Who are you?

378
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,559
Here's your water.

379
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,119
I'll have my other secretary handle the damages at your shop.

380
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,519
That's okay.

381
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,999
The plants at the shop don't cost a lot.

382
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,919
No. Even though it don't cost a lot, it's still damaged.

383
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,559
Please let me compensate to make me feel at ease.

00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,879
Sure.

I'm sorry Chairman.

387
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,439
I didn't know you were coming.

388
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,439
Geez Plu b.

389
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,199
You're so late.

390
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,319
Mr, Puchong has been waiting so long

391
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,799
That's okay.

392
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,759
I didn't tell you I was coming. I wanted to surprise you.

393
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,239
But seems like you knew first.

394
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,599
I called her.

395
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,279
I'll formally introduce you then.

396
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,879
I'm Trepr a dub

397
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,359
Pl ub's older sister.

398
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,359
That's right!

399
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,999
My husband Suthee

400
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,559
owns Suthee Construction Co.

401
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,679
He accepted work from PP World!

402
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,999
Please look after him.

403
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,519
Thank you for the opportunity

404
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,479
Thank you so much for visiting my grandmother.

405
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,199
Of course I would come.

406
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,399
I have to apologize to her on Su's behalf

407
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,199
You understand me, do you?

408
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,759
I did it because

409
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,479
I have to protect my family.

410
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,359
l understand.

411
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,159
I've had it with Su myself

412
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,559
She gets unreasonably jealous

413
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,639
Me telling you this,

414
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:19,959
you must think I'm a player who is blaming everything on my wife.

415
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,279
I wouldn't dare think that way

416
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,759
Smart answer.

417
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,279
When you get to my age, you will know that everything in this world

418
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,199
have a wrong path for people to take.

419
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,799
I've done wrong to someone that I love the most in my life

420
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,439
Peem's mother, Manee.

421
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,439
If...you think everything that has happened

422
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,439
is a process that allows us to grow,

423
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,599
you...

424
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,399
learned about yourself from your past.

425
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,519
You wouldn't ruin your present and future.

426
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,719
I believe it that way.

427
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,839
You seem more mature than I thought

428
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,079
Do you know

429
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,999
you have a lot of things

430
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,439
similar to Peem's mother?

431
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,079
The closer I am to you

432
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,639

442
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,239
No problem.

443
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,119
My company usually does over time anyway.

444
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,519
We should head to the meeting room then

445
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,999
-Yes.
-Let's go.

446
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,479
Hey Peem.

447
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,639
Was that the same Suthee with Plu bp la at the pub?

448
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,519
Yeah.

449
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,439
Do you think this boss and subordinate duo is giving weird looks to each other?

450
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,559
Just keep working Don't pay attention to that

451
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,959

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,559

But this is about your brother!

Why aren't you picking up To ng?

Excuse me.

Sure.

511
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,399
What do you want?

512
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,479
The employee here talks so rudely to the customers

513
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,559
Yeah.

514
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,359
Were you disciplined?

515
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,839
What would you like?

516
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,719
This too.

517
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,079
This, this.

518
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,839
Three of this.

519
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,959
Four of this.

520
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,639
This too.

521
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,239
Also, this and this.

522
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,599
This, this

523
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,759
This too.

524
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,959
Drinks too.

525
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,039
Never mind

526
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,479
I changed my mind.

527
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,719
What?!

528
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,559
Why?

529
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,079
Customers here can't change their mind?

530
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,479
Hey.

531
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,719
If you guys are here to pick a fight,

532
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,559
wait until my shift is over.

533
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,199
Other people will get in trouble

534
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,519
As if you're such a good person

535
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,359
You're a good person?

536
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,879
You're thoughtful of other people?!

537
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,519
If you're not going to order, then leave!

538
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,559
Hey!

539
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,919
You can chase away customers?

540
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,399
Is something wrong?

541
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,639
This employee here

542
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,359
kicked me out!

543
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,199
Really Tong?

544
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,639
They didn't come here to order.

545
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,199
They're just here to mess with me.

546
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,639
Hey!

547
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,919
Are you blaming this on us?

548
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,839
Hey!

549
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,879
Calm down

550
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,439
Stay calm.

551
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,799
Please don't fight here!

552
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,439
You guys are ganging up on me?!

553
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,199
Don't you dare think

554
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,759
that you can hurt me like last time.

555
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,279
Please stop! Tong!

556
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,239
This is for hurting me!

557
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,599
And this is for your sister making my mom cry!

558
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,839
My sister?

559
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,639
What does my sister have to do with it?!

560
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,639
Your sister was seducing my dad!

561
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,799
That's not true!

562
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,039

Huh?!

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,239
Stop! Enough already!
