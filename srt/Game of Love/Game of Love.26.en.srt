1
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,479
Putter has a good family now.

2
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,879
He has everything.

3
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,879
He's happy.

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,879
He doesn't need you in his life.

5
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,239
Uncle Peem left?

6
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,519
From now on,

7
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,039
don't go near Uncle Peem again

8
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,759
Why?

9
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,599
Because...

10
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,039
I will be sad.

11
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,319
Can you do that for me?

12
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,639
Yes.

13
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,879
I can't be near Uncle Peem.

14
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,599
Plubpl a told me

15
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,399
our son has a great family now

16
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,199
He doesn't need me in his life

17
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,399
She said

18
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,759
I'm going to ruin his life.

19
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,559
What Plubpl a said is true though

20
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,119
Plubp la is married.

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,879
She married Kit.

22
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,159
If you are still pestering her

23
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,839
that's like...

24
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,359
you're hurting her again

25
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,639
But do I deserve to be hated on

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,639
deserve to be separated from my son?

27
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,159
Til this day, I still don't know who recorded us and leaked the clip.

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,199
Why am I the only one getting punished for it?

29
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,399
The world isn't fair to me!

30
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,359
Putter!

31
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,359
Are you hurt?

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,319
No, I'm just in shock

33
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,079
I'm sorry dear.

34
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,799
Sir.

35
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,079
What kind of driving was that?

36
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,359
We almost crashed.

37
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,439
If you are still messing with the man who has an owner,

38
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,319
next time won't be an almost.

39
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,159
What are you talking about?

40
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,719
Are you misunderstanding?

41
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,119
No.

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,839
Why did Uncle S aan choose not to work with my company?

43
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,799
I'm actually curious about something.

44
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,479
What is it?

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,879
Have you ever shown the contract of your offer

46
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,679
to anyone before?

47
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,919
Why?

48
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,039
V Group'soffer

49
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,159
looks exactly like yours.

50
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,599
But there was one point

51
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,719
where they offered a better condition.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,119
So they won.

53
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,159
I don't know what is happening at your company

54
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,559
but my father made his decision already

55
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,719
He sends his apologies

56
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,078
and appreciation

57
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,079
for taking interest in our restaurant.

58
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,679
If you have no other questions,

59
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,359
I have to get back to work.

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,919
Pete.

61
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,359
What are you trying to do?

62
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,279
Do what?

63
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,199
You know what lim talking about

64
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,479
How would I know?

65
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,319
Why did our offer and Kit'soffer

66
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,159
look exactly alike?

67
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,319
Except for one point.

68
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,559
That made him beat us.

69
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,559
If you ire asking me, then who do I ask?

70
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,879
I just went to talk to him

71
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,959
just like you told me to.

72
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,879
If someone is at fault

73
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,079
it should be you

74
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,159
Pete!

75
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,479
Peem.

76
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,599
What are you doing here?

77
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,439
Is there a problem?

78
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,679
No Mom.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,719
Peem just

80
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,999
came to ask about work.

81
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,799
But what do you need Mom?

82
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,399
Oh.

83
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,039
Your father wants to see you.

84
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,599
I don't know what it's about either.

85
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,719
What happened Pete?

86
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,679
How could you let a small steak restaurant like that fall in their hands?

87
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,679
What kind of negotiation did you do?

88
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,839
You can't blame this all on Pete

89
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,159
The offer that Pete submitted

90
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,039
was all Peem's idea

91
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,119
Well Peem?

92
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,559
My mistake.

93
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,239
You see?

94
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,919
Save that for later

95
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,319
Go discuss with Mr Mark about investing with us in a hotel in Rayong

96
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,399
Make sure it's a success.

97
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,439
I went to investigate already

98
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,799
The owner of the land that is the entrance to our land in Rayong,

99
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,719
owns a fruit orchard named Dec h

100
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,079
Then quickly go buy that piece of land.

101
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,519
So we can finally get this going

102
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,999
V Group has already started building their hotel

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,679
Tat is on his way to negotiate right now

104
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,799
Remember,

105
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,479
if you mess this up,

106
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,519
I'm going to demote you

107
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,079
Yes, right this way.

108
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,799
Okay.

109
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,039
-You!
-You!

110
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,759
Hey.

111
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,799
Don't tell me you're here to talk to the owner about this land?

112
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,799
I should be asking you that!

113
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,439
News travel fast.

114
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,359
I think Kit knows

115
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,999
that Peem's company want this plot of land.

116
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,159
Hey!

117
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,599
Listen to me.

118
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,599
You have to make Peem

119
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,999
not be able to buy the plot of land in Rayong.

120
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,999
You have to be the one to buy it

121
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,999
So your fathe r canseethat you're doing a better job than Peem

122
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,199
He ill appoint you a better position.

123
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,239
Is this all your plan?

124
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,679
I'll get going then.

125
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,639
Pete!

126
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,519
Gosh this son!

127
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,399
What is it?

128
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,239
Why are you here?

129
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,479
Finally you show up.

130
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,399
I've been waiting for so long

131
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,079
What business do you have with me?

132
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,319
Nothing much.

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,119
Just collecting the money for my clip that you leaked.

134
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,239
What?

135
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,319
You're odd.

136
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,279
That happened four years ago.

137
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,199
And you're collecting money from me?

138
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,879
Or should I goask from Mr, Peem?

139
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,719
I've been thinking.

140
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,839
Mr, Peem and his father don't know yet, do they.

141
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,999
that you leaked the clip?

142
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,719
If they found out.

143
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,399
what will happen?

144
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,239
How much do you want?

145
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,679
I should have thought of this four years ago

146
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,879
Gosh!

147
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,399
You guys again?!

148
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,439
I told you I'm not selling it.

149
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,279
Go back!

150
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,319
Go!

151
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,959
You haven't listened to my offer yet.

152
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,159
That's right.

153
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,119
My company is offering you way more benefits than his company

154
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,999
Hey.

155
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,519
You're going to play like this?

156
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,119
You want to fight,you gotta be quick!

157
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,639
Fine.

158
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,679
Mr. Dec h.

159
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,199
No.

160
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,279
No matter how good your offer is

161
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,319
I will not change my mind.

162
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,519
Go! Leave!

163
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,359
Don't invite them in next time.
Yes Boss

164
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,479
-Mr. Dec h! Excuse me!
-Wait!

165
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,119
Mr. Dec h!

166
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,759
Wait Mr. Dec h!
- You can't go in!

167
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,599
He told you to leave!

168
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,239
Please leave!

169
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,239
Go!

170
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,639
Leave!

171
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,679
Hey you.

172
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,839
Tell Kit to stop playing dirty like this

173
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,719
The reason why he wants this plot of land

174
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,799
because he wants to prevent Peem'scompany from signing a contract to build a hotel with Mr. Mark!

175
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,599
Have some morals

176
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,519
If business is all about morals

177
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,119
then why even have one?

178
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,479
Wow!

179
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,999
I guess you've been working with Kit way too much

180
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,079
to get that kind of bad habit

181
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,159
Hey.

182
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,319
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?!

183
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,399
Huh?

184
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,559
Who is that woman?

185
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,319
Why does she look familiar?

186
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,639
Welcome.

187
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,679
Our school focuses on having children do extracurricular activities

188
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,719
to enhance their learning skills as well!

189
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,039
How old is your grandchild?

190
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,039
My grandchild isn't born yet.

191
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,279
I'm just checking this place out in advance

192
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,359
That's great.

193
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,479
Parents nowadays are well-prepared for their unborn child.

194
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,959
My friend's child also goes to school here.

195
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,159
Really? That's wonderful.

196
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,999
Dad.

197
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,999
Can I use the restroom?

198
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,519
The restroom is over there.

199
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,679
Thank you.

200
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,679
You're welcome.

201
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,119
Can you take me on a tour around the school?

202
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,959
Sure. This way sir

203
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,799
This is their playground

204
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,839
It's for them to...

205
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,039
-Run around and play.
-That's right.

206
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,479
There's different sports here they can play

207
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,759
-Over there, right?
Yes.

208
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,799
Teacher, can l use the restroom?

209
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,719
Play nice. I need to take your friend to the restroom first.

210
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,239
Go.

211
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,719
Are you Putter?

212
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,639
Yes.

213
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,919
-Putter!
-Your mom is here.

214
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,839
Mom is here.

215
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,999
How are you Putter?

216
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,199
Did you cry today?

217
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,599
No, Iwas a good kid.

218
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,959
He did cry a little earlier missing his mom

219
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,119
I guess he needs a little adjustment.

220
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,239
Yes.

221
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,679
Let's go home.

222
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,119
Thank you Teacher

223
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,679
See you tomorrow Putter.

224
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,239
-Bye.
-Bye.

225
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,239
Uncle Peem!

226
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,999
Putter.

227
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,799
Get in the car.

228
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,239
Don't pay attention to him.

229
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,079
9887

230
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,959
Follow her.

231
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,079
10 What?!

232
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,079
Peem knows that Putter is --

233
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,399
Orn!

234
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,239
Sorry.

235
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,399
He knows already?

236
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,399
Yeah.

237
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,999
He planned everything.

238
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,479
He approached Putter

239
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,239
to get a sample of his DNA

240
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,079
So heinous!

241
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,519
So I wanted to talk to you.

242
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,999
If he were to...

243
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,119
file a paternity lawsuit.

244
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,119
I will file a lawsuit

245
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,759
He's my son.

246
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,919
It's not that simple Peem

247
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,879
Because it isn't simple

248
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,439
that's why I need your help.

249
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,079
Aren't you a lawyer?

250
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,039
You have to think this through.

251
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,719
Because if you file a lawsuit, it's going to be big news

252
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,039
Once it becomes big

253
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,199
we won't know if it will be good or bad for us in the end

254
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,399
I don't care

255
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,599
I just want Putter to call me "dad " just once.

256
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,319
Even if it turns out bad,

257
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,559
even if netizens attack me and call me names,
I don't care!

258
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,519
But you won't be the only one that will be affected by this.

259
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,439
Putter will also be affected

260
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,439
Especially when he grows up.

261
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,639
Try talking with him first.

262
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,239
He is Putter's father after all.

263
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,279
If I'm being honest

264
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,079
he has the rights to his son too.

265
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,199
You want me

266
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,359
to let him near my son?

267
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,479
Isn't that his job?

268
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,479
But Putter has Vik it already.

269
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,559
Plub.

270
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,799
Don't mix your personal matter with your son's.

271
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,679
You hating Peem is one thing.

272
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,159
But with your son, that's different.

273
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,879
Hey.

274
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,479
You're abusing your motherhood

275
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,039
to think on your son's behalf.

276
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,079
Do you realize that?

277
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,359
I'm full.

278
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,279
Okay.

279
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,639
Can le at my candy?

280
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,318
Sure.

281
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,399
Who gave you the candy? Your teacher?

282
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,559
Who gave it to you?

283
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,159
Your friend.

284
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,359
A un t Orn?

285
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,359
-You gave it to him?
-It wasn't me.

286
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,519
Who gave it to you?

287
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,319
Your friend who went to my school.

288
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,599
Who?

289
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,239
I don't know.

290
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,079
Hello.

291
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,319
Your son is adorable Plubpl a

292
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,159
Was it you that went to see Putter today?

293
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,999
I coincidentally found out

294
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,319
you and Peem are still seeing each other

295
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,439
So I'm here to warn you.

296
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,399
If you are still messing with my person,

297
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,759
then watch out for your person

298
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,119
What do you mean?

299
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,159
What are you going to do to my son?

300
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,639
Nothing right now.

301
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,639
But next time,

302
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,159
it might not be candy that I give for your son to eat

303
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,359
Remember that!

304
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,719
Putter!

305
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,239
Don't eat anything a stranger gives you, understood?!

306
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,239
Yes.

307
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,759
Putter.

308
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,519
Putter, I'm not scolding you.

309
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,319
You were loud.

310
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,159
I'm sorry.

311
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,319
The candy is...

312
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,999
dirty now.

313
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,119
Do you want to order food?

314
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,959
Something new to eat?

315
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,439
There's a lot of food here.

316
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,159
What do you want to eat?

317
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,679
Order something

318
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,199
-You choose.
-Plub.

319
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,199
Plub.

320
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,199
What did Usa say to you

321
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,999
that you yelled at your son like that?

322
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,519
If you are still messing with the man who has an owner,

323
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,319
next time won't be an almost.

324
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,639
Orn.

325
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,519
Can you go drop Putter off at home?

326
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,039
I have something I need to do.

327
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,999
Oh.

328
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,119
Putter.

329
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,719
Stay with A un t Orn.

330
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,039
Bye.

331
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,799
Where are you going?

332
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,159
Plub!

333
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,759
What is it Plub?

334
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,759
We need to talk.

335
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,919
Sure.

336
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,919
I'm on my way.

337
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,479
Plubpl a?

338
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,879
Why did she call?

339
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,519
I don't know.

340
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,359
I'm leaving.

341
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,359
Peem!

342
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,119
Must be something bad.

343
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:28,959
Plub

344
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,839
I'm happy that you wanted to see me.

345
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,759
What was that for?

346
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,599
The candy.

347
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,359
Your fiancee gave it to Putter at school.

348
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,119
She threatened me that

349
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,119
if I don't stop associating with you,

350
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,079
she will hurt my son.

351
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,279
What?

352
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,239
Are you satisfied now

353
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,279
that me and my son are being harassed because of you?

354
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,719
If anything happens to Putter,

355
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,799
I will kill all of you!

356
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,679
Peem.

357
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,039
You came to my house to see me

358
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,039
Must be special.

359
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,839
Sa.

360
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,399
You threatened Plubp la and her son?

361
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,399
Geez!

362
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,639
That's such a scary thing to say.

363
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,079
I just gave her a warning.

364
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,519
Since she's married and has a child with Kit,

365
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,039
she shouldn't be messing with my fiance

366
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:27,599
Sa.

367
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,919
Don't harass Plubp la and her son again.

368
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,039
Don't do this again!

369
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,239
Seeing you get angry like this

370
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,879
I think I'm on the right track.

371
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,759
Are you threatening me?

372
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,799
I can only threaten you.

373
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,319
But the serious one

374
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,919
is my dad.

375
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,319
Just so you know

376
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,439
Dad knows everything

377
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,639
He's not happy that you're still associating with Plubpl a!

378
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,359
If you won't marry me,

379
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,479
I can't guarantee

380
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,799
what Dad will do to Plub pla.

381
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,759
You are forcing me right now!

382
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,679
Yes!

383
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,039
I can do more

384
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,199
just so you'll marry me.

385
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,879
If you're really worried about Plubp la and her son'ssafety.

386
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,599
make a wise decision.

387
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,879
Don't worry.

388
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,119
I will j protect you and our son.

389
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,719
Don't protect me.

390
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,759
As long as you and your fiancee stay away from us!

391
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,879
Fine!

392
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,359
I'll marry you.

393
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,879
Peem is going to marry you?!

394
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,319
Yes Mom!

395
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,119
Peem said we will get married as soon as possible.

396
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,359
I'm so happy Mom

397
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,799
Me too.

398
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,359
I'll go tell your father

399
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,159
to find the earliest auspicious date

400
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,479
Yes Mom.

401
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,519
What is it Kit?

402
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,519
You crossed the line Sa!

403
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,839
You dare threatened my wife and son?!

404
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,399
It was only a warning.

405
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,599
Only because I felt considerate of you.

406
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,199
So I told Dad not to do anything violent.

407
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,759
Don't threaten me with your father.

408
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,519
I don't care how powerful he is!

409
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,679
But if you mess with my wife and son again

410
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,199
you and l are gonna have a problem.

411
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,639
I wouldn't have done it if your wife didn't mess with Peem first.

412
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,879
It's Peem

413
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,799
that keeps bothering Plubpl a.

414
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,319
Handle your person first.

415
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,759
Don't mess with my wife and son again.

416
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,959
Don't worry.

417
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,919
Peem and I are getting married soon.

418
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,879
After that,

419
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,799
I won't let Peem mess with anyone.

420
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,279
Good.

421
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,039
Rest assured.

422
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,999
About what?

423
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,999
I talked with Usa already.

424
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,559
She won't harass you and our son anymore

425
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,079
Really?

426
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,319
She gave in easily.

427
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,839
It's unbelievable.

428
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,679
I didn't want to believe it either.

429
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,319
But right now

430
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,199
Sa got what she wanted.

431
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,279
She won't mess with you anymore.

432
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,839
Got what?

433
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,119
She's getting married to Peem soon.

434
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,559
Right.

435
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,079
Good.

436
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,039
So they can stop messing with us.

437
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,279
Yes.

438
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,119
Most importantly.

439
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,919
once Peem marries Usa,

440
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,519
he will have more weaknesses for us to attack.

441
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,599
Right.

442
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,999
Rest assured.

443
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,119
Putter.

444
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,999
Do you want to go play football?

445
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,879
Yes.

446
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,639
Let's go.

447
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,119
-Come.
-Yay!

448
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:04,879
Let's go.

449
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,639
Do you want mom to come too?

450
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,999
Do you?

451
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,759
Yes.

452
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,759
Let's go.

453
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,559
Come on.

454
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,719
Let's go.

455
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,639
Higher!

456
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,679
Putter!

457
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,839
Where did it go?!

458
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,879
Putter has a good family now.

459
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,879
He has everything.

460
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,999
He doesn't need you in his life

461
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,319
If you want to hurt his feelings,

462
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,919
you go tell him then

463
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,919
That this man here, the person he loves,

464
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,239
the person he thought was his father

465
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,079
isn't his father

466
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,199
I will do my job as your father

467
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,279
from afar Putter.

468
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,519
Dad!

469
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,319
Yes?

470
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,759
Peem.

471
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,759
Why are you doing this?

472
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,079
I just came to see

473
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,319
to confirm whether what I did was worth it or not.

474
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,319
You and our son are happy

475
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,919
Seeing it makes it worth it

476
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,999
You'remarrying Usa

477
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,439
because you wanted to protect us

478
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,479
You want me to believe that?

479
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,559
You know?

480
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,239
You think l will believe

481
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,719
that you have good intentions for us?

482
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,839
I won't fall for your tricks again

483
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,679
Good

484
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,119
that you don't believe

485
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,359
Because even if you believed me.

486
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,599
it's pointless now.

487
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,799
I never thought

488
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,119
that you would believe me anyway.

489
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,999
You want to blame me

490
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,479
for that clip,

491
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,479
that your grandmother died because of me.

492
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,119
you can be mad and hate me all you want,

493
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,439
or get revenge on me,

494
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,239
I'm not going to make any more excuses.

495
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,639
I just want

496
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,679
you and our son to be happy, that's all.

497
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,399
Why are you doing this?

498
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,079
What's the point of saying all of this?!

499
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,239
Good luck Plubpl a

500
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,079
I hope that your family

501
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,039
is happy as you hoped

502
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,999
As for Putter,

503
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,839
don't worry.

504
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,159
I will not try to form a bond that will cause pain for him because of me.

505
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,199
I will not show my face here again

506
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,319
Sa.

507
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,439
I'm happy that you wanted to see me again

508
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,999
I just came to say goodbye to you

509
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,199
From now on,

510
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,559
we can't meet like this anymore.

511
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,039
Why?

512
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,679
I promised you already

513
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,359
I won't tell anyone about this.

514
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,399
Can you give me a chance?

515
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,919
I will show you

516
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,159
I am just as good as Peem

517
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,239
Pete.

518
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,279
Can you not be sweet like this?

519
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,399
This time

520
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,719
I can't give in to you

521
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,279
Usa.

522
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,959
I'm getting married to Peem.

523
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,239
I won't let you marry him.

524
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,519
Pete.

525
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,199
We talked about this.

526
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,839
Can you not act like a kid?

527
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,119
You're my wife.

528
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,439
How can you marry Peem?!

529
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,999
Don't use that word with me.

530
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,159
We only slept together a few times.

531
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,599
That's not considered being your wife.

532
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,279
Pete!

533
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,959
Enough!

534
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,959
If I can't call you wife

535
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,479
then what do you call this?

536
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,599
Friends with benefits.

537
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,079
Peem won't marry you.

538
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,079
I talked to him already

539
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,439
He said he won't marry you

540
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,399
Oh child.

541
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,119
You believe your brother just because he said that?

542
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,999
Let me tell you.

543
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,039
Peemandl had an agreement

544
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,039
that we will get married as soon as possible.

545
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,679
I hope you will understand me

546
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,199
and be happy for me.

547
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,479
You lied Peem!

548
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,519
You're going to marry Sa?

549
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,559
Yes.

550
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,559
Now you know,

551
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,559
please arrange a wedding for us

552
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,799
Wait.

553
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,719
No wonder

554
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,399
Pete is refusing to come home

555
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,639
He probably knows by now.

556
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,599
I thought you were adamant about not marrying her?

557
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,319
If I marry her,

558
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,199
won't that be a good thing for the company?

559
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,519
Why ask so many questions?

560
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,559
Hey!

561
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,519
I'm your father!

562
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,079
I'm not just the CEO

563
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,039
I asked because I'm worried!

564
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,119
Mr. Thaw ip

565
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,239
threatened you, didn't he?

566
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,159
If he threatened you,just tell me

567
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,759
Who can threaten Peem?

568
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,239
Pete.

569
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,079
No one can!

570
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,079
Pete!

571
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,559
Why do you look like this?

572
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,239
I thought you said you won't marry her?!

573
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,959
You liar!

574
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,678

-This dog!

581
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,399
The one that is heartbroken

582
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,399
The one that,got his lover stolen from him

583
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,199

585
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,479
Listen to me!

586
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,359
I still stand by my word

587
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,879
that l don't love her.

588
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,879
I don't want to marry Usa.

589
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,879
But it's necessary.

590
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,359
You know that if that woman wants something, she will get it!

591
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,479
Why?! Why?!

592
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,559
I promise

593
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,439
I won't touch her.

594
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,919
It's okay son.

595
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,439
" An insider whispered that

596
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,919
finally the young businessman Peem

597
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,479
and Usa,daughter of a politician,

598
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,919
will be marrying soon

599
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,999
It will be a grand wedding.

600
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,839
This is true?

601
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,159
I am not going to get Plubp la and my son back.

602
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,039
I just want to be useful for them.

603
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,839
What are you talking about?

604
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,439
This is gonna be your life.

605
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,559
Don't you think it's too much?

606
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,839
I made my decision.

607
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,039
Stop talking about this.

608
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,279
I'm getting back to work

609
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,919
Gosh Peem.

610
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,159
want you to talk to Plub

611
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,439
to try to convince Peem to call off the wedding.

612
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,119
You want Plub

613
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,719
to convince your friend to call off the wedding?

614
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,479
How could you think like that?!

615
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,559
Because only Plub can stop him

616
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,679
I don't want my friend to suffer because he's marrying someone he doesn't love.

617
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,919
You think your friend is the only one suffering like that?

618
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,399
You're telling me

619
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,839
Plub and Kit don't love each'other?

620
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,919
No!

621
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,119
You just said it though

622
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,359
Let's just say

623
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,199
I can't help you

624
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,079
You're worried about your friend's feelings.

625
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,319
I'm also worried about my friend's feelings

626
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,319
You called me here

627
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,919
What's up?

628
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,919
You probably heard

629
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,119
that I'm marrying Sa.

630
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,159
You're giving me the honor by inviting me yourself?

631
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,719
Don't worry

632
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,559
It's my friend's wedding. Plub and I

633
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,199
will be attending

634
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,079
I don't care whether you go or not.

635
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,759
I just have a favor to ask

636
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,799
You're here to ask for a favor from me?

637
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,879
Tell me.

638
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,479
I will consider it.

639
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,679
I'm entrusting you

640
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,599
to look after Putter and Plubpl a.

641
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,279
They're my wife and son!

642
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,599
Of course I will take good care of them!

643
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,279
It's not your job

644
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,239
to be asking that favor!
