1
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,839
Gosh.

2
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,759
It's unbelievable

3
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,879
that Mr. Peem's mother would still look young and beautiful like this.

4
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,399
Just tell me your business.

5
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,439
I don't have time to listen to your compliments

6
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,519
I'll get straight to the point then

7
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,399
I came here

8
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,039
because I found out Mr. Peem will be getting engaged to another woman.

9
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,879
The engagement?

10
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,399
What about it?

11
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,959
Whoever Peem gets engaged to,
how does it involve you?

12
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,359
It involves me

13
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,119
Mr, Peem can't get engaged to another woman.

14
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,079
He must take responsibility of my sister first

15
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,879
Take responsibility?

16
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,479
Yes.

17
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,119
Mr. Peem is dating my sister Plubpl a

18
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,759
Most importantly,

19
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,879
those two already have a very deep relationship

20
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,879
Really?

21
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,839
You need to have your son

22
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,599
marry my sister Plubp la or...

23
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,759
pay 100 million for compensation.

24
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,359
You dare demand 100 million?

25
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,919
Unless you want this news to reach Mr. Peem's soon to be fiancee?

26
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,439
I heard that woman'sfather is quite powerful

27
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,199
To be frank, when it comes to this.
people can claim anything they want.

28
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,199
Unless you have proof.

29
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,519
I have proof.

30
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,039
Otherwise, would I dare come here and demand such compensation?!

31
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,479
If you don't believe me,

32
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,479
watch this

33
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,519
Hey.

34
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,199
What are you laughing at?

35
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,919
You see that those two slept together

36
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,759
This is a real clip

37
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,479
Yes.

38
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,719
I see.

39
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,159
I'm being serious.

40
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,879
You need to have your son take responsibility of my sister.

41
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,599
The engagement thing was actually my husband's idea.

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,079
Send me this clip first

43
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,279
I'll show it to Mr. Puchong.

44
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,359
Huh?

45
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,759
You want me to just send you the clip?

46
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,599
What do I get then?

47
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,879
I'm not stupid.

48
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,399
Ta!

49
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,159
Bring me my purse.

50
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,879
If you don't trust me,

51
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,239
I'll give you this first.

52
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,359
500,000 baht.

53
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,799
I'll tell you something.

54
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,559
I still have the original clip

55
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,279
Therefore, don't play tricks

56
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,279
Stupid girl.

57
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,199
Stupid and greedy.

58
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,199
I'll be the one

59
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,599
to leak this clip for you

60
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,319
Hello Kwang-Hello

61
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,439
Plub.

62
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,919
What's wrong? Why aren't you going in?

63
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,719
I'm fine.

64
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,039
Kwang.

65
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,799
Can I comes it out here and work with you?

66
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,799
How can you?

67
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,359
The desk is small. How can we sit together?

68
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,559
Then,

69
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,639
can you move in there and work with Mr, Peem instead?

70
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,799
Do you have problems with him?

71
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,719
No.

72
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,039
Forget it.

73
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,639
I can't escape it, right?

74
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,079
Right.

75
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,439
When you're faced with a problem,
you have to fight through it.

76
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,439
It'll get better, okay?

77
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,999
Okay.

78
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,919
I'll hand you some documents for Mr Peem to sign then

79
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,239
-Thank you.
-Sure.

80
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,599
Peem!

81
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,719
I'm sorry.

82
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,399
I was thoughtless.

83
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,679
I was stupid.

84
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,199
I gave you a bad reputation

85
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,799
Hey!

86
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,199
Let me go.

87
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,159
Let go!

88
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,479
Please forgive me.

89
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,719
Please?

90
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,279
Peem,please let me go.

91
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,119
Hey!

92
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,479
I said let go. We're at your company right now

93
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,959
Give me some respect.

94
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,759
Here.

95
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,159
Please sign it.

96
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,479
Grandma!

97
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,159
Oh.

98
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,359
So.

99
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,679
where did everyone go? Why are you home alone?

100
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,159
Tong went to buy food. Hell be back

101
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,039
You haven't eaten?

102
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,839
Okay.

103
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,559
I bought you a lot of food.

104
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,199
What's wrong?

105
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,719
What made you want to buy me so much food today?

106
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,879
Gosh Grandma.

107
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,919
I want to look after you.

108
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,759
Most importantly,

109
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,679
take this as a celebration that you'll get a millionaire as your grand son in law.

110
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,959
What are you talking about?

111
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,999
Pluband Mr. Peem have a deal?

112
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,599
You'll find out soon

113
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,199
Here Grandma

114
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,559
Whatever you want to eat, you can open it yourself.

115
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,839
I'm tired from walking all day. I want to rest.

116
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,959
Here.

117
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,799
There's been a leaked clip of a famous socialite P. with his secretary all over social media.

118
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,839
Let's go watch it.

119
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,759
Socialite P

120
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,439
and secretary?

121
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,159
Huh?!

122
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:26,879
SO NAY

123
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,119
Hey!

124
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,039
SONY

125
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:38,879
Plub!

126
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,319
Grandma!

127
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,639
Was that Plub?

128
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,159
It looks like Plub

129
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,919
It looks like Plub. It was her right?
-Grandma

130
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,119
Calm down Grandma

131
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,999
Go sit down.

132
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,959
Come here.

133
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,479
Stay calm Grandma

134
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,279
Was it Plub?

135
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,359
Was it Plub?
-Have a seat first

136
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,119
Why is it like this?!

137
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,479
-Was it Plub?!
-Grandma.

138
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,199
Grandma stay calm. Just relax

139
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,319
I... I..

140
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,679
I will clear this up

141
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,799
Just a moment Grandma

142
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,839
I'll handle it.

143
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,119
Oh my god!l envy the secretary so much!

144
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,679
Who can resist if she's that beautiful?

145
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,159
Plub.

146
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,159
-What's going on?
-Have you seen it?

147
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,679
Have you seen the news?
Much juicer than the previous one.

148
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,759
What news?

149
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,559
Here. There's an actual clip

150
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,559
Oh my god!

151
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,879
So juicy!

152
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,319
Right? The location seem to be on a yacht too.

153
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,559
They did go to a beach

154
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,119
It's an actual clip but who was the one that recorded it?

155
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,199
That trip.

156
00:13:59,320 --> 00:13:59,759
Hey.

157
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,439
I never thought someone who looks all innocent would do such thing.

158
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,999
But the clip is everywhere now.

159
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,799
Here's the document.

160
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,399
Thank you.

161
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,239
But I can go get it from you next time. You didn't have to come here.

162
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,399
What's going on?

163
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,919
You haven't seen the news yet?

164
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,559
What news?

165
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,999
Here.

166
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,079
This!

167
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,999
It's on the gossip news right now.

168
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,599
I was stupid

169
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,159
to fall for the tricks of this scumbag!

170
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,759
That was fast.

171
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,079
Thank you.

172
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,039
What is it?

173
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,639
You saw the news?

174
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,879
How dare you?!

175
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,879
How could you do this?!

176
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,039
I'm helping you demand responsibility from Peem.

177
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,199
But I didn't allow you to leak the clip like this!

178
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,599
Are you crazy?!

179
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,159
Mr, Peem is your son!

180
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,279
This will cause damage for your son too!

181
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,279
Who cares what kind of damage he will face.

182
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,119
Peem isn't my son.

183
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,479
He's my step son.

184
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,719
What?!

185
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,679
Stupid girl.

186
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,359
If you want to blackmail someone,

187
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,119
find proper information first.

188
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,719
But whatever.

189
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,119
I have to thank you

190
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,079
for allowing me to destroy Peem once again

191
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,759
Hello?!

192
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,399
Damn it!

193
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,199
How can this happen?!

194
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,319
I made the effort to install the camera there!

195
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,919
So now...

196
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,519
how do I get the money?

197
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,959
How do I get the compensation now?!

198
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,319
It was you Tre?

199
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,599
Grandma.

200
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,719
All of this including the clip on TV

201
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,679
was your doing?!

202
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,479
Huh?!

203
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,319
Grandma.

204
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,959
I'm...

205
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,599
I'm not wrong in this.

206
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,799
It's just..

207
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,199
I just installed the camera.

208
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,519
As for Plub, she's the one that chose to sleep with Mr. Peem.

209
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,919
If she was n't easy, there wouldn't be this clip Grandma.

210
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,439
You bitch!

211
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,439
You should be thanking me Grandma!

212
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,639
Otherwise there wouldn't be proof to have Mr Peem

213
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,838
take responsibility of Plub!

214
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,119
You need to thank me!

215
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,719
What you're doing isn't right! You need to thank me!

216
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,039
How could you do this to your own sister?!

217
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,239
How could you do this?!

218
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,519
-Grandma, I didn't do it! Let me go!
-How could you do this to her?!

219
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,719
Grandma, you're hurting me!

220
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,119
Tre!

221
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,039
Grandma.

222
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,279
Tong.

223
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,079
Aunt Ta en.

224
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,159
- I just bought some boat noodles. Come --
-I don't wanna eat!

225
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,599
Did you see this clip yet?

226
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,319
What clip?

227
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,759
I'll show you.

228
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,639
Watch it.

229
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,519
Wake up Grandma!

230
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,719
Grandma listen to me first! I didn't do it!

231
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,839
Grandma!

232
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,159
Wake up Grandma!

233
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,879
Grandma!

234
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,799
What happened?!

235
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,639
Grandma!

236
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,759
-Grandma!
- Wake up and listen to me first!

237
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,519
Grandma!
-Grandma!

238
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,039
Tre!

239
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,679
-Grandma!
- Grand ma Thip!

240
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,039
Grandma!

241
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,999
She's not breathing.

242
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,879
Oh my god!

243
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,159
Grand ma Thip!

244
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,399
Plub, can you --

245
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,719
What's wrong?

246
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,239
Where did Mr. Peem go?

247
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,239
He went to see the chairman.

248
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,119
Do you need something from him?

249
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,479
No.

250
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,879
What is it Tong?

251
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,999
What?

252
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,279
Grandma is in the hospital?

253
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,559
I'm on my way.

254
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,359
Why do I have to take responsibility?!

255
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,119
I'm not the one that leaked it.

256
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,279
More importantly

257
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,359
I didn't agree with Mr. Thaw ip about getting engaged to Sa

258
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,119
You agreed.

259
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,479
You get engaged to her

260
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,119
You can't say this Peem!

261
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,159
Do you not know how powerful Mr, Thaw ip is?!

262
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,319
If we have issues with him,our business will be in jeopardy!

263
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,999
I won't get engaged.

264
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,839
I'll go talk to Sa.

265
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,239
Sir!

266
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,839
We have a big problem

267
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,279
Was this your doing?

268
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,119
No.

269
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,479
It had nothing to do with me.

270
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,599
Plubpl a.

271
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,959
How will you handle this sir?

272
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,439
Go shut this news down.

273
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,199
Sue that TV program too!

274
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,119
Yes, sir.

275
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,799
Mr. Peem.

276
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,119
Is Plubpl a here?

277
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,719
No.

278
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,839
Her relative is in the hospital so she rushed out of here.

279
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,159
Grand ma Thip.

280
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,599
Peem!

281
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,199
Hey.

282
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,439
Did you see the news?

283
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,159
I did.

284
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,479
Plubpl a's grandmother is in the hospital.

285
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,799
I don't know if it's because of the news or not.

286
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,919
I'm on my way to see her.

287
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,719
Hey! lim coming too!

288
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,279
Tong!

289
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,119
How's Grandma?

290
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,519
I don't know either.

291
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,479
Doctor.

292
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,679
How is Grandma?

293
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,119
Your grandmother arrived at the hospital too late.

294
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,839
I'm'sorry.

295
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,079
Grandma!

296
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,839
You're really leaving us like this?

297
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,799
How will I live?

298
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,239
Tong.

299
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,279
What happened?

300
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,959
How did Grandma get a heart attack so suddenly?

301
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,919
I...

302
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,359
I don't know.

303
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,359
When I got there,

304
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,079
Grandma was already unconscious with Tre

305
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,359
Tre.

306
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,559
What happened Tre?

307
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,399
I...

308
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,079
Grandma died

309
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,319
because of you Plub.

310
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,039
She saw your clip with Mr. Peemon the news.

311
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,679
Grandma was in shock.

312
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,479
I tried comforting her

313
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,799
but she kept on crying

314
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,519
Then finally collapsed

315
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,159
Because of me?

316
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,879
Yes!

317
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,519
All of this is your fault Plub!

318
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,079
If you weren't easy and slept with the man for free,

319
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,959
and have a leaked clip out on the news like this,

320
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,399
Grandma wouldn't have died!

321
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,999
Grandma died

322
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,319
because of you!

323
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,919
Plub.

324
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:10,999
Peem.

325
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:11,839
Over there.

326
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,199
Plubpl a!

327
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,039
Tong.

328
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,479
How's Grand ma Thip?

329
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,639
You're a scumbag!

330
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,239
You made my grandmother died!

331
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,839
Grand ma Thip passed away?

332
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,399
Peem!

333
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,799
How could you do this to me?!

334
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,919
Why did you deceive me?! Whatever you want to do, why didn't you do it to me?!

335
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,959
Why did you get my grandmother involved?!
Why did you make my grandmother die?!

336
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,039
Huh?!

337
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,919
Plub, calm down!

338
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,279
Calm down for what?!

339
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,759
It's all a misunderstanding

340
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,959
What misunderstanding?!

341
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,759
Plubpl a.

342
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,279
Listen to me.

343
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,319
I don't know anything about that clip.

344
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,919
I don't believe you anymore!

345
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,119
Plub.

346
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,679
I have nothing left Peem!

347
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,199
I hate you!

348
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,559
-Plub! Plub!
- Get out of my life!

349
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,759
-Plub! Plub!
-Go away!

350
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,599
Calm down Plub!

351
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,999
Plubpl a.

352
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,719
Don't bother her!

353
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,599
Let her go!

354
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,319
Plubpl a.

355
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,119
I said let her go damnit!

356
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,279
Let her go!
- Hey don't!

357
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,999
Tong!

358
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,959
Calm down Tong!

359
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,959
Calm down dude!

360
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,719
-Calm down Tong!
-You!

361
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,319
Don't bother my sister again

362
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,999
Or else l will kill you!

363
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,239
I will kill you!

364
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,879
Tong!

365
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,799
That's enough

366
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,919
Calm down.

367
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,959
Nurse!

368
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,159
-Go check on Plub-Nurse!

369
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:24,959
Come on.

370
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,719
We should leave

371
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,919
Come on.

372
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,759
There's no point in staying here right now.

373
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,799
Let's go home.

374
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,119
Come on Peem.

375
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,759
Peem, come on.

376
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,199
Peem.

377
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,999
Let's go.

378
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,959
Come on.

379
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,919
Let's go.

380
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,399
Who's that?

381
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,679
He looks nice.

382
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,079
Oh.

383
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,879
Mr. Vi kit.

384
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,239
Owner of V Group?

385
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,879
He knows Plub?

386
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,679
Mr. Vi kit.

387
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,919
Hello.

388
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,279
How's Plubp la doing?

389
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,359
She's been like this since Grandma died

390
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,199
She keeps staring at her photo and blaming herself.

391
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,039
Plub.

392
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,959
Don't blame yourself

393
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,999
It's not your fault

394
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,679
The scumbag

395
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,519
is Peem.

396
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,319
If you need my help with anything

397
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,999
please let me know

398
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,799
I'm happy to help you with everything

399
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,959
Wait Peem.

400
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,199
Are you sure you want to go in?

401
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,479
I want to apologize to Grand ma Thip one last time.

402
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,439
Yeah.

403
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,279
But look at yourself right now.

404
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,439
Have you ever got to go inside every time you came?

405
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,079
You get punched every time

406
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,679
Regardless,

407
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,039
I have to go pay my respect today.

408
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,559
You still dare come here?!

409
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,279
Don't!

410
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,839
You still dare come here?!

411
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,159
Why are you here?!

412
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,399
-Stop!
-Don't get involved!

413
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,559
Why are you here?!

414
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,799
Stop!

415
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,719
Plubpl a.

416
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,559
Can I go...

417
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,839
Causing my grandma to die wasn't enough

418
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,678
you're also here to ruin her funeral?

419
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,279
I'm sorry.

420
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,479
You're sorry?

421
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,159
I have nothing left for you to destroy Peem

422
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,079
From now on,

423
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,879
I hope we can live in different worlds.

424
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,559
I wish to never see you again

425
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,559
Go away.

426
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,799
If you won't go.

427
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,079
I will kill you.

428
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,879
Did you hear what I said?

429
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,679
I said go away!

430
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,239
Did you hear what I said?

431
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,559
I said go away!

432
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,199
Are you satisfied now?!

433
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,639
Go!

434
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,479
Go away!

435
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,359
Peem.

436
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,479
Do you not understand?!

437
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,239
Peem.

438
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,759
May you rest in peace Grandma.

439
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,879
We will help each other look after Plub and Tong

440
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,519
I'm sorry.

441
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,319
I will get revenge.

442
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,639
I will get revenge on the person that made you die.
