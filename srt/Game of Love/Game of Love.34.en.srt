00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,319
Excuse me.

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,719
What is it Tong?

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,599
Plub and Putter got kidnapped

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,639
Huh?!

34
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,839
Plubp la and Putter got kidnapped?!

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,239
Do you know who they are?

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,279
I don't. They just came here and took them.

37
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,399
I'll come over right now.

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,599
Excuse me.

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,599
I know who did it.

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,039
What?!

41
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,279
Plubp la and Putter got kidnapped?!

42
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,479
Don't pretend like you don't know.

43
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,119
It was you, wasn't it?

44
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,439
Why did you have Plub and Putter get kidnapped?

45
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,599
Tell me.

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,759
I really don't know about this.

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,279
If it's not you,

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,759
then who is it?

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,279
Who?

50
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,039
Mrs. Su went to go see Mr. Thaw ip

51
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,239
so he can help her escape

52
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,319
I heard those two talking

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,839
about kidnapping Plubp la and her son

54
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,999
They're planning on killing you!

55
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,959
Where are they?

56
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,559
Inside

57
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,999
I'll check on them.

58
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,719
Don't play any games if you don't want the kid to die!

59
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,279
Let go!

60
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,519
Putter.

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,439
How are you? Are you hurt?

62
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,439
Mom I'm scared.

63
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,919
It's okay.

64
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,919
What do you want?

65
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,399
Mrs. Sup ang.

66
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,559
Why did you kidnap us?

67
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,919
Because Peem love you two

68
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,919
More importantly

69
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,919
he's trying to put me in prison.

70
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,079
It was you.

71
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,079
You killed Was u.

72
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,079
You know about this?

73
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,199
Mrs. Sup ang.

74
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,759
Please...

75
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,159
please don't do this.

76
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,679
Just let us go.

77
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,999
Turn yourself in so your sentencing won't be severe.

78
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,239
You think I'm going to let them arrest me that easily?!

79
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,239
You won't be able to get away!

80
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,959
Please don't do any more crimes.

81
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,199
Hey!

82
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,919
If I get arrested and go to prison

83
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,319
I need to get rid of all of you that's in my son's way!

84
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,439
What do you mean?

85
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,879
I mean

86
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,799
if Peem comes to save you guys

87
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,799
it will be his death day!

88
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,279
Tong!

89
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,359
Peem.

90
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,439
Has anyone contacted you?

91
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,319
No.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,919
Well Pete?

93
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,839
Are you able to get a hold of her?

94
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,719
I'm trying but Mom won't pick up

95
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,399
Au nt Su.

96
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,199
Huh?

97
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,799
Au nt Su.

98
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,599
Why did you take Plub and my son?

99
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,279
So you know!

100
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,159
Geez!

101
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,359
I wanted to surprise you

102
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,439
Peem!

103
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,359
Plub!

104
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,159
Peem!

105
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,999
Don't come here! It's a trap!

106
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,839
Peem!

107
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,799
I'm scared Mom!

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,879
Putter!

109
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,159
Gosh!

110
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,919
Such a happy, loving family!

111
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,639
Don't hurt them!

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,999
What do you want?!

113
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,719
I want a hundred million.

114
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,799
Fine.

115
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,199
No problem.

116
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,519
But under one condition.

117
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,119
You need to be the one to bring me the money, alone.

118
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,759
Don't let the cops know about this.

119
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,679
If I see a single cop follow you here

120
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,599
or you try to play any tricks on me

121
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,319
I assure you

122
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,999
you will get your wife and son's body in corpses.

123
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,279
Fine.

124
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,079
As long as they're safe, I am willing to do anything

125
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,719
Where do you want me to meet you at?

126
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,599
I will contact you.

127
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,199
I'll give you until tomorrow morning to get me the money.

128
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,279
Peem.

129
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,119
You do know it's a trap, right?

130
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,119
If you go,

131
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,119
Mom is going to kill you.

132
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,119
Even if I have to die

133
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,479
I am still going

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,719
As long as I get to save Pluband my son

135
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,199
In that case, I think...

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,199
we need a plan

137
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,719
First off,

138
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,799
we need to prepare the money she's asking for.

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,759
Tat.

140
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,919
Can you take care of the money?

141
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:50,679
Peem.

142
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,479
It's a hundred million

143
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,839
She's only giving us a few hours to get it.

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,279
It's not easy.

145
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,839
There's some cash in a safe box at my house

146
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,479
The rest I will get at the bank

147
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,639
Okay fine.

148
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,039
In that case,

149
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,039
let me help you too.

150
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,199
You know about this?

151
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,199
I called him to ask about Plub

152
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,399
At first I thought he kidnapped Plub and her son.

153
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,759
Let me help sol can at one for the mistakes l did to Plub pla

154
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,639
If we help each other,

155
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,479
we will get the money in time

156
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,639
Peem.

157
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,999
Please don't come

158
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,239
Is Peem going to fall for our trap?

159
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,559
If he doesn't come, I'm going to kill his wife and kid

160
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,559
What about the cops?

161
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,679
If he calls the cops

162
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,639
I have a second plan ready

163
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,759
Don't get me in trouble.

164
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,759
Don't worry about that.

165
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,599
Peem.

166
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,919
You hurt my daughter's feelings

167
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,399
Tomorrow will be your death day!

168
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,039
Where's the money?

169
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,959
Where's my wife and kid?

170
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,279
Hey.

171
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,639
Go!

172
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,679
What the hell?!

173
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,319
Walk!

174
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,199
Go hurry!

175
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,039
Go!

176
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,799
Where are we going?!

177
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,839
Just walk!

178
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,719
We're going to split into two teams

179
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,919
Team A will help the hostages.

180
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,799
Team B will provide security protection for Mr. Peem.

181
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,879
Everyone, go!

182
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,679
don't do anything until I say so.

183
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,759
Otherwise Pluband her son won't be safe

184
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,399
Finally you show up Peem

185
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,919
Mr. Thaw ip.

186
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,319
Au nt Su.

187
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,759
I never thought

188
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,359
that you two would join hands to do something despicable like this.

189
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,839
Don't talk

190
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,439
Where is my money?

191
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,919
Where is Plub pla and my son?

192
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,879
Peem! You need to get out of here! It's a trap!

193
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,479
I know.

194
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,199
If you know beforehand,it's not a surprise then

195
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,439
Today will be your death day Peem!

196
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,239
It's your fault my daughter is like this!

197
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,599
It's all your fault!

198
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,519
If you want to kill me, go ahead!

199
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,199
But let Plubp la and our son go!
They have nothing to do with this!

200
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,439
Gosh!

201
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,599
You sure love your wife and kid.

202
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,759
Unlike your father!

203
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,919
Everything

204
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,959
was your doing, wasn't it?

205
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,799
You tried to kill my mom

206
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,399
and made my dad die

207
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,199
Why did you do it?

208
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,879
Your father broke up with me

209
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,359
He chose Mane ewan

210
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,999
I hate her!

211
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,999
I hate all of you!

212
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,999
Without you guys,

213
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,999
my son and I could have been happy!

214
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,919
My son Pete

215
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,719
should get all the inheritance.

216
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,879
He's Puchong's son too

217
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,239
Therefore, I will do anything for my son!

218
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,719
That's enough Mom!

219
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,359
Pete!

220
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,479
How did you get here?!

221
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,199
I'm begging you.

222
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,439
Don't do any more crimes.

223
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,639
I'm doing everything for you!

224
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,759
Stop saying it's for me!

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,279
You're doing everything for yourself!

226
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,999
You're just using me as an excuse

227
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,599
to make yourself look good

228
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,039
How much more do you want me to hate you?!

229
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,439
Pete!

230
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,119
Surrender yourselves

231
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,759
Mrs. Supang, Mr. Thawip!

232
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,199
The police have surrounded you!

233
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,399
Police?!

234
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,399
Pete!

235
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,279
You brought the cops to arrest me?!

236
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,199
I refuse to get arrested!

237
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,519
Come here!

238
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,959
-Let go!
- Come here!

239
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,719
Come here!

240
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,919
-Let go!
-Au nt Su!

241
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,999
Au nt Su!

242
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,719
Peem!

243
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,199
You're still following us?!

244
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,159
Let Plubp la and my son go!

245
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,359
Then turn yourselves in!

246
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,079
You won't be able to escape anyway.

247
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,279
Mom.

248
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,479
Enough.

249
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,839
I'm begging you

250
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,999
Whatever you think of me,

251
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,679
I will do everything for you to the fullest!

252
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,519
If I don't make it out alive

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,599
then you should die as well!

254
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,399
Peem!

255
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,159
- Let go! Go Putter!
- Don't run!

256
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,679
Plub!

257
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,639
Peem!

258
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,319
Putter!

259
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,319
Peem!

260
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,919
How dare you shoot me like this?!

261
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,519
Get up!

262
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,639
Mom.

263
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,319
Peem

264
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,039
is my only brother.

265
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,119
Besides you,

266
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,959
he's the only family l have left

267
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,679
Please don't hurt him

268
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,399
The one thing I need the most

269
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,679
is family.

270
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,359
Peem!

271
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,159
Peem! You have to be okay!

272
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,359
Peem!

273
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,119
Are you okay?

274
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,639
I'm fine.

275
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,359
Peem!

276
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,519
-Plub.

277
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,239
How are you?

278
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,999
I'm okay.

279
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,199
Plub.

280
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,879
Where's Putter?

281
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,759
Putter.

282
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,479
Uncle Peem

283
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,319
Putter.

284
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,479
Are you hurt?

285
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,159
No.

286
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,399
Peem.
POLICE

287
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,999
Throughout the past.

288
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,199
I've always thought that

289
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,519
I would do a better job at taking care of Plubp la and Putter.

290
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,279
But today you've shown me

291
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,639
I don't deserve to look after them

292
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,199
Iim giving back Plubp la and your son to you.

293
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,879
Plub.

294
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,279
When you're ready,
POUCE

295
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,479
we can go sign the papers

296
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,199
Putter.

297
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,119
Mom.

298
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,199
Pete.

299
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,199
She's done with interrogation.

300
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,879
She's on her way to detention.

301
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,279
How are you Pete?

302
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,359
Are you still in pain?

303
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,679
Why did you leave the hospital?

304
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,199
I'm worried about you.

305
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,359
I'm very worried

306
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,759
asked them permission to leave for a bit.

307
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,959
Gosh son!

308
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,799
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,799
Mom.

310
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,999
I'm sorry.

311
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,199
You still have to apologize to someone else too

312
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,719
I won't apologize to you Peem

313
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,479
Mom.

314
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,799
I won't ask you to bail me out either.

315
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,999
I hope you're satisfied with that

316
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,119
Yes.

317
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,199
It's best that you repent inside of prison.

318
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,639
Let's go.

319
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,879
Mom.

320
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,639
It'll be okay.

321
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,359
It's okay Mom.

322
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,039
Ump on!

323
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,519
Are you here to bail me out?

324
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,679
No.

325
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,719
I came to see the face of a traitor

326
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,639
I want a divorce.

327
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,199
Ump on!

328
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,199
I don't need to tell you

329
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,519
why I want a divorce.

330
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,159
Besides cheating on me

331
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,759
you broke up our family!

332
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,079
I will never forgive you!

333
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,039
It's best that someone like you stay in prison!

334
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,079
Ump on!

335
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,119

Now that this is over

343
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,719
it's time to figure out what you want to do next.

344
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:51,799
Hey.

345
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,119
You've done a lot for other people

346
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,199
It's time to love yourself now

00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,679

I love you.

350
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,799
You don't need to love me back.

351
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,879
I just want to

352
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,839
look after you and the baby

353
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,599

Okay S a?

355
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,559

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,119
I'm right here

357
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,639
Don't cry.

358
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,239
How do I tell you?

359
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,879
Putter!

360
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,919
Plub

361
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,759
-Aunt Kaew, Uncle Dech.
-Uncle Peem!

362
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,759
Peem.

363
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,959
Hello.

364
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,999
What's going on?

365
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,799
Peem told me about Putter.

366
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,239
Yes.

367
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,999
I came to visit my grandchild.

368
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,439
I hope you don't mind.

369
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,839
I don't mind.

370
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,559
Putter.

371
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,039
Say hi to grandma

372
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,279
Hi Grandma.

373
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,279
My grandson

374
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,639
Here's your water.

375
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,799
Thank you.

376
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,919
Here you go.

377
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,639
What are you thinking?

378
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,159
I just regret not introducing Putter to Dad.

379
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,759
Sol didn't want to regret again

380
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,159
Even though I can't tell the whole world

381
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,319
and I can't tell Putter either that lim his father,

382
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,959
but I want everyone I love

383
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,639
to know,especially Mom

384
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,559
She deserves to know Putter is her grandson

385
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,039
I understand.

386
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,279
I...

387
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,519
am thinking

388
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,919
how I'm supposed to tell Putter about you.

389
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,439
You're going to tell him?

390
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,399
Yes.

391
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,519
You're his father

392
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,519
Thank you.

393
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,919
I'm so happy.

394
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,079
But right now,

395
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,319
I really don't know how to make him understand

396
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,279
Can l do it?

397
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,799
Kit.

398
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,759
What brings you here?

399
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,639
I found out from Tat.

400
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,559
So I came to help you out.

401
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,799
To repay you.

402
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,439
Can I be the one to tell him?

403
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,839
Yes.

404
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,399
Putter.

405
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,399
Do you miss me?

406
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,559
Yes.

407
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,119
I miss you too.

408
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,879
And...

409
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,719
how much do you love me?

410
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,719
The most in the world!

411
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,679
I loveyou the most in the world too

412
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,359
Are you happy

413
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,079
to have a father that loves you so much?

414
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,719
I am.

415
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,239
And...

416
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,559
what if you have another father that loves you so much as well,

417
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,119
you will be happy?

418
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,719
Yes.

419
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,239
Putter.

420
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,359
Uncle Peem

421
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,479
is your father.

422
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,559
What about you?

423
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,399
How about this?

424
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,079
I'll tell you a story.

425
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,439
Sounds good?

426
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,599
Yes.

427
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,719
Once upon a time

428
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,999
there were two princes that were friends.

429
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,039
One of them

430
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,239
was named Prince Vi kit.

431
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,119
The other

432
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,439
was named Prince Peem

433
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,079
Prince Peem fell in love with Princess Plubpl a

434
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,759
and the two

435
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,599
had a young boy named.

436
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,879
Young Prince Putter.

437
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,919
After that,

438
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,679
a monster appeared

439
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,799
Prince Peem then went on a journey

440
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,359
to kill the monster.

441
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,999
Prince Peem

442
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,519
had to go on a mission to slay the evil dragon.

443
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,839
So he left Young Prince Putter and his mother

444
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,999
under the care of his best friend Prince Vi kit.

445
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,759
Prince Vi kit then

446
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:08,479
became the father and played and took care of the young prince with love.

447
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,359
Not long after that.

448
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,959
the young prince grew up.

449
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,879
Prince Peem

450
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,679
came back from slaying the evil dragon

451
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,679
He came back to live happily with Young Prince Putter

452
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,799
and Princess Plubpl a.

453
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,759
Putter.

454
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,159
Do you understand what they said?

455
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,759
I understand

456
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,559
Putter.

457
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,919
Can you also love me as a father?

458
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,239
I love you Dad!

459
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,959
Vi kit!

460
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,239
Kit.

461
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,239
You gave my son back to me

462
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,039
but your job isn't over yet.

463
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,439
What now?

464
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,159
Actually,

465
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,999
you can still be Putter'sgodfather

466
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,919
Really?

467
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,519
Yes.

468
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,519
You already took on the role.

469
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,239
You gotta keep that role forever.

470
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,399
Thanks Peem.

471
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,199
Thank you.

472
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,079
Yay!

473
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,079
Come here!

474
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,559
Yay! I'm so lucky!

475
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,159
Putter!

476
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,159
Don't run so fast! You're going to fall!

477
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,759
Putter.

478
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,999
You sure love the beach

479
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,359
I love the beach so much!

480
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,839
Well,

481
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,039
he was conceived at the beach

482
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,679
Hey!

483
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,679
What are you saying?!

484
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,719
Am Iright Putter?

485
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,959
Yes.

486
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,239
Putter, what are you making with the sand?

487
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,279
Hey, I thought you said Tat was coming here?

488
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,759
Oh! Tat said he had an urgent case

489
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,639
So may be he'll be here later.

490
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,519
Or nsaid the same thing.

491
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,719
You're on this case?

492
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,678
Yeah.

493
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,839
In that case,

494
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,119
you're representing the other party?

495
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,119
Yes.

496
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,439
But even though it's you.

497
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,039
I'm not gonna go easy on you.

498
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,198
Me too.

499
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,678
If both parties are ready,please come to the courtroom inside.

500
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,479
Sure.

501
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,799
Hey.

502
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,959
Don't forget our date tonight.

503
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,559
I wouldn't.

504
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,719
Putter.

505
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,319
How many was that?

506
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,719
Six!

507
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,959
Good job!

508
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,999
Hey.

509
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,239
It looks like Tat

510
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,679
won't be coming after all

511
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,359
Orn too.

512
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,359
I think

513
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,719
there's something going on between those two.

514
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,279
That's good.

515
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,399
The three of us will have more alone time together as a family.

516
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,479
Plub.

517
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,119
You still look beautiful like the first day l met you

518
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,999
What is this?

519
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,439
Why are you suddenly complimenting me?

520
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,479
Can I trust you?

521
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,319
Peem!

522
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,919
What are you doing?!

523
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,559
What if our son sees?!

524
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,719
He doesn't care

525
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,719
He's busy making sand blocks. There's six already.

526
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,519
You can't!

527
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,519
Thank you Plub.

528
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,759
For what?

529
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,999
For...

530
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,399
teaching me

531
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,399
we shouldn't judge someone if they're good or bad from their appearance.

532
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,879
You taught me as well.

533
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,439
We shouldn't make decisions when we're angry.

534
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,759
Because a spur of the moment

535
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,719
can make us make wrong decisions.

536
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,439
We both learned something from each other.

537
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,759
But there's one thing

538
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,839
that I never regret.

539
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,239
What?

540
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,359
Knowing you

541
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,079
and loving you.

542
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,159
I love you Plubpl a.

543
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,119
I love you too.

544
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,639
Mom, Dad, I'm hungry!

545
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,119
Okay.

546
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,479
Let's go eat okay?

547
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,519
Yay!

548
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,199
Let'sgo eat!

549
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,639
Yay!

550
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:10,399
THE END

551
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:20,319
Thanks for watching!
