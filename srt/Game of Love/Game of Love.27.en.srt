1
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,479
I'm entrusting you

2
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,239
to look after Putter and Plubpl a.

3
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,999
They're my wife and son!

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,159
Of course I will take good care of them!

5
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,959
It's not your job

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,039
to be asking that favor!

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,639
Good

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,159
that you think that way

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,159
Don't you forget it.

10
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,919
I never thought

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,239
that you would believe me anyway.

12
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,719
You want to blame me for that clip

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,839
that your grandmother died because of me,

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,319
you can be mad and hate me all you want,

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,839
or get revenge on me,

16
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,479
I'm not going to make any more excuses.

17
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,959
I just want.

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,079
you and our son to be happy, that's all.

19
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,239
What are you thinking about?

20
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,319
You're home?

21
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,079
Is everything okay?

22
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,439
Lately.

23
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,198
I've noticed you don't look too good

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,839
It's nothing.

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,679
Earlier,

26
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,119
Peem came to see me.

27
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,759
He entrusted me to look after you

28
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,159
and Putter.

29
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,519
He's just saying it

30
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,519
Trying to provoke you. Don't pay attention to him.

31
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,319
What hurts more than not being loved

32
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,559
is loving someone you can't love.

33
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,199
You still love Peem, don't you?

34
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,919
I...

35
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,479
I don't know

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,919
why...

37
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,279
why I'm like this.

38
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,879
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,319
It's okay.

40
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,599
I will wait.

41
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,239
Wait until you no longer love Peem

42
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,119
No matter how long it takes,

43
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,639
I'll wait.

44
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,999
What's the matter Tong?

45
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,078
Someone came to bring you this.

46
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,359
Don't...

47
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,719
take Plub to the wedding

48
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,879
She's already...

49
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,519
been hurt enough.

50
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,959
But I have to make Plub

51
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,479
hurt as much as possible

52
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,639
So she can move forward.

53
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,039
Do you understand?

54
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,839
Go give it to Plub.

55
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,879
You're...

56
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,479
cruel.

57
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,799
Thank you

58
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,239
Watch your face.

59
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,039
Other people will think l forced you into this marriage

60
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,839
I don't care

61
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,639
what other people will think.

62
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,119
Just endure it

63
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,479
We have to show Peem

64
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,999
we're happily married

65
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,919
Okay.

66
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,359
Let's go.

67
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,839
Hello Vi kit,

68
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,839
Plubpl a.

69
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,319
I'm happy you guys came.

70
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,439
It's my friend's wedding

71
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,919
Of course I'd come

72
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,599
Plub.

73
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,639
Thank you for coming.

74
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,799
Ku ddos to you

75
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,839
for being bold to come here

76
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,639
At first

77
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,639
I was hesitant.

78
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,799
I was scared

79
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,159
if I come here and your husband has a change of heart,

80
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,879
it would be chaotic.

81
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,919
Anyway, congratulations Usa.

82
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,679
Finally,

83
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,479
Peem is finally decisive.

84
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,839
We should go inside.

85
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,119
Let's.

86
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,559
Come.

87
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,399
Hello.

88
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,919
Get over Plubpl a.

89
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,719
If you want her to be safe.

90
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,399
Don't make Us a sad.

91
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,399
That's all I'm asking.

92
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,959
I think we should let the kids rest.

93
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,359
Okay?

94
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,919
We should head out.

95
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,239
I'm taking off now dear.

96
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,559
By e Peem

97
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,239
Let's go.

98
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,199
Peem.

99
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,559
I think I have leg cramps. Can you help me up?

100
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,639
Peem!

101
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,199
Where are you going?!

102
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,479
Back to sleep in my room

103
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,639
But we're married

104
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,279
I won't let you sleep elsewhere!

105
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,119
Sa.

106
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,759
You're giving me orders to sleep with you?!

107
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,559
Do you not have any shame?

108
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,919
Peem!

109
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,999
Don't force each other too much

110
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,999
Or else I won't have any patience left.

111
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,559
Peem! No!

112
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,959
I'm sorry!

113
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,159
-Peem!
-Sa!

114
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,679
I'm sorry!

115
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,279
Peem.

116
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,759
Please sympathize me.

117
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,959
I don't want to sleep alone

118
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,639
Peem.

119
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,359
It's our wedding night.

120
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,199
Don't be so cruel to me. Please.

121
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,639
Please Peem!

122
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,639
Peem.

123
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,439
We're married now.

124
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,399
No one will believe that we didn't have sex.

125
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,359
Why don't we share this happiness together?

126
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,559
Please.

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,319
Peem!
-Sa!

128
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,679
Peem.

129
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,439
I promise

130
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,799
I will be a good girl

131
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,719
I will be obedient.

132
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,199
Peem.

133
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,599
Just tonight.

134
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,959
Please.

135
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,079
Make me happy just for tonight

136
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,439
Peem! What are you doing?!

137
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,959
Don't you want to be happy with me?

138
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,759
I do.

139
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,239
Peem!

140
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,239
Where are you taking me?

141
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,759
Someone might see.

142
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,279
Sa.

143
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,359
You think a man will get aroused by a woman who forced him into marriage?

144
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,359
Peem.

145
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,839
What is this?!

146
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,519
Don't come near me again!

147
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,639
Don't make me hate you even more.

148
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,999
Peem!

149
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,159
Why are you drinking alone?

150
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,119
Isn't it your brother's wedding today?

151
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,519
I'm drinking to celebrate his marriage

152
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,359
Why did you call me here?

153
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,919
If Peem can't buy the plot of land in Rayong

154
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,759
won't get to sign a contract with Mr, Mark,

155
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,279
Dad will demote him.

156
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,439
So you want to be the one to buy it.

157
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,439
Yes.

158
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,999
Can you help me with that?

159
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,799
Even if you buy that plot of land

160
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,919
but the project is still Peem's idea.

161
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,839
Whatever you do

162
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,399
think it through first.

163
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,719
What do you want me to do then?

164
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,759
I think

165
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,959
you should buy some other plot of land.

166
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,559
Present Mr. Mark a new project idea

167
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,879
That's how you'll earn points from your dad.

168
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,479
Am I right?

169
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,919
Let me repeat myself.

170
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,319
If those buyers come here again,kick them out. Don't let them come in.

171
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,319
Yes,
Boss

172
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,639
Your tea.

173
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,399
Thank you.

174
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,999
Why don't you want to sell the land?

175
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,399
There's no point in keeping it.

176
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,239
I don't want those people to build a hotel here

177
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,439
Why not?

178
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,559
It's actually good if they build a hotel here.

179
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,639
The workers will have jobs

180
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,279
I just don't like it.

181
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,679
I have my reason not to sell it.

182
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,879
I'm heading to the orchard.

183
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,359
What's wrong with him?

184
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,439
Or...

185
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,559
there's something with PP World?

186
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,879
Where have I heard this name from?

187
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,919
Good morning Au nt Su

188
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,679
You're up early

189
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,479
Have breakfast with me.

190
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,598
I'l I just have coffee for no w, I'llwait for Peem

191
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,839
You didn't know that Peem left at dawn?

192
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,119
How awful of Peem.

193
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,479
He didn't let his wife know.

194
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,359
He's acting like you guys are sleeping in different rooms.

195
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,359
He told me last night but I forgot.

196
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,839
Sure.

197
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,399
Then you also know that he went out of town?

198
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,679
What?

199
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,199
Where did ;he go?

200
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,519
Hello!

201
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,759
Who are you here to see?

202
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,159
I came to see Mr. Dec h, the owner of this orchard.

203
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,879
What's the matter?

204
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,159
Are you here to buy the land?

205
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,239
If so, you can leave.

206
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,519
Mr. Dec h said

207
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,039
he will not sell lit.

208
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,319
Oh.

209
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,799
I came to contact him about exporting his fruits to go sellin china.

210
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,159
Can I meet him?

211
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,599
Right this way then

212
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,599
Follow me.

213
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,239
n M 444
This way.

214
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,599
444 Pick up the pace!

215
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,839
We're two weeks behind. The customer is waiting

216
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,119
You guys over there, come help!

217
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,359
Help them carry this on the car

218
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:00,999
Mom.

219
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,799
Kaew!

220
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,119
Your head hurts again?

221
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,079
I heard a boy calling me.

222
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,079
He called me "mom "

223
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,279
It's so frequent now

224
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,559
I tried to get a vision

225
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,359
but I can't.

226
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,279
So my head hurts.

227
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,119
No. Don't do that again

228
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,479
Don't do that again or else you wil I just get sick

229
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,519
Do you remember the doctor said your memories will come back when it's time?

230
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,639
Okay?

231
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,599
But I feel better now.

232
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,119
The sun is getting hotter

233
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,959
I think you should go rest.

234
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,919
Come on.

235
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,799
Go rest.

236
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,079
Don't be stubborn

237
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,039
Okay.

238
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,279
Go rest.

239
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,799
Sit right here.

240
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,159
Sit.

241
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,479
We'll be done shortly l'lltake you home soon

242
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,879
Boss!

243
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,959
Someone is here to buy fruits!

244
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,359
Who?

245
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,199
Hello.

246
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,999
You?!

247
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,119
You know me?

248
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,679
Come here!

249
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,999
Come!

250
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,279
Who came to see Mr. Dec h?

251
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,799
I don't know.

252
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,159
He just said he's here to buy fruits

253
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,639
Why does he look familiar?

254
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,439
Come here.

255
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,759
Listen up!

256
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,479
You can leave!

257
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,519
I won't sell the land to you!

258
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,959
I didn't tell you I was here to buy your land.

259
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,159
How did you know?

260
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,759
Well.

261
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,039
Unless you know me?

262
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,919
No.

263
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,559
You came to buy my land.

264
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,719
I had to lookup information on you guys first.

265
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,519
Then can you tell me why you won't sell the land to us?

266
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,679
You can propose an offer to me

267
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,999
I will take it into consideration. If it's about money --

268
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,719
It has nothing to do with the money.

269
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,959
It's just...

270
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,319
I sold it to someone else already.

271
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,959
Who?

272
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,159
Me.

273
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,839
Plubpl a.

274
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,799
If we're able to buy that plot of land in Rayong,

275
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,319
there will be no entrance to PP World beach side

276
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,839
Mr, Mark isn't going to sign a contract with them either

277
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,519
Most importantly,

278
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,919
if they can't sign a contract with Mr Mark,

279
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,479
Peem will get demoted at the company.

280
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,399
You're a little late Peem.

281
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,559
Leave

282
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,479
Is old it to V Group

283
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,599
Plubpl a.

284
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,279
I need to talk to you.

285
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,159
Sir,don't be rude to my guest

286
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,159
It's okay.

287
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,799
Follow me if you need to talk.

288
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,519
Hey wait.

289
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,599
Yes?

290
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,959
Where's Kaew?

291
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,039
She went home already

292
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,799
What do you want to talk about?

293
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,519
But if you want me to give the land --

294
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,719
Peem! What are you doing?!

295
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,759
Let go!

296
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,399
Peem!

297
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,959
Peem! You'remarried now!

298
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,479
How much dol have to get hurt

299
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,559
until you're satisfied?

300
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,119
Not just get hurt.

301
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,039
I'm going to destroy you

302
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,599
I told you before.

303
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,799
I will do everything to destroy you.

304
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,999
I can't miss out on the launch of the famous burger shop here.

305
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,079
I drove two hours for this.

306
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,519
It's Tre.

307
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,999
What is she doing with Peem's step mom?

308
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,399
I have to go.

309
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,999
Wait.

310
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,519
This isn't all the money you said you were going to give me.

311
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,279
It's millions.

312
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,119
Who can get you all of it at once?

313
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,919
A millionaire wife like you don't have any money?

314
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,679
Give me time.

315
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,599
I'll gradually pay you.

316
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,279
Don't play any tricks with me.

317
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,439
If you're going to threaten me,

318
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,759
who would dare play tricks?

319
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,639
Good.

320
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,319
If you don't want Mr. Peem to know about the clip

321
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,439
then give me the full amount

322
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,359
Peem and I used to hire a programming company

323
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,639
to hack into the account who leaked the clip

324
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,879
Supposedly the one who leaked the clip was living overseas.

325
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,799
But when we actually tracked them down

326
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,159
we didn't find anyone

327
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,159
Here.

328
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,839
Here is all the documentation of all the programming companies I reguested.

329
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,999
Take a look.

330
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,519
Clip?

331
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,399
Don't tell me...

332
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,959
Thank you so much

333
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,359
for choosing my company to sell your land to.

334
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,879
To be frank.

335
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,559
I wanted to sell this land off to end this chaos a long time ago.

336
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,119
When l first bought it, I wanted to help the person who came to mortgage it.

337
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,279
I have a question.

338
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,479
Why didn't you sell the land to Mr, Peem's company?

339
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,239
This land is right next to his company

340
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,159
He would have paid a lot to get this plot of land.

341
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,679
I'll be honest.

342
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,679
I don't want to get involved with them.

343
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,239
More importantly

344
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,599
I don't want PP World to build a hotel here.

345
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,959
How about this?

346
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,279
After we're done checking out the land,

347
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,559
come have lunch at my house

348
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,519
Kaew will be happy to see you here.

349
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,479
Sure.

350
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,359
Please'stop!

351
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,319
What can I do for you?

352
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,239
My battery is dead.

353
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,239
Can you help me jump it?

354
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,959
Sure.

355
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,039
Thank you.

356
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,999
He came to help me jump the car

357
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,159
Here you go.

358
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,959
Thank you.

359
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,639
Thank you so much young man.

360
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,039
You're welcome.

361
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,639
Mom.

362
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,599
The car that went to drop off Kaew broke down?

363
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,719
I think the battery is dead.

364
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,639
Ming just called to let me know

365
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,039
I'll go take a look.

366
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,199
Wait just a moment Plub

367
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,159
Can I come with you?

368
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,639
I want to go say hi to Aunt Kaew.

369
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,799
Sure.

370
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,359
Follow me

371
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,639
You know me?

372
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,719
You don't remember me, Mom?

373
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,359
Peem.

374
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,159
-Yes?
-Wash it carefully son.

375
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,719
You'll bruise lit.

376
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,279
Do you even know how to do it?

377
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,799
I do!

378
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,119
Mom!

379
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,439
I prepared you your favorite snack.

380
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,439
What are you doing?

381
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,679
I love you the most!

382
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,519
Son.

383
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,839
Yes.

384
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,759
I'm Peem.

385
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,439
The son you left behind!

386
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,879
Mom.

387
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,279
What's wrong?

388
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,399
Mom.

389
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,199
You! Back away!

390
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,239
Aunt Kaew!

391
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,919
What's wrong?

392
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,479
My head hurts.

393
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,679
What did you do to Kaew for her to be like this?!

394
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,199
She's my mom.

395
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,519
Her name is Mane ewan.

396
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,519
Not Kaew.

397
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,519
How did my mom end up here?!

398
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,039
Stop talking!

399
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,239
Go! Get out of here!

400
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,959
Go! Kaew isn't your mother!

401
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,719
Get out!

402
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,679
I'm not leaving!

403
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,519
Untill know

404
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,519
why my mom is like this.

405
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,719
I told you she isn't your mother! Leave!

406
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,959
Get out!

407
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,039
-No.
-Go!

408
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,399
I said leave!

409
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,519
Dec h!

410
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,799
Yes.

411
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,039
He's my son!

412
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,679
Mom.

413
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,199
Peem!

414
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,399
I thought

415
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,839
I won't get to see you again.

416
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,679
You didn't move overseas.

417
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,159
But you were in Rayong the whole time?

418
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,639
Yes.

419
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,799
Why didn't you go back to see me?

420
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,159
Did you really leave me like you wrote in your letter?

421
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,359
What letter?

422
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,599
The letter

423
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,639
you left for me.

424
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,559
If I...

425
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,159
remembered,

426
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,999
I would never not go back to you

427
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,199
Kaew has...

428
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,719
amnesia.

429
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,159
What?

430
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,399
Is that true?

431
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,599
I...

432
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,799
remembered you when I saw you.

433
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,039
What happened to you

434
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,279
while you went missing?

435
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,519
Don't hurt me!

436
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,479
Don't follow me!

437
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,839
Don't hurt me!

438
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,359
Why are you doing this?!

439
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,199
Don't!

440
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,119
Where are you going?!

441
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:36,919
Let me go!

442
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,719
I can't remember

443
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,599
who he was.

444
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,199
I don't know why he wanted to kill me!

445
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,199
I don't know!

446
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,999
When I was conscious,

447
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,799
I couldn't remember anything.

448
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,039
I couldn't even remember who I was!

449
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,919
Dec h was the one that looked after me all those times

450
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,359
I didn't know

451
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,719
what you had to encounter.

452
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,959
I was disheartened

453
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,158
that you left me.

454
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,239
I'm sorry Mom.

455
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,198
It's okay son.

456
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,879
You didn't know.

457
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,639
It's okay.

458
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,599
Mr. Dec h.

459
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,239
Thank you

460
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,039
for taking good care of my mother.

461
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,999
No need to thank me

462
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,439
I'm not that good of a person.

463
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,559
Why would you say that?

464
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,959
I knew for a long time who you were.

465
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,319
And you kept it from me?!

466
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,519
If you knew,

467
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,799
why didn't you send my mom back to me?!

468
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,479
You're --

469
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,479
Calm down! Calm down son!

470
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,839
Peem.

471
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,959
Calm down.

472
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,719
Just talk this out rationally.

473
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,959
I think Mr. Dec h has his reason.

474
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,199
I'm sorry I kept the truth from you.

475
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,279
I am selfish.l was scared that if you knew the truth,

476
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,839
I would lose you

477
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,839
Have you ever thought if I let you go back to who you were,

478
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,199
go be with your good family

479
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,359
what will i happen to you if those bad people are still around?!

480
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,559
Have you ever considered how I would feel?!

481
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,959
I've thought of everything and lim scared of everything!

482
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,959
Dec h.

483
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,679
Is this why

484
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,079
you won't sell the land to me?

485
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,439
Because you were scared we were going to see Mom?

486
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,799
I'm so disappointed in you.

487
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,039
Wait Kaew.

488
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,079
Kaew!

489
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,399
I i'll go talk to Mom.

490
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,919
Mom.

491
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,919
Peem.

492
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,439
I'm sorry that he kept me from you

493
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,719
He made us unable to be together.

494
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,919
I almost didn't get to see you.

495
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,559
But Mr. Dec his right though.

496
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,999
If you went back to me,

497
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,999
you might have been dead by now.

498
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,239
You're not...

499
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,959
mad at him?

500
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,039
I am.

501
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,079
But l also understand

502
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,479
he did it because he loves you.

503
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,759
You're also happy here

504
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,719
So no matter how much l want to be mad

505
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,039
I can't.

506
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,079
Peem.

507
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,319
Mom.

508
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,759
We shouldn't judge someone

509
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,599
based on their actions.

510
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,999
We need to look at their intentions too.

511
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,439
Peem.

512
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,639
You've grown up so much.

513
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,879
Probably because I became a defendant for someone

514
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,279
even though I didn't intend for it to be like that

515
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,759
What did you have to face

516
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,359
in the past?
