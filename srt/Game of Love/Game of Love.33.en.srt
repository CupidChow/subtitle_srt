1
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,279
Putter!

2
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,559
Orn!

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,879
Putter!

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,959
Orn!

5
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,919
Putter!

6
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,999
Where did they go?

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,879
Hello?

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,559
Orn.

9
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,519
Where are you?

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,399
I'm at work.

11
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,239
I got called Jin for an urgent matter.

12
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,879
What's wrong?

13
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,759
Where's Putter?

14
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,759
Putter is home with Kit.

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,719
Home?

16
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,119
You're crazy! No one is home!

17
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,439
But Kit said he will look after Putter sol can come back to work.

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,999
Okay

19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,679
They probably went to go buy something. I'll call him.

20
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,399
Vi kit.

21
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,959
Is Putter with you?

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,719
He started to cry

23
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,799
and had a fever.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,799
So I took him to a doctor.

25
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,359
What's wrong with Putter?!

26
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,199
Where are you right now?

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,079
Okay. I'm on my way.

28
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,959
Okay.

29
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,839
Vi kit!

30
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,719
Is Putter okay?

31
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,679
Putter is fine.

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,319
Doctor said he's healthy.

33
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,719
I think l was overreacting

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,999
I thought he was sick because he was crying

35
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,719
So I brought him to see a doctor

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,999
Okay.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,159
In that case, we should head back.

38
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,519
Yes.

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,799
Come on.

40
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,719
Let's go.

41
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,999
Come.

42
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,279
I'm sorry!

43
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,559
It's okay.

44
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,759
Kit.

45
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,199
Sa.

46
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,199
What's wrong?

47
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,159
Are you sick?

48
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,279
You're pregnant?

49
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,599
No.

50
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,399
I'm not.

51
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,439
How are you not?

52
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,279
These are prenatal meds.

53
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,679
Kit.

54
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,279
Don't tell Peem that I'm pregnant

55
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,439
You too.

56
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,799
I'm begging you

57
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,039
Sure,

58
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,919
What do you mean?

59
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,999
Why can't we tell Peem?

60
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,719
If you'll excuse me.

61
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,159
Wait Sa! Wait!

62
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,159
Whatever issues you have,

63
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,799
you can tell me.

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,479
I can't tell you.

65
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,599
Just please let me go

66
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,719
What happened Usa?

67
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,239
You're pregnant with Peema ren't you?

68
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,959
Yes.

69
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,119
I'm pregnant with Peem

70
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,119
Does Peem know that you're pregnant?

71
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,599
Why don't you tell him?

72
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,479
Peem...

73
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,479
wants to divorce me.

74
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,639
He wants to get back with you

75
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,079
what will you do next?

76
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,679
If I have to divorce him,

77
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,399
I'm going to get an abortion.

78
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,039
What?!

79
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,999
No Usa. You can't do that.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,519
It's better than letting the child be born in a broken family.

81
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,759
I believe

82
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,119
if you tell Peem,

83
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,279
he will change his mind

84
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,039
If you're scared to tell him, I can tell him for you.

85
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,039
You can't.

86
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,519
I...

87
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,319
I don't want Peem to hate me even more.

88
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,199
That's right

89
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,279
I think if you tell Peem,

90
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,759
he will be even more mad at Sa.

91
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,639
Most importantly,

92
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,199
I asked Peem already

93
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,919
what he will do

94
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,799
if I get pregnant.

95
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,599
He said he still will divorce me.

96
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,679
I don't know what to do

97
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,399
Peem really said that?

98
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,679
Plub.

99
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,879
I'm begging you.

100
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,439
Can you help me?

101
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,399
He still has hope

102
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,359
of getting back together with you.

103
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,719
But if...

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,599
you show him

105
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,639
that you will never get back together with him,

106
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,079
he should get over you

107
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,879
and change his mind about divorcing me.

108
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,319
I'm begging you.

109
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,999
For my baby's sake

110
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,759
I don't have any other choice.

111
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,719
You have to help me.

112
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,719
Yes.

113
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,439
I will try...

114
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,999
to think of ways to help you

115
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,679
Thank you Plub.

116
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,239
I truly thank you.

117
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,239
Peem

118
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,919
If l have to divorce him, I will get an abortion.

119
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,319
Plub.

120
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,599
Putter is asleep?

121
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,199
He is.

122
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,759
I had to read him so many stories before he was able to sleep.

123
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,719
Thank you

124
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,079
Sure.

125
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,039
If you really want to help S a,

126
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,799
we shouldn't get a divorce.

127
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,319
Our situation

128
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,679
has nothing to do with Peem or, Usa

129
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,199
But if we don't divorce,

130
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,599
it will stop Peem from having any hope

131
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,399
of getting back together with you.

132
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,798
If he knows Sa is pregnant

133
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,199
it will stop him from divorcing Sa.

134
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,279
This is the only way we can help Sa and her baby.

135
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,959
You really think like that?

136
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,999
You can call mean opportunist.

137
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,319
But I can't imagine

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,919
a better solution to this.

139
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,559
Yeah.

140
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,519
I'll think about it.

141
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,599
What did Plubp la say?

142
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,599
It looks like she sympathizes you and the baby very much

143
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,799
Everything should go according to our plan.

144
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,159
So,

145
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,319
Plubpl a won't divorce you?

146
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,519
Plub wants to think about it.

147
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,239
Will this make her get over Peem though?

148
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,319
Ever since I've known her,

149
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,679
she's a very good person

150
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,319
She always thinks of others before herself.

151
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,399
I think...

152
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,879
if she knows what you have to encounter,

153
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,199
she will walk away from Peem.

154
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,679
I hope so.

155
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,839
Plub.

156
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,559
What's the matter?

157
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,919
Vi kit.

158
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,719
I've made my decision.

159
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,679
I will help Usa.

160
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,279
Can you call her to come meet me?

161
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,839
I want to see her in person.

162
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,959
Sure.

163
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,759
I'll see you soon.

164
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,999
Why did you wanted to see me?

165
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,319
I want to

166
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,559
help you and Peem.

167
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,199
Really?

168
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,639
Thank you.

169
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,999
I truly thank you

170
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,999
Don't thank me yet.

171
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,799
Before I help, I have a question to ask.

172
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,439
But you need to answer me truthfully.

173
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,239
What is it?

174
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,439
Are you

175
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,799
really pregnant with Peem?

176
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,559
Plub!

177
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,919
Why are you asking me like that?!

178
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,759
That's disrespectful!

179
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,239
Plub.

180
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,759
Why did you ask Sa like that?

181
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,759
I'm just curious

182
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,959
If you're pregnant with Peem why don't you just tell him?

183
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,559
That's the best reason for him not to divorce you.

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,479
I told you already

185
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,159
Peem will divorce me regardless

186
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,519
He wants to get back together with you

187
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,759
All of this is because of you!

188
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,079
Do you not realize it?!

189
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,879
You're the one that doesn't realize it.

190
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,079
Peem.

191
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,399
Why don't you realize that the reason I don't love you

192
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,119
is not because of Plubpl a?

193
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,399
Whether Plubpl a exist or not

194
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,959
I will never love you

195
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,359
I only consider you a sister.

196
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,719
Peem.

197
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,119
You called them here?!

198
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,879
Yes.

199
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,719
Plub!

200
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,439
What's wrong?

201
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,879
Is our son sick?

202
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,479
No.

203
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,159
Putter is fine

204
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,639
That's a relief that he's fine.

205
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,079
So what's the matter?

206
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,479
I have a question to ask

207
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,559
before l make my decision.

208
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,239
You have to answer me truthfully.

209
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,879
Sure.

210
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,839
The other-day

211
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,439
why did you come looking for Usa at my house?

212
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,439
Sa went to see you?

213
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,639
Sa's pregnant.

214
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,319
You know

215
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,119
she's pregnant,

216
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,679
so why are you still divorcing her?.

217
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,639
What did Sa tell you?

218
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,199
She said

219
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,759
you will divorce her because "of,me.

220
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,199
It has nothing to do with you

221
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,039
Then what?

222
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,399
Because Sa is pregnant with ime

223
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,159
What?!

224
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,919
The baby

225
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,959
is my child.

226
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,519
Why did you tell Peem?!

227
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,879
I told you not to tell him!

228
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,439
-- You betrayed me?!
-Sa!

229
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,039
-Sa stop! Sa!
-Why are you doing this?!

230
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,399
That's enough!

231
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,399
I'm not pregnant!

232
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,599
That's enough Sa!

233
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,839
Stop lying!

234
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,119
You're pregnant with my child, aren't you?

235
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,519
How did you know?

236
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,799
Peem!

237
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,119
I'm not pregnant!

238
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,479
-Peem!
-Sa!

239
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,919
You're pregnant with my child, aren't you?

240
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,919
Are you?!

241
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,039
-Answer me!
-No!

242
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,359
The child is Peem's.

243
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,519
How can it be his?

244
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,359
You and him

245
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,279
never slept in the same room.

246
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,119
How would you know?

247
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,359
We're married!

248
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,559
It's Peem'schild!

249
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,799
Peem promised me

250
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,039
that he wouldn't touch you.

251
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,279
I believe him.

252
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,039
Stop lying Sa.

253
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,719
You know deep down that we never slept together.

254
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,639
Why are you lying to other people?

255
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,119
Sa!

256
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,279
What is going on?!

257
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,319
You're not pregnant with Peem?!

258
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,879
You got deceived Kit.

259
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,719
The reason you don't want me to know that you're pregnant

260
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,879
because we never-slept together

261
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,679
You were scared that I would know the baby isn't mine.

262
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,719
I'm not lying.

263
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,279
You're not taking responsibility!

264
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,239
Let's go Sa.

265
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,439
Come here!

266
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,159
Let go!

267
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,199
Peem!

268
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,199
Let go!

269
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,879
Vi kit.

270
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,079
We need to talk

271
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,159
Come here!

272
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:29,999
Let go!

273
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,519
- Let go!
-Stop being crazy!

274
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,519
Pull yourself together!

275
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,639
For the baby's sake!

276
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,879
I am thinking about the baby

277
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,359
that's why I can't divorce Peem!

278
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,519
The baby

279
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,279
has to have Peem as the father.

280
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,599
Not you!

281
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,559
If you hate me so much

282
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,399
then why even get involved with me in the first place?!

283
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,919
Because I'm the mistress's son right?

284
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,719
That's why you hate me.

285
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,759
If you know, why bother asking?

286
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,239
Mom.

287
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,919
I need your help.

288
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,839
Plub.

289
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,039
When you said you love me

290
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,879
I don't think that's true.

291
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,919
If you really loved me

292
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,479
you wouldn't makeup this lie

293
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,079
Plub.

294
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,079
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,439
I'm disappointed in you

296
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,919
But I did it

297
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,639
so that I don't lose you and our son.

298
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,359
I'm doing this for him

299
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,239
For our family.

300
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,759
You did it for yourself.

301
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,318
Don't use him as an excuse.

302
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,439
You can think that way.

303
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,838
Even if limb ad in your eyes

304
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,959
but if it makes you stay with me, I will do everything

305
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,559
Then let me ask you a question

306
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,319
Go think about it before answering me

307
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,519
You're refusing to divorce me

308
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,359
because you love me

309
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,199
or you're refusing to lose to Peem?

310
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,719
Think about it first

311
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,759
If you really love me,

312
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,919
you would want to see me and my son happy

313
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,599
Not keep lying to me like this.

314
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,239
What you did today made me confident

315
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,639
that we should get a divorce

316
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,519
Plub.

317
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,679
Peem asked for a divorce?!

318
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,719
You have to help me

319
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,119
I won't divorce him!

320
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,719
I won't lose him!

321
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,279
How dare he?!

322
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,399
How dare he do this to our family?!

323
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,159
I won't divorce him Dad

324
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,759
You have to help me!

325
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,719
Sa!

326
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,959
Enough already!

327
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,119
Peem doesn't love you so why try to force it?!

328
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,359
I'm pregnant!

329
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,719
What?!

330
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,199
I'm pregnant with Peem

331
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,239
Liar!

332
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,079
Pete!

333
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,759
Why are you here?

334
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,839
Go home!

335
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,959
What is going on Mrs. Sup ang?!

336
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,679
I brought Pete to ask for Mr. Thaw ip and your forgiveness.

337
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,119
Forgiveness?

338
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,799
Forgiveness for what?

339
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,959
Tell him.

340
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,239
Pete.

341
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,599
Don't say it!

342
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,359
I won't let you do things as you please anymore.

343
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,679
The baby

344
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,199
is mine.

345
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,119
What?!

346
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,479
Is that true?!

347
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,879
Sa! Is it true?!

348
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,319
It's not!

349
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,319
Pete is lying!

350
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,999
Pete has a crush on me.

351
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,559
He's lying because he wants me to divorce Peem.

352
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,159
It's not true Mom, Dad

353
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,279
The baby is Peem's.

354
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,319
Gosh Sa.

355
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,719
How can it be Peem's child?

356
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,559
The whole family knows

357
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,279
you and Peem never slept together.

358
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,199
How would you people know about this private matter?

359
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,199
If you don't believe me sir,

360
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,719
I am willing to get a paternity test

361
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,719
when Sa gives birth.

362
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,879
It's a good idea

363
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,799
Is it true Usa?!

364
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,319
Are you pregnant with Pete?!

365
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,159
I...

366
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,999
How could you do this?!

367
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,879
I had you marry Peem because I want my grandchild to be the heir to PP World!

368
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,639
But you're pregnant with --

369
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,079
Go divorce Peem!

370
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,319
No!

371
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,319
I won't divorce him

372
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,679
My child has to be Peem's!

373
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,679
Dad!

374
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,519
You have to help me!

375
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,959
Just like you helped me in the past!

376
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,559
Whatever I wanted,you would always get it for me, no?!

377
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,919
But you're pregnant with someone else and that man happens to be Peem's brother!

378
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,159
How do you want me to help you?!

379
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,679
Sa!

380
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,679
It's pointless now.

381
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,319
Get over Peem

382
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,959
and start paying attention to the man who loves you like Pete!

383
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,519
No I won't divorce him!

384
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,799
Sa!

385
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,999
Don't come near me!

386
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,239
I rather die than get a divorce!

387
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,519
Sa, put the knife down! It's dangerous!

388
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,519
Dad.

389
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,119
I really love Peem.

390
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,959
I've loved him since I was little.

391
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,679
I did everything for him!

392
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,799
But he never loved me

393
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,279
Sa.

394
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,879
Peem never loved me!

395
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,759
Don't do this dear.

396
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,199
How is Plub pla

397
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,199
better than me?

398
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,479
Why do l have to lose to her?!

399
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,719
Sa!

400
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,719
-Sa!
-Don't Sa!

401
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,239
Sa!

402
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,759
Usa! Honey!

403
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,759
My daughter!

404
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,679
Sa!

405
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,279
Somebody call the ambulance!

406
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,719
Honey!

407
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,919
Are you okay?

408
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,799
Plub.

409
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,319
Are you okay?

410
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,719
Yeah.

411
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,439
I thought you left.

412
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,119
I wanted to thank you first.

413
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,199
Thank me for what?

414
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,679
Well,

415
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,159
for believing in me.

416
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,199
O just

417
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,319
don't want to listen to one side of the story.

418
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,799
Everyone has their reasons.

419
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,359
Including you.

420
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,079
I'm so proud

421
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,519
to love you.

422
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,719
Hey.

423
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,919
Peem.

424
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,199
Let go!

425
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,359
We're not divorced yet.

426
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,159
But we're about to.

427
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,519
Peem!

428
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,719
Let go!

429
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,439
Hey!

430
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,039
Even if we're divorced

431
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,519
we can't love each other.

432
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,959
Why not?

433
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,719
Because...

434
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,359
we have to think about our son first.

435
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,439
But...

436
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,639
Just stop.

437
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,679
Let's not talk about it right now

438
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,199
We each have other things to focus on right now.

439
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,559
Right.

440
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,959
I still need to find the perpetrator who killed my dad.

441
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,479
How is she?

442
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,839
Ever since she came back from the hospital,

443
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,559
if she's not asleep she would be aloof like this

444
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,599
It's all because of Peem

445
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,079
Don't blame other people.

446
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,959
We raised her the wrong way.

447
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,479
We love and spoil her way too much.

448
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,559
You're always siding with him!

449
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,479
No.

450
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,839
I'm speaking the truth.

451
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,199
Mrs. Sup ang and Mr Pete came to visit Young Miss.

452
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,239
Stay here.

453
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,559
I'll go.

454
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,839
Go ahead.

455
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,239
I'm sorry dear.

456
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,919
The reason you've become like this

457
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,919
is partially my fault.

458
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,279
I was too weak.

459
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,919
From now on, I won't let anything take the wrong path

460
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,079
I will take care

461
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,879
and protect you

462
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,519
and my grandchild

463
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,439
He's coming.

464
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,599
Hello sir.

465
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,879
We went to visit Sa

466
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,439
But after finding out she was discharged, we came here instead.

467
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,359
How is she?

468
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,079
She's physically fine.

469
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,279
But she's not mentally well.

470
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,679
Can I please go upstairs to see her?

471
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,479
Yeah.

472
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,999
Go check on her

473
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,439
I'm going to talk to Mr. Thaw ip.

474
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,799
Okay.

475
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,439
If my daughter wasn't pregnant

476
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,799
and my grandchild would end up being fatherless,

477
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,759
I wouldn't have spared your son.

478
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,839
Pete love s Sa very much sir

479
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,839
The relationship that happened was consensual

480
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,599
So how is it Pete's fault?

481
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,919
Well,

482
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,759
say what you need to say!

483
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,759
I know

484
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,599
you resent Pe em for doing this to Sa.

485
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,319
You want to use me to get rid of Peem?

486
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,159
Since we have a common enemy,

487
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,759
why don't we join hands and get rid of Peem?

488
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,319
Before he divorce s Sa.

489
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,199
Other than getting revenge,

490
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,599
your side will benefit from this too.

491
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,119
How so?

492
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,359
Sa won't get a divorce right now

493
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,999
She's still the lawful wife.

494
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,839
If Peem dies while they're still married,

495
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,639
the person that will get all of Peem's inheritance

496
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,439
is Sa

497
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,679
and our grandchild.

498
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,319
Am I right?

499
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,119
But killing someone like Peem won't be easy

500
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,679
We can't just kill him whenever, wherever

501
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,399
Don't worry about that.

502
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,399
I have a way.

503
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,519
assure you

504
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,599
Peem will fall for the trap and die.

505
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,799
What plan do you have?

506
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,519
Orn!

507
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,679
Food is here!

508
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,239
I'm starving!

509
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,519
Come help me plate them then

510
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,079
Come.

511
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,279
Thank you.

512
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,279
Putter, let's go inside.

513
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,279
Let's go eat.

514
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,759
We found Plubp la and her son.

515
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,679
Good!

516
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,439
Keep an eye on them.

517
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,079
Wait for my orders

518
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,399
Plub!

519
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,119
What's wrong?

520
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,519
Is our son sick?

521
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,639
No.

522
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,199
Putter is fine.

523
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,719
That's a relief that he's fine.

524
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,319
That kid is Peem's son

525
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,439
Even better!

526
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,719
Here.

527
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,679
We tried tracing clues from CCTVs.

528
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,279
We found that Mrs. Sup ang left the temple

529
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,119
and headed straight to an abandoned warehouse.

530
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,319
The same warehouse where Was u was killed?

531
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,759
Yes.

532
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,719
It might be a misunderstanding.

533
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,519
Just because it's the same route,it doesn't mean that Mom went there.

534
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,719
But this spot is the nearest to the abandoned warehouse

535
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,319
And this is the only spot in the area with a i c CTV camera installed

536
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,479
This is the other clip

537
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,679
that showed Mrs. Sup ang walking back

538
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,519
If you take a closer look

539
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,599
you can see blood residue on her leg

540
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,399
That day...

541
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,959
What is it Pete?

542
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,359
Well,

543
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,759
I did see blood on her leg.

544
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,719
So it was Mrs. Sup ang?

545
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,919
From Was u's time of death

546
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,239
and the time stamp from the camera,

547
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,759
I'm quite certain it's her.

548
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,759
Most importantly,

549
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,279
I checked Was u's money transactions

550
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,759
I found that Mrs. Sup ang has been wiring him money pretty often

551
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,479
ever since ten years ago

552
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,799
That means

553
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,879
Au nt Su hired Was u to kill my mom over ten years ago?

554
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,039
I think so.

555
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,479
Mom was the one who killed Was u?

556
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,879
That means

557
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,479
Mom was involved

558
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,479
in Dad's death?

559
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,799
Yes Pete!

560
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,639
Aunt Suse nt Was u to go kill my mom

561
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,959
but he failed.

562
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,679
The one that died was our father.

563
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,919
It's okay Pete.

564
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,119
Why did Mom do it?

565
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,679
Why?

566
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,119
Everyone has their own reasons.

567
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,039
But whatever the reason

568
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,239
we have no right to take someone's life.

569
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,319

572

What will...

573
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,759
you do with Mom next?

574
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,359
Excuse me Captain

575
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,319
Here's Mrs. Sup ang arrest warrant.

576
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,799

She's in her room

00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,359
Peem.

579
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,559
Can I go talk to her myself?

580
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,959
Pete.

581
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,799
You need to accept the truth

582
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,319
and move forward.

583
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,559
What you should do right now

584
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,039
is stand by her side

585
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,039
so she will do the right thing for once

586
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,439
Come in!

587
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,759
Pete.

588
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,799
Where are you going?

589
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,439
I'm meeting a friend.

590
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,999
We're going to visit a temple out of town.

591
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,319
What do you need?

592
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,039
You hired

593
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,359
Was u to go kill Dad, didn't you?

594
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,919
What are you saying?!

595
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,919
Why would I do that?!

596
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,638
The police have evidence

597
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,999
when you went to kill Was u.

598
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,399
That's not true!

599
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,399
I didn't do it!

600
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,479
It's impossible. I'm being slandered!

601
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,119
Peem and the others are slandering me!

602
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,359
Stop lying Mom!

603
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,199
Why did you kill Dad?

604
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,599
I didn't mean for Puchong to die!

605
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,159
But I wanted to kill Mane ewan!

606
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,399
Peem's mother!

607
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,679
But your father saved her!

608
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,639
Your father's death had nothing to do with me!

609
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,759
Enough Mom!

610
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,719
The cause of Dad'sdeath

611
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,639
came from you, no?

612
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,239
Mom.

613
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,519
Turn yourself in.

614
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,199
The police are waiting downstairs.

615
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,719
What?!

616
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,279
Trust me.

617
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,999
If you turn yourself in,

618
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,999
your sentencing might not be so severe.

619
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,639
Trust me.

620
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,119
No.

621
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,879
I won't have this kind of ending!

622
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,159
What are you going to do then?!

623
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,159
I would rather die

624
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,199
than get arrested!

625
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,119
Hey!

626
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,919
Don't Mom!

627
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,239
Choose!

628
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,239
Will you help me

629
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,839
or let me die right here?!

630
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,239
Choose!

631
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,159
Pete.

632
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,519
Where's Aunt Su?

633
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,239
Mom got away.

634
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,439
What?!

635
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,959
Go! Find her!

636
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,519
Can I go upstairs?

637
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,799
Sure.

638
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,279
Pete.

639
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,719
How could you let her go?

640
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,919
Mom threatened to kill herself

641
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,679
I'm sorry!

642
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,479
I can't stand and watch my mom die in front of me.

643
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,079
Hello.

644
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,799

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,399
Regardless,

650
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,239
Think about our relationship in the past

651
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,599
Please help me escape.

652
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,839
Don't forget

I can help you

655
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,319
If we join hands

656
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,799
it will succeed sir.

657
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,919
Fine.

658
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,399
