1
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,199
I'm ready Plub

2
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,159
What's next?

3
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,039
Who would believe that a woman of her size

4
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,319
that I once insulted

5
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,879
changed my life til now?

6
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,518
That woman

7
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,719
made me a better person

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,919
Plub.

9
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,079
You want to change your mind?

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,239
Do it.

11
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,959
I have to thank her.

12
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,759
Sa,

13
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,079
my fiancee.

14
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,399
It's not what you think

15
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,639
The "truth is I didn't want to get engaged to Sa.

16
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,719
Oh.

17
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,439
Hey.

18
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,919
I'm really happy for you

19
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,599
I have no grudges. I'm okay.

20
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,959
Our relationship..

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,559
ended.

22
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,599
I'm serious.

23
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,279
I think about you all the time

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,879
Oh shit Peem.

25
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,799
Peem.

26
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,919
Whatever you say.

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,039
please respect Ms. Usa.

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,279
She is your fiancee right now.

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,399
Then wait for me.

30
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,039
Once l take care of Usa's situation,

31
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,559
we can start over.

32
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,719
Okay?

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,199
What?

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,479
-Mr. Peem.
Ms. Usa, did you know about this?

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,999
Ms. Usa.

36
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,039
Is this true? Can you answer us?
-Ms. Usa.

37
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,439
Is it true?

38
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,519
Please answer us.

39
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,279
So what's the real story?

40
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,239
What's the story?

41
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,559
Please give us an answer.

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,039
Are you two still in love?

43
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,679
Is this considered cheating?

44
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,999
Mr, Peem, so what's the story? Please answer us

45
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,159
Mr. Peem!

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,079
Sa!

47
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,639
What is this Mr. Puchong?!

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,479
Please stay calm sir.

49
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,679
- It might be a misunderstanding.
-What misunderstanding?

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,679
The voice we heard in the clip is Peem's voice

51
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,319
Your son

52
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,719
humiliated my daughter.

53
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,639
Therefore,

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,639
you must be responsible for this. Remember that!

55
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,439
Sir. Sir!

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,959
Looks like your favorite son caused a real problem

57
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,799
Puchong!

58
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,879
Wait for me!

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,239
Was that your voice?

60
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,719
Can you please explain?

61
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,279
Sa! Sa!

62
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,639
Sa!

63
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,719
Sa.

64
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,919
Peem!

65
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,999
Pete.

66
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,239
Didn't I tell you

67
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,319
not to ma ke Sa sad?!

68
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,879
Wait Pete.

69
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,239
You punched me

70
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,199
because of Sa?

71
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,159
Yeah!

72
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,599
I can do more than that

73
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,439
if you ma ke Sa cry

74
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,919
and sad again!

75
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,519
Pete.

76
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,639
If you love her,

77
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,919
why didn't you take her from me?

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,999
Why are you doing this?!

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,719
Because she loves you!

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,879
I will do everything

81
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,239
to make the person I love be happy!

82
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,679
Understood?!

83
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,359
Are you going to kill me?

84
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,759
Sa!

85
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,239
Let's go.

86
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,079
Tong.

87
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,119
Take your nephew to the car.

88
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:48,919
Okay.

89
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,879
I'm going to use the restroom

90
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,519
Sure.

91
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,479
Let's go.

92
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,119
Come.

93
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,639
Peem!

94
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,439
We need to talk

95
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,759
-Hey!
-Come here!

96
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,719
Peem!

97
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,999
Let go!

98
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:32,879
Hey!

99
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,119
Peem!

100
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,159
What the hell are you doing?!

101
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,879
-Where are you going?!
- Let go!

102
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,799
We need to talk!

103
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,239
I have nothing to talk about!

104
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,359
But I do!

105
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,679
Why are you doing this?

106
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,919
You left me without saying a word.

107
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,519
You made me search everywhere for you

108
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,999
because I was worried!

109
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,399
But how you repay me

110
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,919
is by coming back as Kit's wife?!

111
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,399
Making me look stupid wasn't enough,

112
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,799
now you want to do this?!

113
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,759
I really want to know what you get from doing this!

114
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,399
Satisfaction.

115
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,959
I just want to show everyone

116
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,079
how you're really like.

117
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,879
This is only the beginning.

118
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,679
What do you mean?

119
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,279
I mean

120
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,279
I will do everything

121
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,439
to destroy you!

122
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,919
Destroy me?

123
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,399
Plub.

124
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,679
You hate me that much?

125
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,079
Did you forget

126
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,519
you're the cause of my grandmother's death?

127
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,759
The bad things you've done to me

128
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,799
made my grandmother sad until she died.

129
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,839
I never forgot how you ruined my life.

130
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,279
I hate you.

131
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,039
Hate more than anything in my life.

132
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,399
Plub.

133
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,759
About your grandmother,

134
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,759
you know I've been sad about it all along.

135
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,759
I tried apologizing

136
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,079
Don't apologize!

137
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,759
I won't accept it!

138
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,319
I will never for give someone like you!

139
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,759
Plub.

140
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,839
You want to be mad, you won't forgive me, fine.

141
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,158
But can you let me explain?

142
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,479
I won't listen!

143
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,359
I don't want to listen to you anymore!

144
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,239
I never got the chance to explain to my grandmother!

145
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,879
Never got to apologize!

146
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,959
So why should I give you the chance?!

147
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,039
Plub.

148
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,119
You have to be responsible for this.

149
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,479
It's time that I get back at you.

150
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,839
You better prepare yourself.

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,439
S But the closer I get to you

152
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:39,519
S The more I know I've done wrong and made mistakes

153
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,639
T Can you please forgive me

154
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,199
T How much I hated you

155
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,239
TI can love you even more

156
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,079
PI'm sorry for all the mistakes &

157
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,879
PI want you to try to accept the love that comes from me

158
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,159
I will give you everything

159
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,879
F I lose to you in every way?

160
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:17,679
P Can I make amends? Let me fix it by asking for your love

161
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,159
Plub.

162
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,399
Where were you?

163
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,039
Are you...

164
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,599
okay?

165
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,439
Can you take me home?

166
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,319
Okay.

167
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,759
Let's go home.

168
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,879
The reason Plubpl a exposed you with the audio clip at the event

169
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,239
because she's still mad at you about her grandmother?

170
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,999
Plubpl a must be very resentful of me

171
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,759
She hates me now.

172
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,439
Then tell her

173
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,559
you had nothing to do with that clip

174
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,719
You didn't secretly record it.

175
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,599
You didn't leak the clip either.

176
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,079
Even though l didn't do it

177
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,639
but I'm still the cause for her grandmother's death

178
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,079
But you're also a victim in this matter.

179
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,879
What's the point in explaining anyway?

180
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,639
Since right now

181
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,559
Plubp la is Kit'swife

182
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,239
You're not going to do anything about it?

183
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,799
You're just gonna let her attack you

184
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,039
one sided like this?

185
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,959
Alright.

186
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,959
Save this for later

187
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,919
Let's talk about this instead.

188
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,879
What are you going to do?

189
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,799
Sa's father, Mr. Thaw ip,seems very angry at you

190
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,999
I think this matter

191
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,439
was Kit's plan.

192
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,759
He wants me

193
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,639
to have problems with Mr. Thaw ip

194
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,479
MOM

195
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,359
Why are you calling so much?

196
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,079
You can't help with anything

197
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,199
Pete!

198
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,439
It's oka y Sa.

199
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,639
It's alright.

200
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,399
I'm right here.

201
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,199
I knew you would come if I called you.

202
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,119
That's enough Sa

203
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,879
You drank too much already

204
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,759
You'll get sick

205
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,679
Just let me get sick and die then!

206
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,479
I don't want to live anymore! I'm embarrassed!

207
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,439
Why are you embarrassed?

208
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,239
Pull yourself together

209
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,639
You've done nothing wrong

210
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,039
Why are you embarrassed?

211
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,359
You're not me, you wouldn't get it!

212
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,599
By now,people are probably having fun talking about me

213
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,959
Why do you care about them?!

214
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,399
Why should you care about people with ill intentions towards you?

215
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,919
The people you should care

216
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,319
are the people that love you

217
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,079
The ones with good intentions

218
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,999
Who?

219
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,599
Who loves me and has good intentions for me?

220
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,719
Where?!

221
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:58,239
Even my own fiance doesn't care about me!

222
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,799
So who would love me?

223
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,319
Me!

224
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,799
I love you so much

225
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,799
I've always loved you

226
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,199
You never knew?

227
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,559
You always knew

228
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,599
but pretended not to.

229
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,519
That hurts.

230
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,679
Pete.

231
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,759
But...

232
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,079
regardless

233
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,119
I still love you.

234
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,399
Even if it's.

235
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,519
painful.

236
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,799
But you don't have to love me back

237
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,119
As long as you're happy

238
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,359
I'm happy.

239
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,919
I'm scared I won't be able to refrain myself

240
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,999
Pete.

241
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,639
Don't you love me?

242
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,598
I don't care about anything right now

243
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,719
I want your love

244
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,359
Can you give that to me?

245
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,759
Welcome to Gossip Celebrity segment!

246
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,799
What's the juicy gossip today?

247
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,399
To day's gossip

248
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,719
is about a famous socialite leaked audio clip

249
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,599
The man got forced into this engagement and wants to call it off.

250
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,879
Oh my god! So juicy! So what happened?

251
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,879
This is even more juicier!

252
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,159
The audio clip that got leaked was about him and this other woman who was at the event too!

253
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,239
Like it was all planned.

254
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,239
If they were showing off how sweet they are,

255
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,959
wouldn't that be humiliating?

256
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,399
What do you think?

257
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,159
If you want to know what happens next,

258
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,039
please stay tuned after the break.

259
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,159
So satisfying!

260
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,799
Peem is going to get attack on all sides

261
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,159
Mr. Thaw ip isn't going to spare him.

262
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,959
Yeah.

263
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,359
But the pitiful one right now is..

264
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,039
Ms. Usa.

265
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,479
As a woman like her, I..

266
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,359
I just wanted her to see this man's true nature.

267
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,559
Plub.

268
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,399
Why pity her?

269
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,159
She's probably just like him.

270
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,119
That's why they are engaged.

271
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,079
Don't stress about it Plub.

272
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,879
Usa will get the lesson from the choices she made

273
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,159
Excuse me

274
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,039
We have a problem

275
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,839
What is it?

276
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,159
Good morning Sa.

277
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,079
Last night was so much fun.

278
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,999
Fun about what?

279
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,839
Last night we...

280
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,919
Nothing happened last night.

281
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,239
I was alone.

282
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,719
You didn't come here.

283
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,799
Sa.

284
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,919
Do you understand what Iim saying?

285
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,359
If you still want to see my face,

286
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,119
forget about last night.

287
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,879
Ms. Plub pla, can we interview you?

288
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,439
Can we interview you?

289
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,159
The woman's voice from the audio, was that you?

290
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,239
Was it you?

291
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,279
Were you the one that leaked the audio?

292
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,839
- Was it you?
Please answer us.

293
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,319
Can you open the gate so we can interview you?

294
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,039
-Please. Can we come in?
-Can we?

295
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,599
You...

296
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,119
Please?

297
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,039
You should go inside. I'll handle this.

298
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,319
It's fine.

299
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,719
Koon g, can you open the gate?

300
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,799
Can we interview you?

301
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,119
Hurry!

302
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,959
Is it true that you leaked the audio?

303
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,679
Yes.

304
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,239
Are you trying to break those two up?

305
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,199
Yes, are you?

306
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,479
It might be because

307
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,879
I wanted this audio clip

308
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,039
to help a woman open her eyes.

309
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,999
That's why I did it.

310
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,239
So you don't want to get back together with Mr Peem?

311
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,319
Of course not

312
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,079
I married Mr Vi kit

313
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,879
You should know that already

314
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,439
We are very much in love.

315
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,759
So you support your wife in this matter Mr, Vi kit?

316
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,839
Yes.

317
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,719
No matter what my wife does,

318
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,679
I...

319
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,559
support her.

320
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,359
Thank you.

321
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,279
Can we get photos of you two?

322
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,719
Why does it have to be Kit?!

323
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,399
Well,

324
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,239
Plubpl a knows you're rivals

325
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,279
You're enemy'senemy is your friend.

326
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,559
Plubp la is with Kit

327
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,999
because she wants to hurt me, right?

328
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,839
But leaking a clip to ruin someone's reputation,

329
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,919
we can sue.

330
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,479
No.

331
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,759
I don't care what other people think of me.

332
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,159
I will call off the engagement.

333
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,639
Can we interview Ms. Usa?
-AIso, Mr. Thawip

334
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,039
One guest ion will be fine

335
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,519
He is unavailable for an interview

336
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,759
You guys should leave.

337
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,199
Then can we interview Ms. Usa?

338
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,519
Young Miss isn't home either

339
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,199
Where is she?

340
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,199
Could you please leave? You can come back another time

341
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,479
It'll be brief.

342
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,239
You guys should leave.

343
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,879
-Ms. Usa will be fine.
-Or. Mr. Thaw ip

344
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,519
Please leave. Excuse me now.

345
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,359
It'll be a brief interview, We waited so long

346
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,199
Who came?

347
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,959
There's Ms. Usa!

348
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,239
She's here!

349
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,599
You guys should leave.

350
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,679
What's going on?

351
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,399
Was that Mr. Peem's voice from the audio clip?

352
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,959
What he said in the audio

353
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,359
that he doesn't want to be engaged, is that true?

354
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,279
Will the engagement be called off?

355
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,679
Well? Is it true?
-Calm down everyone!

356
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,359
She can't do the interview today.

357
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,199
Please leave

358
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,959
Is it true?

359
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,599
-Please, can we do an interview?
-lt'll be a brief one!

360
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,719
So chaotic!

361
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,159
This is all Peem's fault!

362
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,959
You can't blame this all on Peem

363
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,999
Peem didn't want to get engaged to her from the beginning.

364
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,799
But you forced him to.

365
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,479
You're blaming me?!

366
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,239
It's true.

367
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,479
If you didn't do that, this wouldn't be happening to our daughter

368
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,039
Mom.

369
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,119
Will you die if you keep your mouth shut?

370
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,719
Usa.

371
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,319
Call off the engagement.

372
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,479
What?

373
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,919
He humiliated us

374
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,439
You still want to stay engaged to him?!

375
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,559
That's why I can't call it off!

376
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,239
If I do that, that means we lost!

377
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,959
I'm not a loser!

378
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,119
Stupid!

379
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,319
You do stupid things!

380
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,079
We need to call it off before he does

381
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,559
That's how we can save our face

382
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,399
No!

383
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,399
I will not call off the engagement!

384
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,319
Be reasonable Sa!

385
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,439
There are other good men.

386
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,199
No!

387
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,719
I'm not a loser!

388
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,879
I won't call it off!

389
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,479
This is my order and you will listen!

390
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,239
No!

391
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,279
I won't be a loser!

392
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,799
I'm not a loser!

393
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,119
Be reasonable!

394
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,119
Sa!

395
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,279
Usa!

396
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,799
-Usa!
-I won't call it off!

397
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,919
Help her!

398
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,399
I won't call off the engagement

399
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,399
Can you calm down Usa?!

400
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,919
She fell asleep

401
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,399
Good thing she doesn't have to be hospitalized.

402
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,719
This never happened to her before.

403
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,999
What are we going to do?

404
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,559
What can we do?

405
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,079
Could we ever say no to her?

406
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,199
This isn't just up to us.

407
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,039
What if Peem still wants to call off the engagement?

408
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,839
What are we going to do?

409
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,039
Don't worry.

410
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,599
I have a way to pressure him into obeying us.

411
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,839
Just watch her.

412
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,479
If I'm not happy,

413
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,599
Peem can't be happy either

414
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,639
-Was u.
-Yes?

415
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,639
Call the reporter that works for us.

416
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,399
You want them to clear the news regarding Young Miss and Mr, Peem?

417
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,719
No.

418
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,919
Publish another news.

419
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,759
As for clearing the news,that's someone else's job, not ours.

420
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,839
Peem,you idiot!

421
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,839
Why are you thinking about her?!

422
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,919
Stop thinking about her!

423
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,799
She's married and has a family now.

424
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,239
Most importantly,she hates you

425
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:27,999
Peem!

426
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,359
There's a huge problem!

427
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,479
What is it Tat?

428
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,199
There's a rumor

429
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,039
that our mall.in Sukhumvit

430
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,239
won't extend the lease contract for us to rent anymore!

431
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,999
What?!

432
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,359
Our mall there is a famous branch of ours in a prime location.

433
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,039
It's going to be a huge problem if it has to close down.

434
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,759
Our stocks have dropped ten percent today.

435
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,479
Mr, Thaw ip

436
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,439
is a board member in that area.

437
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,759
It must be his doing.

438
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,759
Probably trying to threaten us.

439
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,759
I'm not threatening you

440
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,439
I will do it.

441
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,559
I'm calling a board meeting soon

442
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,479
Please don't do this sir

443
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,999
I'm begging you.

444
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,759
You can have Sa call off the engagement first than Peem if you want.

445
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,559
I'm begging you. Please don't mix the business with our children's issue

446
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,679
It just so happen l can't differentiate the two.

447
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,159
My daughter's reputation is ruined in this matter.

448
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,919
Yes sir.

449
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,199
I know.

450
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,679
But society is already attacking Peem

451
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,599
Do you want Peem to hold a press conference to give an official apology?

452
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,319
But please don't do this.

453
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,119
It'll affect so many parties.

454
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,879
If you close down that mall

455
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,119
the one in trouble will be my employees

456
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,319
That is your problem

457
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,639
Not mine.

458
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,879
What do you want me to do

459
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,119
for Sa to be satisfied?

460
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,479
Tell me.

461
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,439
It's up to your son Peem

462
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,079
Will he give in or not?

463
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,679
" RUMOR PM ALL WON'T BE ABLE TO RENEW LEASE CONTRACT "

464
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,999
Peem is getting attacked by Mr. Thaw ip now

465
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,919
I think it's strange.

466
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,519
How?

467
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,639
Publishing the news like this

468
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,679
looks more of a threat than a serious matter.

469
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,479
If that's the case,

470
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,599
I'm guessing

471
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,559
Mr Thaw ip is pressuring Peem to do something he wants.

472
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,439
But I don't know what that is

473
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,759
Whatever it is, forget it.

474
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,319
Right now, Peem is probably busy trying to fight Mr. Thaw ip

475
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,439
Why don't we use this opportunity to attack him as well?

476
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,399
You mean...

477
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,319
Peem'scompany wanting to buy a famous steak restaurant?

478
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,919
Don't you want that restaurant too?

479
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,319
You know everything about me.

480
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,919
Mom! Dad!

481
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,079
Auntie came to visit!

482
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,079
Tre.

483
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,199
You're so adorable!

484
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,719
Putter come here

485
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,999
Hello Mr. Vi kit.

486
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,079
I'm Trepradub, Plub's older sister.

487
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,679
I'm also Su the e's wife

488
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,159
Do you remember?

489
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,039
We met at Grandma's funeral.

490
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,599
Yes.

491
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,599
I remember.

492
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,999
What are you doing here?

493
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,359
Plub!

494
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,079
What a strange question to ask.

495
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,799
I came i to visit..

496
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,079
My apologies.

497
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,999
I came to visit you and my nephew.

498
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,279
I heard you were back

499
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,599
You didn't plan on telling me

500
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,559
You still want to see me?

501
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,119
You're crazy! Why would you think like that?!

502
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,559
We're sisters

503
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,479
Why wouldn't I want to see you?

504
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,999
Just be honest with me why you're here

505
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,639
If you don't need anything, you wouldn't come see me.

506
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,399
You're my sister that knows me so well

507
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,639
Here's the thing.

508
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,359
Can I borrow300,000 from you?

509
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,919
300,000?

510
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,719
What do you want with 300,000?

511
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,879
Su the e's company isn't doing financially well right now

512
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,239
All the money he had was used up.

513
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,319
Su the e's company is having issues?

514
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,919
Yes!

515
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,479
He's not giving me allowance money either.

516
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,719
Hey.

517
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,039
I'm really struggling right now.

518
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,839
If you're really struggling.

519
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,159
300,000 won't be enough

520
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,919
You'll spend it quick.

521
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,359
Hey!

522
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,439
You're going to give me more than 300,000?!

523
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,279
Don't get happy yet.

524
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,719
I'm not giving you money.

525
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,599
I'm giving you a job.

526
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,119
Job?!

527
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,919
But don't worry.

528
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,599
I'm not going to make you an entertainer who escorts sugar daddies like you once did for me

529
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:55,839
Okay?

530
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,919
From the look s of i t, Idon't think you can do that job anymore.

531
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,119
Plub!

532
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,199
You ungrateful sister!

533
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,719
Hey!

534
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,119
I helped you when you were struggling!

535
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,959
From what I can remember,

536
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,719
Su thee helped me

537
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,359
You tried to stop him.

538
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,759
Plub!

539
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,799
If you want money,you need to work

540
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,279
I will never give you free money.

541
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,599
You bastard sister!

542
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,759
Ungrateful person!

543
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,319
You can't help me with this trivial thing?!

544
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,759
Even though

545
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,759
my husband helped you before,

546
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,879
but if I refused, he wouldn't help you either!

547
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,719
You need to hold a press conference to propose to Sa.

548
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,679
What?

549
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,159
Are you high on something?

550
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,639
I'm not high!

551
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,599
But that's what Mr. Thaw ip is proposing!

552
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,679
If you don't do as he say,he's going to lobby the other board members and not let us renew the lease!

553
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,919
Our lease contract is almost up

554
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,638
I'm trying to negotiate renewing the contract with him.

555
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,559
Hey.

556
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,399
I know you love Plubpl a.

557
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,839
But she's married and has a child now

558
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,799
Wasn't she the one that leaked the audio to hurt you?

559
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,599
Just get over her and marry Sa.

560
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,119
No Dad.

561
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,439
I will never marry'someone l don't love

562
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,399
Can you not be selfish?!

563
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,959
This isn't just about you!

564
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,079
If you don't do as he say,

565
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,319
do you know the ones that will be in most trouble is our employees?!

566
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,919
If this mall shuts down, hundreds of people,

567
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,919
their'families...

568
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,839
Dad.

569
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,799
I don't think these two are related

570
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,439
If we give in to him,

571
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,079
we will have to keep giving in

572
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,639
We have brains. Why should we give in to him?

573
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,479
I won't give in.

574
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,879
I'll find a way to handle this.

575
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,959
How did it go?

576
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,879
Did it pass?

577
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,199
They're not okay with the price we offered!

578
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,039
What?

579
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,519
This is the best price already.

580
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,319
If they want cheaper, why don't they do it themselves?

581
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,759
It's building a ten story building.

582
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,919
It's not making desserts.

583
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,599
The projects we're working on right now

584
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,959
still haven't been paid

585
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,679
If within two months

586
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,679
we're still not getting any money

587
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,719
we won't be able to pay the employees.

588
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,239
It's okay.

589
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,199
Don't stress yet.

590
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,839
I'll help you find a solution.

591
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,159
Enough.

592
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,999
Just stay put.

593
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,719
The reason our company is like this

594
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,399
the reason our finances are ruined

595
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,719
because you used your power

596
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,479
and used the company's money to pay off your gambling j debt.

597
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,079
You're blaming me?

598
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,679
I'm trying to comfort you here.

599
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,559
Come in.

600
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,519
Ms. Plub pla is here to see you.

601
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,399
Hello Su thee.

602
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,879
Oh P lub!

603
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,479
Plub.

604
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,159
Hey.

605
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,599
When did you get back to Thailand?

606
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,159
A while now.

607
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,879
But things we ren't falling into place yet

608
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,599
so I didn't come see you

609
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,399
It's fine.

610
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,719
Hey.

611
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,159
I heard the news about you and Mr. Vi kit

612
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,719
Congratulations!

613
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,239
-Thanks.
-Have a seat.

614
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,759
Come.

615
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,439
How's it going?

616
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,439
Do you need something?

617
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,239
Vik it is trying to build a hotel.

618
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,479
Do you want to take on this project?

619
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,159
Build a hotel?

620
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,199
Yes.

621
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,199
Please come this way

622
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,799
Hello.

623
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,279
Thank you for coming

624
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,799
-Sure.
Have a seat.

625
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,519
Thank you.

626
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,479
Peem went to talk to the other board members without my knowledge?!

627
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,439
That's right.

628
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,759
I bribed one of the board member's driver.

629
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,919
He told me.

630
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,559
He dare lobby my board members?!

631
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,799
Peem!

632
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,599
If Dad can't pressure Peem anymore

633
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,319
what am lgoing to do?

634
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,359
Thank you so much for coming here to listen to my offer.

635
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,279
We will have to bring this up at the next board meeting

636
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,319
No problem.

637
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,559
I respect your opinions

638
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,599
Don't worry.

639
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,879
Your proposition of the new project sounds really interesting.

640
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,559
I think all the board members will agree to it

641
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,079
Thank you.

642
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,479
Bye.

643
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,199
Good job.
