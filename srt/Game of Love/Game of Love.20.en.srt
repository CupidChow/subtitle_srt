1
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,519
Plub.

2
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,999
Sorry to keep you waiting.

3
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,999
I just got done with my meeting

4
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,479
I also'came here without making an appointment.

5
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,079
I'm sorry.

6
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,439
What business do you have with me?

7
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,839
You once told me

8
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,239
if I needed your help with anything..

9
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,719
Yes.

10
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,479
You can tell me

11
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,479
I'm willing to help you

12
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,199
What if I want you to help me get revenge?

13
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,399
What was that?

14
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,999
Get revenge

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,599
Hang in there dear.

16
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,479
I believe that one day

17
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,519
you will find a better path.

18
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,559
You're my grandchild. You must be strong like me.

19
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,599
Don't give up so easily

20
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,879
I feel much better now

21
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,879
My grandchild is smart and talented.

22
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,839
You're thoughtful too.

23
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,639
You taught me well.

24
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,079
Oh!

25
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,119
Are you sure

26
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,799
you're really going to do this?

27
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,079
It's the only reason

28
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,439
I'm alive.

29
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,279
Go with me Tong

30
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,479
I can't leave you here alone

31
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,839
Yeah.

32
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,639
I will never abandon you.

33
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,839
What is this?

34
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,839
Why are you here?

35
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,839
You have the audacity to come here?

36
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,439
Where's Plubp la?

37
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,279
Plub doesn't live here anymore.

38
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,479
Leave!

39
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,559
Where did she go?

40
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,599
You don't need to know.

41
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,239
Tell me.

42
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,399
I want to apologize to her

43
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,679
Unnecessary.

44
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,839
Please let me see her just once

45
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,999
Just once.

46
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,279
I'm begging you.

47
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,719
I want to apologize to her

48
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,999
Remember this.

49
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,199
You will never get to see Plub again

50
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,319
if Plub doesn't allow it

51
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,519
Go!

52
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,399
Let's go Yot.

53
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,719
It's pointless talking to this kind of person

54
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,719
I better not see you again!

55
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,399
Go!

56
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,279
28377 URGENT SALE

57
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,639
Plubpl a.

58
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,359
Where did you go?

59
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,079
Peem

60
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,439
Tat.

61
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,439
Plubp la is gone.

62
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,399
She left me.

63
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,199
She won't let me explain anything

64
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,599
She hates me that much?

65
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,559
Yes.

66
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,479
She hates me

67
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,319
Because I'm a scumbag

68
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,439
I'm a bastard! A scumbag!

69
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,439
Scumbag!

70
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,559
That's enough.

71
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,559
Enough.

72
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,519
Peem.

73
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,559
What?!

74
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,479
That's enough!

75
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,559
- Why should I stop?!
- That's enough!

76
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,639
What you're doing is pointless!

77
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,679
What?

78
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,879
Peem.

79
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,519
What you have to do right now is pull yourself together

80
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,519
You need to pull yourself together

81
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,919
Then go out and find her.

82
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,879
Peem.

83
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,599
You need to go find Plubpl a

84
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,519
Go explain everything to her.

85
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,799
So she can understand

86
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,999
That's what you must do.

87
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,719
Not sit here and fuss like this.

88
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,999
You're right.

89
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,439
I should go find her.

90
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,359
I have to at least apologize to her

91
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,919
That's right Peem.

92
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,399
You need to go apologize

93
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,799
I will find her.

94
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,679
4-years later

95
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,559
Putter!

96
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,359
Why didn't you wait for me?

97
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,519
This is your home Mom?

98
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,719
Yes.

99
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,719
Thailand is our home.

100
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,719
Soon, it will be your home too.

101
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,079
Hurry up Uncle Tong!

102
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,599
Walk faster Uncle Tong

103
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,399
The luggage are heavy

104
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,479
Putter, you get your own luggage.

105
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,479
Let'sgo.

106
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,439
Hello.

107
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,679
Yea h I'm here, I'm walking over there.

108
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,879
Plubpl a.

109
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,679
I'm sorry.

110
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,879
I mistook you for someone else.

111
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,159
Vi kit!

112
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,879
-Plub.
-Dad!

113
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,239
Putter!

114
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,959
Do you miss me?

115
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,479
I miss you the most in the world too.

116
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,279
Feeling tired from your flight?

117
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,999
A little

118
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,399
In that case,

119
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,999
Iet's go home.

120
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,119
Okay.

121
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,759
Let's go!

122
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,679
Come on.

123
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,159
You greeted the wrong person again?

124
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,279
Peem.

125
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,039
We've been looking for her for four years now.

126
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,759
I think

127
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,679
you should give up.

128
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,719
I don't think she's even in Thailand right now.

129
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,599
No matter where she'sat

130
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,599
I will find her.

131
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,599
Okay.

132
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,319
Let's get going

133
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,639
Mr. Zhang is waiting.

134
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,879
This way Mr. Zhang

135
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,959
Hello Mr. Zhang.

136
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,879
How did she get here?

137
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,039
I don't know. She was already here when I got here too.

138
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,159
Peem.

139
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,359
Just stay calm

140
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,799
Who's this beautiful lady?

141
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,559
I'm Peem's fiancee

142
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,799
You're an important business partner of ours.

143
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,879
So I came to help Peem welcome you here.

144
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,519
Peem!

145
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,199
Stop!

146
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,079
Sa!

147
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,279
Didn't we agree

148
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,879
we are only engaged in name?!

149
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,599
My, job, my life,

150
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,319
you have no right to interfere without asking me first!

151
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,319
I want to help!

152
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,519
Am I wrong?

153
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,159
You want to help me

154
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,119
or you're trying to show ownership to other people?

155
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,039
That's right.

156
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,479
The person I want to show it most tois you!

157
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,639
You can't act like l don't exist!

158
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,479
Don't forget

159
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,479
I wasn't willing

160
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,079
to get engaged!

161
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,199
Therefore,

162
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,039
don't try to demand things that I can't give you.

163
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,879
Otherwise,l won't have anymore patience with you

164
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,639
Auntie!

165
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,319
Gosh!

166
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,599
You're still looking for Plub?!

167
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,239
How long will you keep bothering her?!

168
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,639
Auntie.

169
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,639
Can you please tell me

170
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,079
where Plubpl a went?

171
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,079
I don't know!

172
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,479
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you!

173
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,199
You dirty-hearted man!

174
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,879
You evil scumbag!

175
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,679
Go!

176
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,679
I won't tell you!

177
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,279
Mr. Peem came looking for that woman

178
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,479
at this house almost every day.

179
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,239
The investigator we hired said the number Plubpl a used is no longer in service.

180
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,759
In the system right now,

181
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,879
there is no number registered under the name Plubpl a.

182
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,879
Where did she go?

183
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,239
Sa.

184
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,199
In that case,

185
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,679
I'm gonna get back to work.

186
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,919
What business do you have with me?

187
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,999
I came to ask you about our engagement.

188
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,559
I told my dad to go tell your parents already

189
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,239
I won't get engaged to you

190
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,479
But the news is out there already

191
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,479
People ask me everywhere l go

192
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,479
How do you want me to answer them

193
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,479
if no engagement is happening

194
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,079
Just tell them the truth.

195
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,399
Peem.

196
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,719
But I'm embarrassed.

197
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,039
Can't you just get engaged to me?

198
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,959
It's just an engagement.

199
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,119
Sa.

200
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,599
Why do I have to be responsible for something I didn't do?

201
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,879
Vi kit.

202
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,799
I need your help on something.

203
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,599
I can't tell you where Plubp la is at

204
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,039
Why not?

205
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,879
You think I'm going to hurt her?

206
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,519
You think I'm that evil?

207
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,399
You won't do it.

208
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,399
but your dad might

209
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,879
I'm so jealous of Plubpl a.

210
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,039
One person is trying desperately to find her

211
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,399
while the other person is protecting her

212
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,239
Use these photos to your benefit.

213
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,959
But do not bother Plubpl a.

214
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,559
This is as much as I can help you.

215
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,199
This is enough.

216
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,759
You can't go inside!

217
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,799
Where is Mr Thaw ip?!

218
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,759
You can't go in yet!

219
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,759
Wait!

220
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,199
-Mr, Thaw ip!
-Stop!

221
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,759
You can't go in!

222
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,959
-Mr. Thaw ip!
-You really can't!

223
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,039
You can't go in-Mr. Thaw ip!

224
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,519
I have to l inform him first!

225
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,159
Mr. Thaw ip.

226
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,399
Wait Mr Peem

227
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,279
-Wait.
-Was u.

228
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,639
Don't be rude.

229
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,239
What is it Peem?

230
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,799
What business do you have with me?

231
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,679
How did you get these photos?

232
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,279
I was wondering what you wanted.

233
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,319
I saw that you were desperately looking for that woman

234
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,079
that you forgot about your engagement to my daughter Usa.

235
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,279
O just...

236
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,679
went to find her for you.

237
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,879
You know where Plubp la is at?

238
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,519
I don't just know

239
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,399
but my people are watching her from afar.

240
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,119
What do you mean?

241
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,879
To put it simple.

242
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,159
If you do everything I tell you to do.

243
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,879
that woman

244
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,359
will be safe.

245
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,799
But if you don't,

246
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,559
I can't imagine

247
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,159
a woman

248
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,599
living in another country

249
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,239
suddenly disappeared

250
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,519
or died.

251
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,799
Will anyone care about her?

252
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,519
You're pressuring me to get engaged to Sa?!

253
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,519
Think carefully Peem

254
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,319
That woman's life

255
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,599
is up to your decision

256
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,919
I don't care

257
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,199
that you got engaged to me to protect that girl.

258
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,679
No matter what,

259
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,879
you are considered my fiance

260
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,279
Get down.

261
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,319
7522

262
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,399
Let's go.

263
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,839
Your house is big Dad.

264
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,039
From now on,

265
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,879
this house won't just be my house anymore.

266
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,399
It will be your house too!

267
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,119
Also, your mother's.

268
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,199
Including...

269
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,799
Uncle Tong

270
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,239
Do you like it?

271
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,239
I do.

272
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,119
Do you want to go inside and look?

273
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,479
-Yes.
-Let's go.

274
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,199
Let's go.

275
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,919
Do you like it?

276
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,159
I'm happy

277
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,079
that you came to welcome Plubp la and my son.

278
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,279
Putter.

279
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,279
Say hi to Grandpa

280
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,479
Hello.

281
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,559
You're not my grandson!

282
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,279
Dad!

283
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,559
Vi kit.

284
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,959
Nurse.

285
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,759
Take me back to my room

286
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,679
You're going to register your marriage to that low-class woman?

287
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,759
Yes.

288
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,639
Plubp la is pregnant.

289
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,839
I know you're stupid.

290
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,039
But I didn't think you would be this stupid.

291
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,239
You don't know how to handle this kind of situation or what?!

292
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,399
Like not publicly announce that woman as your wife to society.

293
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,239
Make her your secret wife.

294
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,759
Have her go live in America.

295
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,599
She doesn't need to come back to Thailand.

296
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,639
No.

297
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,279
I will not do that to my woman.

298
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,199
You dare disobey my orders?!

299
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,119
In the end,

300
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,079
you even lost to Peem when it.comes to women!

301
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,639
Look at how smart Puchong's son is!

302
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,759
He's about to get engaged to Usa.

303
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,519
When his family becomes in laws with Mr. Thaw ip,

304
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,039
his business will be even bigger!

305
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,399
Why don't you follow Peem's example?!

306
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,039
This is why you're a loser!

307
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,319
Lose to him for eternity!

308
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,559
What about you?!

309
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,479
You never defeated Uncle Puchong either!

310
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,079
T'ma loser

311
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,919
is because I'm your son!

312
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,919
A loser like you!

313
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,319
Kit!

314
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,159
You bastard!

315
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,479
Do you realize what I'm saying to you and telling you is because of goodwill?!

316
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,119
Dad!

317
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,279
Somebody!

318
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,919
Call the ambulance!

319
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,239
Dad!

320
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,999
Don't mind my dad

321
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,279
Dad is never satisfied with me

322
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,479
But he can't do anything now

323
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,959
I'm in control.

324
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,599
Actually,

325
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,639
you can have me go live somewhere else.

326
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,559
I don't want to be the cause to make your father feel uneasy

327
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,359
He has to learn.

328
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,319
You're not the cause.

329
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,279
The real cause is my father

330
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,359
He's hurt my feelings since l was little

331
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,479
He's partially at fault

332
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,839
Another thing,

333
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,959
don't say you'll go live somewhere else again

334
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,959
Husband and wife must live under the same house.

335
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,719
We talked about this

336
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,759
Don't stress about it.

337
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,279
Thank you...

338
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,039
so much.

339
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,279
Let'sgo check out your room

340
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,639
Putter.

341
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,239
Let's go check out your room.

342
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,319
Come on.

343
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,199
Come and follow me.

344
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,799
You're drinking alone?

345
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,439
Oh Pete.

346
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,159
Why are you here?

347
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,799
I went home and I saw Aunt Lek

348
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,919
She told me

349
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,719
you were at the house and got into an argument with Peem.

350
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,119
You've been drinking

351
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,239
since noon?

352
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,239
You...

353
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,559
always know me so well!

354
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,239
It would be nice

355
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,719
if Peem knew me so well too.

356
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,519
Well,

357
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,399
you chose to be with the person that doesn't love you.

358
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,639
That hurts

359
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,239
That's enough.

360
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,319
Just let me drink.

361
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,599
Nothing can help me right now besides this.

362
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,119
You know how to come home too, Pete?

363
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,599
I thought you only live at your friend'sshop.

364
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,639
Geez, you talk as if he doesn't do his job.

365
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,119
He works too.

366
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,719
You need to relax after working hard.

367
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,719
Marketing?

368
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,559
Must be very difficult.

369
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,679
Mom.

370
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,959
Have you seen Peem?

371
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,479
What's up Pete?

372
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,319
Why are you asking for me?

373
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,079
Peem!

374
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,119
Just marry Sa already!

375
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,719
What's your problem?

376
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,359
Why are you bringing this up?

377
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,519
-Sa told you to come tell me this?
-No!

378
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,199
But I can't standl seeing Sa be hurt like this anymore!

379
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,359
If you don't love her

380
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,359
why get engaged to her?

381
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,359
For what?!

382
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,079
It's none of your business.

383
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,919
Then call off the engagement!

384
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,879
If you want me to call it off.

385
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,279
go tell Sa.

386
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,839
You think I didn't?

387
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,639
I told her everything!

388
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,719
But she loves you! She refused!

389
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,559
Then I can't help you

390
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,039
Why are you hurting yourself and her?!

391
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,039
Why torture you and her?!

392
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,719
-Hey, hey.
-What the hell bro?!

393
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,719
Talk nicely to each other son.

394
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,839
Talk nicely.

395
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,639
Don't worry.

396
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,959
I will call off the engagement.

397
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,679
Just wait a little bit.

398
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,119
You love Usa, don't you?

399
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,039
I know

400
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,759
that you love Usa.

401
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,879
Usa

402
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,199
never saw the love I have for her

403
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,119
It's not that she didn't see.

404
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,439
More like pretends not to see it

405
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,039
What do you mean?

406
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,639
You think a smart person like Usa

407
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,919
will marry someone like you?

408
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,039
Hm?

409
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,079
You come second to Peem.

410
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,039
If you want to win Us a's heart,

411
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,319
you need to beat Peem first.

412
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,559
Hey.

413
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,639
You want me

414
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,519
to take the position of CEO

415
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,759
from Peem?

416
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,319
You

417
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,239
must have power in the company over him.

418
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,919
That's howyou get Usa

419
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,559
Plub!

420
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,319
Orn!

421
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,039
- I missed you!
- I missed you too.

422
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,119
Plub.

423
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,879
I'm happy you're back.

424
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,879
Yo t, Orn.

425
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,119
Hi.

426
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,559
Wow Tong!

427
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,079
You've grown so much!

428
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,359
Well,

429
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,999
I graduated.

430
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,678
I was gonna take Tong to come see you guys

431
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,759
I couldn't wait for you to come see me.

432
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,158
It's better we come see you.

433
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,359
I see.

434
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,439
Putter,did you greet A un t Ornand Uncle Yot yet?

435
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,719
Hello.

436
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,679
Hello Putter!

437
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,119
I finally get to meet you in person

438
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,719
Do you remember her? We video call her often.

439
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,799
-You remember?
-He looks like his dad!

440
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,199
Yot!

441
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,839
Sorry Plub.

442
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,159
Of course he looks like his dad.

443
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,119
Right?

444
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,399
Hello Mr. Vi kit.

445
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,639
Hello.

446
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,359
You're here to o, Mr. Yot?

447
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,279
You're going up now.

448
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,759
He seems to love Putter.

449
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,599
Yeah.

450
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,879
What will you do next in life?

451
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,959
I'm ready to get revenge

452
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,439
on the person that made Grandma died.

453
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,479
Plub.

454
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,959
Are you sure

455
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,479
you want to do this?

456
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,439
I think you should just live your life

457
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,319
and stop creating karma for yourself

458
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,319
You want me to let the person that made my grandma die walk free?

459
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,759
I can't do that.

460
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,399
But you have a child now.

461
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,679
More importantly

462
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,439
-Putter is his so --
-My son...

463
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,799
and Mr. Vi kit.

464
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,519
Don't say that again.

465
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,239
Okay.

466
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,199
I'm sorry.

467
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,079
But I still disagree with you on getting revenge

468
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,479
If you do it, in the end you will get hurt as well.

469
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,959
I'm also the cause to make my grandma die as well.

470
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,959
I deserve to get hurt.

471
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,679
Plub!

472
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,039
Enough. That's enough

473
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,199
Orn.

474
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,559
Since Plub made her decision

475
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,879
we're her friends

476
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,719
our job is to support her

477
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,239
Understood?

478
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,239
Yeah.

479
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,279
In that case,

480
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,559
just let me know if you need my help.

481
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,079
Thank you.

482
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,759
Has that person gone and bothered Aunt Ta en at the house lately?

483
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,159
Mom said he goes every week.

484
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,799
lim getting tired of kicking him out to o Plub

485
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,719
It's been four years and he's still bothering you.

486
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,159
I don't understand what he wants from you.

487
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,879
I don't know.

488
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,559
But I don't think

489
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,519
that kind of person has repented.

490
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,519
I think Peem will soon find out that you're back.

491
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,759
But before he finds out.

492
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,519
I will go see him first.

493
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,479
Plub.
