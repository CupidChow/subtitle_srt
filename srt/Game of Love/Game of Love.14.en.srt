1
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,467
Stop doing these kinds of jobs

2
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,219
What rights do you have to stop me?

3
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,221
I'm not your secretary anymore.

4
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,305
Fine.

5
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,685
Then pay back the debt you owe for Grand ma Thip's surgery

6
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,024
Didn't we agree

7
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,319
you will pay me back through your monthly salary?

8
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,529
Fine.

9
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,448
I will gradually pay you back

10
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,533
like we agreed.

11
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,117
Okay?

12
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,118
Not okay.

13
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,037
I want all the money back right now, this instant!

14
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,372
Hey.

15
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,209
When I loaned you the money, you were my employee.

16
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,503
I had to help my employee.

17
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,173
But you don't work for me now.

18
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,092
It's right of you to pay me back all the money.

19
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,262
But if you change your mind

20
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,555
and come back to work with me,

21
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,891
our deal will remain the same.

22
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,350
Are you crazy?!

23
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,603
What is your problem?! What do you want?!

24
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,521
When will you let me go?!

25
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,023
Whatever I want,

26
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,357
I shall get!

27
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,859
Are you crazy?! Let go!

28
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,610
I won't let go!

29
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,322
Let Plub go Peem!

30
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,419
It doesn't involve you

31
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,296
I'm talking to my secretary!

32
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,631
Former you mean.

33
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,176
Plub doesn't work for you right now

34
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,140
Plub.

35
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,935
If you agree to come work for me,

36
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,647
the debt you owe Peem

37
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,483
will be paid off by me.

38
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,153
We can deduct it from your salary if it makes you feel comfortable.

39
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,907
But I'm the creditor.

40
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,492
I don't agree to this!

41
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,412
I won't accept the money from anyone else

42
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,747
Hey Peem.

43
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,083
Don't act like a kid.

44
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,086
However Plub gets the money to pay you back is her business!

45
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:19,925
Plub.

46
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,136
I really want to help you

47
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:38,819
Plub.

48
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,952
I said don't get involve!

49
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,537
If I want to.

50
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:49,871
what are you gonna do?!

51
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,175
Peem!

52
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,762
Cha Cha!

53
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,852
-Stop!
-Peem!

54
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,687
Hey! Stop!

55
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:14,688
Both of you stop!

56
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,984
Peem!

57
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,236
I might be your debtor,

58
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,739
but you have no right to take control over my life!

59
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,243
Let's go Mr. Vi kit.

60
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,511
You and I

61
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,221
should race Kit.

62
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,432
The game you never defeated me in.

63
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,478
I'll let you redeem yourself.

64
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:01,735
Fine.

65
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,820
It's a deal.

66
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,586
What's up Top?

67
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,091
Huh?!

68
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,509
What was that?

69
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,427
Okay.

70
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,470
Fine.

71
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,066
What happened?

72
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,318
I don't know what kind of bet they made

73
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,569
but I heard they want to race

74
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,197
Sol opened the race trackas a special privilege for my friends

75
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:53,787
Peem.

76
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,372
Come talk to me.

77
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:57,707
Peem!

78
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,097
Mr. Vi kit.

79
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,100
Don't get yourself in trouble

80
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,269
over my problem with Peem

81
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,687
I'll talk to him.

82
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,023
The truth is

83
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,735
this isn't entirely your problem.

84
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,447
Peem and Ihas had problems for a long time

85
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,324
Your problem

86
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,827
is probably another excuse

87
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,080
for him and I to defeat each other again.

88
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,628
I don't know what kind of problems you guys have

89
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,464
Plub.

90
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,550
Don't over think it.

91
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,345
Let Peem and I settle our old problems

92
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,347
As for your problem,

93
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,850
if I defeat him,

94
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,518
you get to be free from him

95
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,855
I would be very happy

96
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,153
Huh?!

97
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,030
You're going to race Kit

98
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,406
for Plub?!

99
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,491
Kit

100
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,326
got involved first.

101
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,204
What's gotten into you Peem?!

102
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,331
I thought you said if it's not about business.

103
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,875
you don't want any problems with Kit?!

104
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,419
Well, this is business.

105
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,546
How is it business?

106
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,548
Plubp la is my secretary.

107
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,717
She works close with me and has information on the company

108
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,469
If I let her go work with Kit,

109
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,346
it's like I'm giving him information.

110
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,138
Huh?

111
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,723
That's just an excuse

112
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,975
Plubpl a only worked for you for a short period of time

113
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,602
How would she know that much information?

114
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,145
Better safe than sorry

115
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,522
I don't want to be a loser!

116
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,565
I don't want to lose to Dad and Kit

117
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,067
I won't lose to anybody.

118
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,485
Sure.

119
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,239
I'm being serious.

120
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,285
Telling me is pointless

121
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,995
Tell yourself that

122
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,205
Yeah.

123
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:00,997
You don't believe me.

124
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,249
Do as you please.

125
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,711
Hey!

126
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,132
Before we race,

127
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,759
let's make a deal

128
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,677
Fine.

129
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:14,928
Tell me.

130
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,305
If I defeat you,

131
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,473
you must give me..

132
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,694
what I ask for.

133
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,781
I think you should think first

134
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,449
that if you lose

135
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,034
what you will do.

136
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,745
That percentage is higher

137
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,207
I'm not gonna let you win that easily this time.

138
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,378
Try hard then.

139
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,465
If you lose...

140
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,676
Just tell me what you want

141
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:58,471
RCX

142
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,889
RCX Stop bothering Plubpl a.

143
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,807
RCX

144
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,766
RCX Okay?

145
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,815
Okay.

146
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,820
CEOs from two companies

147
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,532
are racing each other to get you to go work for them

148
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,243
I think that's telling something

149
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,244
Look.

150
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,413
They already have their own problems.

151
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,789
It has nothing to do with me.

152
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,167
But they have more problems because of you

153
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,639
Peem is still good as before.

154
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,776
Plub.

155
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,153
Who are you cheering for between Mr. Peemand Mr. Vikit?

156
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,365
I'm cheering neither

157
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,620
That means, you will go work with whoever wins then.

158
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,041
Peem!

159
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,348
Kit is evil.

160
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,816
Go! Go! Go! Go!

161
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,182
What's wrong with Peem's car?

162
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,642
I think something is wrong with the engine.

163
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,976
If he keeps driving, the engine will catch fire.

164
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,521
Peem!

165
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,542
I told you

166
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,378
I won't let you win this time

167
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,380
You want me.

168
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,798
to cheat Peem?

169
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,132
Yes.

170
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,134
I can't lose to him this time.

171
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,220
You need to help me Top

172
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,888
But if Peem finds out...

173
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,224
If you help me,

174
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,935
all the debt you owe me

175
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,687
will be canceled.

176
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,776
Is this race that important to you?

177
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,280
Yes.

178
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,450
It might make Peem feel like he lost to me for the rest of his life.

179
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,329
Alright.

180
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,372
Okay.

181
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,665
I'll help you.

182
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,459
Hey

183
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,795
Make Peem's car have some kind of issue.

184
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,630
Sure.

185
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,339
Okay.

186
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,050
All done.

187
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,093
Thanks alot.

188
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,784
Peem!

189
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:12,911
Cha Cha!

190
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:35,975
Damn it!

191
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,156
Peem!

192
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,160
What the hell did you do?!

193
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:54,869
Huh?!

194
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,246
Do you know how dangerous it is?!

195
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,500
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,091
Peem!

197
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,555
You lost.

198
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,557
What do you want?

199
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,184
Just say it.

200
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,312
What I want is.

201
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,900
let P lub go.

202
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,655
Have her make her own decision about her job.

203
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,867
Don't find excuses to pressure her anymore.

204
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,290
What a hero.

205
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,299
You must be very impressed

206
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:53,678
Fine.

207
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:55,930
Let's go with that.

208
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,605
Don't.

209
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,816
Let him calm down for a bit

210
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,570
SHARK

211
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,074
Plub.

212
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,535
You're free now

213
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,706
Thank you.

214
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,586
I hope you will take my company into consideration.

215
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,882
I...

216
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,052
Excuse me.

217
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,459
Peem.

218
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,672
Are you here to mock me?

219
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,135
Wait!

220
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,096
L086-046881

221
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,270
I want to know

222
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,315
why you want me to go back to work for you.

223
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,484
Why do you want to know?

224
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,945
You should be happy

225
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,696
that I lost.

226
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,156
Just tell me.

227
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,077
Because...

228
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,205
I don't want to break my promise

229
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,332
I made to you.

230
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,543
I'm sorry

231
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,378
for getting you guys in trouble.

232
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,382
I won't let it happen again.

233
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,143
I will protect you and your family

234
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,188
I promise.

235
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,775
You working with me

236
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,986
will be the only excuse

237
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,030
I have to protect you and your family

238
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,577
Thank you so much.

239
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,245
The deal was interesting.

240
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,080
The debt is called off.

241
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,542
You managed to cheat and defeat Peem.

242
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,794
But it was really a waste of time.

243
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,465
Do you think it wasn't?

244
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,053
Top didn't tell me.

245
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,141
But even a kid could tell that you two cheated.

246
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,353
I can't help it!

247
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,899
Peem wasn't being careful so he lost to me.

248
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,735
Well, why do you have to win in this race?

249
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,528
We're friends

250
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,362
Friends?

251
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,866
Him and I haven't been friends in a long time!

252
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:02,950
Kit.

253
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,835
How can the heirs of a rival company be friends?

254
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,087
Look at reality.

255
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,725
Even though l work close with Peem

256
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,978
but if he sees me as only his sister,

257
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,605
it's pointless.

258
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,443
I have to change something

259
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,739
So that Peem can see me as a woman.

260
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,707
Hey,last night episode was so good. The heroine

261
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,461
Hey.

262
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,837
Is that Ms. Usa?

263
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:57,672
Yeah.

264
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,965
She changed a lot.

265
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,926
What did she do?

266
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,221
Is Peem here yet?

267
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,138
Yes.

268
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,890
Wait!

269
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,100
Ms. Usa!

270
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:21,529
Sa.

271
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,659
I forgot to tell you Plubpl a came back to work with me already.

272
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,120
You can go back to your old job now

273
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,582
Come on.

274
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,792
We should get going before we'relate

275
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,252
Yes.

276
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,774
The guy is always trying to act cool.

277
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:00,901
Hey! Hey!

278
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:03,612
-I thought she quit.
-I know right?

279
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,240
We need to gossip about this.

280
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,077
Oh Dad!

281
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,538
You came to work early.

282
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,334
Plubpl a

283
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,502
I thought you quit?

284
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,130
I went toget her back.

285
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,012
You see Dad?

286
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,931
I told you Plubp la would choose me.

287
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,475
Not you.

288
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:38,939
Let's go.

289
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,066
Let's get going.

290
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:11,597
Hey!

291
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,808
Let me go Mr. Peem!

292
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,309
I can't do that.

293
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:17,770
Hey!

294
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,271
Let me go!

295
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,732
We're not outside the company yet.

296
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,192
People will see us.

297
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,613
Don't be smooth

298
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,659
Let go.

299
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,285
I'm not being smooth

300
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,036
Let go!

301
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,791
I was just doing what we agreed to do.

302
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,128
I don't want to break my promise

303
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,213
I made to you.

304
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,550
You working with me

305
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,760
will be the only excuse

306
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,888
I have to protect you and your family

307
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,474
There's no need.

308
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,768
I can look after myself.

309
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,270
I don't need anyone to protect me.

310
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,771
Do you think

311
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,773
Pete and Su

312
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,484
really believe that you quit working at the company?

313
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,778
That you won't contact my father outside of work anymore

314
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,198
Paranoia 0468817

315
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,492
can push people

316
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,952
to do anything.

317
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,705
You've encountered it before.

318
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,002
The only way

319
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:27,089
to make Su and Pete believe you stopped associating with my father

320
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,134
IS

321
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,220
show everyone that you chose me.

322
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,558
I came back to work for you already

323
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,977
I don't need to put on this act.

324
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,228
It's not enough

325
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,814
The truth is we need to make everyone understand that

326
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,441
we are dating.

327
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,526
Is that necessary?

328
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,611
Yes!

329
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,615
Whatever.

330
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,994
We can do it until Su and Pete are confident that my father

331
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,246
has stopped associating with you.

332
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,290
We can talk then.

333
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,960
I don't want to lie to people

334
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,379
If you don't want to lie

335
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:08,881
then...

336
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,925
let's date for real.

337
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:13,260
Hey.

338
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:17,056
Don't talk to me like that.

339
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,099
I'm not kidding.

340
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,106
Let's go.

341
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,857
We're late.

342
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,152
There's no need I can walk on my own!

343
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:31,862
Hey!

344
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,821
Come on!

345
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:33,989
No need to hold my hand!

346
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,708
P lub is so evil!

347
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:49,547
She pretends to quit so that Mr. Peem can go beg her to come back to work!

348
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,758
She probably wants to let someone know

349
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,843
that Mr. Peem chose her.

350
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,596
Who is this someone?

351
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,098
Who else?!

352
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,766
Ms. Usa!

353
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:01,934
Right.

354
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,312
It looks like Ms. Usa does like Mr. Peem.

355
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,105
Hey!

356
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:11,193
I can tell from looking down from Mars that Ms. Usa

357
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,945
likes Mr. Peem for sure!

358
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,365
But the chairman

359
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,909
seems to give the green light.

360
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,413
He had Ms. Us a go take Pl ub's place

361
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,165
-Oh!
-So it's like that.

362
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,420
That's why Plub showed her rights by having Mr, Peem go beg her.

363
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,965
She probably wanted to tell us

364
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,509
that Mr. Peem chose her.

365
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,679
I pity Ms. Usa.

366
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,139
Yeah.

367
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,474
Ms. Usa made the effort to change her look

368
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,853
but Mr. Peem didn't even take notice.

369
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,314
It's obvious!

370
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,820
I pity her!

371
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,167
Where are you going Mr. Pete?

372
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,631
Can you not'meddle?

373
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,592
You can't.

374
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,638
You need to ask Mr. Puchong for permission

375
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,389
His orders.

376
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,349
Please.

377
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,770
What is the deal?!

378
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,626
Why did you bring me here?

379
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,004
There will be a job interview today.

380
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,507
I want you to do the interview.

381
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,343
Why do I have to?

382
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,684
Hello Mr. Peem

383
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,061
Is the interviewee here yet?

384
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,896
He's sitting over there.

385
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,697
Tong.

386
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,534
What is this?

387
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,661
Your brother is looking for a job

388
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,956
I promised him I would help him.

389
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,960
You made a deal with him.

390
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,461
Why have me come here?

391
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,463
Your brother

392
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:39,341
think s he'sworthless

393
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,553
and can only be your burden

394
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,555
He told you?

395
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:45,723
No.

396
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,349
But I can tell.

397
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,935
What Tong is becoming

398
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,729
is like my brother Pete.

399
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,121
Damn!

400
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,498
Oh my god Mr. Pete!

401
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,500
What is this?!

402
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,627
What happened?

403
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,270
And the reason why our brothers are like this

404
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,438
is because...

405
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,440
they think they're worthless.

406
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,484
So they're seeking attention

407
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,571
I never thought of him like that.

408
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,156
I just

409
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,908
don't want To ng to struggle.

410
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,995
I never thought

411
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,748
I would cause him such emotional scars.

412
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,709
This is the only opportunity

413
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,961
you will get to know what he's thinking

414
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:00,172
and talk him to have him understand you

415
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,469
I'm giving you full authority to make the decision

416
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,971
whether to hire him or not.

417
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,224
I'll respect your decision.

418
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,018
As my secretary

419
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,228
and...

420
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,687
Tong'solder sister.

421
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,830
What happened? Why are you home so soon?

422
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,081
Isn't work still not over?

423
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,666
I'm annoyed.

424
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,459
I don't want to work so I took half the day off.

425
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,503
Are you sick?

426
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,256
Where's Dad?

427
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,966
What do you want with him?

428
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,300
Mom.

429
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,386
Is it hard to answer my question?!

430
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,347
Why are you in such a bad mood?

431
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,475
Dad!

432
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,188
Honey.

433
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:02,776
Dad!

434
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,069
What happened dear?

435
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:08,448
Help me Dad I can't take it anymore!

436
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:11,577
Usa.

437
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,920
I'm about to lose the person I love

438
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,133
to that low-class woman!

439
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:32,139
Help me Dad!

440
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:34,683
Honey.

441
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,084
Plub.

442
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,588
Ms. Plub pla would be doing your interview.

443
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,673
Go ahead.

444
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,095
What is this?!

445
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,390
What a waste of time! I'm going home!

446
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,642
You haven't done your interview yet.

447
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,979
You're giving up already?

448
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,121
Let's start the interview.

449
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,418
Why do you want to work here?

450
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,170
O just --

451
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,175
I just want to work.

452
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,471
Okay.

453
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,848
But actually you

454
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,059
can work anywhere else.

455
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,603
Why do you want to work with us?

456
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,732
Because this place

457
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,859
is a brand of a large company

458
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:11,196
It will probably give me more knowledge than other companies.

459
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,115
Once l graduate,

460
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,242
I will gain more experience.

461
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,289
In your application, you said

462
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,084
you're able to come work every day

463
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,169
after school?

464
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:28,839
Yes.

465
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:29,965
But...

466
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,384
your grades are...

467
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,261
not that great.

468
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,971
If you get this job,

469
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,099
how can you be sure your grades won't get worse?

470
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,818
I'm not sure

471
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,572
But I will try

472
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,575
to prove my own capability.

473
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:00,829
Okay.

474
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,582
Last question.

475
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,837
What motivated you to want to come work here?

476
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,510
My older sister.

477
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,646
I just want my sister

478
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,523
to see

479
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,358
that I can take care of myself.

480
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,237
I don't want to be her burden.

481
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,458
Okay.

482
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,837
In that case,

483
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:01,515
you can start work tomorrow.

484
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,229
Tomorrow?

485
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,614
It's a pleasure to be working with you

486
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,378
Tong.

487
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,717
I never thought

488
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,012
you were a burden.

489
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,143
You're just someone

490
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,354
I want to protect.

491
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,236
You don't think

492
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,489
I want to protect you too?

493
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,045
I forgot to think about that.

494
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,047
You're all grown up

495
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,968
You're not a kid anymore.

496
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,935
am sorry if I...

497
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,691
only cared about my own feelings that

498
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,527
I didn't care about yours

499
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:41,907
Yeah.

500
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,579
I've neglected you a lot

501
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,874
In that case,

502
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,920
can we start over?

503
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:57,214
Yeah.

504
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:58,590
We can.

505
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,099
At first I was surprised

506
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,810
why you want to interview

507
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,021
a part time position candidate

508
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,065
Now I know.

509
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:17,943
Know what?

510
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,656
This woman must be very important to you

511
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,164
You think so?

512
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:32,749
Yes.
