1
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,559
Tong!

2
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,039
You!

3
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,399
-Don't!
-Pete stop!

4
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,359
Peem!

5
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,319
Tong.

6
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,079
Careful.

7
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,799
How did Peemge t here?!

8
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,879
You told him?!

9
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,879
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,879
Your brother threatened to punish me.

11
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,039
If something happens to you and I don't tell him

12
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,919
he's gonna come after me.

13
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,999
You traitor!

14
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,599
Why did you come here Peem?

15
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,679
I have to ask you

16
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,119
why you came here for.

17
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,519
Why are you causing more trouble?

18
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,839
It was him that hurt me last time!

19
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,359
And it's him

20
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,119
who has a sister that is stealing Dad from Mom!

21
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,119
Pete.

22
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,199
Apologize to him.

23
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,759
No!

24
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,679
Why do I have to apologize?!

25
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,199
Did you not lis ten to what I said?

26
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,399
No matter what excuses you use,

27
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,559
the one who started violence first is always at fault.

28
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,519
When will you know how to grow up?!

29
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,519
You're criticizing me in front of him?!

30
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,679
Yes.

31
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,839
Know how to be embarrassed

32
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,439
so you can remember next time

33
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,919
Fine!

34
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,999
I'll stop for today.

35
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,239
I'll get you next time!

36
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,199
Let's go!

37
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,319
Pete!

38
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,559
Wait for us Pete!

39
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,439
Pete!

40
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,359
This is for all the damages.

41
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,919
If you need anything else, please let me know.

42
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,839
Thank you.

43
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,439
Sure.

44
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,079
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,599
Here To ng

46
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,439
Your salary

47
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,239
Don't come back to work tomorrow.

48
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,279
Do you have to fire him?

49
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,439
I'll be honest, lm scared there will be another problem

50
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,999
Excuse me!

51
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,159
I promise I won't let this happen again

52
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,199
Wait.

53
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,479
I'm sorry on behalf of Pete

54
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,999
Do you want me to compensate for anything?

55
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,719
You don't need to do anything.

56
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,439
Take it as

57
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,559
me compensating

58
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,519
for what I did to him last time.

59
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,319
Just tell him

60
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,359
not to mess with me again.

61
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,399
To be frank,your issue with Pete should have ended a long time ago.

62
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,239
But Pete is still angry

63
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,279
and found you here

64
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,599
is because of your sister.

65
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,279
My sister?

66
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,279
What does she have to do with it?

67
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,199
Your sister

68
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,839
is messing with my dad.

69
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,599
That's why Pete is mad

70
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,799
That's not true.

71
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,919
If you don't believe me,

72
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,039
go as k Plubpl a.

73
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,719
Who was the reason behind Grand ma Thip's hospitalization?

74
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,999
You're telling me

75
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,719
my grandmother isn't hospitalized

76
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,959
due to some illness?

77
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,999
Whatever your sister tells you,

78
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,479
you believe her?

79
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,199
Tong!

80
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,359
Why do you look like this? Who did this to you?!

81
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,319
Hey Tong!

82
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,599
Stop.

83
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,799
Does it hurt a lot?

84
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,159
It was him that hurt me last time!

85
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,759
And it's him

86
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,639
who has a sister that is stealing Dad from Mom!

87
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,559
So...

88
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,359
who did this to you?

89
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,039
Why do you look like this and what were you doing here?

90
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,559
Hey.

91
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,439
Didn't I tell you

92
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,079
to go home after school?

93
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,319
-Why are you always causing problems?!
-Yeah!

94
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,359
I'm causing problems

95
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,239
And you're a saint?!

96
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,839
Hey.

97
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,679
Why are you talking to me like that?

98
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,719
The reason Grandma is hospitalized

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,519
It was because of you.

100
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,279
Look Tong.

101
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,719
You're misunderstanding me.

102
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,599
Misunderstanding you?

103
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,519
If I misunderstood you,

104
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,039
why the hell did Pete come here to attack me?!

105
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,759
Huh?!

106
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,679
Pete attacked you?

107
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,879
Peem!

108
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,559
Your brother attacked my brother?!

109
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,879
I will pursue this matter with you til the end!

110
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,639
Let's go.

111
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,719
Let's go file a report

112
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,079
No!

113
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,159
Why?!

114
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,839
I'm embarrassed!

115
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,239
Embarrassed of what?!

116
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,479
You didn't do anything wrong

117
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,038
If Pete goes to file a report for attacking me

118
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,479
because...

119
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,759
you're messing with his dad.

120
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,079
What are you talking about?

121
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,559
Is it not true?

122
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,799
If you didn't mess with his dad,

123
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,919
Grandma wouldn't have gotten attacked

124
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,039
and he wouldn't have bothered me!

125
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,239
I did no such thing.

126
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,039
You're my brother.

127
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,519
Shouldn't you believe me?

128
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,959
Have you believed me?

129
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,559
You never believe me!

130
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,559
It's the same thing!

131
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,839
You see?

132
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,239
Even your own brother

133
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,759
doesn't believe you.

134
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,359
What did you say to him?

135
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,839
The truth.

136
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,399
You can't be mad at me.

137
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,279
Pete knows the truth about you and my dad

138
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,159
That's why he came to attack Tong here

139
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,319
That's why I couldn't keep it from him.

140
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,559
I came here to save your brother

141
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,119
but you're not grateful for it?

142
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,999
Right now your family

143
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,759
are in trouble.

144
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,319
Because of your wrong decision

145
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,559
If you're really smart

146
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,839
you should be able to think for yourself

147
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,639
if you should accept my offer or not.

148
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,399
But don't take too long

149
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,039
before things get worse.

150
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,239
One more thing.

151
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,319
Before you criticize your brother, why don't you ask him?

152
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,319
Your brother

153
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,119
got a job here.

154
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,359
Peem.

155
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,959
I talked with her.

156
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,519
Yeah?

157
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,959
The owner still won't let Tong continue to work here.

158
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,919
Right now your family are in trouble

159
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,919
Because of your wrong decision

160
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,119
If I have to work with Peem.

161
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,319
I rather quit.

162
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,559
If I quit,

163
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,639
what money do I have to pay for her treatment?

164
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,319
If you're really smart

165
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,599
you should be able to think for yourself

166
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,279
if you should accept my offer or not

167
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,359
You're really bad.

168
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,279
You called Plu b pla to come see it

169
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,239
So she will know

170
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,519
she's causing trouble for her own brother.

171
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,039
Hey.

172
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,319
You're such an opportunist in every situation.

173
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,959
I'll take that

174
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,559
as a compliment

175
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,239
So what?

176
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,599
If Plu bpl a stops messing with your dad

177
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,239
you think she will come work for you?

178
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,199
If Plu bpl a really loves her family

179
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,159
she will accept my offer.

180
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,919
I'm happy I get to come home

181
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,359
I thought I wouldn't be able to any more.

182
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,279
You're talking like that again.

183
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,519
Yeah Grandma.

184
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,759
You'remaking Plu b sad

185
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,039
talking like that.

186
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,119
So,

187
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,239
Tong hasn't woken up yet?

188
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,079
Tong.

189
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,079
Oh!

190
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,119
What happened to your face?

191
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,879
Huh?

192
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,119
Well?

193
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,559
Yeah Tong.

194
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,919
Who did you fight with this time?

195
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,919
And...

196
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,999
why are you all so shocked?

197
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,599
Are you not used to the problematic one yet?

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,759
Tong.

199
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,239
You keep asking questions.

200
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,479
Hey Tong!

201
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,479
How can you talk like that to the adults?!

202
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,839
It's okay Yot.

203
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,399
I'll handle it.

204
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,759
I'll be back.

205
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,319
Tong!

206
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,559
What?

207
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,239
I'm sorry

208
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,799
for the misunderstanding from last night.

209
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,999
I just found out

210
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,839
you got a job there.

211
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,479
Yeah.

212
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,279
You...

213
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,839
don't have enough money to spend?

214
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,999
Or what problems do you have?
Why do you have to work there?

215
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,599
I just want a job.

216
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,319
You don't have to work from now on.

217
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,199
I want you to stay focus in school

218
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,119
I'll handle the rest.

219
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,799
What rights do you have to order me around?

220
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,239
I'm worried about you.

221
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,239
I don't want you struggling.

222
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,159
Your health is already bad and now your academic performance is also bad.

223
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,799
You still have time to go get a job too?

224
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,399
How will you be able to graduate?

225
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,559
Graduate?

226
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,839
If I don't graduate then screw it!

227
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,319
It's my life!

228
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,359
Look Tong.

229
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,199
Don't talk to me like that.

230
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,239
-l sacrificed everything just so you can go to school!
-Stop saying the word sacrifice!

231
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,479
You think and decide everything on your own.

232
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,959
You didn't ask me!

233
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,399
Therefore,

234
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,439
stop using me as an excuse.

235
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,999
It's uncomfortable!

236
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,599
Tong!

237
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,679
You're not any better than me.

238
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,719
Therefore,do not lecture me!

239
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,319
Hey Tong.

240
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,639
You need to thank your sister

241
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,799
Do you know how much trouble she went through just to help you?

242
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,679
Why?

243
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,079
Why do you have to make me feel guilty?

244
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,479
I feel so guilty!

245
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,519
Sit down.

246
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,679
Just quickly nag about what you want to nag.

247
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,519
I'm sleepy.

248
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,719
I want to go back to sleep

249
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,879
Don't cause trouble like last night again.

250
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,239
If his sister is still messing with Dad

251
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,359
I won't guarantee it.

252
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,519
I'll handle this matter

253
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,999
How will you handle it Peem?

254
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,959
You don't need to know

255
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,559
Seems like you really like Plu bpl a.

256
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,279
I'm very serious with her

257
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,439
I really like her.

258
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,079
If possible

259
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,319
I want this kind of woman by my side.

260
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,399
You see?

261
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,959
Seems like Puchong is getting serious with this girl.

262
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,879
It's going to be difficult to handle

263
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,999
I'll handle it!

264
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,598
I will handle them

265
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,759
I told you that l will handle it

266
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,199
No one can't get involved.

267
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,039
IS You heard what Peem said?

268
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,039
I don't care.

269
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,759
However he will handle it, it's his business.

270
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,719
I will handle them my way as well

271
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,759
If you don't want your father to know

272
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,719
and be upset with you even more,

273
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,839
do not do anything

274
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,279
You're just gonna let that girl mess with Dad like this?

275
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,199
I won't let her.

276
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,199
But your father put a target on my back

277
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,999
That's why I'm using Peem's hands to handle the situation.

278
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,399
I will find a way to handle them without your father knowing.

279
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,639
Why are you so afraid of Dad?

280
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,199
I'm not his lawful wife

281
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,439
I'm scared of him abandoning me.

282
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,119
And you

283
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,719
should make your father love you

284
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,039
You can't even help me with this simple thing.

285
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,719
Just wait and see.

286
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,799
Soon, Peem will get everything.

287
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,119
You won't get anything!

288
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,719
That's fine.

289
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,399
I don't want anything.

290
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,959
Stupid child!

291
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,799
Where do you get this idea?!

292
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,279
From Peem?

293
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,759
Peem told you to think this way?!

294
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,199
Peem instigated for you to think this way,didn't he?!

295
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,479
No he didn't!

296
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,639
Peem never said anything!

297
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,079
He didn't do anything but he made you think this way!

298
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,799
You're stui pid!

299
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,319
You don't know his tricks!

300
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,519
Enough Mom!

301
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,199
If you want to hate Peem, hate him by yourself

302
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,599
Can you not instigate me to hate him as well?!

303
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,799
Hey.

304
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,079
You...

305
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,199
only used my womb to be born!

306
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,199
I guess so.

307
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,239
When you

308
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,959
gave birth to me,

309
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,559
you didn't care nor look after me.

310
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,679
You were busy chasing Dad

311
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,079
When I called for you,

312
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,719
were you around?

313
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,039
Pete!

314
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,279
I'm doing everything for you!

315
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,879
If I didn't do something, your father would have made that woman his wife!

316
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,159
You and I would be sleeping on the streets by now!

317
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,359
If sleeping on the streets makes me happier than this,

318
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,199
I'll let it happen.

319
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,479
Stupid child!

320
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,839
I don't want to talk to you anymore!

321
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,439
Waste of my saliva!

322
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,639
If sleeping on the streets

323
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,439
makes me see you more,

324
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,479
it would be nice.

325
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,519
Plu b.

326
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,079
When my mom closes her shop,she will come keep Grandma company.

327
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,439
You don't need to worry.

328
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:54,919
Plu b.

329
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,159
What did you say?

330
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,439
Hey.

331
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,839
You're having issues with Tong?

332
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,839
You can tell?

333
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,759
Him and I...

334
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,079
don't understand each other's thoughts.

335
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,799
I don't know

336
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,839
what his needs are or what he wants to do

337
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,959
Sometimes I feel awful

338
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,199
that I seem.

339
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,599
not to care about him.

340
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,119
You have to work,

341
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,479
make money.

342
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,279
You have to take care of your grandma

343
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,279
and Tong.

344
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,079
May be Tong doesn't

345
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,999
just want money from me.

346
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,399
There's only one way to fix this problem

347
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,839
Have an honest conversation with him.

348
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,959
I'll give it a try.

349
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,199
Plu bpl a Car model, accepts EN work?

350
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,199
Help spread news

351
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,199
that Plu bp la is my father's secret wife in the company.

352
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,319
nu EN

353
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,479
I want cake!

354
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,559
I like iced tea.

355
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,439
Right?

356
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,079
Also the barista.

357
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,439
I don't want to talk about it

358
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,359
What is this?!

359
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,479
This is Plu bp la, the new girl that works front desk for the chairman!

360
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,239
You're right!

361
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,919
She's dressing so sexy!

362
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,239
Does EN work?

363
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,399
Car model?

364
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,959
What's going on you guys?

365
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,919
Ana.

366
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,639
I don't know who posted these.

367
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,919
Look at it!
-Oh my!

368
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,959
May be the chairman's new woman is...

369
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,479
What?

370
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,679
Who?

371
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,599
Gosh you guys!

372
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,879
I can't just gossip

373
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,039
about the chairman.

374
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,799
Only us will know, We won't tell anyone

375
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,959
That's right.

376
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,959
If you're already talking, you might as well finish your sentence.

377
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,359
- That's right.
-Gosh.

378
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,439
I feel so uncomfortable-Just tell us Ana!

379
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,719
Step on this.

380
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,719
Do not tell anyone.

381
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,439
Sure.

382
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,399
I heard that the chairman brought in an EN girl and will pamper her

383
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,519
to make her his wife!

384
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,599
So what we were curious about is true then?

385
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,199
Yeah!

386
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,479
Oh my god!

387
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,999
Car model.

388
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,959
Look at the way she's dressed!

389
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,759
I can not accept this

390
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,279
-You're right.
-Look at her.

391
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,559
Usa.

392
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,079
Hi.

393
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,919
Are you just getting here?

394
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,399
Yes.

395
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,199
I took half the day off today.

396
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,359
-She's the chairman's new girl Really?

397
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,719
The one that used her body to get a job here?

398
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,159
The perks of being pretty.

399
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,039
That's nice.

400
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,519
What's going on?

401
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,119
Why...

402
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,079
are they saying that?

403
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,079
Geez!

404
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,799
No wonder the chairman hired her directly

405
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,159
I'm not surprised people are gossiping.

406
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,479
I really hate it.

407
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,439
people who don't go to school

408
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,679
and used their body to get the job.

409
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,759
So why did we have to study hard to work here?

410
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,399
I know, right?

411
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,599
I should have used the money to make myself pretty

412
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,719
and make my life better

413
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,399
First off,

414
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,719
if you want a better life,

415
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,119
stop gossiping about other people

416
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,639
Because no matter how pretty you make yourself.

417
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,879
but still have a rotten mouth like this,

418
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,559
it's pointless.

419
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,879
Hey!

420
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,839
They really tried to humiliate you like that?!

421
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,039
For?

422
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,399
I don't know either.

423
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,559
It's not just that.

424
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,919
There's also rumors that I'm the chairman'ssecret wife.

425
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,199
Huh?!

426
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,599
Who would do this?!

427
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,119
Yeah Plu b.

428
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,399
This is getting more aggressive.

429
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,039
You want to find that person?

430
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,919
I'll help you.

431
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,879
Yes. We can sue them for damages.

432
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,999
No.

433
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,879
I think I know who did it.

434
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,439
Who?!

435
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,039
Ms. Supang.

436
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,639
The chairman's wife.

437
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,759
Why would she do this?

438
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,519
I don't know.

439
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,239
Maybe she thinks there's something going on with me and the chairman.

440
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,599
So she sent thugs to destroy my grandma's shop.

441
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,439
You still want to go back there to work?

442
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,719
Well...

443
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,559
I can't quit yet.

444
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,759
I went to talk to the doctor.

445
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,159
He said

446
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,559
the medications are n'treally working on Grandma

447
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,279
She might need heart surgery.

448
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,519
Oh Plub!

449
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,719
So...

450
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,279
what will you do now?

451
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,439
Hello Mr, Peem.

452
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,799
Mr. Peema nd Samust be dating for sure!

453
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,639
They're so compatible with each other!

454
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,919
I can get here on my own

455
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,439
I made you come to work early

456
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,199
It's fine, I come to work at this hour anyway.

457
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,239
Unless you lre scared people will think you're an epo kid.

458
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,639
No.

459
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,879
I'm not scared but just considerate

460
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,519
inssniu2022
Plub!

461
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,559
Are you waiting for me?

462
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,959
Sa.

463
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,719
Go to work.

464
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,599
Follow me.

465
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,479
What do you need?

466
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,799
You may speak

467
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,079
You offered me a solution to my problem

468
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,159
by working with you instead of the chairman.

469
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,319
What do you need?

470
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,999
Why did you offer me this?

471
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,039
What do you mean?

472
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,719
I don't believe you would help me without wanting anything in return.

473
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,519
You don't like me.

474
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,079
You probably don't want me to prove myself like you said

475
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,279
Yes.

476
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,879
Someone like me

477
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,439
must get something in return.

478
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,439
But when you said that I don't like you,

479
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,519
I object.

480
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,279
May be I...

481
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,959
changed my mind.

482
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,999
What do you want?

483
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,919
I'm just like you.

484
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,199
I'm just protecting my family

485
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,919
Protecting your family?

486
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,639
Pete is my brother.

487
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,159
I don't want him to be disappointed in my father

488
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,439
I know that feeling is awful

489
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,799
and how much wound it can create for someone.

490
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,079
That's my reason.

491
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,159
You can either believe me or don't.

492
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,719
But if I were you,

493
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,679
I would not over think it.

494
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,999
I'd rather benefit myself.

495
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,919
You don't need to quit plus you'll get a higher salary

496
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,719
You'll be able to cut the problem

497
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,799
from Su and Pete

498
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,999
What's not good about that?

499
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,079
In that case,

500
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,159
you need to guarantee safety for my family.

501
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,439
Don't let Pete mess with Tong again

502
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,079
Sure.

503
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,079
No problem.

504
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,199
I'll take the offer.

505
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,879
Great.

506
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,399
Then...

507
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,999
you...

508
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,879
must follow my condition as well.

509
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,839
What condition?

510
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,839
You need to tell my father

511
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,639
you came to work for me

512
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,159
because of money.

513
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,119
Huh?

514
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,879
Are you trying to make me a gold digger?

515
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,839
So you wearing those short skirts and tube tops

516
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,599
Was for charity?

517
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,399
Hey!

518
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,199
Why?

519
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,359
You're scared my father will look at you in a bad way?

520
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,919
I thought you said

521
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,159
you don't have feelings for my father?

522
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,199
So why be scared?

523
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,719
What do you say?

524
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,319
You want to go work with Peem?

525
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,679
Yes.

526
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,879
Why?

527
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,199
Mr. Peem offered me double the salary

528
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,999
I need the money so..

529
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,159
What if I pay you more than Peem?

530
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,079
Whatever amount you wish to get

531
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,119
I made my decision

532
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,719
I rather much go work with Mr Peem

533
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,439
Plu bpl a.

534
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,359
If this is about Su.

535
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,359
Thank you so much for being kind to me

536
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,279
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

537
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,559
Okay. Whatever you want

538
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,239
Okay.

539
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,039
Excuse me now.

540
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,399
I really want to know

541
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,879
how Dad will react.

542
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,359
Why are you doing this?

543
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:41,999
Hmm?

544
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,799
Wow!

545
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,759
Just one assistant secretary,

546
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,359
it's made the mighty chairman come see me here?

547
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,999
Why did you make Plu bpl a transfer over to work with you?

548
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,199
What do you want?

549
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,199
I'm just showing you that this woman

550
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,719
can be bought with money

551
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,719
I offered her more money

552
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,399
and she already packed her things over here.

553
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,319
Now do you see?

554
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,638
That's not true.

555
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,719
Plu bpl a isn't that kind of woman

556
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,599
I will gradually show you

557
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,399
and when that time comes,

558
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,599
you will finally realize

559
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,799
what you dream of,

560
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,239
the woman that truly loved you,

561
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,879
is now gone.

562
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,479
Stupid child!

563
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,198
If your mother really loved me

564
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,638
she wouldn't have abandoned us for this long!

565
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,439
What?

566
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,399
Plu bpl a transferred over to work with Peem?

567
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,719
That's right

568
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,559
Ana,who works front desk for the chairman reported back to me

569
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,759
She said Plu bpl a transferred over this morning

570
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,639
Or was this the plan Peem was talking about?

571
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,999
And Puchong just allowed it?

572
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:38,879
Yes.

573
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,559
But he seemed unhappy about it

574
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,919
I heard that

575
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,279
he went to criticize Mr. Peem in his office.

576
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,159
The employees are gossiping right now

577
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,639
how the father and son are fighting over one woman.

578
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,559
Good.

579
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,519
Disgustingly good.

580
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,599
Do you still want our people to keep following the chairman?

581
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,279
Yes.

582
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,799
I don't trust things that easily.

583
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,039
Okay

584
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,559
So, Plu bpl a has agreed to come work with you

585
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,399
Yeah.

586
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,119
What will you do to her next?

587
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,839
My next plan

588
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,879
is to use closeness to win her heart.

589
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:30,239
I'll make her agree to be mine.

590
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,959
Hey!

591
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,999
Why go to such lengths?

592
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,119
So my dad can finally open his eyes.

593
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,519
Since he thinks those women are good,

594
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,719
I will show him that women like Plu bp la and Su

595
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,999
aren't the type to truly love anyone

596
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,999
besides the money and power my dad has.

597
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,879
So my dad can realize that he's wrong

598
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,559
for making the woman that truly loved him leave him

599
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,799
But throughout the past,your dad has been going out with countless women.

600
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,919
I don't see you doing anything about that.

601
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,559
So why Plu bpl a?

602
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,519
Oh!

603
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,319
May be the truth is that

604
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,959
you like Plu bpl a.

605
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,919
Idiot!

606
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,919
What makes you think that?!

607
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,679
I would like a woman like that?!

608
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,039
Why not?

609
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,079
May be l...

610
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,479
have lost my.patience.

611
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,399
I thought you changed your mind

612
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,719
and wouldn't be coming anymore

613
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,679
I'm not a fickle person

614
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,399
T suppose

615
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,879
you are mine now.

616
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,759
Look.

617
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,079
Can you rephrase that?

618
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,119
I don't want to be the gossip in this company

619
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,599
Wow!

620
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,399
My new secretary

621
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,239
is so serious.

622
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,279
I'm sorry.

623
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,679
What do you have up your sleeve?

624
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,039
Over there

625
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,919
Your desk.

626
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,119
Why is my desk in here?

627
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,999
Why can't it be?

628
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,919
Don't you have to work with me?

629
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,519
It's heavy.

630
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,159
Hey.

631
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,879
Peem!

632
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,599
Are you putting me on probation?

633
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,959
Geez.

634
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,479
You're exaggerating.

635
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,439
I won't go to that extent.

636
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,759
O just

637
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,679
want you to be in my sight.
