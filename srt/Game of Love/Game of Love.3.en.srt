00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,399
In the evening,you have a meeting with the catering department.

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,439
Later at night.

6
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,478
Cancel the meeting in the evening for me.

7
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,719
I'm going to go visit Pete.

8
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,839
Oh, the evening?

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,559

10
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,759
Tat.

11
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,639
Is there some hot news?

12
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,679
I'll check the secret group chat

13
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,519
of the employees I'm secretly in first.

14
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,199
Kit.

15
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,599
Why is he calling?

16
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,999
What?

17
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,039
I heard that

18
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,079
you took a woman up to your hotel room last night?

19
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,039
peem!

20
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,359
Last night,did anyone see Mr peem get locked outside the balcony by a woman?

21
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,159
D did.

22
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,479
Me too.

23
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,079
Hey.

24
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,839
What did you do

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,319
to get locked outside by a woman like that?

26
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,479
Unless...

27
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,639
you're incompetent?

28
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,839
Hey peem.

29
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,759
You need to learn a lot about women from your father, man!

30
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,759
So this doesn't happen again!

31
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,999
Come on guys!

32
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,639
Let's celebrate Tong's freedom from those two evil brothers!

33
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,559
Eat up. What are you waiting for?

34
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,479
Hey Tong.

35
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,999
You need to thank your sister.

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,919
Did you know how much trouble she had to go through to help you?

37
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:58,919
That's right.

38
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,399
Thanks.

39
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,319
Say it nicely!

40
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,078
It's fine Orn.

41
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,999
It's my duty

42
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,559
to look after Grandma and Tong.

43
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,879
But.

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,599
can I ask for something?

45
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,479
I want to you stay focus in school.

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,719
I dropped out of school and started working because

47
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,679
I want you to finish school.

48
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,879
I want you to get a good job.

49
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,879
Can you do that for me?

50
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,119
Sure!

51
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,039
Listen to your sister.

52
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,039
From now on, before you do something,
think it through first.

53
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,999
Because it's not just you that will get in trouble but your whole family.

54
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,879
Mm Get some of this too son.

55
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,559
I know.

56
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,639
Tong!

57
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,519
Does he see how much his sister is struggling?

58
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,279
For get him.

59
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,439
It's my duty anyway

60
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,759
Hello.

61
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,719
I'm Kom san,

62
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,159
Mr. Puchong's assistant

63
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,599
Mr. Pete's father

64
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,759
Oh, yes.

65
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,199
Mr. Puchong would like to see you

66
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,999
Hello.

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,159
Have a seat.

68
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,719
Don't be afraid

69
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,439
I invited you here

70
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,199
mainly to apologize on peem's and Pete's behalf

71
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,159
My sons are always creating problems for me.

72
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,279
I don't blame your brother in any of this.

73
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,679
To be frank, I don't like men

74
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,319
who likes to take advantage of women either.

75
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,599
If I was your brother, I would have beat Pete harder than he did

76
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,799
Actually my brother

77
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,839
went over board.

78
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,759
I'm sorry on my brother's behalf too.

79
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,599
It's okay.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,119
Consider it as both kids being forgiven then

81
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,399
They're both still young and it'll be a long time that we discipline them

82
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,599
Thank you.

83
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,759
As for peem,

84
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,399
he's had a grudge against women like you for the longest time that it's beyond repair.

85
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,039
Yes.

86
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,439
I also...

87
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,479
understand that.

88
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,599
Majority of the people in society

89
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,519
have grudges

90
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,999
against people who have jobs like me too.

91
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,279
It's...

92
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,879
not always the case.

93
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,559
There are a lot of people who understands the world, understands life.

94
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,319
peem is like that

95
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,759
because lim the useless one

96
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,239
Who is it this time?

97
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,719
Just an average woman.

98
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,799
But she does many jobs

99
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,799
Whether it's car models or host,

100
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,279
entertainer,waitress or employee in a convenient store.

101
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,719
She seems like she spends a lot of money.

102
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,519
She'll do anything people hire her to do.

103
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,119
But I checked already.

104
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,399
No profile on her that is interesting.

105
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,159
How can an average person be this beautiful?

106
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,279
What's her name?

107
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,599
Plu bpl a.

108
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,679
Our spy who is the driver told me that

109
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,918
the chairman ordered to find a position in the company for this woman.

110
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,399
Huh?!

111
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,839
Can I see the photo?

112
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,799
What photo?

113
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,359
Dad's photo

114
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,799
that your person secretly took.

115
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,479
What is this peem?

116
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,119
-I never...
-Don't make me repeat myself.

117
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,439
I know that you chase away

118
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,919
and hurt all the women that gets close to my father.

119
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,719
I just didn't want to get involved.

120
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,639
Can I take a look?

121
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,679
I heard you're looking for a job.

122
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,679
The company is currently launching a new coffee shop brand

123
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,039
We're going to open our first branch pretty soon

124
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,519
We're looking for the manager of the shop.

125
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,079
Are you interested in coming to work at the shop?

126
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,919
Thank you but...

127
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,439
I can't accept this offer

128
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,999
I think this position doesn't suit

129
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,119
someone without a degree like me

130
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,559
I think you're smart enough not to take this good opportunity in life

131
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,399
just because you don't have a degree

132
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,199
He offered you a job?!

133
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,679
That was unexpected.

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,079
But sounds okay What do you think?

135
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,639
Well, seems like a good opportunity.

136
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,959
But I'm scared there will be problems.

137
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,159
So I said no

138
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,759
-Hey!
-That's good Plu b.

139
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,719
Don't get involved with them.

140
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,479
Good opportunities like this don't come often.

141
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,479
Nowadays,where are there good companies that hire people without a bachelor's degree?

142
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,639
Plu b will graduate in a year

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,439
She has a good GPA too

144
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,959
She only has a few credits left What's there to be afraid of, right?

145
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,679
What time does she have to study?

146
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,759
She keeps working nonstop

147
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,159
Plu b.

148
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,999
A good job that will help your future like this

149
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,439
doesn't come around so often.

150
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,919
How long will you keep working with Cha Cha?

151
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,239
You're getting older.

152
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,839
Jobs at a company like this is hard to find.

153
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,399
She doesn't need an office job.

154
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,719
Save up

155
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,359
and open your own restaurant.
Get your own business.

156
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,759
Where will she get the money to save up?

157
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,119
She barely has enough to spend each month.

158
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,359
Orn!

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,519
What the hell are you saying?!

160
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,079
Show her some moral support!

161
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,239
Look at Plu b. She's stressed out now.

162
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,359
My words might not be pleasant to hear

163
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,719
But you're studying marketing

164
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,399
Even if you dropped out

165
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,239
I just want you to get a good job.

166
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,279
I don't want to see you wandering around doing jobs that don't require your skills anymore.

167
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,839
Thanks for your concern.

168
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,079
This woman is named Plu bpl a

169
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,039
Her parents died a long time ago.

170
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,119
She's living with her grandmother

171
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,119
who opened a flower shop in front of the house.

172
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,759
And a younger brother who is still in school.

173
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,199
Plu bpl a.

174
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,439
This woman is starting to be interesting.

175
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,359
The legal department sent a lawyer to handle the case in which our company is being sued

176
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,599
for infringing PP World's logo.

177
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,999
Bring them in.

178
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,959
Sure.

179
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,079
Hello.

180
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,959
My name is Or a wee.

181
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,919
The new attorney that will be doing your case.

182
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,479
Tell the HR department to adjust the criteria for recruiting the coffee shop manager.

183
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,119
No educational qualifications required

184
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,239
I'll handle it sir.

185
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:20,959
Good.

186
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,999
If that young woman isn't stupid,

187
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,199
I think she will apply for this job

188
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,999
When that time comes, do whatever it takes to give Plu bpl a this job. Got it?

189
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,119
Yes.

190
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,759
Sir.

191
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,439
I'm just curious

192
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,759
why is this girl

193
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,119
getting special treatment from you?

194
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,519
May be there's something about this kid

195
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,759
that reminds me of Man ee.

196
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,919
What are you going to do?

197
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,679
I won't allow it.

198
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,039
I will show Dad

199
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,879
that even though he is the CEO,

200
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,999
he can't do as he please

201
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,439
What?!

202
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,239
You haven't done anything and you want me to surrender?!

203
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,919
From the looks of it.

204
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,719
it'll be hard to win this case

205
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,839
I think

206
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,879
PP World must have solid evidence for them to sue you this time

207
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,039
Before it damages your company,

208
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,439
I recommend you settle this case.

209
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,399
No way!

210
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,679
I don't care what evidence they have!

211
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,159
Your job is to make us win this case!

212
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,599
Do whatever it takes No matter the cost!

213
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,839
But I have to win this case. Do you understand?

214
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,519
But...

215
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,479
If you can't do it.

216
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,679
then leave!

217
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,839
How did it go Orn? Did Boss settle?

218
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,959
Settle my ass!

219
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,719
Even when it's obvious that we will lose,
he still won't settle.

220
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,359
Because it's Mr. peem's company.

221
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,079
And...

222
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,319
so what if it's Mr. peem's company?

223
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,079
You're new so you don't know yet.

224
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,719
Mr. Vi kit

225
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,279
is Mr, peem's nemesis

226
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,879
They're rivals.

227
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,079
Mr. Vik it will not lose this case regardless.

228
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,919
If he doesn't want to lose,

229
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,279
then why copy their logo from the beginning?!

230
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,919
Hey! What are you talking about?

231
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,759
We will all get fired!

232
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,279
It's true.

233
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,239
It's obvious that our company published it after.

234
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,159
Stop talking.

235
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,079
If you don't want to be jobless on your first day here.

236
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,599
Quickly find the information

237
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,959
and win this case.

238
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,239
How do we defeat them?

239
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,919
I'm so stressed!

240
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,239
Wow!

241
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,759
This collection!

242
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,319
Oh my god!

243
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,919
Su thee just gave the money to help Tong.

244
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,159
So if I ask Su thee for some money...

245
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,279
Gosh!

246
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,159
Damn you Plu b!

247
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,039
Sako o.

248
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,079
Sako o, be gentle.

249
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,279
Sako o!

250
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,279
Can you be gentle?! My head hurts!

251
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,799
Why are you scolding my grandchild?!

252
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,719
Hi Mom, Dad.

253
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,479
I bought you more toys.

254
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,559
Here you go.

255
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,318
Sako o, take your toys and go play over there.

256
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,199
I asked why are you scolding my grandchild?!

257
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,479
Well...

258
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,639
Sako o was mischievous

259
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,839
So I gave him a little warning

260
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,719
What kind of warning was that?!

261
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,759
You raised your voice on him!

262
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,159
Do you know that will traumatize the kid?

263
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,999
Why didn't you say it nicely and explain it to him?!

264
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,479
My grandchild isn't stupid like you!

265
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,439
Our secretary told us that

266
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,239
Su thee took out his personal money

267
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,879
to help your family.

268
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,079
I had you marry my son and build a family.

269
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,399
Not leech off of him.

270
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,199
It's your fault.

271
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,679
Where did you find her to marry our son?!

272
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,799
Look at her.

273
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,839
If you found someone of his level,

274
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,719
we wouldn't be talking like this!

275
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,919
Hey.

276
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,039
You already know we had no choice.

277
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,039
Whatever

278
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,239
If you keep bringing problems for us,

279
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,799
get a divorce then.

280
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,599
Then leave this house.

281
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,119
Mom.

282
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,119
I'm being serious.

283
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,119
Sako o

284
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,399
Let's go out to eat with us and go shopping.

285
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,879
Okay.

286
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,039
Let's go! Put these away first

287
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,079
What do l do?

288
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,679
Su the e is naive and listens to his parents too.

289
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,039
If I divorce him,

290
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,999
I have to go back

291
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,479
and live like before. Struggling

292
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,599
No way.

293
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,999
I will inot go back and live that life.

294
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,439
I have to do something.

295
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,679
Do whatever I can

296
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,199
to have Plu b

297
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,719
pay Su thee back as soon as possible.

298
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,719
What about us suing Kit's company?

299
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,599
Who's in charge?

300
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,519
Me.

301
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,199
This case is so difficult that you're in charge?

302
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,119
It's not difficult

303
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,479
but Kit is conniving

304
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,239
He will do everything

305
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,519
to defeat you.

306
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,199
That's why l don't trust anyone else to do it.

307
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,239
But don't worry. We will win

308
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,639
I'll leave it in your hands, Head of Legal Department.

309
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,159
I have a meeting to get to. Imight not come back

310
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,159
You can leave afterwards.

311
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,679
Okay.

312
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,999
See you.

313
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,039
Mm.

314
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,919
Here's the menu.

315
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,199
Oh P lub.

316
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,399
You work here?

317
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:15,959
Yes.

318
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,399
Plu b,

319
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,439
I think you have a pretty face. You should..

320
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,559
find a sugar daddy to look after you

321
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,919
So you don't tire yourself like us!

322
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,799
Do you want me to recommend you those rich sugar daddies?

323
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,839
That's okay.

324
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,999
I like working to earn my own money.
Not ask for money.

325
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,439
Hello Tre.

326
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,959
Are you able to get the money to pay Su thee back?

327
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,839
Can you tell him to wait a little? I'm trying to get some at the moment.

328
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,319
I will pay him back.

329
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,119
If you want to pay him back,

330
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,439
quickly come to my house.

331
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,359
Tre, why did you call me over?

332
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,319
Hey Plu b.

333
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,039
This is Mr. Toey. A friend of mine.

334
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,719
Well?

335
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,919
How is she?

336
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,479
Pretty.

337
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,399
I really like it.

338
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,519
What the hell are you doing?

339
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,519
He is attending a reunion this evening and is looking for a girl.

340
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,199
I'm sorry. A friend to escort him.

341
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,759
How about this?

342
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,799
Take the job and escort him.

343
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,759
Consider doing it to get the money to pay Su thee back.

344
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,519
Go.

345
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,639
-Plu b!
- What the hell are you doing?!

346
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,799
I will kick you if you come near me!

347
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,319
Plu b!

348
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,759
Stop P lub!

349
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,039
Plu b! Come here!

350
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,439
Tre.

351
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,599
You can do this to me now?

352
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,839
What did I do?!

353
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,839
I was just finding you a job!

354
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,439
Just like Cha Cha does. What's the difference?!

355
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,439
It is different!

356
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,079
Other people will look at me like a product,

357
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,319
a money.maker,l don't care!

358
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,879
But not you!

359
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,759
Not someone in my family!

360
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,399
Don't be pretentious Plu b.

361
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,519
You owe Su thee money.

362
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,999
You don't have the money to pay him back!

363
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,759
So you have to work to get the money!

364
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,039
Look Tre.

365
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,999
I never thought you would be this cold-hearted with me.

366
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,119
What?

367
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,919
I found you a job

368
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,719
so you can get the money to pay Su thee back

369
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,999
How am I cold-hearted?!

370
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,199
Stop talking!

371
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,239
The more you talk, the more awfull feel

372
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,359
for having a selfish sister like this!

373
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,559
Yeah! Think whatever you want!

374
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,399
But you need to pay Su thee back as soon as possible.

375
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,399
If you don't have any, go ask Grandma.

376
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,759
Grandma should have some savings.

377
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,079
Where would Grandma get the money from?!

378
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,159
What?!

379
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,119
There's her elderly allowance.

380
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,679
There's money for selling her plants Does she not have anything?!

381
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,999
Tre!

382
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,359
Are you using your brain to think
whe nyou're saying those things?

383
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,199
How much do you think she gets for her elderly allowance?!

384
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,439
Is it enough?!

385
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,559
How can Grandma save up over 100 K

386
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,959
from selling her little plants?!

387
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,399
Yeah! Who knows?!

388
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,599
How would I know if Grandma has money or doesn't have money?!

389
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,439
I'm just finding a solution for you!

390
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,399
That's all!

391
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,399
More like finding a solution for yourself!

392
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,479
Plu b!

393
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,959
Il I just say it.

394
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,719
You married a.rich person

395
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,199
and live a luxurious life in a big house

396
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,759
Have you ever thought of.giving Grandma the money you spend on buying purses?

397
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,519
Plu b! Don't criticize me!

398
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,879
When I married Su thee,

399
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,599
didn't he give Grandma millions?!

400
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,759
Wasn't it for formality?

401
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,799
Grandma gave it back to him

402
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,079
Grandma never wanted a piece of the dowry.

403
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,119
She didn't want to be called i a person who sold her granddaughter

404
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,279
You have the money

405
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,639
and you're gonna blame Grandma?!

406
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,559
You think I don't know?

407
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,679
I just didn't say anything

408
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,279
Why?

409
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,599
Grandma told you to come get the money back?

410
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,119
No.

411
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,479
I just want you to have a subconsciousness.

412
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,519
Be grateful of Grandma and how much she struggled raising us!

413
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,839
Grandma's matter is her matter.

414
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,359
As for you,

415
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,279
you owe Su thee so you need to get the money to pay him back!

416
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,199
I feel considerate of his family!

417
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,999
I don't want them to criticize me later

418
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,839
that I brought my family to leech off of them, understood?!

419
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,919
I know!

420
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,999
If I have the money, I will pay.him back. Don't worry.

421
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,559
One week!

422
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,559
You need to pay Su thee

423
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,519
and me back within a week.

424
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,559
Remember that!

425
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,039
What?

426
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,319
She wants the money back after you borrowed it in less than a week?!

427
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,239
Is she really your sister?

428
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,639
Did your parents adopt her?

429
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,359
Why is she so cruel to you?

430
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,559
If my parents were still here,

431
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,999
I want to ask them the same question.

432
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,279
It's money worth over 100 K.

433
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,439
Where are you gonna get the money?

434
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,159
I don't know either.

435
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,519
Cha doesn't have any job for me to do either right now.

436
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,359
Hey Plu b.

437
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,079
I know you feel uncomfortable

438
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,319
to work at peem's company.

439
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,519
But I think Mr, Puchong, his father, is a good person

440
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,799
I don't want you to throw away a good opportunity.

441
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,279
Reconsider your decision on this again.

442
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,599
Mm.

443
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,359
I'll think about it again.

444
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,639
As a mother

445
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,759
whether we're physically suffering

446
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,479
or emotionally suffering

447
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,439
what a mother should never do

448
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,919
is abandon her own child.

449
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,599
This is not abandoning your child?

450
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,119
Not attentive

451
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,399
is abandoning.

452
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,079
Gosh Mr. Pete.

453
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,959
Mr peem is here Auntie

454
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,439
What is it?

455
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,919
Mr. peem.

456
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,239
Mr. Pete's asthma is acting up again.

457
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,839
Where did his mother go?

458
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,999
The usual.

459
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,959
She left to send Mr. Puchong off to Phuket just now.

460
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,159
Does she know that her son is like this?

461
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,239
She does.

462
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,959
But she still left and said that Mr.
Puchong's matter is more important.

463
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,199
So she asked me to look after Mr. Pete for her.

464
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,599
Mr. peem.

465
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,079
What do we do?

466
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,119
I already gave him his medication

467
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,679
I wiped him too and still the fever hasn't gone down.

468
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,359
Let's take him to the hospital.

469
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,839
peem.

470
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,879
Let's quickly take him

471
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,399
peem! I want to play too!

472
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,119
Hey!

473
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,999
Stop doing what Iim doing!

474
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,559
peem! I'm lonely! Can I play with you?!

475
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,439
peem! Can I play too?!

476
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,319
Don't bother me!

477
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,959
Don't come near me.

478
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,919
I hate you.

479
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,719
Help!

480
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,759
peem!

481
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,759
Help!

482
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,439
Pete!

483
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,839
peem.

484
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,279
When did you get here?

485
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,679
A while now.

486
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,239
I saw you were sleeping sol didn't want to bother you.

487
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,319
So,

488
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,839
why are you by yourself?

489
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,119
Your mother isn't here watching you?

490
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,599
She's busy.

491
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,479
Like you already know.

492
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,479
My mom is...

493
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,719
busy catching

494
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,519
Dad's women.

495
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,079
What about Dad?

496
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,119
Has he come to visit you?

497
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,479
It's good that he didn't.

498
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:38,959
Easy now.

499
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,799
I don't want to hear him complain.

500
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,959
Every time he comes

501
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,719
he's always here arguing and fighting with me.

502
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,599
What did you do

503
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,719
to scare of his complaints?

504
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,999
Talking like that,

505
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,999
you know about the clip?

506
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,719
Yeah.

507
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,639
I deleted the clip from your phone.

508
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,679
Why did you do it?

509
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,279
Secretly recording a woman like that.

510
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,199
Only bad guys would do it.

511
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,359
I know!

512
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,279
I want to be bad!

513
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,399
Pete.

514
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,759
Why?

515
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,799
It's not fair.

516
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,399
Dad isn't a good father.

517
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,039
So the child has to be good to make the father feel at ease?

518
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,839
Mom too.

519
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:38,999
Pete.

520
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,519
You misunderstood!

521
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,319
Being a good person who does good and think good,

522
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,839
it's not for someone else.

523
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,759
But it's for yourself.

524
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,279
Don't spite Dad by doing this again

525
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,279
Because with Dad,

526
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,839
it won't work.

527
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,639
That's Sakoo,

528
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,199
Pl ub's nephew.

529
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,559
Are you okay?

530
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,599
Are you hurt?

531
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,639
Sako o.

532
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,359
Why are you crying?

533
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,599
Hey you!

534
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,719
Oh! So handsome!

535
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,119
Yes?

536
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,679
You scolded my nephew?!

537
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,439
No.

538
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,159
Then why is he crying if you didn't?

539
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,439
Are you hurt anywhere?

540
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,359
Can you stand?

541
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,079
Huh?

542
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,719
Does it hurt?

543
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,959
Did this man scold you?

544
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,799
No.

545
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,479
Then why are you crying?

546
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,839
I'm sorry, Can you please not scold me?

547
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,279
I won't scold you

548
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,839
You didn't mean to do it, right?

549
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,439
It was an accident, right?

550
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,439
Don't cry.

551
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,559
It's embarrassing if the girls saw you

552
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,239
Don't cry.

553
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,119
Sako o!

554
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,158
Sako o! The reyou are!

555
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,919
Don't run so fast.

556
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,479

How can we keep laughing all day?

588
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,959
We would go crazy

589
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,279
I know

590
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,719
that the pathway for poor people is filled with gravel

591
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,719
But I

592
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,279
just want a day

593
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,359
where I can walk a smooth path.

594
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,639
I just want you to get a good job.

595
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,639
I don't want to see you wandering around doing jobs that don't require your skills anymore.

596
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,799
I'm not insulting what you do right now.

597
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,319
I just regret your knowledge

598
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,159
If Iwork here

599
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,159
I would have to be that jerk's subordinate

600
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,119
Oh come on.

601
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,359
Here is your chance Plu b.

602
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,999
If a problem occurs, deal it with later.

603
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,159
Smiling in front of the company like that, are you not embarrassed?

604
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,439
-Hello.
-Hello.

605
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,159
I came to apply for a job.

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,599
The woman named Plu bpl a really did come apply for a job

608
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,079
Mr. peem wouldn't let this woman get a job here that easily.

609
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,679
Then I guess we're going to have to fight this out.

610
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,039
Let's see in this company

611
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,599
who will the employees be more considerate of?

612
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,239
Me or peem?
