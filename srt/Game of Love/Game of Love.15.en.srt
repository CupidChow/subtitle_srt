1
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:21,807
Hey.

2
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:22,391
Hm?

3
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,226
Go home and get lots of rest

4
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,936
It'll be your first day at work tomorrow

5
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,355
Be really prepared, got it?

6
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,397
Okay!

7
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,899
You don't have to worry

8
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,442
Go watch Grandma.

9
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:32,360
Yeah.

10
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,613
Thank you so much Mr. Peem

11
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,198
You don't have to be formal with me

12
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,699
You don't need to thank me either

13
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,868
If your sister didn't give permission,

14
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,994
I wouldn't d are either.

15
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,080
Your sister is very mean!

16
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:45,748
Hey.

17
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,666
Mr, Peem.

18
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,084
l agree.

19
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:49,502
Right?

20
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:50,795
Hey!

21
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,296
Both of you stop it!

22
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,214
You see?

23
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,676
I'll excuse myself then

24
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,512
See you.

25
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:07,645
Hello,

26
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:08,813
Plubpla.

27
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,774
Hello Mr, Vi kit.

28
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,067
We meet again,

29
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,694
best bud.

30
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,239
Hey.

31
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,573
Plub.

32
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,784
You went back to work with Peem?

33
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,121
Yes.

34
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,664
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,249
Do you have any problems?

36
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:29,375
Or...

37
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,211
did Peem force you?

38
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:33,587
Hey.

39
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,423
You told me yourself

40
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:36,632
Plub has to choose.

41
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:39,927
Is that true?

42
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:41,887
Yes.

43
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,515
We had problems before

44
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,892
but we cleared everything up

45
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,728
You don't have to worry

46
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,483
Kit.

47
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,485
I'm sorry

48
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:00,406
that I had to drag you into our relationship

49
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,658
We were just sulking at each other.

50
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,493
We've made up now

51
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:13,586
Let's go.

52
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,628
We should get going.

53
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,630
Grandma has been waiting long.

54
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,631
There will be traffic.

55
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,090
Yes.
4

56
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,095
I'll call to explain later Mr. Vi kit.

57
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,388
-Hey!
-Okay.

58
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,931
What's there to explain?

59
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,558
Kit understands now.

60
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,226
He'll get annoyed.

61
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,186
Let's just go.

62
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,355
Grandma is waiting. We should hurry

63
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,024
I can walk on my own!

64
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,740
Peem.

65
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,951
Why do you always take things I want?!

66
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,877
Hello Mrs. Sup ang

67
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,255
What Mom?

68
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,049
You said

69
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,426
Peem hired Tong?

70
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,469
Yes.

71
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,554
Your brother

72
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,389
interviewed him himself.

73
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,519
Now do you see

74
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,978
that Peem lied?

75
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,526
He doesn't care about your feelings at all.

76
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,736
But...

77
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,615
Peem is helping us pull that woman away from Dad though

78
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,160
That is true.

79
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:34,083
Peem keeping Plubpla close to him is definitely good for us

80
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,627
But don't forget

81
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,964
Tong once hurt you.

82
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,216
With your brother doing this,

83
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:46,178
you want me to believe that he's helping us?

84
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,513
Huh?

85
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,356
I think

86
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,026
it might be Peem's plan.

87
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,197
Can't we just wait and see Mom?

88
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,741
It might work.

89
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,036
What if it's not his plan?

90
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,760
Where is Tong working at?

91
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,475
You better not start anything again

92
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,687
Your dad is already angry with me

93
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,440
I just want to go see.

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,734
I won't do anything.

95
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,236
Better be true.

96
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,239
You told me yourself

97
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,451
if we want to hurt someone,

98
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,873
we don't need to use violence.

99
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,259
Thank you

100
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,304
for helping me come to an understanding with Tong today.

101
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,514
I did it as your boyfriend.

102
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,643
Don't say stuff!

103
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,436
Who's your girlfriend?

104
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,608
Are you not going to soften up to me at all?

105
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:23,525
Hm?

106
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:25,653
No.

107
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,114
I'm happy

108
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,991
that you and Tong came to an understanding.

109
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,786
You're a really good sister.

110
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,164
No.

111
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,375
Sometimes

112
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,585
I get mad at him

113
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,797
for causing problems for me.

114
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,132
How can I be a good sister with that?

115
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,843
Then...

116
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,137
I'mproba bly a bad brother too.

117
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,182
I used to really dislike Pete.

118
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,642
To the point of hating him.

119
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,686
You?

120
00:07:58,937 --> 00:07:59,645
Yeah.

121
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,650
You seem to spoil him though

122
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,361
For me,

123
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,196
siblings are like a roommate

124
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,864
that we can't choose.

125
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,866
We can't change them either.

126
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,870
That's true.

127
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,082
When it comes to sister and brother problems.

128
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,251
sometimes we may not like it

129
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,713
or even hate it.

130
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,381
but we love them regardless.

131
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,008
Love each other

132
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,511
but it doesn't mean we have to like them.

133
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,971
A sibling relationship

134
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,389
is quite strange, don't you think?

135
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:43,355
Oh!

136
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:44,732
Plub.

137
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:45,649
Tre.

138
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:46,984
Su thee.

139
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,777
-Hello.
-Hello.

140
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,404
Hello Mr Peem

141
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,905
Hello Mr. Su thee.

142
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:53,907
Mrs....

143
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,828
Tre.

144
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,705
My older sister, do you remember?

145
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,000
About.

146
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,668
the other time.

147
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,504
I'm sorry for being rude

148
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,257
What happened?

149
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,259
It's just that..

150
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,344
Pluband I

151
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,264
had a little misunderstanding

152
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,350
Let bygones be bygones.

153
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,687
I feel at ease that you and Plub has come to an understanding now

154
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,023
Of course.

155
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,691
Plub

156
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,610
is my beloved sister

157
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:33,614
Yes.

158
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:36,533
You can send me off here Mr. Peem

159
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,328
Excuse me then.

160
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,747
Tell Grandma I'm sorry I won't be visiting her.

161
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,249
She probably wants to rest right now.

162
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,250
Okay.

163
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,420
Grandma will be discharged tomorrow.

164
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,465
You can go visit her at home

165
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,134
She's getting discharged?

166
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:55,886
I'll pick you guys up tomorrow.

167
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,054
That's okay.

168
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,307
I already told Yot to come pick us up

169
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,060
Plub.

170
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,062
Yot is an officer

171
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,438
Why bother him?

172
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,190
He has a lot on his plate

173
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,526
Let Mr. Peem pick you up

174
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,236
Call Yot.

175
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,447
That's okay.

176
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,908
I can go visit Grandma at home then

177
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,076
Just like you said

178
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,038
You're so sweet Mr. Peem

179
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,373
Next time.

180
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,252
you can address me as your big sister just like Plub

181
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:31,505
Yes,

182
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,464
Tre.

183
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,509
You're easy to talk to

184
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,262
If you'll excuse me.

185
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,521
Plub.

186
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,689
What's the deal?

187
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,315
Your boss came to drop you off?

188
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,733
There's nothing

189
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,485
Come. Let's go visit Grandma

190
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:55,612
Wait up!

191
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,287
Plub.

192
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,330
How is there nothing?

193
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,625
I think he really likes you. He's courting you, isn't he?

194
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,669
Look Tre.

195
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,797
He's just teasing me, that's all.

196
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,132
There's nothing.

197
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:16,842
Grandma.

198
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,926
Hello.

199
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,724
Hey.

200
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,019
I confirm

201
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,271
I think Mr. Peem really likes you

202
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,317
If he's courting you,

203
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,651
grab on to him.

204
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,861
Do not let him slip away

205
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,364
Plub.

206
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,409
This is the best opportunity in your life.

207
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,329
- Think about it. A woman who used to work as --
-What?

208
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,207
What about the jobs I used to do?

209
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,125
wasn't selling my body

210
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,545
I'm not looking down on you.

211
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,340
But think about it.

212
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:02,095
Only a few men can see the good

213
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,097
and understand you

214
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,642
I'm your big sister Plub.

215
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,977
I have your best interests at heart

216
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,148
I understand.

217
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,776
I ill make my own decision

218
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,779
That's enough Tre

219
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,406
Enough talking about this matter.

220
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,700
Let Grandma rest.

221
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:25,911
Let's go home.

222
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:29,498
Okay.

223
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,918
Don't forget what I told you.

224
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:43,095
P lub is playing hard to get when there'sagood man courting her.

225
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,808
I hope she doesn't have bad taste and get with a loser like Yot.

226
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,936
What a waste for Mr. Peem.

227
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,813
If we get to be in laws,

228
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,191
it'll be a good thing for your company.

229
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,442
Don't you think so?

230
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,696
Money to money.

231
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,614
We'll only get richer.

232
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,199
Su thee.

233
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,577
You need to help me root for Plub and Mr. Peem

234
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,666
I think you shouldn't get involved in Pl ub's personal business.

235
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,042
Why not?

236
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,752
I'm her sister.

237
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,629
Why can't I get involved?

238
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:18,922
Being a sister

239
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,425
doesn't mean you have the right to meddle in everything

240
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,345
Especially whoever she wants to be with.
That's her business

241
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,471
You're jealous?

242
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,724
What is wrong with you?

243
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,852
You like Plub, don't you?

244
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,646
Tre.

245
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,316
Plub is your sister.

246
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:39,735
How could you think that?

247
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,570
You're awful.

248
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,826
I better not catch you then!

249
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,583
I have to make Plub your s, Mr. Peem.

250
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,961
So Suthee can stop bothering and hoping to have her,

251
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,838
and come back to me.

252
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,762
If what Tres aid is true

253
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,848
that Mr. Peem really likes you,

254
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,558
what do you think Plub?

255
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,188
Well,

256
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,858
nothing Grandma.

257
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,195
I know what kind of person he is.

258
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,325
Don't worry.

259
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:33,789
Plub.

260
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,958
If you like him,

261
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,378
like really like him,

262
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,005
I won't mind.

263
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,425
He's a good person

264
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,139
But I want to warn you.

265
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,975
You have to be well-behaved.

266
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,562
Don't make him think that you're just a toy

267
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:02,359
Don't make him look down on you and think that you want to be with him for his money.

268
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:05,904
Yes.

269
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:07,948
But...

270
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,118
I'm telling you the truth Grandma

271
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,330
It's impossible for us to be together

272
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,958
We're too different.

273
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,751
If he wants to...

274
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,462
have whatever feelings for me

275
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,340
it won't mean anything to me

276
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,592
Okay?

277
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,897
Geez, Mr. Hero!

278
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,443
You acted as the glue to have the siblings reconcile

279
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,318
Hey.

280
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,029
To win Plubpla's heart.

281
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:52,200
Mr. Peem Pattaratrakul had to invest this much?

282
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,121
I just understand what it's like to be an older sibling

283
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,873
So as of right now.

284
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,584
how do you really feel about Plubpla?

285
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,460
Huh?

286
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:02,544
Well?

287
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,591
You want to win her heart

288
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,259
to defeat your dad?

289
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,218
Or...

290
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,972
you want to win her heart because you really like her now?

291
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,140
There's no way.

292
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,310
You know I don't like a woman like Plubpla

293
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,066
then you don't need to help her

294
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,444
and Tong make up

295
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:28,445
Am I right?

296
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:29,279
Well,

297
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,864
I told you already.

298
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,866
I only sympathize with her.

299
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,868
That's even weirder.

300
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,788
Can we really sympathize someone who we don't like?

301
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,543
Are you sure

302
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,504
that right now

303
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,673
you don't like a woman like Plubpla?

304
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,972
You can't answer me

305
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,641
because you're not sure

306
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,351
Hey Tat.

307
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,479
I'm not a defendant in your case here.

308
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,481
If you're not sure.

309
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,191
why do this then?

310
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:12,572
Because I don't want Plub pla to be another woman in my dad's collection

311
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,491
Besides, both Su and Pete

312
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,827
are trying to attack her and her family

313
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,163
That's why l have to keep her close to me.

314
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,415
Is this enough reason, Mr. Lawyer?

315
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,547
I think you do like her.

316
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,466
Tat.

317
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,051
If you don't like her,

318
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,303
why try to even win her over?

319
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,474
I think

320
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,227
you try asking yourself again

321
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,729
how you really feel about Plub

322
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,065
Whatever!

323
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,525
But I don't like her!

324
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,402
Okay.

325
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,529
Whatever you say

326
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,878
Are you sure that right now

327
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,464
you don't like a woman like Plubpla?

328
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,354
Hey!

329
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,064
How did you get here?!

330
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,400
We've met before?

331
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,653
No.

332
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,447
I took you for another person.

333
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,531
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,375
Plubpla.

335
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:51,838
That's Plub pla to o.

336
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,219
Why am I seeing Plubpla everywhere?

337
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,472
Unless...

338
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,682
I'm thinking about Plubp la too much?

339
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,518
I think you really like her

340
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,939
Not true!

341
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,024
It's not true!

342
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:25,830
VANIR Y SEL I think

343
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,333
VANIR Y SEL you try asking yourself again

344
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,418
VANIR Y SEL how you really feel about Plub.

345
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,087
VANIR Y SEL Impossible.

346
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,464
VANIR YS EL
Ijust want to defeat Dad, that's all.

347
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,059
Hello.

VANIRYSEL
I'm sorry Mr. Peem

349
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,271
for calling you on the weekend.

350
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,191
VANIR Y SEL What do you need Mrs. Tre?

351
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:54,859
VANIR Y SEL Gosh.

352
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,653
I told you

353
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,822
not to be formal with me.

354
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,711
What is all this?

355
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,924
Don't tell me you set this all up P lub?

356
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:18,508
( RAE FIELD )

357
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,509
That's crazy!

358
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,302
I didn't do this.

359
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,930
Must be Tong then

360
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,639
Right?

361
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,682
TRAC R-FIELD

362
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:26,766
I don't think so.

363
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,268
RACH-FIELD It's Tong first day of work today.

364
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,562
I don't think he had the time to do this.

365
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,689
Then who was it?

366
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,568
Great Grandma is home!

367
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,112
My Sa koo!

368
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,283
I missed you!

369
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,617
Is this for me?

370
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,704
Who did you come with?

371
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:48,580
Hm?

372
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,749
You guys are home

373
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,501
Welcome home, Grandma.

374
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,630
Mr. Peem.

375
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,340
Why are you here?

376
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,509
Your sister invited me.

377
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,432
I want to throw a small party to welcome Grandma home.

378
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,684
So I invited Mr. Peem

379
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:10,810
Gosh!

380
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,147

No trouble at all

It's the weekend

383

Besides, you were in the hospital for a long time.

384

We need to celebrate on you returning home

385

I think we should take Grandma to go eat.

403
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,985
You must be hungry Grandma.

Yot, go put my grandma's things in her room.

As for Mr. Peem

408

You're feeling better now?

Did you wait for me long?

Should I let you go home now?

426
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,037
Pete wants to apply for an internship?

427
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:54,789
Yes.

428
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:59,794
You should tell your people to stop following our son now.

429
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,588
I don't want him to feel uncomfortable.

430

What's he thinking?

431
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:08,177
He wants to change himself for the better.

432
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,723
How are you sure he won't get into more trouble?

433

I'm telling you because I want you to feel at ease.

Whatever.

436
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:26,487
You should tell your people to stop following him around.

437

I can't.

438
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,826

who can be housewives like Usa are hard to find.

569
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,726
Her mother raised her well!

570
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,104
Even though women go outside to work

571
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,357
but l think housework are also important

572
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,359
They can't neglect it either.

573
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:06,364
I think cooking your own food is much healthier for your body

574
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,950
Mom and Dad are getting older now.

575
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:14,830
That is why lam always coming home for dinner every night.

576
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,998
Right.

577
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,462
It's a pity.

578
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:26,092
It would be nice to have an adorable daughter like Usa as my own.

579
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,054
Mr. Puchong.

580
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,931
I heard that

581
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,058
if we have a good daughter in law

582
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,351
it's like having a real daughter

583
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,478
They are interchangeable

584
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,398
You're right.

585
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,942
Why have I never thought of this?

586
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,195
Hey.

587
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,866
Should I ask you to have Usa as my daughter in law?

588
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,956
By saying that, I guess my son in law would be Peem then.

589
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,584
Dad.

590
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,378
Don't joke around.

591
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,130
I'm not joking.

592
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,383
I'll be honest Mr. Puchong

593
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:12,388
Peem has been coming over to my house so often that people are thinking

594
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,349
that these two are dating.

595
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,184
But more importantly

596
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,811
my daughter

597
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:20,896
is a woman.

598
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,988
I wasn't joking either, sir

599
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,200
I really want Usa to be my daughter in law.

600
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,913
Uncle.

601
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,166
You're in on this with him?

602
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,588
Shall we eat now?

603
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,591
Sure, let's. Food must be delicious today.

604
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,441
Oh my god Tong!

605
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,318
Why aren't you careful?!

606
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,694
All the things are damaged!

607
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,488
I'm going to deduct your salary!

608
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,364
But I didn't do this

609
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,325
I just walked in here. You saw me.

610
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,410
If you didn't do it, then who did?!

611
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:17,786
Well...

612
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,164
I did it.

613
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,751
It's just...

614
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,294
I wanted to help

615
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,046
But l accidentally dropped it

616
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,298
You can deduct my salary

617
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,634
Gosh Mr. Pete

618
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
It was an accident

619
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,136
It's fine.

620
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,971
Then...

621
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,515
can you help me clean it up?

622
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,684
Tong, why don't you --

623
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,228
Tong and I

624
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,521
are off work

625
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,190
Manager, why don't you.

626
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,274
clean it yourself?

627
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:50,986
Sure.

628
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,336
Pete.

629
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,129
Wait.

630
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,175
What?

631
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,886
Why are you doing this?

632
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:17,972
Doing what?

633
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,183
Help me not get my salary deducted.

634
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:25,812
Consider it compensation for what I did to you.

635
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,858
We have to work at the same place anyway

636
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:31,944
We should be friends.

637
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:43,038
You think I would believe someone like you wants to be friends with me?

638
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,591
You won't fall for my trick?

639
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,060
Are you really going to have Mr. Peem get engage to Ms. Usa?

640
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,062
Yes!

641
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,191
Peem can finally stop bothering Plubpla

642
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,818
Most importantly,

643
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,905
Usa seem to like Peemany way

644
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,365
Mr. Peem..

645
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,452
is interested in her?

646
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,371
From the looks of it, he doesn't seem to..

647
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,707
have any romantic feelings for her

648
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,005
Mr s. Umpon are friends with Man ee.

649
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,301
Peem adores and is very considerate of Mr s. Umpon

650
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,969
Would he dare say no?

651
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,138
He has to give in regardless

652
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:00,908
Usa.

653
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,244
Most importantly

654
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,414
Usa seem to like Peem anyway.

655
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,794
Where are you going Mr. Pete?!

656
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,048
What?!

657
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,591
You can't leave!

658
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,510
Why not?! I want to go!

659
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,011
It's Mr. Puchong's order!

660
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,304
You can not leave!

661
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,916
Pete, stop it right now!

662
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,045
I said stop!

663
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,760
Are you okay?

664
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:02,678
I'm fine.

665
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,139
You...

666
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,432
You should go get your wound cleaned up.

667
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,600
However much the medical bill is, come get the money from me

668
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,686
Don't tell anyone about this

669
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,146
I'll take care of it

670
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,188
Sure.

671
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:20,529
Hey!

672
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,322
Your father is inside.

673
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:23,907
You dare cause trouble again?!

674
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,452
I thought you said you won't use violence again?

675
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,287
What's gotten into you?

676
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,208
Pete!

677
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,085
Come back right now!

678
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,003
-Pete!
-Where are you going?!

679
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:46,472
What happened?

680
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,348
I don't know either.

681
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,061
It's good you came.

682
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,272
Your father was asking for you

683
00:37:58,443 --> 00:37:59,067
Huh?

684
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,820
You want me to get engaged to Sa?!

685
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,948
I discussed it with Mrs. Umpon and Mr, Thawip.

686
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,617
They said yes.

687
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,953
How can I get engaged to her?

688
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,747
Sa and Iare like brother and sister.

689
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,999
What do you mean brother and sister?

690
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,503
You go over to their house as if it was your own home

691
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,547
Neighbors have been gossiping about their daughter.

692
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,298
Dad.

693
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,467
I've been going over there since I was a kid

694
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,427
Why are they gossiping about it now?

695
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,221
How would I know?

696
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,722
That's what they said.

697
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,933
I'll go talk to Sa.

698
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,935
You guys can't agree on this together like this.

699
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,687
But Usa said yes!
