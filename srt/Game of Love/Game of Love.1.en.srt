00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,750
How much I hated you♪

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,500
Ican love you even more

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,750
I'm sorry for all the mistakes

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,500
I want you to try to accept the love that comes from me

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,750
I will give you everything♪

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,250
Alright everyone.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Welcome to the launch of the latest electric car model.

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,500
Remember your guy's face.

13
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,250
When the song changes,

14
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,000
go for it!

15
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,250
When I give you the signal,

16
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,500
Within five minutes,

17
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
anyone who can make our guests

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
raise their hands and book a car,

19
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,250
I'll have a bonus for you.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
30,000 baht!

21
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,500
30,000?!

23
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,250
Plub.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,750
Over there.

25
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,500
He's over there.

26
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,500
Is she so beautiful that you're astonished, Boss?

27
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,750
You already know

28
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,500
I'm not interested in women who uses
their beauty in exchange for money.

29
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,500
know.

30
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,750
But that's the past.

31
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,250
Just forget about it.

32
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,000
Just have some fun living the life.

33
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,250
If I forget,

34
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,250
I might be like Dad.

35
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,500
I don't want to be like that.

36
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,000
Whatever.

37
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,750
She's coming over.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Enjoy it.

39
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,000
Can we get photos?

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,500
Keep a close eye on him.

41
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,250
If Puchong is with this woman for more than a week,

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,250
handle it.

43
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,250
Yes, Ms. Su.

44
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,750
I will never let anyone replace me,

45
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Puchong!

46
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,250
This camera please.

47
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,500
Smile.

48
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Beautiful.

49
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,250
Hello Uncle.

50
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,500
I'm so happy that you gave me
the honor for coming to my event.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I heard Peem is also attending this event.

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,250
He's inside already. I'll take you inside.

53
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,500
- Let's go.
- Follow me.

54
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:19,750
Let's go.

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't have to tell you what you must do

56
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,500
to have them book a car.

57
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,000
For those guys, as long as we're offering them VIP service,

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,750
they're in our hands one hundred percent.

59
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,250
Hey

60
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,000
I told you I won't accept these kinds of jobs.

61
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:57,750
Oh,

62
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,250
well I'm not going to scold you.

63
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,000
It was just an idea.

64
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I thought you need money to help pay for your brother's tuition?

65
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,750
You said so yourself.

66
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,250
Come on over.

67
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,750
It is now time for our girls

68
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,250
to take our three handsome men out to
experience our latest luxury innovations.

69
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,000
After this,

70
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,750
we will find out

71
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,500
which young men will like and book a car with us.

72
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,750
I'll give you five minutes!

73
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,500
Hello.

74
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,500
Let me formally introduce you.

75
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,750
The highlight of this car

76
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,750
is the interior design in which is simple and elegant.

77
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,500
- It has--
-That's enough.

78
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
These information

79
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,250
can be read through the brochure.

80
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,750
It's a waste of time.

81
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I just want to know how these electric cars

82
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,000
are better than gas-powered engine cars?

83
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,000
Can you answer that?

84
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You probably won't answer something simple like

85
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,750
polluting or environmentally friendly vehicles.

86
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,250
Women who only sell their beauty

87
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,000
won't have a brain to answer these questions.

88
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes.

89
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,000
First point,

90
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,750
electric cars have fewer spare parts.

91
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It reduces annual maintenance costs.

92
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Second point,

93
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,000
it reduces expenses because we can charge the car at home.

94
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,500
Currently, the cost of electricty in the house
is only 4 to 5 baht per unit.

95
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,000
Third point,

96
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,750
electric cars are more powerful.

97
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,000
Produces more torque than a normal car.

98
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,500
Making it possible to accelerate
faster and overtake more quickly.

99
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,500
How was that?

100
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,000
Shocked I bet.

101
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,500
Beautiful women have brains too.

102
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,750
Don't try to bully me.

103
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
What do you think?

104
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,500
It doesn't make me want to buy it.

105
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,500
This guy gets on my damn nerves!

106
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,500
This woman is really working hard

107
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,000
or just being professional when it comes to men?

108
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,750
That's strange.

109
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
I thought

110
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,500
you would give it your all so I can book a car.

111
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,500
Give it my all?

112
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,750
How?

113
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,000
Well...

114
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,250
selling products like hard sell,

115
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,250
like getting physically intimate.

116
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,750
Like...

117
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
what your friends are doing

118
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,000
I think...

119
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,250
a businessman like you

120
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,250
wouldn't want to buy a car worth millions

121
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,750
just to...

122
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,750
want my service just once.

123
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,000
You mean

124
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,750
if I book your car today,

125
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,000
you will give it to me more than once?

126
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Is that so?

127
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,000
If you're interested,

128
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,250
I can look after you for rest of your life.

129
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:12,750
There you go.

130
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,000
Smart

131
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Probably trying to have me be committed to her for a long time.

132
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,250
Why don't you tell me your propositions?

133
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,500
How will you take care of me?

134
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,250
In that case...

135
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,750
...

136
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,250
Let me formally introduce myself.

137
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,250
I'm Plubpla.

138
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,000
Insurance agent. Number 353535.

139
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I would like to sell you first class
insurance for the entire life of this product.

140
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
One minute left.

141
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,250
I'll add home insurance to the mix too.

142
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,500
What the hell?

143
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,000
What happened?

144
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,750
I got it.

145
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,250
Hey Plub.

146
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:32,750
Hmm?

147
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,750
What did you do for him to leave before time was up?

148
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,500
Peem.

149
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Hey Peem!

150
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Hey!

151
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,750
Did she do something to upset you?

152
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,750
You sold insurance to Mr. Peem?

153
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,250
Yeah.

154
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,750
He said

155
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,500
to submit a request for care and he will consider booking.

156
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,750
So I offered care my way.

157
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,500
sold him insurance.

158
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,500
My goodness. We're gonna be dead.

159
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,500
It's over!

160
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,000
How dare you?

161
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,000
You made Mr. Peem Pataratrakul,

162
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,000
CEO and heir to PP World upset.

163
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
PP World?

164
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,750
Yeah, PP World.

165
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,500
One of the country's largest business groups.

166
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
I didn't know.

167
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,750
He insulted me first!

168
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,500
It was for your sake. Otherwise I would have cussed him out!

169
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,000
I really hate men who view women
as sexual objects. You get me?

170
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,000
Sure little good girl!

171
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,500
Then you'll be the only one missing out on 30,000 baht.

172
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,500
I think

173
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,000
he won't book a car from you.

174
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,000
Wow! Mr. Vikit has decided to book a car with us!

175
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Congratulations!

176
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,500
Our first handsome young man has booked a car already.

177
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,500
After seeing our cars,

178
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,000
will you or will you not book a car with us, Mr. Peem?

179
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,750
Will you or will you not Mr. Peem?

180
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,250
You're gonna be a rotten egg Plub.

181
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,500
Bye bye 30,000.

182
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,000
see the signs.

183
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,500
Let's anticipate whether or not you will book, Mr. Peem.

184
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,500
Mr. Peem has decided to book a car!

185
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That is excellent!

186
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,500
Reporters, you can take pictures. Go ahead.

187
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,250
Go ahead.

188
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,500
I didn't think Mr. Peem would book a car today.

189
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,500
Yeah.

190
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,000
Usually Peem really hates these women.

191
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Or...

192
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,500
maybe it's because of this girl?

193
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Mr. Peem, this camera please.

194
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,500
Excuse me.

195
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,750
I call dibs on green shirt.

196
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:46,750
Sure.

197
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,250
I want the middle.

198
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,000
Deal.

199
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,250
Black shirt for me.

200
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,500
Go for it.

201
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,500
Let me treat you to a drink.

202
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,250
I'll only accept your kindness.

203
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,750
I don't drink with strangers.

204
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
I'm going to use the restroom.

205
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,500
I bought her a drink

206
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,750
but she didn't want to drink it.

207
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,000
You want to play hard to get?

208
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:03,750
Hey.

209
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:04,750
What are you doing?

210
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,500
This doesn't look good Pete.

211
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's go.

212
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,750
You guys recorded a woman in the restroom?

213
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
It's none of your business.

214
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,500
Don't meddle!

215
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,250
Bastard.

216
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,000
Hey!

217
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What the hell?!

218
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,250
I said delete the photo!

219
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,750
No.

220
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,500
Who are you to order me around?

221
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,250
Hey Tong.

222
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
What's going on?

223
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
These guys here

224
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,750
were recording a woman using the restroom!

225
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,750
What?!

226
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,000
Don't accuse me.

227
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,250
It's in your phone!

228
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,500
Show it.

229
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,250
No.

230
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,750
Why?

231
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,750
Who are you?

232
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,750
If you want it, come and get it.

233
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,250
- Come on. Don't mess with him.
- You want another one?

234
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,250
Bring it on!

235
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
You want it?

236
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,750
Tong!

237
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,250
Pete!

238
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Punch him!

239
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,000
Tong!

240
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,750
Pete!

241
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,000
Don't jump in!

242
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,500
Pete be careful!

243
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,250
Pete!

244
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,250
Tong!

245
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,500
- Tong! Stop!
- Pete!

246
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,750
Pete!

247
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,500
Wake up!

248
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,750
Pete!

249
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,250
Wake up!

250
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,000
You're in trouble, Tong.

251
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,250
Please be okay Pete!

252
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Pete!

253
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,750
Wake up!

254
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,000
Pete!

255
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,500
I'm very surprised

256
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,250
that you booked a car with her.

257
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,500
You know that I wanted that car.

258
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,000
But you can just buy it from Top another time.

259
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,750
Or is it because of her?

260
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,000
Theard that if those girls can make their
special guest book a car,

261
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
they will receive a big sum of money as a reward.

262
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,250
Were you helping her?

263
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,750
Aha!

264
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,250
It's not what you think

265
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,250
What the hell?

266
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,250
Maybe it's because she sold me insurance.

267
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,250
Huh?

268
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,500
I just feel

269
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,750
sometimes there are women that has to take these jobs

270
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,000
for self-sufficient.

271
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,000
They don't want to be comfortable and use
their beauty to get rich like my stepmother.

272
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,000
Mm.

273
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Why are you smiling?

274
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,500
I'm just happy.

275
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,250
At least there is this girl

276
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
that can lower your grudge a little.

277
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,750
hope I'm not wrong.

278
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,750
What?

279
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,500
Mr. Vikit wants Plub to leave with him?

280
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,250
That's right.

281
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Mr. Vikit is really interested in Plubpla.

282
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,750
Kit probably thinks you're interested in her

283
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,500
So he's trying to steal her.

284
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,250
Screw Kit.

285
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,000
Let's see

286
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,000
if that woman is what I think she is or not.

287
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Well?

288
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,000
Do you have a problem?

289
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,750
Oh!

290
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,000
Plub has to look after Mr. Peem.

291
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
She agreed to leave with Mr. Peem after work.

292
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,000
No!

293
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,500
I'm afraid

294
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,000
if Plub leaves with Mr. Vikit, Mr. Peem will not be happy.

295
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,750
There will be problems.

296
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,000
But Mr. Vikit said

297
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
however much Mr. Peem paid for her,

298
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Mr. Vikit will pay double.

299
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,750
You will also get a bonus.

300
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,750
Well...But...

301
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:30,500
Mr. Vikit really likes Plubpla.

302
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,750
He wants to talk to her and get to know her.

303
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,250
To develop a future relationship,

304
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,250
Really?!

305
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,750
Yes.

306
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Let's go Tat.

307
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,250
Waste of time.

308
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,250
I tried to give these women a chance!

309
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,750
But you saw

310
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,500
this woman is freaking smart

311
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,250
for using me to add value to herself!

312
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,500
And it's perfect for someone like Kit

313
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,750
He's already trying to defeat you in every way.

314
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,500
Right now just feel

315
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,500
so stupid!

316
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,000
took pity.

317
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,750
-When in truth-
Calm down.

318
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,250
Don't give her value.

319
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
It'll just ruin your mood.

320
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,500
How's it going Peem?

321
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,500
Long time no see.

322
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,750
I never thought someone like you would
come and do something fun like this too.

323
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,250
You're back sooner than I thought.

324
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,250
You think what you've done

325
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,250
is forgotten by society?

326
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,750
Don't worry.

327
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,500
I'll do some charity content here and there.

328
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,250
They'll forget soon.

329
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,000
But I still see your clip of drunk driving on the internet.

330
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah.

331
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,500
People these days aren't stupid.

332
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,500
Those who do good things and build reputation,

333
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,000
cover up their reputation,

334
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,250
people can see the intention.

335
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,250
What about you?

336
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,750
You've changed a lot.

337
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,250
Or...

338
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,750
the girl that presented the car to you must be really good.

339
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,500
It's made you

340
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,000
eat your own words.

341
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,750
New plate.

342
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,750
That day was thrilling

343
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Roberto Carlos

344
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,250
It was cool

345
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
What?!

346
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,000
Pregnant?!

347
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,500
It happened alreadyWhat do you want me to do?

348
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:11,750
Peem.

349
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:12,750
Hey Peem!

350
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,500
Peem!

351
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,250
Calm down!

352
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,250
-Tat, let go -Calm down!

353
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,000
Peem!

354
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
That beautiful woman

355
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,500
is also your dad's wife?!

356
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,000
She's freaking sexy!

357
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,250
He has two wives.

358
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,750
Your dad is awesome!

359
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,000
What are you talking about Kit?

360
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,500
No.

361
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,500
My dad is rather an embarrassment

362
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,750
N.U.A.
for not choosing who he sleeps with!

363
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Don't over think it.

364
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Yeah, that's right

365
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,250
All men are like this.

366
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:55,750
No.

367
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,250
I won't be a man like Dad.

368
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,250
I will not get involved with a woman like that!

369
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,000
You must have absorbed a lot of this from your dad.

370
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:13,750
Kit.

371
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,250
Tat!

372
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,250
Hey Tat.

373
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,250
I really like a loyal dog like you.

374
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
When you get tired working with Peem,

375
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,750
come work with me.

376
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,750
I'll pay you double for your salary.

377
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:31,750
Tat!

378
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,250
If the reporters sees us,

379
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
there will be a bigger problem.

380
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
No.

381
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,750
I told you I won't take these kind of jobs.

382
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,250
I know that.

383
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,750
But he's not your average pimp.

384
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,500
This is Mr. Vikit, heir of V Group.

385
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,250
I want you to reconsider.

386
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Plub.

387
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,500
Listen to me.

388
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:09,000
Sometimes the key to wealth

389
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,250
doesn't all just depend on hard work.

390
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,750
Especially to women,

391
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,250
knowing how to use your beauty to your benefit,

392
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,750
picking a good man,

393
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,500
might make your life leap from being an average woman

394
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,750
to Cinderella over night.

395
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,750
Don't try to convince me.

396
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,000
It won't work.

397
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,500
want to use my brain

398
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,500
and my own two hands

399
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,750
to create my own wealth.

400
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,500
More than beauty.

401
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,000
Okay.

402
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,750
I understand.

403
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,000
won't ask anymore.

404
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,000
Okay?

405
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,750
In that case,

406
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,750
I'll go say no to Mr. Vikit's secretary

407
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,250
Yes!

408
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,500
How's it going boys?

409
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,500
Vikit.

410
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,500
Hello.

411
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,250
Hey, son.

412
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm happy that you know how to have fun with life.

413
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,500
Where did your girl go?

414
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,250
Those women

415
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,750
are just wildflowers on the side of the road.

416
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,500
I'm not like you Dad

417
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:38,250
where I won't care if that wildflower
has been peed on by a dog or cat.

418
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,500
Just sitting alone with her in the car

419
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
already disgusts me.

420
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,000
Is he talking about you?

421
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,250
Not all women who work like this is the kind that you think.

422
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,500
Maybe some are just working

423
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,000
But I don't think that way.

424
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,500
Deep down inside these women's hearts,

425
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
they are hoping to trap a rich man

426
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,500
and want to get rich the short cut way!

427
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,250
Not do these kind of jobs for self-sufficient.

428
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,000
But they want to be rich, they want to upgrade their life!

429
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,750
Miss!

430
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,750
-Let him handle it.
-Why did you say that?!

431
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,500
What did you just say?!

432
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,750
What happened?!

433
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,250
Did something happened?

434
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,750
Excuse me. Please back away.

435
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,250
Please wait outside.

436
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,500
Was that your mouth?

437
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,000
Is that how you talk about the gender of your mother?!

438
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,750
I just speak from what I've seen throughout my life.

439
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,750
But if it upsets you

440
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,000
then apologize.

441
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,750
But if one day

442
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,750
a rich man

443
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,250
wants you,

444
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,250
and puts money worth millions in front of you,

445
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
you won't take it?

446
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,500
Remember this.

447
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,500
Someone like me,

448
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,250
even if you bring all the money in the world,

449
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
you will never get to touch me!

450
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Miss.

451
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,750
Calm down.

452
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,750
This might be a misunderstanding.

453
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,250
Misunderstanding?

454
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,000
What's your problem?

455
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,750
No one disciplined you?

456
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,000
When you do something bad or evil,

457
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,500
when you can't argue back, you say
you're sorry and wasn't in your right mind!

458
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,250
Well? Do you have a gift basket along with this apology?

459
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,250
If you want to badmouth me,

460
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,750
just badmouth me!

461
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Do not mention anyone else!

462
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,500
Fine.

463
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,750
You're freaking rich.

464
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,750
But your heart is freaking low!

465
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,500
Didn't I tell you not to include all the
women who do this kind of job?

466
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,250
Some women aren't what you think.

467
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,250
It's because of you

468
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,250
that made me hate it since I was a child.

469
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
It won't easily change either.

470
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:55,250
Where do I get the money for Tong's tuition?

471
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
What is it Yot?

472
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
What?!

473
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,750
Here, to help your mood.

474
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Don't over think it.

475
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,250
That's what life is supposed to be.

476
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,750
Sometimes we can't choose what we will encounter.

477
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,750
Like today,

478
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:31,000
consider yourself unlucky for meeting an awful woman.

479
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,250
probably won't see her again.

480
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:37,750
Yeah.

481
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,250
Pete.

482
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,750
What is it this time?

483
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,250
Hello.

484
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,500
Peem.

485
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,500
I'm Pete's friend.

486
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,750
Well...

487
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,500
Pete is...

488
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,000
Huh?

489
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,000
What?!

490
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,000
Yot!

491
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,250
Plub.

492
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,750
How is Tong? Can I see him?

493
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,250
You can't.

494
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Tong is being interrogated right now.

495
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,250
So...

496
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,750
can I bail him out?

497
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,000
Well....

498
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,750
for an assault battery case this severe,

499
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,000
you need...

500
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
over a hundred thousand.

501
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,750
Severe?

502
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,250
Your brother is out of danger now.

503
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,250
I will come back in the morning to examine him again.

504
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Thank you Doctor.

505
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,750
Excuse me.

506
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,750
Peem!

507
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
How is Pete?

508
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,750
The doctor said

509
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,750
Pete is safe now.

510
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,750
Pete, son.

511
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,000
Why were you unlucky to meet those evil people?

512
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,250
Do you know who hurt him?

513
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,500
heard

514
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,000
they fought in a pub.

515
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,500
I think both parties were drunk.

516
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,250
How can they do this to Pete?!

517
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,000
You need to pursue the matter!

518
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Make them go to prison for life!

519
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,000
Maybe our side is at fault.

520
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,000
Impossible!

521
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,750
I'm confident Pete isn't at fault!

522
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,750
What is the matter with you?

523
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,000
You keep spoiling him.

524
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,750
That's why he keeps seeking problems for us!

525
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Spoiling him

526
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,000
is better than you not caring about him at all!

527
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,250
If he wasn't critically hurt like this,

528
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,250
you wouldn't come to visit him.

529
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,000
Where is she?

530
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:33,750
Today,

531
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,000
which woman were you with?!

532
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,500
Don't pick fights with me!

533
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,750
My son already sees me in a bad light!

534
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,250
Is it not true?!

535
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,500
How is it true?!

536
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,250
Pardon me, but can you go argue outside?

537
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,750
Pete will wake up and hear everything.

538
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,000
Come back and talk to me!

539
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,750
How is this my business?

540
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Why do I have to spend over a
hundred thousand on a brat like Tong?!

541
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,000
Tong might be mischievous sometimes

542
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,750
but he's our brother. Just help him.

543
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Just a brother.

544
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,250
He's not my son.

545
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,750
Most importantly, I don't want to consider
him my brother anymore.

546
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,500
Always seeking problems for us

547
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,500
If you want to take care of him,

548
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,500
find your own money. I won't get involved.

549
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,750
Tre.

550
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,000
So you're not gonna help Tong?

551
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
That's right!

552
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,750
Why are you cruel like this?

553
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,500
Say whatever you want to say!

554
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,250
You should leave.

555
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,250
-Before--
- Aunt Plub!

556
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,250
Sakoo!

557
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,750
I miss you so much!

558
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,250
How long have you been here Plub?

559
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,750
I just took Sakoo to see my parents.

560
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,750
You should have told me you were coming over.

561
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,500
I would have brought Sakoo home sooner.

562
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
It's just that...

563
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,000
Plus was just leaving Suthee.

564
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,750
Go

565
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,000
Can you stay first Aunt Plub?

566
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,750
Stay and play with me first.

567
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,000
I can't stay today Sakoo.

568
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,250
How about next time? I can sleep over.

569
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,250
In that case,

570
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,000
take off.

571
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,000
I have something urgent to do.

572
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,500
Wait Plub

573
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,500
Do you have any problems?

574
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,750
What is it?

575
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,000
Our lawyer got some information.

576
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,750
The other party is a student.

577
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,250
His name is Palapol.

578
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,250
I got his photo from social media.

579
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,750
Have the lawyer take legal action.

580
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,750
Wait, look at this first.

581
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
I have a surprise.

582
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
This woman again?

583
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,750
She's Palapol's guardian.

584
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,500
There's another thing you should know.

585
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,750
Palapol told the police that

586
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,250
he attacked Pete

587
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,500
because he was upset when he saw Pete
committing an indecent act.

588
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,750
He used his phone to record a
woman using the restroom.
