1
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,272
Grandma Thip!

2
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,815
How are you?!

3
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,900
Grandma Thip!

4
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,235
Take a deep breath!

5
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,237
How are you?

6
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,741
i don't know what's wrong

7
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,911
It hurts like someone is stepping right here.

8
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,413
Granny!

9
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:45,831
Gosh!

10
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,500
Why did you get up?

11
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,169
You just got discharged from the hospital!

12
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,172
I'm scared the plants will die

13
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,174
You can tell someone else to do it

14
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,425
Who?

15
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,968
Tong isn't here

16
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,512
Plub went to work.

17
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,638
There's no one.

18
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,348
Then wait.

19
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,432
How about this?

20
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,267
I will help you.

21
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,979
I'm better now. You don't have to.

22
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,899
I feel considerate. I don't want to use you.

23
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,402
Considerate?

24
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,987
Then let these plants die!

25
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,156
Before you die first than them!

26
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,201
Why are you laughing?!

27
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,994
I'm being serious!

28
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,080
If Plub finds out

29
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,915
she will scold me!

30
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,210
I'm really better now.

31
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,297
You still have a stubborn mouth!

32
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,175
You're still going to be stubborn when you can barely breathe right now!

33
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,095
I'll take care of these plants

34
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,138
Go rest.

35
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,556
Go upstairs. Now.

36
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,390
No.

37
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,393
-I said I will handle it!

38
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,644
Alright.

39
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,063
But.

40
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,065
me being in pain like this

41
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,067
don't tell Plub

42
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,444
I don't want her to stress.

43
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,404
I don't want her to worry about me

44
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,322
Yes, I know.

45
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,657
Good.

46
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,617
You have to look after yourself too.

47
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,493
Understood?

48
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,619
Get lots of rest!

49
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,203
Yeah.

50
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,496
You're worse than a child

51
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,290
Ill give you a spank if I have to!

52
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,751
Ill take care of the plants!

53
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,710
Watch your steps.

54
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,011
Plub.

55
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,597
Are you waiting on me?

56
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:30,978
Sa.

57
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,772
You can go to work.

58
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:36,776
Follow me.

59
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,742
What's going on?

60
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,163
Hey everyone!

61
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,247
Guys!

62
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,582
Urgent news!

63
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,792
What is it?!

64
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,045
Plubpla,

65
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,505
the chairman's girl.

66
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:01,967
asked to be transferred to work with Mr. Peem!

67
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:08,182
I thought Mr, Peem didn't like this girl?

68
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,142
He didn't want her to work here.

69
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,186
And now he wants her to work with him?

70
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:17,525
Are we witnessing a father and son sharing the same woman now?

71
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,111
So who is she gonna choose?

72
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,488
I know right?

73
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,241
Who will she choose?

74
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,118
The father or the son?!

75
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,539
May be both.

76
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,623
Does she have to choose?

77
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,171
I will choose

78
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,465
whoever makes a better offer

79
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,008
I'll choose that person.

80
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,472
Anything else you want to ask?

81
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:16,769
Come on.

82
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,770
Let's go eat.

83
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,897
Why do I have to go?

84
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,358
I have a job for you to do after we finish eating.

85
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,442
I'll waste time.

86
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,318
Come.

87
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,153
Hey!

88
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,071
Wait!

89
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,614
It'll waste time!

90
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,240
What's the hurry?!

91
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:31,867
Let's go eat.

92
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,410
No need to hold my hand!

93
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:38,874
Hey!

94
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,752
I can walk on my own!

95
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,004
You walk slow! I'm in a hurry.

96
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:44,838
I don't walk slow!

97
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,049
Excuse us.

98
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:53,889
Peem!

99
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,604
Let's go!

100
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:01,563
Peem!

101
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,816
I said I'm in a hurry!

102
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,234
I can walk on my own!

103
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,987
Hurry!

104
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,989
It's her first day with him

105
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,616
and they're holding hands going out to eat!

106
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,576
It's not just that.

107
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:19,498
Mr. Peem had them move Plubpla's
desk inside his office too!

108
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,670
I've never seen him like this before.

109
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,629
Yeah.

110
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,966
This feels like someone crazy in love!

111
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,261
May be Plubpla isn't just a toy for him?

112
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,304
But she's the real deal!

113
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,981
Let's go eat.

114
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,866
You're being serious Peem?

115
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,088
Don't misunderstand me.

116
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,133
Peem probably doesn't want me to go work with him.

117
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,219
But there was an emergency.

118
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,265
You shamelessly lied!

119
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,652
Hello Mr. Peem.

120
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,320
Welcome.

121
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:43,957
Have a seat.

122
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,298
May I?

123
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,386
Why don't you tell me

124
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,932
what you will do to win her heart?

125
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,809
It's not hard Tat.

126
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,145
First off, to win a woman's heart like Plubpla,

127
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:07,815
you need to take her out to eat at a very fancy,expensive restaurant.

128
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,817
Who knows,

129
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,735
after we finish eating

130
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,364
I might get some of her

131
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,117
Order.

132
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,078
No matter how expensive it is

133
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,704
I can pay.

134
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,388
You're going to pay?

135
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:41,390
Yes.

136
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,433
This is my friend's restaurant.

137
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,935
I am a shareholder too

138
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,437
What do you want to order? You can order everything

139
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,026
No matter how expensive it is?

140
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:56,488
Sure.

141
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,489
Order.

142
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:06,748
Everyone!

143
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,917
Can I have your attention real quick?

144
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,422
This is Mr. Peem Pattaratrakul,

145
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,965
owner of PP World

146
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,968
Everyone in here should know him already, right?

147
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,347
What are you doing?

148
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,435
Mr, Peem is a shareholder here.

149
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,896
Today is his special day.

150
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:34,985
So he wants to treat everyone tonight!

151
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:42,576
May you enjoy your meals and order as much as you want!

152
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:51,919
What are you doing?

153
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,922
You must feel better now

154
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,132
showing off how rich you are?

155
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,968
I'm going to go eat at the food court now

156
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,305
I won't let you go anywhere

157
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,556
Sit down right now!

158
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,016
That's an order.

159
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:08,518
Hey.

160
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,813
This is my lunch break, Boss

161
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,490
Mr. Peem.

162
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,033
Thank you.

163
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,661
Tell them I'll be back to clear the bill

164
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,912
Sure.

165
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,334
Ms. Plub pla.

166
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,919
Plubpla!

167
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,338
Peem!

168
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,299
Well?

169
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,301
The new name I've given you

170
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,177
do you like it?

171
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,513
I think it suits you.

172
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,473
Plubp la Si!

173
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:49,685
Peem.

174
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,436
A punch for a punch.

175
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,981
That's good.

176
00:12:54,148 --> 00:13:00,487
Because my punch cost you over a hundred thousand.

177
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,698
Pardon me,

178
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,576
that little money won't make my cat at home starve.

179
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:10,831
Plubpla.

180
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,041
Let's go eat.

181
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,127
I don't like eating alone.

182
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,378
Please?

183
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,757
Please? Ms. Plub pla

184
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,634
Please?

185
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,137
Ms. Plub pla, please?!

186
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,110
If you want to eat with me, it only has to be this place.

187
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,751
Is this a prank?

188
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,215
Hey.

189
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:07,137
At the restaurant, you also wanted me to be in an unfamiliar setting

190
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,807
Who told you?

191
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,226
I just want to please you.

192
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,646
Please me?

193
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,397
Yeah.

194
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,150
For what?

195
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,821
Prior to this, we didn't get along much.

196
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,783
If you're going to be working with me

197
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,994
I just want us to get along

198
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,915
You really think that way?

199
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,792
Yeah.

200
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,919
From now on,

201
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,506
let's start over.

202
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,406
I work with you.

203
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,826
I'll only do my job and that's enough

204
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,994
Has anyone told you

205
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,164
you hold grudges?

206
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,916
It's called

207
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,459
lesson learned.

208
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:20,961
Fine.

209
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,922
I'll show you from now on

210
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,258
my cute and adorable side.

211
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,495
Peem Pattaratrakul said that to you?

212
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,330
Adorable side?

213
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,250
Adorable side that belongs in the trash.

214
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,961
It's obvious the closer I get to him the more abnormal he is

215
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,885
But maybe he does like you Plub

216
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,597
What a fairy tale

217
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,015
So make-believe.

218
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,809
How is that possible?

219
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,146
Is that everything?

220
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,648
Yes-Shall we start the Live?

221
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,608
This is yours.

222
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,739
I hope we get 3,000 in sales.

223
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,328
Hello!

224
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:37,829
150,000?!

225
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:42,584
You went out to eat with Plubp la for a day and you spent 150,000?!

226
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:44,794
Something like that.

227
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,926
Did she ordered a golden air fried steak that you had to pay that much?

228
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,178
No.

229
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,097
She had me pay everyone in the restaurant

230
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,562
This girl is really wicked

231
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,314
I like her.

232
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,316
Not funny.

233
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,530
What kind of woman doesn't care about expensive things?

234
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,532
Plus she even took me to go eat at the food court!

235
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,660
Should n't I be pissed?

236
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,705
Food court?!

237
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:25,919
Tat.

238
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,087
Sorry.

239
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,756
I can't help but laugh

240
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:30,966
Hey.

241
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,634
That means

242
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:38,014
Plubpla can't be bought with money like you said

243
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,057
Am I right?

244
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:41,893
Well,

245
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,604
it won't always be the case.

246
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:48,441
I might have to use more money than this.

247
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,028
Do you know what women like?

248
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,284
You're asking a single man like me?

249
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,910
How would I know?

250
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,092
Grandma!

251
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,678
-What dear?
- Hey Grandma!

252
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,387
Huh?

253
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:20,015
I told you not to work

254
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,684
Gosh, I'm just watering the plants.

255
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,853
Let me get some work out done.

256
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,565
Just watering plants?

257
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,774
Don't do other things

258
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,776
Yes, grandchild.

259
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,279
Then...

260
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,947
I'm going to work now.

261
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,324
Go ahead.

262
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,034
Aunt Ta en will come keep you company.

263
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,038
Don't worry about me. May Buddha protect you.

264
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,164
Bye.

265
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,173
Grandma, someone came to buy your plants

266
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,301
So early.

267
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,761
That's great.

268
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,896
Hello, are you here to look at the flowers?

269
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,523
Hello. Are you Ms. Plub pla?

270
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,068
Yes.

271
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:27,374
HER MEL

272
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:29,834
Hey.

273
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,089
What did you bring for me?

274
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,551
Mr. Peem had me bring you handbags to choose from.

275
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,137
For me to choose?

276
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,722
Why do I have to choose?

277
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,599
I don't know.

278
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,436
But he said he will take care of the cost.

279
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,022
What's Mr, Peem trying to do?

280
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,315
Hmm?

281
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,360
It's okay Grandma.

282
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,112
I'll handle this.

283
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,824
I can't accept these.

284
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,909
Please take it back.

285
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,369
I'm sorry

286
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,871
but Mr, Peem paid for all of it already

287
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,624
can't go back unless you pick one

288
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,171
You haven't learned yet?

289
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,678
I really can't choose.

290
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,598
Since Mr, Peem already paid for it

291
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,100
I'll take all of them!

292
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,477
Sure.

293
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,521
Thank you.

294
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,255
Calm down everyone, Calm down

295
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,882
Calm down.

296
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,092
Guys, please calm down.

297
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,720
All of you will get one

298
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,391
What is going on here?

299
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,436
Mr. Peem!

300
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,021
Hello

301
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,775
Is it true you will give bonuses to the employees with handbags?

302
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,443
Is it true?

303
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,195
Since you already bought them

304
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,198
Why don't I hand out the bonuses?

305
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,118
Can I have this one?

306
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,496
First bag, Chanel, suits you.

307
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:30,914
Thank you!

308
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,625
Second bag,

309
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:37,253
luscious green suits you

310
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:43,301
The bold orange suits you

311
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,889
As for this one...

312
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,141
Thank you!

313
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,980
The last bag suits Kwang

314
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,483
-It's okay.
-Just take it.

315
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,902
It's your bonus.

316
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,529
I like the green one!

317
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,075
- Are the bags nice?
-Very!

318
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,788
You're so nice!

319
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,626
Yours is pretty too!

320
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,133
What is this?

321
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,928
Why are the handbags with them?

322
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:27,804
Hey.

323
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,516
Didn't you want me to hand out the bags to the employees?

324
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,061
You delivered it to my house

325
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,898
You wanted me to be the representative to hand out the bags

326
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,569
Next time just tell me what you want

327
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,655
You don't really get it

328
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,907
or you're pretending to be stupid?

329
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,702
You didn't know that it was for you?

330
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,913
Why did you send it to me?

331
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,960
I don't believe you are giving it to me

332
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,753
without wanting something

333
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,338
I can't accept it.

334
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,173
I did this much already

335
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,718
and you still don't know how I feel about you?

336
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,532
I like you.

337
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,045
Why are you laughing?

338
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:44,964
Look Peem.

339
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,634
To be frank,

340
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:52,680
if you told me you want to sleep with me, that is more believable

341
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,015
Hey.

342
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,603
I hear it a lot.

343
00:23:58,729 --> 00:23:59,812
" I love you."

344
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,855
" like you."

345
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,023
" You're the most beautiful person."

346
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:06,110
Those words to certain people don't mean anything

347
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,531
It's just a key that opens the way for women

348
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,660
You think I can't read people?

349
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,246
Between who is sincere and who Just wants to get in bed with me?

350
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,752
I just want to tell you

351
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:27,131
sometimes your money can't buy everything

352
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,092
Okay.

353
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,469
I might have misjudged you

354
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,680
I thought you were just like those women that I've met

355
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:35,139
But from now on,

356
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,141
I will make you believe

357
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,310
that I really like you.

358
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,147
Really?

359
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,692
I'll wait and see.

360
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,236
But it might be difficult.

361
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,113
Because I have a hard time believing people

362
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,329
Hey.

363
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,082
You told her you like her and she still doesn't believe you?!

364
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,751
This girl is tough.

365
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:05,795
Yeah.

366
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,006
She worked with men before.

367
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,090
Probably encountered a lot.

368
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,384
I forgot to think about that.

369
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,928
You telling her you like her

370
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,513
I think that's something

371
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,559
Do you really like her?

372
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,687
The situation forced me into it!

373
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,105
I have no such feelings!

374
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,189
Look.

375
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,899
You don't need to quickly deny it

376
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,192
The quicker you speak

377
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,152
the more it looks unbelievable

378
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:29,777
Understood?

379
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,486
Tat.

380
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,655
I'm kidding!

381
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:33,531
Alright.

382
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,200
You told her you like her but she doesn't like you back.

383
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,201
Now what?

384
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:38,703
Call off the plan?

385
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:39,787
No.

386
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,831
I think this woman

387
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,833
needs something bigger

388
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,376
Like...

389
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,881
Acceptance from society?

390
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,716
Yeah.

391
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,135
Nowadays, the more people know you.

392
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,637
the more chances there are to earn money

393
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,848
If that's the case,

394
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,683
this girl is smart.

395
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,560
Yeah.

396
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,146
So I have to be smarter.

397
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,902
That's good.

398
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,362
Men are a contradictory gender.

399
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,156
When they court women,

400
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,825
they will do everything to get the woman

401
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,369
the quickest, easiest way possible.

402
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,788
But after sleeping with them

403
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,081
they don't want to get married.

404
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,707
They think women are easy.

405
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,919
That's what contradicting about men!

406
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,253
Therefore,

407
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,964
if Peem really likes you,

408
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,674
you can't be easy with him.

409
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,176
Hey.

410
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,513
You sound like you're anti-men.

411
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,973
Aren't you courting one right now?

412
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,018
That's why I have to do the courting!

413
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,437
Why do women have to be the ones chosen?

414
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,105
Am I right?

415
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,482
Okay.

416
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,109
Don't worry about me.

417
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,195
I will never fall for that man's tricks

418
00:26:58,951 --> 00:26:59,992
I have to go.

419
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,832
I have a job for you.

420
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:06,958
Follow me.

421
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,228
Mr. Peem is here

422
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,647
Boss.

423
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:31,899
What is it?

424
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,317
Mr. Peem is here.

425
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:46,539
You had to come survey work at my department store?

426
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,168
I came to see if there's anything else you copied from me

427
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,920
I don't like people copying me again and again

428
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,589
Like someone who doesn't know how to think

429
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:59,552
When it comes to these things, you can't tell who did it first or second.

430
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,680
May be the first person to do it didn't exactly come up with it.

431
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,770
Am I right, Plub?

432
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,817
I can't give you an answer to that.

433
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,320
The judge needs to make that decision.

434
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,075
I really like your answer

435
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:24,660
Straightforward

436
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,953
and sincere.

437
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,875
If it was another subordinate and in front of their boss like this

438
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:35,630
they would try to please their boss to the fullest.

439
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:41,719
But it's a pity.

440
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,472
You should have come work with me instead

441
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,145
Because certain places or people

442
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,357
don't suit a sincere person like you

443
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,359
Sincere?

444
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,945
Who would choose to work because of sincerity?

445
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,364
They would choose a stable place

446
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:07,161
Executives who have visions of not jeopardizing the company

447
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,332
Certain places, executives don't know how to do their jobs

448
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,334
They're only good at copying people's work

449
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,378
That's concerning.

450
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,472
It really is just you

451
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,975
But you still have childish thoughts

452
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:30,476
No wonder,

453
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,311
ever since your dad got sick

454
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,647
and you took over managing.

455
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,607
your department store hasn't improved.

456
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,317
Peem!

457
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,277
Don't.

458
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,861
Please don't argue here.

459
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,155
Yes.

460
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,532
If you fight here,

461
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,367
you'll be in the headlines.

462
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:48,995
Peem.

463
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,080
Let's head back.

464
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,335
Remember Peem,

465
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,838
I will defeat you!

466
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,008
I've been waiting to lose.

467
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,636
But I'm afraid I will be waiting for nothing

468
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,816
Hey Peem.

469
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,235
What are you laughing at?

470
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:23,195
Why?

471
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,156
You're scared I was going to fight Kit?

472
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,657
Well,

473
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,493
you were provoking him. How can I not be scared?

474
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,914
Kit and I aren't teenagers anymore to be using violence

475
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,583
We use our brains now.

476
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,169
Who would have known?

477
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,963
Mr, Vik it seemed like he was going to punch you.

478
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,590
He can't fight me.

479
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,841
I know him well.

480
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,634
His bark is worse than his bite.

481
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:50,806
Hey.

482
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,060
You guys used to be friends?

483
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:56,896
Yeah.

484
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:03,611
So what happened?

485
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,871
It's none of your business.

486
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:17,875
Peem!

487
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,004
You opened a way for me to ask and when I do, you don't answer!

488
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:23,672
Are you crazy?!

489
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,216
Let's go.

490
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,717
We have places to go to

491
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,595
Go where? My shift is almost over!

492
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,179
Follow me.

493
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,514
-I don't want to!
- Just follow me!

494
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,432
-Why do I have to follow?!
-Just follow!

495
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,203
Why did Peem come here?

496
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,707
It's probably about the case.

497
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,543
How's the case going?

498
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,378
Will we win?

499
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,175
You lost to him again?!

500
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,677
Dad.

501
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,180
I did my best.

502
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,601
Try harder!

503
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,772
Loser!

504
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,443
You can't even defeat Peem in this

505
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,237
You shouldn't have been born my son!

506
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,366
Look at Puchong

507
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,535
A lousy useless father

508
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,912
but got a great son.

509
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,459
He's more skillful than my useless son!

510
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,472
The pineapple is very sweet

511
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,140
I bought it to make red curry soup.

512
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,559
So I brought it for you to eat today

513
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,482
Grandma!

514
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,567
Whose car is that?

515
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,654
I don't know.

516
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,241
Peem!

517
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,328
What?

518
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,788
Do you need something?

519
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,373
I came to visit Grandma Thip.

520
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,833
I didn't purposely drop you off.

521
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:30,591
Hi Grandma.

522
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,051
I was wondering who it was

523
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,345
Who is he?

524
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,347
Pl ub's boss.

525
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:40,351
Hello.

526
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,520
How did you two end up coming together?

527
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:46,273
We were working off site today.

528
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,109
I also wanted to come visit you

529
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,112
Grandma, you're strong.

530
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,573
I'm much better now

531
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:55,574
Thank you so much.

532
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,201
Seeing you look healthy

533
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,536
makes me happy

534
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,956
Since you're here.

535
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,042
do you want to stay for dinner?

536
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,754
I'm going to have Plub make pineapple red curry.

537
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,464
I've prepped it for her already

538
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,216
Have you eaten it before?
Yes.

539
00:34:13,592 --> 00:34:14,426
What?

540
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,512
Be considerate of him Grandma

541
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,263
It's inconvenient for him to eat with us.

542
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,974
You start led me.

543
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,059
Who said Grandma?

544
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,686
I'm starving.

545
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,729
Can I join you?

546
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,772
Sure.

547
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,402
Hey Plub.

548
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,611
Is he courting you?

549
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,198
No he's not.

550
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,578
Then why is he doing this?

551
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,955
I don't know. Maybe he likes talking to Grandma.

552
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,749
Funny

553
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:49,461
Young people don't like talking to elders

554
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,754
He's courting you isn't he?

555
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,549
Auntie!

556
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,426
Think whatever you want.

557
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,850
Everything looks delicious.

558
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:06,186
Then you have to eat a lot.

559
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,355
Yes. I'm starving right now

560
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:09,940
Go ahead.

561
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:10,691
Plub!

562
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,359
Serve Mr. Peem some rice

563
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,203
Here Grandma.

564
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,663
Why didn't you give to Mr, Peem first?

565
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,247
It's fine.

566
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,249
It's fine. You can go first.

567
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,835
Thanks.

568
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,048
A lot or a little?

569
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:35,633
Up to you.

570
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:42,890
Tong.

571
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,892
You're home?

572
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:46,727
Tong.

573
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,355
Go wash up, get changed, and come eat.

574
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,273
Not hungry.

575
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,233
I'm sleepy

576
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:55,569
Wait Tong.

577
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:04,953
What?

578
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:06,955
Do you still want a job?

579
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:09,917
What is it?

580
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,253
D

581
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,213
Go to the company.

582
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,632
We're looking for a part time employee for the cafe.

583
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:18,175
Are you interested?

584
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,386
Peem.

585
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:20,928
I think

586
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:21,720
Okay.

587
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,430
Deal.

588
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,483
How is he not courting

589
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,443
He's being so obvious right now.

590
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,070
Oh Yot!

591
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:40,364
You have a scary competition now.

592
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:43,992
Peem!

593
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,539
Yes?

594
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,166
Why didn't you tell me

595
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,168
you were going to offer a job to my brother?

596
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,130
He's an adult.

597
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:57,548
He should think for himself.

598
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,135
But...

599
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,637
I'm his guardian.

600
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:05,597
You should tell me first.

601
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,016
So I can help him think it through

602
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:12,146
You really don't trust him like he said.

603
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:15,190
No wonder he looks uncomfortable

604
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,817
and not be himself.

605
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,695
How would you know my brother better than I do?

606
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,239
I'm a man like him.

607
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,241
I can see right through him

608
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,411
This is my family's affair.

609
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,038
You don't know the real reason so you shouldn't criticize me.

610
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:30,914
Okay.

611
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,249
I won't get involve.

612
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,917
But let me warn you,

613
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,003
people can't survive

614
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:38,297
if they feel worthless.

615
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,592
Don't let your brother be like that.

616
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:18,504
Yot!

617
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:21,423
You're here so early

618
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,341
What's up?

619
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,722
came to take you to work

620
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,307
It's fine.

621
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,934
I feel considerate. I can go on my own.

622
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,603
Don't you have to turn back around to get to your job?

623
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:36,772
Plub

624
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,484
I don't like it when you say you feel considerate of me.

625
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,237
It's true.

626
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,572
I've bothered you with so many problems already

627
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:46,907
How can I not be considerate?

628
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,117
Besides,

629
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,664
if it was someone else I think they would stop being friends with me

630
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:57,084
Yot.

631
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:57,835
Hmm?

632
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,170
However you feel about Plub

633
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,922
you should quickly tell her

634
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,757
Don't just wait around.

635
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,176
I don't want to be your friend.

636
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,682
I can't keep this feeling inside any more Plub

637
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,392
I like you.

638
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,477
For a long time now.

639
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,981
You don't need to answer me right now.

640
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:23,235
I want you to think about this carefully

641
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,074
Plub.

642
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,078
Give me a chance

643
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:34,705
From now on,

644
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:39,501
I want you to get to know me as a man who isn't your friend

645
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,462
Can you do that?

646
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,133
I will try.

647
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,358
You really know how to use your charm

648
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,410
Oh it's you.

649
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:14,870
Why are you startled?

650
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,123
Did you not want me to see a man dropping you off?

651
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,125
It's not that.

652
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:26,882
I'm just wondering why the chairman is acting like a thief in the corner of the building like this

653
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,718
You're good at retort ing.

654
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,511
Has anyone told you that?

655
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:32,888
No.

656
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,391
If we're done here, I need to get to work.
