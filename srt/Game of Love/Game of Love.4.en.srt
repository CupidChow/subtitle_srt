1
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,519
Our spy who is the driver told me that

2
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,679
the chairman ordered to find a position in the company for this woman.

3
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,799
Other people will look at me like a product,

4
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,799
a money maker, I don't care!

5
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,399
Not someone in my family!

6
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,439
that the pathway for poor people is filled with gravel

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,719
just want a day

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,799
where I can walk a smooth path.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,279
The woman named Plubpla really did come apply for a job

10
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,199
Are you shocked to see my face?

11
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,199
Are you afraid of something?

12
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,759
No.

13
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,239
I thought you were afraid that I might know you're an epo baby.

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,599
Did you misunderstand something?

15
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,879
I came here to apply for a job on my own

16
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,399
I didn't use any connections.

17
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,919
Better be true

18
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,999
Ready for your interview?

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,479
Yes.

20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,639
Have a seat

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,199
From your profile

22
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,079
you've done a lot of jobs

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,399
That's right.

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,719
Because I'm responsible for all the expenses in my house

25
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,439
So I have to work a lot of jobs.

26
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,959
To put it simple,

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,758
you do everything for money

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,719
Well,

29
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,399
not everything

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,519
With certain things even though it's a lot of money,

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,999
I won't do it.

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,639
Why do you want the manager position at the cafe?

33
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,079
Because I like drinking i coffee.

34
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,199
Also, I've worked at a cafe before sol think

35
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,759
I have enough knowledge in this field quite a bit.

36
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,039
But this job is hard and tiring

37
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,359
You would have to take care of the customers closely.

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,039
Are you confident that you can do that?

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,759
l am confident

40
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,359
that I have the heart of service.

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,439
That, I believe.

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,599
I believe that you

43
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,599
must've had a lot of experience in service work

44
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,799
Yes.

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,439
I'll consider that

46
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,799
a compliment.

47
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,279
But you don't have a bachelor's degree.

48
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,279
How do you think

49
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,279
you're suited for this position?

50
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,039
In the application

51
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,399
education level isn't required.

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,279
I think I have the right to apply

53
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,639
I didn't ask if you have the right or not to apply.

54
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,759
I asked if you think you are suited for this job or not.

55
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,239
My cafe brand

56
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,199
is high-end.

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,199
Yes.

58
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,719
If I wasn't confident, I wouldn't have come.

59
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,999
But I don't think you are.

60
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,599
Do you know why

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,919
I don't think so?

62
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,999
Because you

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,079
have had an inappropriate job before.

64
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,559
Later,customers will think that my cafe is a dishonorable place.

65
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,999
The customers you have served

66
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,159
might misunderstand that my cafe

67
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,199
have additional special services.

68
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,559
This is the vision of an award-winning global businessman?

69
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,199
Miss!

70
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,919
It's fine.

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,639
I want to hear her opinion

72
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,239
What era are we in?

73
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,159
People who are well-off don't discriminate others based on occupations

74
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,359
And no matter what profession you choose,
you should not be looked down upon.

75
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,398
You misunderstood

76
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,559
I'm not looking down on these professions.

77
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,279
But I'm looking down on the actions.

78
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,959
People who work to earn money isn't wrong.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,319
But those who hope to make money from money they didn't earn

80
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,839
now that's despicable

81
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,679
I never expect money from anyone.

82
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,479
I don't believe your words.

83
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,919
I believe your actions.

84
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,839
Fine.

85
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,119
I'll show you then.

86
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,159
You were trying to provoke her in front of the directors.

87
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,079
You're bad.

88
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,319
I can't help it.

89
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,959
I must prevent it to the fullest extent.

90
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,519
My company will go into chaos if we hire this woman.

91
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,439
Where is she?

92
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,279
Hey, they're hiring her?

93
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,319
-Yes.
-What?!

94
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,079
Where are you going?

95
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,599
I want to go see that shameless girl

96
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,399
who dare use Puchong's name to apply for a job here

97
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,479
Scared karma will catch up to you?

98
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,959
Weren't you like this woman?

99
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,279
Hello Mr. Puchong

100
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,559
am a public relations employee at the company

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,879
You dare bring that prostitute to work at the company?!

102
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,439
Are you not afraid our clients will think of the company as a brothel?!

103
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,879
I don't care where you take her to fool around at.

104
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,599
But you brought her to work at the company!

105
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,119
Isn't that too much?!

106
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,079
Why are you shallow-minded like this?

107
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,839
Sup ang just want to change herself.

108
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,039
She just wants to have a good job.

109
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,639
Why don't you give other people chances?

110
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,799
You got her pregnant?!

111
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,599
If I wasn't thinking of Pete

112
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,999
or the company's name,

113
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,959
I would have hired that woman in an instant.

114
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,679
Because l want to see karma catch up to you too.

115
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,599
Jerk!

116
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,639
This is such a prank!

117
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,999
I shouldn't have come!

118
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,479
I won't get the job if he's interviewing me himself like this!

119
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,839
Hello.

120
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,079
I'm so happy you called!

121
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,239
I am looking for a job

122
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,279
I want to thankyouverymuch

123
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,519
for being a tour guide for my client like this.

124
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,519
What is this?

125
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,039
You're the one that's always finding jobs for me.

126
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,799
Otherwise I would be in trouble.

127
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,279
You're exaggerating

128
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,239
If you didn't help me, I would be in trouble too.

129
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,079
I don't know what's the matter with kids these days.

130
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,279
Those easy jobs

131
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,519
where they detriment their bodies and get lots of money for it, they take it.

132
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,079
Jobs taking care of customers like this,

133
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,199
it's little pay so they don't take it.

134
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,399
That's good.

135
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,799
More jobs for me.

136
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,839
Look at you!

137
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,239
So that...

138
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,839
job interview,

139
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,999
how did it go? You think you'll get it?

140
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,359
Not a chance.

141
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,279
Why is that?

142
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,719
Well...

143
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,039
it's a long story.

144
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,359
I had a good opportunity like other people

145
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,439
but Satan got in the way.

146
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,079
Oh Plub! You're such a fighter!

147
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,319
If you need help with anything,

148
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,199
you can call me any time. Happy to help.

149
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,239
Sure.

150
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,759
Tell me if there's any job for me to do.

151
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,719
Sure!

152
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,639
I need the money to go pay him back as soon as possible.

153
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,479
Sure. No problem

154
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,799
Thank you.

155
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,279
Think about it.

156
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,919
What crazy woman had so many jobs?

157
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,159
These resumes

158
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,959
can be made up by lots of people

159
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,279
What if the truth

160
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,719
Plubpla isn't a bad woman like you think she is?

161
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,039
You're softening up to this woman now?

162
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,319
No.

163
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,079
I was just thinking

164
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,999
may be we're destroying a good opportunity

165
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,599
for a woman who's struggled all her life

166
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,559
Hi Fred!

167
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,359
Hey!

168
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,399
How are you today?

169
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,319
Great! Thank you!

170
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,999
Plu b!
Suthee!

171
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,239
Hi.

172
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,519
Su thee.

173
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,599
Your tour guide here is great!

174
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,119
Really?

175
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,639
Yeah.

176
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,839
I'm glad that you like my sister.

177
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,639
Whoa!

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,199
She's your sister?

179
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,799
Yes.

180
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,759
What a surprise!

181
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,039
Su thee.

182
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,439
Hmm?

183
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,999
I'm working for Cha Cha

184
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,399
I didn't know

185
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,119
Mr. Fred is your client.

186
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,799
Oh, this is his first time in Thailand.

187
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,199
So I want him to be impressed with Thailand.

188
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,159
Oh.

189
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,599
Wow.

190
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,439
I'm very impressed with her. Very impressed

191
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,359
Can I go use the restroom real quick?

192
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,799
You can discuss business with him then.

193
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,079
Okay. Thanks.

194
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,279
Oh!

195
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,799
Peem.

196
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,559
Lately our worlds

197
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,559
have been colliding

198
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,239
I think it's you

199
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,359
that's trying to step foot in my world

200
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,839
You...

201
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,599
are still self-absorbed j like you always have been

202
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,719
I'm being truthful

203
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,639
Like with your company

204
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,159
copying my product.

205
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,239
Unless

206
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,999
I should be happy

207
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,159
that I didn't think to the extent

208
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,279
that you sent your subordinate

209
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,399
to copy me

210
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,399
Hey!

211
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,879
The case isn't over yet.

212
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,759
How do you know who copied who?!

213
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,279
Who did what

214
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,359
knows it in their heart.

215
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,519
Sir!

216
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,119
Is something wrong?

217
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,599
It's you.

218
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:34,959
My...

219
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,759
My heart is relapsing again.

220
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,279
Huh?!

221
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,159
So what do you want me to do?

222
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,479
Do you want me to call an ambulance?

223
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,799
That's okay

224
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,519
Take me

225
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,519
to that room

226
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,799
I have my medication in my bag.

227
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,839
If I take the medicine.

228
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,079
I would feel better.

229
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,839
Okay fine.

230
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,799
Hey. Hey.

231
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,199
I'll take you.

232
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,679
Can you manage?

233
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,279
Yes.

234
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,599
This way.

235
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,279
Can you manage?

236
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,479
To put it simple,

237
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,159
you do everything for money

238
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,879
Not everything.

239
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,039
With certain things even though it's a lot of money,

240
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,799
I won't do it.

241
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,399
Here's your medicine, Mr. Vi kit.

242
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,519
Do you feel better?

243
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,479
I feel better.

244
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,119
Thank you so much.

245
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,559
Sure.

246
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,879
In that case...

247
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,359
Wait.

248
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,359
To repay you,

249
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,799
do you want to drink with me?

250
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,239
That's okay.

251
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,799
I'm work --

252
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,439
I have another client in another room

253
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,519
That's fine.

254
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,839
I'll repay you some other time then.

255
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,199
It's really okay.

256
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,359
I can't.

257
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,719
I don't want to owe anyone.

258
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,159
Thank you.

259
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,319
Okay.

260
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,319
Excuse me then

261
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,559
Do you want to come have fun in my room?

262
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,479
Who knows, may be tonight Plubpla

263
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,799
might soften up to you.

264
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,839
Entertain or VIP work today?

265
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,959
Peem.

266
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,399
You're someone of two worlds

267
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,799
During the day,you talk all smart and is pleasant to listen to.

268
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,599
But during the night,

269
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,879
you do relaxing jobs where you don't have to use your brain.

270
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,119
You're skillful.

271
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,519
You take both hard and easy jobs.

272
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,559
You're good at selling. Did you find one today?

273
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,479
A client who enjoys the taste of you

274
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,959
who is willing to pay you monthly.

275
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,599
What the hell is wrong with you?!

276
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,679
Always picking fights with me nonstop!

277
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,239
That's true.

278
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,399
It's my job

279
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,519
to choose people to come work at my company.

280
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,119
Not someone who deceives men and only wants their money!

281
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,759
I don't want that.

282
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,199
If my clients know I hired someone like that,

283
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,599
they will think my company

284
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,639
is a brothel.

285
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,759
Look Peem!

286
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,959
I don't care if you won't hire me!

287
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,679
But you have no right to speak ill of me!

288
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,359
You have no right to criticize me for what l didn't do!

289
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,919
You have a dirty heart!

290
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,919
Peem.

291
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,639
Did the toilet clogged up or what?

292
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,919
You have a sullen face

293
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,239
Do you know who I ran into?

294
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,159
Who?

295
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,679
The pitiful Plu bp la of yours!

296
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,598
I saw her serving Kit here.

297
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,359
Really?!

298
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,279
I thought she repented.

299
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,679
Tell HR

300
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,319
to take this girl's name out.

301
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,479
I won't authorize it.

302
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,719
Sure.

303
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,799
Let's go home!

304
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,559
Peem. Hey!

305
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:37,919
Excuse me!

306
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:39,919
Peem!

307
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,839
I was right.

308
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,119
What kind of good woman would do that kind of job to detriment herself?

309
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,679
What the majority of them would do

310
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,839
is hoping to get rich the short cut way.

311
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,879
A pitiful heroine does it to survive?

312
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,239
That's a TV drama!

313
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,479
Gosh, just forget about her.

314
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,199
Who cares what she does?

315
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,159
That's her body and career.

316
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,199
I won't get involved

317
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,439
if this woman didn't come to my company

318
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,719
and also mess with my dad.

319
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,319
Thank you 3477

320
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,479
3103477

321
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,039
Wait.

322
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,799
That was...

323
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,199
Mr, Su thee,owner of a construction company

324
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,319
that will be collaborating with us.

325
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,039
Only trapping rich men.

326
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,639
You see? It has n't been that long and she has a new client already

327
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,839
If I hire her,

328
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,279
our reputation will be tarnished.

329
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,719
You're home?

330
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,759
You're not asleep yet?

331
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,879
I was waiting for you

332
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,439
Why are you home late today?

333
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,799
Oh well..

334
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,399
Hmm?

335
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,919
It's just that...

336
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,279
had a dinner banquet with clients

337
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,999
Then you must be drunk.

338
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,679
Let me shower for you.

339
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,319
Tre!

340
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,399
It's okay.

341
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,839
I can do it myself.

342
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,399
Thank you.

343
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,559
But today I want...

344
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,239
I want to shower for you

345
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,639
Tre!

346
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,919
Don't.

347
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,199
I can do it myself. Really

348
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,919
I'm going to go shower now.

349
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,959
Tre.

350
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,119
Yes?
-Tre.

351
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,039
Did you tell Plu b

352
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,759
to pay me back within a week?

353
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,079
Plu b snitched on me?

354
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,719
No.

355
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,319
But my company

356
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,839
hired someone to entertain my foreign client

357
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,359
I coincidentally ran into Plu b.

358
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,879
When she got paid, she gave me the money.

359
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,199
That's how I know.

360
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,639
That's right. I told her.

361
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,839
I felt considerate of you

362
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,399
I told you not to be

363
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,559
Did you know by telling her that.

364
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,919
she has to take on these entertainment jobs?

365
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,599
Gosh!

366
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,319
Don't worry about her!

367
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,119
Plu b has been doing these jobs since she was 18 and 19

368
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,879
You should be concern about your sister a little

369
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,599
Yes.

370
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,799
Well,

371
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,039
I'm going to go shower now.

372
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,719
You should go to sleep.

373
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,599
Su thee!

374
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,839
Plu b!

375
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,599
Now do you know Dad

376
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,599
that you can't do as you please

377
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,319

378
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,079
It's 160 baht but I'll charge you 150

379
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,279
Thank you!

380
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,479
What plant do you want today?

381
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,759
What do you want?

382
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,359
For three, I'll only charge you 100

383
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,959
Tong.

384
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,239
Where are you going?

385
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,279
School, Grandma.

386
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,359
Oh, classes started already?

387
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,119
Wait.

388
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,679
That means you've registered for classes already

389
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,239
Yeah.

390
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,599
Within this week.

391
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,919
I wired you your tuition money.

392
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,479
Stay focus in school little brother

393
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,079
I will quickly graduate

394
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,399
So you won't have to struggle.

395
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,119
Bye.

396
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,359
Well Plu b?

397
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,439
WER Hearing him say that

398
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,079
do you feel less tired?

399
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,359
Of course.

400
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:24,919
WER Good.

401
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,399
Hi Grandma

402
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,919
What plant do you want?

403
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,679
Variegated ones.

404
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,799
Variegated ones? Not flowering ones?

405
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,439
I have some.
-Can I see?

406
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,519
Hello.

407
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,279

408
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:41,999
Peem!

409
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,479
Yeah?
-Peem!

410
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,879
Do you know about the new employee yet?

411
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,919
I do.

412
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,479
My dad's nepo kid

413
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,359
didn't pass her interview so she won't get hired

414
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,199
That's a miss for my dad.

415
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,239
Yes she didn't pass the interview.

416
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,999
But your dad didn't miss.

417
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,479
What do you mean?

418
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,839
There is an announcement of appointing

419
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,279
Plu b pla to be your dad's other secretary.

420
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,439
Secretary?!

421
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,359
Work hard and make the most

422
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,839
of the opportunity given to you.

423
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,119
Yes.

424
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,239
Thank you.

425
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,959
I need to talk to you, Dad

426
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,039
In private.

427
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,799
Komsan.

428
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,079
Look after and show my new secretary the ropes around here.

429
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,319
If you need anything, just let Komsan know.

430
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,839
Speak.

431
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,519
How could you hire this woman

432
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,119
to come work here?

433
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,399
Come this way, Ms. Plub pla.

434
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,119
She's my new secretary How are you involved?

435
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,119
I am involved!

436
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,239
The CEO's secretary

437
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,439
must be the face of the company,no?

438
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,239
Plu bp la can be the face of the company.

439
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,039
No damage done there

440
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,279
There is damage Dad.

441
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,919
You already know what kind of jobs she's done in the past!

442
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,239
So?!

443
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,279
Because you think this way, that's why you never gave anyone a chance!

444
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,279
A chance?

445
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,719
Give her a chance like you gave Su over ten years ago?!

446
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,959
She's become my step mother now

447
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,959
that my mother couldn't tolerate anymore

448
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,239
and had to run off!

449
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,279
Our family is like this

450
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,839
is because of you!
Stop talking Peem!

451
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,479
I'll tell you something.

452
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,279
I might not like Su

453
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,439
but l don't want Pete to encounter what I've encountered!

454
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,319
If you are adamant about this woman working here,

455
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,639
I will be the person toget her fired!

456
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,639
Just you wait and see!

457
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,639
Peem.

458
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,959
Cancel all my appointments today.

459
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,319
Tell the people at the shipyard to prepare a boat for me too

460
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,239
Sure.

461
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,679
Puchong hired that girl to be his secretary?!

462
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,559
Yes.

463
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,239
I heard Mr, Peem intervened her interview

464
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,159
that HR couldn't hire her to be the cafe'smanager

465
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,279
So Mr. Puchong hired her to be his secretary instead.

466
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,319
Where is she right now?!

467
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,599
This is your desk.

468
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,279
Okay.

469
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,559
Hey.

470
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,559
Ill go find the documents for the initial procedures for new employees for you

471
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,759
You sit here.

472
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,519
Sure.

473
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,919
Finally,

474
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,879
I have a good job

475
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,559
I hope this job can make Grandma and Tong

476
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,039
have a better life

477
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,159
You.

478
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,959
Since you chose your own path.

479
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,079
you need to be able to accept

480
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,359
that from now on,

481
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,839
your life will never be at peace.

482
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,599
ASSISTANT EXECU I SECRET AN

483
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,559
SECRETARY

484
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,719
Why are you here?!

485
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,759
You're finally awake?

486
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,679
From now on,

487
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,199
my son and I

488
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,719
will come live here

489
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,879
as your father's wife and son.

490
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,719
Oh, Peem.

491
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,039
Dad.

492
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,959
What is this?

493
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,799
He's your brother.

494
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,519
He recently was born.

495
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,239
She has no one to help raise him.

496
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,479
Sol have to bring her to come live with us until your mother returns.

497
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,399
This is why

498
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,639
Mom left and refused to come back!

499
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,599
Your mother took off on her own!

500
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,039
You can't blame me for it!

501
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,799
What do you want me to do?

502
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,639
Abandon your brother?

503
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,759
Look at your brother, Peem

504
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,799
He's so tiny and adorable

505
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,879
From now on,

506
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,119
you can call me "mom ".

507
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,639
So other people won't know

508
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,199
that you

509
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,959
got abandoned by your mother.

510
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,959
Please watch over us, Peem.

511
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,079
We will soon be one family.

512
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,599
Okay?

513
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,199
Don't touch me.

514
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,119
I hate women like you the most!

515
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,199
You're disgusting!

516
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,239
Hey!

517
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,039
You're being more aggressive by the minute!

518
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,919
How can you speak to an elder like this?

519
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,039
Why can't I?

520
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,639
Since it's true!

521
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,159
If you didn't mess with this woman, Mom wouldn't be hurt and run away like that!

522
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,519
If something bad happens to Mom,

523
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,559
it will be all your fault!

524
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,079
Ohmygod! My goodness!

525
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,759
Gosh, what is this?!

526
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,599
People these days.

527
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,639
-My goodness!
-Let me help

528
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,719
Thank you so much young man.

529
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,079
Thank you.

530
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,679
The wheel came off

531
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,879
I guess I've been using it a lot.

532
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,159
I'll try putting it back on.

533
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,639
Are you in a hurry?

534
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,999
It's okay young man.

535
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,999
The tuk tuk l called will be here soon.

536
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,039
It's okay.

537
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,999
Okay, let's go under the shade and I'll fix it for you.

538
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,999
Okay, Thank you so much.

539
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,919
All done Granny!

540
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,959
Thank you so much

541
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,999
Such a trouble for you

542
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,599
No trouble at all.

543
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,039
I fix the wheels on my luggage all the time.

544
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,839
Oh really? You're skillful

545
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,639
Are you waiting for your girlfriend?

546
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,519
No.

547
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,399
Just getting fresh air

548
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,919
and letting the wind hit my face to bring me back to my senses.

549
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,479
Son, do you know

550
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,639
when I'm in a bad mood

551
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,439
I like coming here to stare at the river

552
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,479
and let myself calm down.

553
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,479
Then Iim no longer pissed.

554
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,279
You're in a good mood and also

555
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,959
use slang words

556
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,479
I have teenage grandchildren

557
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,279
so I have to adjust myself to their generation.

558
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,919
Yes.

559
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,159
Do you want to know

560
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,919
what my secret is to help stay in a good mood?

561
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,759
Yes.

562
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,439
When I'm really suffering

563
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,359
I like to stay still and know where my hand placement is at.

564
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,879
Why?

565
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,519
It's a question l got from the monks.

566
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,959
If we know where our hand placement is at,

567
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,239
how our demeanor is,

568
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,239
that means you are able to get your senses back

569
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,999
It reminds us

570
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:22,999
we are only living in the present.

571
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,079
Living in the present?

572
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,319
Yes.

573
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,559
Because this suffering comes from a clouded mind from the past

574
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,959
So it makes us unhappy.

575
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,359
Thank you Grandma.

576
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,479
Talking to you

577
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,198
makes me feel at ease.

578
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,919
I feel at ease too.

579
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,319
When you have free time,

580
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,119
stop by my flower shop.

581
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,879
It's on the other side of the river and ask them

582
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,319
for Grand ma Thip's flower shop.

583
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,039
They all know me there.

584
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,239
Sure.

585
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,319
When I have free time,

586
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,199
I will stop by.

587
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,439
Come by.

588
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,039
Yes.

589
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,919
I have to go now before my tuk tuk waits for me.

590
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,679
Do you want me to drop you off?

591
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,679
That's okay. I can go home myself.

592
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,479
Remembers on,

593
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,359
live in the present more.

594
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,399
Your heart will be at ease.

595
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,639
Yes Grandma

596
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,559
Remember that.

597
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:26,999
Okay.

598
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,519
Thank you.

599
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,719
Since you chose your own path,

600
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,879
you need to be able to accept

601
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,199
that from now on,

602
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,559
your life will never be at peace.

603
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,639
Your threats can't do anything to me!

604
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,479
Plubpla.

605
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,879
Don't pay attention to threats coming from that kind of person.

606
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,279
You need to fight!

607
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,599
Fight! You got this!

608
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,719
Got it?!

609
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,159
Huh?

610
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,999
Here's my internship paperwork.

611
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,599
The hotel auction in Phuket,

612
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,279
I'll let you handle it.

613
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,079
Okay.

614
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,959
Sir.

615
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,679
And in terms of welcoming Mr.
Zhang before the official meeting?

616
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,319
You're right.

617
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,919
I think that's important too

618
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,999
This time, we need to make an impression to Mr. Zhang.

619
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,999
to help him decide to become our partner for our project in Vietnam.

620
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,719
Mm.

621
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:41,119
In that case,please tell Su to have the PR department arrange someone to take care of it

622
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,119
But I think

623
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,359
you already have the right person for this job nearby.

624
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,279
Why don't you send her to handle this matter?

625
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,279
It will show them that we care.

626
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,359
Who are you referring to?

627
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,719
Im referring to the person who has abilities in this specific area.

628
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,359
You just hired her.

629
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,879
Who knows, if this is a success,

630
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,239
everyone might accept the skills of your new secretary.

631
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,639
The reason you suggested the chairman

632
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,039
to send Plu b pla to look after Mr. Zhang,

633
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,919
you have a plan don't you?

634
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,359
Think about it.

635
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,999
That nepokid Plubpla that the chairman hired himself

636
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,999
gets to do an important job like this

637
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,599
who wouldn't be the most satisfied?

638
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,799
What?!

639
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,639
She just started working here

640
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,559
and they gave her an important task to do already?!

641
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,759
Yes, I heard the other employees gossiping

642
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,559
So I quickly came to inform you

643
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,679
This is too much!

644
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,359
Are you stepping over my head now Puchong?!

645
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,399
Send someone to look after Plu bp la and her family

646
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,479
In case Sup ang does something too violent

647
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,999
and we can help them in time.

648
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,719
What's your deal?

649
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,279
You want to prank her

650
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,279
but you're also worried about her safety?

651
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,999
You're contradicting.

652
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:28,999
Hmm?

653
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,159
Okay, I'll handle it for you.

654
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,799
I really want to know

655
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,719
if Plubpla meets my stepmother,

656
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,999
how will she defeat her?
