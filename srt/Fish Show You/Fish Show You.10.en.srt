Haven't you seen the news online?

Didn't you just admit your
relationship with Yu Sheng indirectly,

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,910
which made Yu Sheng look like a cheater?

00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,270
I didn't.

That's right.

You have to ask Xin Qing about that.

Maybe she meant it literally.

153

Perhaps her relationship didn't go well.

with Yu Sheng.

156

However, it's very obvious
from what Xin Qing implied.

157

Does Yu Sheng have anything to say

That's right. Give us an explanation.

That's right.

I already promised Xin Qing

510
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,310
to file a lawsuit against Xia La

511
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,000
and take back her own asset.

512

So,

513

can you

514

517

However...

518
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,430
After the accident of Shang Zhan,

519
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,400
the first heir was changed to Xia La.

520
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,310
Also, Zhuang Xiaoqiao
already lost the first trial.

521
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
She's not satisfied with the result.

522
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,000
She appealed. The second trial
will start at the end of the month.

523
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,430
That's why she was trying

524
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,280
to get publicity on the Internet

525
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,350
so that she can win the court case.

526
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,590
Yu Sheng is quite unfortunate

527
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,520
to have become a victim suddenly.

We, the humans?

There's only one word

I'm sorry.

It's okay. I didn't take it to heart.

Are you forgiving me for real?

If it weren't for this,

553
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,160
it would have been hard for me
to confirm Zixin's feelings.

Are you afraid of me staying

or are you afraid I'll get publicity
in another scandal?

Then you can't do as you want anymore.

he'd write us a will every year.

My mother and I were
ahead of you every year.

However, why was the first heir suddenly

changed to you in the year
of his accident?

583

Who's the one faking it?

584
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,590
You're none other than
an illegitimate daughter.

585
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,000
Your mother is just an ex.

586
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,190
Can she compare to someone

who shared the same bed
with him for years?

588

Do you still remember you
shared the same bed with him?

589

After all these years,

you could even do such a thing.

haunt you in your dreams at night?

I checked.

677
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,350
Wang Youming has a fiancée
named Li Xinyi.

678
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,560
They have a deep relationship.

679
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,310
Li Xinyi has been working
in E-Changxiang for years

680
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,040
but has never got promoted

681
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,710
because she's being
suppressed by Xia La.

682
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,680
She then came to
Jiangnan Film and Television.

683
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,830
However, she still can't get
rid of Xia La's suppression.

684
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,590
Li Xinyi

685
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,760
should be a chance for us.

686
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,680
She can be.

687
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,000
From what I know,

688
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,470
Li Xinyi isn't treated
nicely in the company.

689
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:50,800
Okay.

690
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,520
Let's target Li Xinyi.

691
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,160
Tianmin.

692
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,160
Help me to settle
Xin Qing's court case first.

693
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,680
Won't Ling Zhi be suspicious

694
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,680
if he knows you're helping Xin Qing?

695
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,400
So we have to be extra cautious.

696
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,430
Moreover, Ling Zhi has
started to doubt me.

697
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,110
However, don't worry.

698
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,070
I have my way.

699
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,190
Okay.

700
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,470
I have copied everything for you.

701
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:10,910
Okay.

702
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,950
All right, we'll leave first.

703
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:13,800
Okay, bye.

704
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,360
Bye.

705
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,870
Sister.

706
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,800
Please sit.

707
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,560
Makeup artist, help us out.

708
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,760
I just met Tianmin.

709
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,360
You should have known everything.

710
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,080
The assistant of Xia La
had an emergency.

711
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,390
Xia La brought her here.

712
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,910
Xia La has an extremely
bad attitude toward Xinyi.

713
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
Isn't that good?

714
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,520
We have to get her no matter what.
