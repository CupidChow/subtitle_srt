Oh my...

20
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,270
He turned old so much.

21
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,680
What's wrong with you?

Isn't Yu Jiao with you?

It's all right. I'll

No one is answering.

That's right, I thought so too.

Zixin.

46
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,320
He is not a human.

47
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,110
Do you know what he is?

48
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,160
Anyway, this is how things are.

49
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,960
They won't hurt you.

50
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
It's still absurd.

51
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,440
Who else knows about this?

52
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,800
Zixin and you for now.

53
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,360
I'm telling you.

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,270
Actually, aside from that,

55
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,440
they're no different from
ordinary human beings.

56
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,600
Ordinary human beings?

57
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,960
He's not even a human, okay?

58
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,960
You have the guts

59
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,190
to pretend as a human
to act in a drama series.

60
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,600
You too.

61
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,630
You covered for him

62
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,190
to the extent that he's
shown on the big screen.

63
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,360
What were you thinking?

64
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,110
Have you gone nuts?

65
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,960
Let me ask you.

66
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,830
You have known Yu Jiao
for quite some time now.

67
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,550
Do you think she's different
from an ordinary human being?

68
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,670
That's not okay either.

69
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,960
He cannot continue to pretend
to be a human anymore.

70
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,510
That cannot be.

71
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,670
I promised Zixin

72
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,670
that I'd always stay by her side.

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,410
Ji Fanyi, I beg of you.

74
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,440
Don't reveal this.

75
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,320
Do you plan to continue to hide

76
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,390
this thing all along?

77
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,440
What if anyone finds out

78
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,390
about his identity in the future?

79
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,160
We'll leave that to the future.

80
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,200
It's not now anyway.

81
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,600
Okay.

82
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,350
I can keep the secret,

83
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,510
but you two must break up.

84
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,550
Ji Fanyi, this is between Zixin and me.

85
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,320
- Who are you?
- Don't come near me!

86
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,040
It's because you're not
an ordinary human being.

87
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,670
Regarding this matter,

88
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,320
either you two break up

89
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,440
or I'll get the word out.

90
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,200
There are only these two options.

91
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,790
Do you have to do this?

92
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,110
I'm doing this for your own good.

93
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,390
How dare you say it's for her sake.

94
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,200
Don't you come near me!

95
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,550
Let him calm down for some time.

96
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,670
What about Yu Jiao?

97
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,720
Are you not going to tell her
what happened today?

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,390
Okay.

99
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,510
She's mentally deficient now.

100
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,110
I'm afraid it'll only cause
a problem if I tell her now.

101
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,480
Then,

102
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,720
we can only wait until her
energy crystal is fully restored.

103
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,720
Good morning.

104
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,600
Good morning.

Take Xia La's part.

107
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,480
Okay.

108
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,950
Are you going to do laundry?

109
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,790
Aren't you handling the administration
of your company?

110
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,720
How did you become Xia La's assistant?

111
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,230
Ms. Xia trusts me and gives me a chance.

112
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,510
That's right.

113
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,160
If you can do the work
of an assistant well,

114
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,440
you can basically do any work.

115
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,110
Actually I have been observing
you for the last two days.

116
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,200
I think you can really endure hardship.

117
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,070
Our company happens to need
an administrative supervisor.

118
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,640
Are you interested in it?

119
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,950
Thank you,

120
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,110
but I don't plan to get another job.

121
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,640
Zixin.

122
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,320
Let me bring you to a place.

123
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,390
Where is it?

124
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,200
You'll know it if you follow me.

125
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,110
Yanzi, help me to take this.

126
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,880
Okay.

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,200
Why did you take me here?

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,550
We are here only 500m
away from our hotel.

129
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,670
I've already bought the house above.

130
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,790
Before the shooting wraps up,

131
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,830
you'll stay here.

132
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,510
Why?

133
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,830
Can't I stay in the hotel?

134
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,350
Don't you know the reason?

135
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,510
You must keep a distance from Yu Sheng.

136
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,350
After this drama series is filmed,

137
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,720
you'll have to follow me to
where you came from.

138
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,000
Can you not make decisions for me?

139
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,880
I already gave you choices yesterday.

140
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,200
I already made a choice.
I chose Yu Sheng.

141
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,320
Just get the word out if you want.

142
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,070
What do you like about him anyway?

143
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,040
He's a monster.

144
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,830
He's not!

145
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,760
What was it that I saw yesterday?

146
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,670
He is just a neighbor

147
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,790
on the opposite planet who
is stranded on our planet.

148
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,270
Okay.

149
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,110
I can pretend that I don't know

150
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,760
the existence of Yu Sheng,

151
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,760
but I'll never allow you
two to be together,

152
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,070
because you two are
not even the same kind!

153
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,550
The world is big. There are
many wondrous things.

154
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,040
If you don't accept him, it doesn't
mean I have to follow you.

155
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,670
If you really mean well to me,

156
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,390
don't make life difficult
for me anymore.

157
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,880
Where are you going?

158
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,110
I'm going to the set
to look for Yu Sheng!

159
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,670
Sister Xia, that way.

160
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,230
That way.

161
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,230
Here.

162
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,920
Sister Xia, please sit.

163
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,920
I'm an investor.

164
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,550
A recreational vehicle is
not even prepared for me.

165
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,230
I have to sit outside every day.

166
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,470
Just how much I'm going
to spend on whitening?

167
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,840
I told you to talk to the crew.

168
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,760
What did they say?

169
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,440
I already asked them.

170
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,840
They said the budget was not enough.

171
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,710
Always this kind of excuse.

172
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,880
Nevermind.

173
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,350
Find me a makeup artist
to touch up on my makeup.

174
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,760
I need half an hour for the touch-up.

175
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,200
I already told the makeup artist.

176
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,960
She'll be here soon.

177
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,910
Why don't you put on your shoes first?

178
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,470
Why don't you hurry up?

179
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,350
What are you waiting for?
Put them on me.

180
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,350
It's such a cold day.

181
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,000
They're making me
wear such thin clothes.

182
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,440
I'm already having a cold. Who's going
to be responsible if I'm hospitalized?

183
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,400
No one is working on the set.

184
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,030
No one knows how to solve the problem.

185
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,960
How am I going to live?

186
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,670
It's so cold.

187
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,200
Are the actors for
Episode Three, scene 23, ready?

188
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,320
Come to the set now.

189
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,350
It's done, Ms. Xia La.

190
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,320
I'm going to leave tomorrow.

191
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,840
Let's break up.

192
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,710
Take care of yourself.

193
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,400
Don't go.

194
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,710
What should I do if you leave?

195
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,110
Don't go.

196
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,640
Cut.

197
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,030
Can you cry with tears, Ms. Xia La?

198
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,030
Come on, makeup artist.

199
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,960
Give her some eye drops.

200
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,550
Come on.

201
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,320
Hurry.

202
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,590
The eye drops are in the toolbox.

203
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,790
Why were you so stupid?

204
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,640
I already said this must
be taken with you.

205
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,440
I'll get it now.

206
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,880
Give me some water.

207
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,000
You can't even read the situation.

208
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,760
Go on.

209
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,110
Here.

210
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,030
We're here to help her,

211
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,590
not to babysit her.

212
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,080
Even a babysitter
is not treated like this.

213
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,320
Nevermind.

214
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,910
Since she's the shareholder
of our company,

215
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,280
it's better not to cause trouble.

216
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,640
I'll talk to Mr. Ling about this.

217
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,910
Don't tell him.

218
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,960
She's Mr. Ling's girlfriend.

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,350
You're also my girlfriend.

220
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
It's okay for me to suffer a bit.

221
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,440
I can't bear to see you like this.

222
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,590
What is this anyway?

223
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,550
Just bear with it.

224
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,000
It's only a matter of one or two weeks.

225
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,230
Hurry, drink some water.

226
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,030
I'm not drinking it. I'm in a rush.

227
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,640
Come on. All departments, take note.

228
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,400
One more.

229
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,470
Sister Xia, the eye drops.

230
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Okay, I know.

231
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:05,670
Okay.

232
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,400
Ji Fanyi.

233
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,760
Why are you here?

234
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,400
Why are you avoiding me?

235
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,840
I'm not.

236
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,790
You're not?

237
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,520
I have thought it through.
I'll be your girlfriend.

238
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,760
Zixin doesn't want you.

239
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,670
I want you.

240
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,710
About that,

241
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,710
let me tell you something.

242
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,440
I'm not even considering you.

243
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,400
Well,

244
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,880
I have work to do. I'll leave first.

245
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,000
Boss, what's wrong?

246
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,150
You don't look good.

247
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,000
Someone confessed her love to me.

248
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,760
That's a good thing.

249
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,550
The point is the one who
confessed her love to me

250
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,670
is not a human.

251
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,710
No.

252
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,880
She's not an ordinary human.

253
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,880
Not ordinary?

254
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,590
There are a bunch of ordinary
humans on the street.

255
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,110
Don't you feel happy to
meet one that's extraordinary?

256
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,470
The point is she's too extraordinary.

257
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,590
You're complimenting her.

258
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,910
She must be very special.

259
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,280
Who is she?

260
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,840
Yu Jiao.

261
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,080
That little girl?

262
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,790
I think she's quite ordinary.

263
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,320
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

264
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,760
You don't get it at all.

265
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,320
Hello.

266
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,470
May I know who this is?

267
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,080
This is from
Municipal People's Hospital.

268
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
Your mother has fainted.

269
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,840
Please come to the hospital right away.

270
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,840
Ms. Xia, I want to apply for leave.

271
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,760
What's the matter? I have
a few more scenes later.

272
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,960
My mother fainted in the hospital.

273
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,230
I have to visit her.

274
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,880
She's in the hospital.
Why are you worried?

275
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,670
What else can you do there
except for waiting anxiously?

276
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,230
Can you help the doctor to do his job?

277
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,350
However...

278
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,320
It's already here.

279
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,200
Let's go to the set.

280
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,590
Let's go.

281
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,280
Ms. Xia.

282
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,440
Let's go.

283
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,470
Come on, pick up the phone.

284
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,470
Xinyi, hurry up.

285
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,590
You can go after work.

286
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,280
Ms. Xia.

287
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,200
Aunt, try this.

288
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,400
This is very good for your body.

289
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,280
Oh my God.

290
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,470
This must have cost you a lot.

291
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,400
It's fine. Let me peel
an orange for you.

292
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,910
Thank you.

293
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,640
How is my mother now?

294
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,790
Why are you only here now?

295
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,710
Hurry, have a look.

296
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,550
Mother!

297
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,960
Xinyi, you're here.

298
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,710
Hurry, thank your colleague.

299
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,670
He's such a good person.

300
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
He specially came to take care of me.

301
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,670
Mother, are you okay?

302
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,910
I'm okay.

303
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,880
Just a little hypoglycemia.

304
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,150
That's good.

305
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,790
Sit down.

306
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,200
Your mother often faints
in the hospital,

307
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,230
but she always keeps it from you.

308
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,000
She doesn't want to affect you.

309
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,230
That's why we asked
the hospital to call you.

310
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,000
How did you know about it?

311
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,200
I heard your phone call by chance.

312
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,030
Was it a coincidence?

313
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,080
Were you trying to get close to me

314
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,400
to help someone?

315
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,030
It's up to you whether
you believe me or not.

316
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,110
I still think it's necessary to
get a caretaker for your mother.

317
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,350
That way, it won't affect your work.

318
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,840
Thank you for your kindness.

319
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,470
I can solve my own problem.

320
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,880
Suit yourself.

321
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,350
Zixin has claimed the reimbursement
of payment for the caretaker.

322
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,670
You can ask her to take it back.

323
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,080
I'll leave now.

324
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,000
Look. What are these?

325
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,280
Isn't this An Tianmin?

326
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,910
How did they know each other?

327
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,440
I've told you before.

328
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,030
There's something wrong with Li Zixin.

329
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,440
Furthermore,

330
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,760
I've asked Su Qing again.

331
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,520
This was the person who asked her
for the information of the decoder.

332
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,080
Is he still investigating
the incident of An Xin'er?

333
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,960
Was Li Zixin sent by him?

334
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,350
Not only that,

335
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,640
Yu Sheng went to the hospital yesterday.

336
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,110
He paid the medical fees
for the short-sighted girl.

337
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,960
We can't keep the short-sighted girl.

338
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,670
How is it?

339
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,790
Do I look pretty?

340
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,000
Yes.

341
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,230
Do you feel bad about buying so much?

342
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,110
See if you're still going to
wrong me or not in the future.

343
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,150
Why would I feel bad about it?

344
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,520
If you like it,

345
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
I can even pick the stars for you.

346
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,150
What a sweet talker.

347
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,350
Xia La.

348
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,350
I have thought carefully about
the matter of the short-sighted girl.

349
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,670
Since Youming is her fiancé

350
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,590
who's followed me for years...

351
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,280
It's not like you're not
giving him a salary.

352
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,080
It's just a worker.

353
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,230
If the boss wants to fire someone,

354
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,350
does he have to care
for the worker's feelings?

355
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,030
This is a small community.

356
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Youming is someone
who handles the finance.

357
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,910
We don't have to offend him.

358
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
What should we do then?

359
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,440
We will definitely fire her,

360
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,760
but I need your help.

361
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,560
Okay.

362
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,680
Do you have money?

363
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,470
Yu Jiao looked for Ji Fanyi?

364
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,710
Did she tell you the reason?

365
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,230
She's not telling me.

366
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,350
That's strange.

367
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,400
Ji Fanyi is afraid of her.

368
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,000
You asked Yu Jiao to look for him.

369
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,400
What if he reveals what
happened that night?

370
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,680
I don't think he will.

371
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,880
Yu Jiao has always
treated him as a friend.

372
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,830
Also, he knows Yu Jiao
has lost her memories.

373
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,000
He might not tell Yu Jiao

374
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,800
about this matter.

375
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,310
That's right.

376
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,760
Ji Fanyi is not that kind of person.

377
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,640
Besides, Yu Jiao is so naive.

378
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,520
Just let her live in her own world.

379
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,560
Zixin and Brother Yu.

380
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,680
Have you heard?

381
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,280
Something happened to
the new assistant of Xia La.

382
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,560
What's the matter?

383
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,110
It's said she stole something
in the dressing room.

384
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,230
She was caught in the act.

385
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,280
What's going on?

386
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,310
Why did you ask me to be here?

387
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,520
Couldn't you say it on the phone?

388
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,520
Look for yourself.

389
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,560
Ms. Xia, it really wasn't me.

390
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,590
I saw her coming in here yesterday,

391
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,430
but I didn't know what she was up to.

392
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,040
I lost a very expensive piece
of jewelry here today.

393
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,880
After checking the CCTV, I realized.

394
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,640
I really never expected that

395
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,000
she'd have this kind of behavior.

396
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,280
The clothes may look like mine,

397
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,190
but it really wasn't me.

398
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,110
Tell me then.

399
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,640
Who else would wear such clothes

400
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,040
and dress like this?

401
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,310
The company is disgraced by you.

402
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,430
Ms. Xia, believe me.
It really wasn't me.

403
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,310
Why don't we call the police?

404
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,710
No.

405
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,000
Calling the police will harm
our company's reputation.

406
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,310
How should this matter be solved then?

407
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,640
Leave it to me.

408
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,830
I will compensate you for your losses.

409
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,470
The fish is taking the bait.

410
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,230
Do you think Li Xinyi
would do this kind of thing?

411
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,110
No.

412
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,000
It's very obvious that

413
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,590
they set her up.

414
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,430
Do you mean Xia La did it purposely?

415
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,760
We just helped Li Xinyi

416
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,680
two days ago.

417
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,190
Now this is happening.

418
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,680
It means our effort in the last
few days isn't wasted.

419
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,950
This is called driving a wedge
between the enemies.

420
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,590
However,

421
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,190
they set Li Xinyi up.

422
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,350
That means she already knew

423
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,590
I was investigating this incident.

424
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,920
If you resign,

425
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,350
we won't reveal this.

426
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,680
Ms. Xia, I didn't steal it.

427
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,830
It's not the problem
about whether it's you or not.

428
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,310
The video is just right there.

429
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,830
Everyone knows it's you at first glance.

430
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,160
Who else would wear that kind
of clothes except for you?

431
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,310
Xinyi.

432
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,880
You have followed us for so long.

433
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,880
I also believe you.

434
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,880
However, if I were to cover for you,

435
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,830
I couldn't give an explanation
for the drama set.

436
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,280
I understand, Ms. Xia.

437
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:38,760
It's nothing.

438
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,680
Remember to go to the company

439
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,710
and get your three months
worth of salary as compensation.

440
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,400
Also,

441
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,280
Mr. Ling sees you as our old worker.

442
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,280
So he got you a job in Shaocheng

443
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,040
since you can't stay here anymore.

444
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,190
Wang Youming will brief
you on the details.

445
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,430
Thank you, Ms. Xia.
I also thank Mr. Ling.

446
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,400
It's okay.

447
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,760
We are a family.

448
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,160
Mr. Ling, you seem to be
in a good mood recently.

449
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,040
You have asked me out for beer

450
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,190
for a few times in a row.

451
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,400
Just listen to yourself.

452
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,430
You're the key person in
Huaning Film and Television.

453
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,310
We should keep a good relationship

454
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,560
for better cooperation and
development of our companies.

455
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,950
You're flattering me.

456
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,470
What kind of key person am I?

457
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,560
You think too highly of me.

458
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,430
I'm just a nobody

459
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,310
trying to make a living.

460
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,640
You're too humble.

461
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,280
You're the godson of Li Ning.

462
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,160
Li Ning doesn't have a successor.

463
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,950
The company will be
yours sooner or later.

464
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,110
There's Li Zixin too.

465
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,950
No matter how outstanding Zixin is,

466
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,310
she'll always be a disciple of Li Ning.

467
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,350
She can't compare to you.

468
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,280
You don't know how unusual

469
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,400
this disciple is.

470
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,070
Could she be the illegitimate
daughter of Li Ning?

471
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,400
I'm just joking.

472
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,160
I mean

473
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,470
she's my godmother's favorite disciple.

474
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,430
Oh right,

475
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,110
I heard some time ago, you
signed a contract with Li Li.

476
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,470
After some time,
you'll have a big project.

477
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,000
Mr. Ling, not bad.

478
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,590
Your business is looking good.

479
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,350
It's rising day by day.

480
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,310
That's nothing.

481
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,640
I should thank Zixin for helping me.

482
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,230
If it weren't for Zixin,

483
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,310
I wouldn't have secured
the investment of Mr. Guo.

484
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,920
You two seem to have
a good relationship.

485
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,190
We're just good.

486
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,590
Zixin has been helping me.

487
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,880
Well, we should help each other.

488
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,880
For example?

489
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,520
This is a trade secret.

490
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,560
You know that, Mr. Ye.

491
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,070
I know that.

492
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,920
Okay.

493
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,000
I think we can follow up

494
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,800
with the project of Xufeng.

495
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,520
The risk management team
should follow it, too.

496
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,430
Where's your evaluation report?

497
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,470
Give me straightaway.

498
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,520
Yes, Mr. Ji.

499
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,560
As for the agreement after that...

500
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,160
Mr. Ji.

501
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,230
There's a person looking
for you downstairs.

502
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,430
Who is it?

503
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,470
The receptionist said it's a girl.

504
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,040
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

505
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:26,920
Let her wait.

506
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,920
Okay.

507
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,430
Do continue.

508
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,230
I'll settle something.

509
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,110
Okay.

510
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,280
Hello, Mr. Ji.

511
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,000
This is for you.

512
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,520
Thank you,

513
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,800
but I don't want it.

514
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,640
Also, how did you come to my place?

515
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,400
Zixin told me about it.

516
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,680
She said I had to be
persistent if I liked a person.

517
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,880
Well, since I like you,

518
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,280
I cannot give up that easily.

519
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,430
I don't like you.

520
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,800
Why?

521
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,640
No reason.

522
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,710
It's because you're not my type.

523
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,430
What's your type then?

524
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,520
It's not someone like you anyway.

525
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,830
Is it someone like Zixin?

526
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,160
Did you tell Yu Sheng
before you came to my place?

527
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,920
I'll get someone to take you back.

528
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,920
I'm not going back.

529
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,350
I want to stay with you.

530
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,470
Hello.

531
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,110
Come down and help me to send a person.

532
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,400
Mr. Ling has already arranged

533
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,160
everything for you at Shaocheng branch.

534
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,110
You can go anytime.

535
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,950
Help me to thank Mr. Ling,

536
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,640
but I'm not going to Shaocheng.

537
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,800
Xinyi, actually this...

538
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,400
This thing wasn't done by me.

539
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,000
I want to find evidence by myself

540
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,920
to prove my innocence.

541
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,560
I believe you.

542
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,950
I really believe you.

543
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,000
I mean

544
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,160
actually you can leave
for a period of time.

545
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,880
After this incident has passed,

546
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,070
you can come back again.

547
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,040
Time will get this incident
forgotten in history,

548
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,230
but will the people forget
about it once I'm back?

549
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,950
I don't want to live a life
carrying the label of a thief.

550
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,280
If we see it from
the view of the company,

551
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,520
actually we don't want to make this big.

552
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,190
This will affect the drama series badly.

553
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:16,880
You do know this, right?

554
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,400
I have to...

555
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,800
It will affect the drama
series in a bad way.

556
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
Does it affect me in a good way?

557
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Why do you only think for
Mr. Ling and the company?

558
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,830
Xinyi.

559
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,230
You will get promoted

560
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,920
for going over there.

561
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,710
You will be managing
an administration department.

562
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,760
I hope you can consider it
for your future,

563
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,400
all right?

564
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,800
- Mr. Ling is...
- Mr. Ling is so nice to us.

565
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,800
We have to be grateful for it, right?

566
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,000
I'll walk you out.

567
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,590
No need.

568
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,110
Let me calm down by myself.

569
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,590
Li Xinyi.

570
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,590
The thief is found.

571
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,400
Really?

572
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,400
Does it mean I don't have to go?

573
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,590
However, I'm afraid this thief
can never be caught.

574
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,310
This is the item checklist
of the dressing room.

575
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,230
None is missing.

576
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,070
Why did they wrong me?

577
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,880
Is it not obvious enough?

578
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,430
This was their trick to get you away.

579
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,560
I have been working hard
in the company for years.

580
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,680
I didn't do anything wrong.

581
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,950
Why did he do this to me?

582
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,400
It's not your fault.
They're just feeling guilty.

583
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,710
Why are you helping me?

584
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,920
To tell you the truth,

585
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,800
I'm looking for the truth
behind Shang Zhan's incident.

586
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,280
I believe Wang Youming knows something.

587
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,070
If you can persuade him

588
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,830
to tell us the situation of the time,

589
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,760
maybe we can get the culprit.

590
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,590
Please consider it.

591
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,070
I believe you'll make the right choice.

592
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:40,520
Why did she go?

593
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,590
She hasn't given me an answer.

594
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,560
but she's now like me.

595
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,760
She doesn't have another choice.

596
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,830
I still think this is a bit risky.

597
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,230
I promised you I would be cautious.

598
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,230
No, I have to stay beside you.

599
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,310
What about Yu Jiao?

600
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,560
I think it's better for her

601
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,350
to stay with Ji Fanyi.

602
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,430
Ji Fanyi?

603
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,680
What did you say?

604
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
She ran away?

605
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,310
Yes.

606
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,680
It's just a moment at the gas station

607
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,590
and she disappeared.

608
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,470
She's not familiar with this place.

609
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,230
Where can she go?

610
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,000
Why don't you give her a call?

611
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,280
Of course I will.

612
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,070
Do I need you to tell me this?

613
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,950
Hello. Where are you?

614
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,680
I'm shopping.

615
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,000
Can you shop after you get back?

616
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,070
I won't be able to
see you if I get back.

617
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,560
Which shopping mall are you at?

618
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,710
It's none of your business.

619
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,520
Can you not give me so much trouble?

620
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,800
I won't have to worry
about your matter then.

621
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,000
I promised Zixin that

622
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,680
I would send you back safe and sound.

623
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,400
Hello.

624
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,400
She hung up on me.

625
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,520
I just called her.

626
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,280
No one is answering.

627
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,950
What time is it now?

628
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,040
All the shopping malls are closed now.

629
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,710
Where else can she go?

630
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
If you didn't reject her,

631
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,350
none of this would have happened.

632
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:24,950
I don't like her.

633
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,110
Of course I have to reject her.

634
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,280
If you really don't like her,

635
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,710
why are you feeling anxious?

636
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,680
She's different from others.

637
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,560
In your heart, right?

638
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,880
I don't want to talk to you.

639
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,190
Boss, where are you going?

640
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,680
I'm looking for someone.

641
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,000
Thank you.

642
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,830
Did you go to the shopping
mall at this hour

643
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:32,950
for this?

644
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,040
Didn't you say you
didn't like a girl like me?

645
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,280
That's why I dressed like Zixin.

646
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,230
Do you like me now?

647
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,350
I didn't mean this...

648
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,470
No.

649
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,190
Anyway, that's not what I meant,

650
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,520
okay?

651
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,000
Do you still have Zixin in your heart?

652
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,830
How can I let go of
my feelings so quickly?

653
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,070
I can wait.

654
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,590
Okay.

655
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,520
You said you didn't want to date.

656
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:08,880
I can wait.

657
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,590
I can wait until the day
you want to date someone.

658
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:22,950
Anyway,

659
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,880
you and me are impossible.

660
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,760
Wait as you like.

661
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,800
Where are you going at this hour?

662
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,560
Wait.

663
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,710
I'll ask someone to send you back.

664
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,190
Do you despise me so much?

665
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,310
Stop explaining.

666
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,040
Yu Jiao.

667
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,040
Yu Jiao.

668
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,830
Go back with me.

669
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:26,880
I won't.

670
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,350
You're back.

671
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,110
Just the right time, let's
have dinner together.

672
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,230
Hurry, wash your hands and eat.

673
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:06,760
These are all your favorite dishes.

674
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,280
This afternoon,

675
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,150
I went to the hospital.

676
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:18,950
Don't worry.

677
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,600
your mother is gradually recovering.

678
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,150
Also,

679
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,840
don't be angry over what
happened during the daytime,

680
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,630
okay?

681
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,600
Come on.

682
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,910
Stop being angry over what
happened during the daytime.

683
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,670
Let's eat.

684
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,190
I'm not angry.

685
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,190
I'm just sorting out my thoughts.

686
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,040
Here, an egg.

687
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,280
Where did you go? You're back so late.

688
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,710
I went to meet Li Zixin.

689
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,910
She said she's got the request
of Shang Zhan's daughter.

690
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,000
There's something behind
Shang Zhan's death.

691
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,520
What did she ask you to do?

692
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,760
She said you'd have some clues.

693
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,120
She wants to talk to you.

694
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,360
I don't know how she found out.

695
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,120
On the day of An Xin'er suicide,

696
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,120
Shang Zhan was also on the yacht.

697
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,000
It's not like what Xia La said

698
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,520
that he suddenly died at home.

699
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,320
Xinyi.

700
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,670
Let's not talk about
this matter in the future.

701
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,360
Don't you want to know the truth?

702
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,190
Listen to me,

703
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:31,870
okay?

704
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,190
We're just normal people.

705
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,120
This incident has been over
for such a long time.

706
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,190
Why do you want to seek trouble?

707
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,230
Shang Zhan died unjustly.

708
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,040
He is already dead.

709
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,360
Whether he died justly or
unjustly, it has nothing

710
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,800
to do with you or me.

711
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,320
Mr. Ling

712
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,870
was kind

713
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,280
to both you and me.

714
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,800
We cannot be ungrateful.

715
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,280
Why do you suddenly mention Mr. Ling?

716
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,470
I didn't say this was related to him.

717
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,870
Do you really know something?

718
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,670
Don't talk nonsense.

719
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,760
Let me ask you.

720
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,760
Have you thought of the possibility

721
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,040
of Li Zixin framing them

722
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,430
just to get information from you?

723
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:18,840
Xinyi.

724
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,080
Listen to me for once.

725
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,600
If Li Zixin arranges a job for you,

726
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,800
we can thank her for her kindness.

727
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,840
However, we don't want
to be indebted to her.

728
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,520
Everything is arranged at Shaocheng.

729
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,840
You don't have to worry

730
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,560
about your mother.
I'll take care of her.

731
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,600
Say no more about this matter.

732
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,800
Let's eat.
