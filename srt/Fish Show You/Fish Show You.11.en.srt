19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,160
That's what happened.

20
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,550
We'll start a new investigation.

21
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,720
I hope you can cooperate
with us in our investigation.

22
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,230
I'll cooperate with you by the time.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,230
Okay, thank you.

24
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,830
Thank you.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,190
They have looked for me too.

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,040
Why is this happening?

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,160
Where are those photos from?

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,760
Wasn't Shang Zhan's phone
thrown into the sea?

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,160
Do you remember Su Qing telling us

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,760
that someone threatened her to
find Shang Zhan's phone decoder?

31
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,440
Yes.

32
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,480
Does it mean someone is

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,000
reinvestigating
the incident of that year?

34
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,680
We must find this person.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I keep thinking this is
related to Li Zixin.

36
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
She asked to meet me tomorrow.

37
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,550
I'll meet up with her first.

Aren't you busy filming?

39
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,910
How come you have the time
to ask me out for a meal?

40
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,030
Mr. Ling, do you really
not know what it is about?

41
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
Don't you know clearly

42
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,960
what you have done?

43
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,240
I don't know.

44
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,390
Your company has been

45
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,440
in arrears of payment to the crew.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,750
I see.

47
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,030
I was too busy lately.

48
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,000
We didn't have the time
to review that payment.

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,110
I'll settle it later.

50
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,390
I know that

51
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,600
your company doesn't have money.

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,390
I'll figure something out.

53
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,670
Actually I just knew it today.

54
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,910
Your company is having difficulties

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,750
as you're unable to sign
a contract with Li Li.

56
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,630
Your company failed in financing.

57
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,880
Most of it was because of me.

58
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,320
What do you mean?

59
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,630
Actually, I came here

60
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,880
to apologize to you, Mr. Ling.

61
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,830
I can spare you some time for the crew.

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,160
I also asked Li Li.

63
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,600
He's not signed a contract yet.

64
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,360
Our company is starting a new project.

65
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
It's the drama series of the famous
screenwriter, Gao Meng.

66
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,390
I want to let Li Li try it out.

67
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,440
Zixin.

68
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,630

69
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,240
Previously Su Qing...

70
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,110
It's about business competition.

71
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,390
Besides, helping you
means helping myself.

72
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,190
If your company does go bankrupt,

73
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,190
how am I going to fill this hole?

74
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,440
I'm afraid it comes with conditions.

75
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,800
You see through me.

76
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,350
I will make it clear.

77
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,550
I want to invest in your company.

78
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,510
You're now the pillar of
Huaning Film and Television.

Don't put all eggs in one basket.

81

I'm giving myself a few more options.

82
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,670
What if your mentor knows about it?

83
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,760
There's a kind of agreement
called a non-disclosure agreement.

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,320
Please consider it, Mr. Ling.

85
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
I'll make a technology investment.

86
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,320
Don't you need content for your company?

87
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,480
We'll be helping each other.

88
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,720
I've said it before.

89
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,390
This is just the beginning.

90
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,480
You're behind everything, right?

91
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,230
Criminals will be punished by law.

92
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,070
What did Zhuang Xiaoqiao

93
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,920
mean by saying that?

94
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,950
Calm down.

95
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,950
If she was telling the truth,

96
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,670
we're going to have trouble.

97
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,200
How could she single-handedly find out

98
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,950
the things about us?

99
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,920
There must be somebody behind her.

100
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,350
Ji Fanyi and Li Zixin

101
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,720
from what I see, intend to destroy us.

102
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,670
Stop the conspiracy theory.

103
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,110
This thing must have been
done by Zhuang Xiaoqiao alone.

104
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,670
It has nothing to do with Zixin.

105
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,040
Zixin?

106
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,510
Since when have you started
to address her that intimately?

107
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,550
I mean

108
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,920
we're the investor of
Huaning Film and Television.

109
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,320
If Li Zixin goes against us,

110
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,510
she'll risk her own project in the end.

111
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,320
How is she going to survive

112
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,760
in Huaning if her project fails?

113
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,510
What if she's going to
take us down with her?

114
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,920
Does she have a reason to do this?

115
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,440
Zhuang Xiaoqiao is just
an unknown actress.

116
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,040
Why would Li Zixin help her?

117
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,040
Would she do it to
share her inheritance?

118
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,440
Is she short of money?

119
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,670
Why don't you believe what I'm saying?

120
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,390
Don't you remember the police
have already looked for us?

121
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,640
Do you know

122
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,440
just a few days ago

123
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,230
Li Zixin helped me with her connection?

124
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,110
Li Li is going to sign a contract
with our company soon.

125
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,920
It doesn't sound right.

126
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,640
This is weird.

127
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,390
This is 100% a conspiracy.

128
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,830
Yes.

129
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
On certain conditions,

130
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,440
she'll invest in our company.

131
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,070
I don't agree.

132
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,350
I don't have any other option.

133
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,640
If she's willing to bear
the risk with me

134
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,320
and provide some content,

135
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,670
I will have nothing to lose.

136
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,390
I don't like her.

137
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,440
This drama series is already my limit.

138
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,230
I don't want to see her face, too,

139
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,760
every time going to the company.

140
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,480
Okay.

141
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,070
I'll reject her.

142
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,110
Get Li Li to sign a contract
with our company.

143
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,880
You will solve the financial crisis
of the company.

144
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,230
You know I can't solve it.

145
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,640
Yes.

146
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,720
I can't solve it too.

147
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,160
I can't just watch
the company's capital chain

148
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,070
breaking like this.

149
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,550
You're overthinking it.

150
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,960
She just has some photos.

151
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,400
We can say whatever we want.

152
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,320
It's a good thing for Zhuang Xiaoqiao
to get the shares.

153
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,280
She won't dwell on it anymore.

154
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,590
She wouldn't want the company
to go bankrupt, would she?

155
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,350
Stop thinking about it.

156
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,880
How long will it take?

157
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,550
Almost done. What's the rush?

158
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,840
Must we do this?

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,670
Of course.

160
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,440
Ting told me

161
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,000
to make your skin

162
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,440
firm and plump.

163
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,110
Ting sometimes likes

164
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,110
to do this kind of strange thing.

165
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,790
I don't want to do it anymore.

166
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,760
No. Don't take it off.

167
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,590
There's more.

168
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,790
There's more?

169
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,760
What

170
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,640
- is this for?
- This is

171
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,110
very good for your skin.

172
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,030
Really?

173
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,710
Wait.

174
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,880
Why does it feel hot?

175
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,110
Why is it hot?

176
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,710
Are you sure this is how it is?

177
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,840
Almost done.

178
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,470
Why are you laughing?

179
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,910
I... I'm not...

180
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,550
I'm not laughing. I'm happy.

181
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,710
I'm very happy today.

182
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,000
It's a bit painful.

183
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,000
Really?

184
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,320
Aunt.

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,470
Why are you laughing so happily?

186
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,200
Nothing.

187
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,230
How are you doing?

188
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,790
I'm quite good.

189
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,960
I'm just eating here and
there. It's very relaxing.

190
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,000
That's good.

191
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,640
You know what, Aunt?

192
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,880
I've got evidence of Ling Zhi
and Xia La having an affair.

193
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,080
Things are going smoothly here.

194
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,200
That's great.

195
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,790
Oh right,

196
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,880
I heard you're dating someone.

197
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,520
Is it Yu Sheng?

198
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,470
Yes.

199
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,880
After you left, he came back to me.

200
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,760
So...

201
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,520
Is Yu Sheng there?

202
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,910
Let me talk to him.

203
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,110
He...

204
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,400
He may not look presentable now.

205
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,230
Rest assured.

206
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,150
I won't stop you from dating each other.

207
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,030
Seeing you like this,

208
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm very happy.

209
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,960
That's not what I mean.

210
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,590
Let me show him to you.

211
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,910
Look at him.

212
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,280
Hello, Aunt.

213
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,320
What... What's this?

214
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,960
Zixin is experimenting on me.

215
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,440
Seeing you two being so good together,

216
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,080
I can rest easy.

217
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,000
Aunt, why are you coughing?

218
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,910
Aunt.

219
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,320
What's wrong with you?

220
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,080
I'm fine.

221
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,230
It's just a cold.

222
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,960
Yu Sheng.

223
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,350
I'll entrust Zixin to you.

224
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,110
You must treat her well.

225
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,230
Don't worry, Aunt.

226
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,550
I'll surely take good care of Zixin.

227
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,080
That's good. All right.

228
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,760
You have to take good care of yourself.

229
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,710
I will. You too.

230
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,200
- Bye.
- Bye.

231
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,710
What is it?

232
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,280
I don't know.

233
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,280
I just feel something is weird.

234
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,110
Just look at you.

235
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,230
Why are you crying?

236
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,520
I'm not dead yet.

237
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,400
People always say one should
return to his or her roots.

238
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,910
However, in the end, you...

239
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,110
For humans,

240
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,710
it's the same to be buried anywhere.

241
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,590
Now that I have seen Zixin and
Yu Sheng being good together,

242
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
I can rest easy.

243
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,840
At least I let her know

244
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,910
that her Aunt loves her.

245
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,760
Boss,

246
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,640
I prepared a feast

247
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,280
to welcome you back.

248
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,670
I got anxious about not being able

249
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,110
to contact you in the last few days.

250
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,670
Let's go to the set straightaway
to look for Zixin.

251
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,080
I don't it's appropriate.

252
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,440
Okay.

253
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,550
Let's go to the mall first.

254
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,640
All right.

255
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,710
Here, taste this.

256
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,590
Steak imported from Australia.

257
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,550
How is it?

258
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,440
It's good.

259
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,880
I said I wouldn't lie to you.

260
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,110
You can have luxurious meals

261
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,790
by following me.

262
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,910
Indeed.

263
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,710
We're going to look for Yu Sheng soon.

264
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,910
So we have to match our stories first.

265
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,960
What can I benefit from it?

266
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,280
Benefit?

267
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,960
From today onwards,

268
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,230
I'll cover your food expenses.

269
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,840
Here, eat more.

270
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,320
Coming.

271
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,470
Who is it?

272
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,470
Ji Fanyi.

273
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,320
- What's up?
- Where's Yu Sheng?

274
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,520
Yu Sheng!

275
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,640
Yu Sheng.

276
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,230
Come out!

277
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,110
What's up?

278
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,470
Where's Yu Sheng?

279
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,710
Who is it?

280
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,760
Yu Jiao, what are you doing here?

281
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,110
You are Yu Sheng?

282
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,280
Yes, I'm Yu...

283
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,400
Wait.

284
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,550
I'm Yu Sheng.

285
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,550
Yu Sheng.

286
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,400
What's wrong?

287
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,400
Say something. What's wrong?

288
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,030
Bad boy!

289
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:17,840
Yu Jiao.

290
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,000
Did you really lose your memories?

291
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,280
Do you really not remember anything?

292
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,790
I only remember you.

293
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,640
You said you wanted to protect me.

294
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,520
Yu Sheng.

295
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,080
If you still have a conscience,

296
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,030
you should be responsible for her.

297
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,110
Ji Fanyi, you should go back first.

298
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,280
We can settle the rest.

299
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,030
Zixin.

300
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,350
You can't be together
with this guy anymore.

301
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,840
He only lies to you.

302
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,840
I said it. You should go back first.

303
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,320
He will give us an explanation.

304
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,110
I can't go back.

305
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,640
He'll only lie to you. He's a bad boy.

306
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,840
- A bad boy.
- Okay.

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,790
You're a bad boy.

308
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,760
I just lost a day of memory back then

309
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,030
when you saved me
with the energy crystal.

310
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,910
Why doesn't Yu Jiao remember anything?

311
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,520
She couldn't get her
broken energy crystal fixed.

312
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,710
That's why she ended up like this.

313
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,640
You should take care of
Yu Jiao in the next few days

314
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,230
and repair her energy crystal.

315
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,550
Go ahead and eat.

316
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
Is this it?

317
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,960
I want to eat big prawns.

318
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Didn't I tell you?

319
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,670
Prawns and fish

320
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,200
are our kind. We can't eat them.

321
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,400
Didn't you say you're my subject?

322
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,640
You must listen to me.

323
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,880
I don't care.

324
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,000
I want to eat meat.

325
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:56,790
However I...

326
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,710
Eat these.

327
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,030
Thank you.

328
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,280
It's a buffet.

329
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,640
People should eat what they like.

330
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
You shouldn't care too much.

331
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,800
You are so controlling.

332
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,230
I see you are controlling her mentally.

333
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,590
I'm controlling?

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,640
Say something. Did I torture you?

335
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,470
I don't think I have to
explain so much to you.

336
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,350
You surely don't have to explain to me.

337
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,920
How are you going to explain to Zixin?

338
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,760
Regarding Zixin,

339
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,230
I don't even need to explain to you.

340
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,760
There's nothing I can explain to you.

341
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,760
How can you be so confident
about two-timing the girls?

342
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,400
I'm not.

343
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,230
You know it deep down inside.

344
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,710
By the way,

345
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,520
about Zixin,

346
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,680
I won't give in to you.

347
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,590
Zixin.

348
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,800
Where's Yu Sheng?

349
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,800
They just went down to eat.

350
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,350
Is there work today?

351
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,280
Yes.

352
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,160
We can depart after I finish packing.

353
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,190
You can tell him that

354
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,880
Yu Jiao can follow me today.

355
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,680
He said you're quite busy today.

356
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,520
We shouldn't trouble you.

357
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,590
Right.

358
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,800
Zixin.

359
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,950
Who's that girl who suddenly
came out of nowhere?

360
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,400
Could it be...

361
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Don't overthink it.

362
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,800
That's Yu Sheng's sister.

363
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,640
Yu Sheng. Yu Jiao.

364
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,160
Just look at my brain.

365
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,920
By seeing how nice he is treating her,

366
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,040
I thought he'd fallen for her.

367
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,430
Don't speak nonsense.

368
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,400
I'll leave now.

369
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,590
I'm already clear about the situation
of the short-sighted girl.

370
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,590
She has a weak character
and doesn't have any friends.

371
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,470
That's why she's relying on
her fiancé, Wang Youming.

372
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
How is Wang Youming treating her?
They're preparing to get married.

373
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,280
How is Li Xinyi's family?

374
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,520
She has only a mother.

375
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,040
She isn't in good health
and is often hospitalized.

376
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,160
In order to pay for the medical fees,

377
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,950
other than her company's job,

378
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,160
she's also working part-time outside.

379
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,520
There'll be a breakthrough
if there's a weakness.

380
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,830
Do you really want to get close to her?

381
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,110
She's working for Ling Zhi.

382
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,230
Isn't it risky?

383
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,800
No pain, no gain.

384
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,230
Mother.

385
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,350
I'm good now.

386
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,880
I'v eaten well. My colleagues
are good to me.

387
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,190
My boss also thinks highly of me.

388
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,760
I'll visit you afterward.

389
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,950
Okay. Mother, I'm eating.

390
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,680
I'll hang up first.

391
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,680
Bye.

392
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,760
It's not easy to get close to Li Xinyi.

393
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,400
No one talks to her

394
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,470
in the crew except for Xia La.

395
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,110
That's right.

396
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,880
I've tried talking to her,

397
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,920
but she only talks about work.

398
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,110
I can't even get her to chat.

399
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,000
I think she's just pretending.

400
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,110
She's pitiful.

401
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,710
I can only take this slowly.

402
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,830
It's for you.

403
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,560
Sit. Sit down and eat.

404
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,760
Thank you.

405
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,880
Don't mention it.

406
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,230
How's the food on the set?

407
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,470
Quite good.

408
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,470
If you have anything you need,

409
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,560
you can just ask me.

410
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,680
Okay.

411
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,520
I'll go back and eat first.

412
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,680
Okay.

413
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,190
Bye.

414
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,880
Sister, eat some grapes.

415
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,350
Sit.

416
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,520
What's wrong?

417
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,590
You're choosing to
stand when I let you sit,

418
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,710
as if I'm very fierce.

419
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,310
No.

420
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,590
Why is Li Zixin looking for you lately?

421
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
I'm not quite sure too.

422
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,470
What did she say to you?

423
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,880
Nothing special.

424
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,520
She just talked about this and that.

425
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,230
She's talking to an assistant like you?

426
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,680
I'm not quite sure about this too,

427
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,710
but I didn't talk much to her.

428
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,830
Okay. I know.

429
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,470
However, Xinyi,

430
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,800
you are working in our company.

431
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,560
You have to remember
where you stand, all right?

432
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,760
All right.

433
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,800
I understand.

434
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,830
Good.

435
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,520
Mr. Guo.

436
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,680
I have signed a contract with Li Li

437
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,040
whom you mentioned to me last time.

438
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,000
About the investment you mentioned,

439
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,590
how shall we get it going?

440
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,830
You acted pretty fast.

441
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,590
I thought you had given up.

442
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,230
Since I want to work with you,

443
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,040
I will have to show you my sincerity.

444
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,590
Tell me,

445
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,040
I have bought the masterpiece.

446
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,470
Would I not hold an exhibition?

447
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,160
I'm happy to work with you.

448
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,280
That is a must.

449
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,470
You didn't believe me when
I doubted Li Zixin last time.

450
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,560
I have found the evidence.

451
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,040
Mr. Guo.

452
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,470
I've already sent the agreement to you.

453
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,430
Right.

454
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,230
What did you just say?

455
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,160
I said Li Zixin intended

456
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,070
to get close to the short-sighted girl.

457
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,190
What do you mean?

458
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,760
You may not know about
the short-sighted girl.

459
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,070
She's submissive and
not likable at all.

460
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,190
No one ever talks to her on the set,

461
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,000
except for Li Zixin and Yu Sheng.

462
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,640
They tried to talk to her
by giving her a chair.

463
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,830
Don't you think this is weird?

464
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,070
You're always worrying

465
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,430
about these trivial fights of nobodies.

466
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,000
What's the point of it?

467
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,110
Don't you think Li Zixin

468
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,350
acts the weirdest of all?

469
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,230
Wait.

470
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,280
Do you know what this means?

471
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,160
Xia La, our time has finally come.

472
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
In the world,

473
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,590
the strong always dominate the weak.

474
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,590
Even if time goes by,

475
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,110
it never changes.

476
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,760
This is really unreasonable.

477
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,280
What's the matter?

478
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,880
Ling Zhi has signed
a contract with Li Li

479
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,830
and got to work with Chenxu Capital.

480
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,880
He's gained a foothold in this industry.

481
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:04,920
I know.

482
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,400
I helped him with it.

483
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,190
Did you help him? Why?

484
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,310
If E-Changxiang goes on like this,

485
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,040
they'll be the greatest opponent

486
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,470
of our company.

487
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,310
I urgently need a witness now.

488
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,920
If I didn't do this,

489
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,710
Ling Zhi would have doubted me.

490
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,280
We could've looked for
the witnesses secretly.

491
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,040
Have you thought about
Huaning Film and Television?

492
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,920
There must be give and take.

493
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,190
The success of
Huaning Film and Television today

494
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,920
is thanks to the hard
work of my godmother.

495
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,920
She entrusted it to you
because she trusted you.

496
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,590
You can use it as a stepping stone.

497
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,310
You can also use it as
a tool for your revenge.

498
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,800
However, you can't throw it
away after using it.

499
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,590
I didn't have a choice.

500
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,760
If I can take Ling Zhi down,

501
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,520
the new E-Changxiang won't be

502
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,950
a threat to us anymore, isn't it?

503
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,070
What if you can't take him down?

504
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,040
Who's going to take the risk?

505
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,190
My godmother and I will
have to bear the consequences.

506
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,590
You're too self-centered.
You should reflect on yourself.

507
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,640
Boss.

508
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,230
How are you going to
celebrate your birthday?

509
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,280
Do you want to make it big?

510
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,830
Make it big?

511
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,680
Of course.

512
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,950
However, this time, I'll
only invite a person over.

513
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,310
Okay, I got it.

514
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,590
Leave it to me.

515
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,230
Pick the best restaurant for me.

516
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,520
The atmosphere must be romantic.

517
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,190
However, she has a boyfriend now.

518
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,190
Aren't you trying to steal
someone's girlfriend?

519
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,760
No.

520
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,760
I'm swimming against the stream.

521
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,800
Besides, Yu Sheng is not
suitable for her at all.

522
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,760
She's only blinded by lies for now.

523
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,830
Wait until she opens her eyes,

524
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,710
she'll realize

525
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,040
the person who can
accompany her until the end

526
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,310
is none other than me.

527
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,640
Okay, the room is prepared for you.

528
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,000
It's very close to Yu Sheng.

529
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,070
Just stay here without worries.

530
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,590
It's soft.

531
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:14,800
Right.

532
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,680
I'm going to confess
my feelings to Zixin later.

533
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,710
Do you still remember
what you promised me?

534
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,520
You said you would
help me to stall Yu Sheng.

535
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,230
Please never ever

536
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,760
let him come to mess things up.

537
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,920
I'll leave my lifetime happiness to you.

538
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,190
However, don't worry.

539
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,560
After I succeed,

540
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,070
I'll buy you

541
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,800
a lollipop bigger than you.

542
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:47,590
Come on.

543
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,070
For our happy cooperation.

544
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,560
Okay.

545
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,560
I'll go over there first.

546
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,040
Yes!

547
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,560
Ever since your Aunt went on a trip,

548
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,560
Ye Ran has really helped you a lot.

549
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,400
I think he must have his reasons

550
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,800
for doing it this way.

551
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,710
Actually I've been in a dilemma lately.

552
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,680
Do you think

553
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm resorting to all means

554
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,830
to get what I want?

555
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,400
If I do this,

556
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,310
how am I different from Ling Zhi?

557
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,430
Of course, there's a difference.

558
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,800
He's a bad guy in nature.

559
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,400
You're doing it to punish the bad guy.

560
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,470
It's different in essence.

561
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,400
After listening to your words,

562
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,230
I feel much better.

563
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,800
I don't know about the ways anyway.

564
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,310
I just think

565
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,040
maybe you can discuss with Ye Ran

566
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,230
before you make the next decision.

567
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,040
I agree.

568
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,920
Should I apologize to him now?

569
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,590
Where are you going?

570
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,520
Why are you here?

571
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,880
Didn't you promise

572
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
to have a meal with me today?

573
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,040
Have you forgotten about it?

574
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
I have forgotten about it.

575
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,830
Why don't we go together?

576
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
You're not welcomed.

577
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,040
Yu Sheng, I'm also hungry.

578
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,110
Let's eat.

579
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
Right. We can eat together.

580
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,160
That's right.

581
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,880
I don't want to see him.

582
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,160
I don't want to be with him.

583
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,000
Let's go.

584
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,590
Stop looking.

585
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,640
Let's go too.

586
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,950
Eat slowly.

587
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,040
No one is snatching it from you.

588
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
There's still a lot.

589
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,160
Why? Are you not happy?

590
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,830
Why?

591
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:41,880
I don't know.

592
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,110
I'm not happy either.

593
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,520
It's all because of Ji Fanyi.

594
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,520
He's always hanging around Zixin.

595
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,280
He knows Zixin and I are a couple.

596
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,520
He is...

597
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,920
Simply shameless.

598
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,160
That's right. He's simply shameless.

599
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,110
He is pestering Zixin

600
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,920
and trying to ruin
my relationship with Zixin.

601
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,520
That's right.

602
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,160
He's despicable, shameless

603
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,310
and nasty.

604
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,000
He even asked me to stall you.

605
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,070
Doesn't that make me his accomplice?

606
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,520
Did he ask you to stall me?

607
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,640
I don't want to be an accomplice.

608
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,000
An accomplice will be
punished by the heaven

609
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,110
and get hit by the thunder.

610
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,680
Look.

611
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,470
God knows that I'm right.

612
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,950
I want to do the righteous thing.

613
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,590
Don't you worry about whether
you're right or wrong first.

614
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,920
Why did he let you stall me?

615
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,280
He wanted to confess
his feelings to Zixin.

616
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,280
What?

617
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,470
Am I a dead fish to him?

618
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,350
So,

619
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,000
we can't allow him to do that.

620
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,160
Let's go.

621
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,190
Please.

622
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,520
There's no one else in this restaurant.

623
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,280
This is not just a simple
birthday celebration.

624
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,280
Let's order some food first.

625
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,350
Excuse me, I want to place an order.

626
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,950
Okay.

627
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,070
Why is the rain getting heavier?

628
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,400
Isn't the weather like this recently?

629
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,520
Let's hurry and eat.

630
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,680
We'll go home after eating

631
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,400
or it'll be hard to leave later.

632
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:44,760
You know what?

633
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,280
This heavy rain

634
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,470
is meant to keep the two of us

635
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,520
to stay here together for some time.

636
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,230
Isn't today your birthday?

637
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,590
Why am I the only person?

638
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
That's good enough.

639
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,160
Oh right.

640
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,760
Thank you.

641
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,350
What is this?

642
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,160
It's for you.

643
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,880
Why are you suddenly
giving me a present?

644
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,710
It's because it's my birthday.

645
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,110
You're giving me present

646
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,560
on your birthday?

647
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,560
I'm willing.

648
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,760
I see that

649
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,310
you never change the scarf on your hand.

650
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,950
I figured you did not have
the time to buy a new one.

651
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,040
So I bought you one

652
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,160
when I was buying

653
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,880
a birthday present for myself.

654
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,590
Is it nice?

655
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,310
Actually this scarf is enough.

656
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,830
This scarf means a lot to me.

657
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,070
Allow me.

658
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,920
Get up.

659
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Today is my birthday.

660
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,470
You're not allowed to reject me.

661
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,000
Let's go. Why are you stunned?

662
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,280
Eat this, taste it.

663
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,160
You make the rules on your birthday.

664
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,160
However, it has already past 12 a.m.

665
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,800
I'll return this to you.

666
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,430
Why?

667
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,590
Is it because of Yu Sheng?

668
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,880
How is he better than me?

669
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,680
You are not bad at all.

670
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,640
You are very outstanding.

671
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,160
However, you're not him.

672
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,230
I'm leaving. Happy birthday.

673
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:32,760
Let's go.

674
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,600
What are you doing?

675
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,150
I wanted to wake you up.

676
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,670
What?

677
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,600
I'm widely awake.

678
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,800
However, my heart aches.

679
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,630
I'll ache with you together.

680
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,870
Is this necessary?

681
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,280
You even ran to the restaurant
to look for me.

682
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,320
Did you not trust me?

683
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,840
No.

684
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,320
I just heard from Yu Jiao that Ji Fanyi
was going to confess his love to you.

685
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,280
That means you didn't trust yourself.

686
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,000
How come you're not confident?

687
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,910
That's right. I'm not confident.

688
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,390
I'm afraid Ji Fanyi
will steal you from me.

689
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,950
No, I'm just kidding.

690
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,840
You are the only one in my heart.

691
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,670
Really?

692
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,560
No one can replace you.

693
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:37,840
All right.

694
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,840
Since you're sincere
with your love confession,

695
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,600
I'll forgive you.

696
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:44,950
You did it purposely.

697
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,950
I did it purposely.

698
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,870
Blue planet.

699
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:05,390
I am going to
conquer you, the blue planet.

700
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,950
I was the one with a broken heart.

701
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,760
Why should I be the one
who cleans up the mess?

702
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,150
Ji Fanyi, put me down.

703
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,360
Put me down.

704
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,080
Ji Fanyi, I am going to conquer you.

705
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,630
All right.

706
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,800
You can do it. You're great.

707
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,760
Don't you believe it?

708
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,950
I do.

709
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,000
Let's go. Go back first.

710
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,710
No.

711
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,280
Yu Sheng told me

712
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,470
that I was the commander.

713
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,950
Blue planet!

714
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
Ji Fanyi!

715
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,040
Ji Fanyi, come here!

716
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,950
What are you trying to do?

717
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,950
Come over!

718
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,520
Ji Fanyi, come here!

719
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:22,910
He ran away.
