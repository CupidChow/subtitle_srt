1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,240
Kid! It's you kid.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,760
Wipe your eye

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,680
and know that I'm your senior.

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,320
Okay, Kit.

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,560
If you can’t see Pha today,

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,040
why don't you just ask Mark to see Dr. Kit instead?

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:13,920
Dr. Kit?

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,040
Yu told me to see your boyfriend.

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,000
Name's… Dr. Kit.

10
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,280
Your ass!

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,760
Bump a cheek.

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
Hah!

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,560
I broke up with Pha.

14
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,320


15
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,040
Let's end it, between us. Ok

16
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,560
We should break up.

17
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
Hello Yu.

18
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,680
I really appreciated

19
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,720
that you sent Sab to me.

20
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,120
Don't you know?

21
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,960
I went on a date with Kit today!

22
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,400
Sab set me up to get cheek by cheek with Kit today.

23
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,160
He's a genius!

24
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,800
Hey.

25
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,000
Aren't you excited for me?

26
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,880
What's your problem, Yu ?

27
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,320
Are you with Pha?

28
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,400
Am I bothering you?

29
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Yu?

30
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
What's going on?

31
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,760
Why are you crying?

32
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,720
Who hurt you? Tell me.

33
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,680
Pha broke up with me.

34
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,360
He left me.

35
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,200
Pha and I are not together anymore.

36
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,760
Pha!

37
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,640
It's me.

38
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,400
You know that I'm always with you right?

39
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,640
If there is no one to take care of you, I will be the one.

40
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,960
Let me be beside you.

41
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,720
Be strong.

42
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Just stay strong.

43
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
You're wet like a puppy.

44
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Go take a shower.

45
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,760
Put some clothes on.

46
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,720
I'll get something warm for you.

47
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Are you cold?

48
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Here.

49
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Let me help.

50
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Careful.

51
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Don't worry.

52
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,560
I will be with you till you get better.

53
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,720
You gave him your heart for too long.

54
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,240
It's time to heal it now.

55
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,240
Let's end it, between us.

56
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,680
We should break up.

57
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,280
Lucky that you didn't lock the door.

58
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,800
I was wondering why you're still here.

59
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,720
I just pulled you out of the rain.

60
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,000
And look what you did.

61
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,720
I'm sorry Mark.

62
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,240
Just let it all out.

63
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,520
I'm here with you.

64
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
I still don't get it.

65
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,960
Is it really the end ?

66
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,080
Yesterday, we were still in love.

67
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,840
But today...

68
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,520
he doesn't love me anymore.

69
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
I can't stand it.

70
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,400
Can I ask...

71
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,840
Why did he leave ?

72
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
I don't know.

73
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,960
He never told me anything.

74
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,560
I don't want it to turn out this way, Mark.

75
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,880
It hurts so much.

76
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,120
How can I live?

77
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,280
I can't stand it anymore.

78
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,040
If it hurts,

79
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,040
just cry.

80
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,800
Cry it all out.

81
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,680
I'll be right here with you.

82
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,120
Sitting beside you

83
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,960
until you get better.

84
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,040
How can I be better?

85
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
I can't see how.

86
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,920
It's gonna be okay.

87
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,240
You are stronger than you think you are.

88
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,840
Ready! Let's do it.

89
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840


90
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,200
Sir, should we get a group picture?

91
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,240
Sure, come on.

92
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,120
Where should we?

93
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,440
Over here.

94
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Okay.

95
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,240


96
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
Let's count.

97
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,960
One...Two...

98
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
Three!

99
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,640
Let's do another boomerang.
(boomerang is a repeat motion picture function in Instagram.)

100
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
Okay, how?

101
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,240
Move like me.

102
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,960
One... Two...

103
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
Three!

104
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,400
Well! That's alright. Let’s start working.

105
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Sure.

106
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,760
Hope he'll see.

107
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
So strange.

108
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,120
Why aren’t Yu and Mark replying to me today?

109
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Here. Let me help.

110
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,080
Phai, why don't you ask your brother to visit us sometimes?

111
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,760
I heard that he's studying at the same college with Sab's brothers.

112
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,720
He's studying Medicine.

113
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,040
That sounds really hard.

114
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,200
He must be busy.

115
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,960
Thanks Sandee.

116
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,360
- It’s getting late.
- You're not gonna come in time.

117
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,280
Whose ID is after Pharawee Praphathanakul?

118
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
Me.

119
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,440
You can enter now, no need to wait for him.

120
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,320
Don't leave the space.

121
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,360
The Registration office just notified us that Pharawee was suspended

122
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,480
What's your problem, Pha?

123
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't have time to talk to you.

124
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,600
I didn't come to see you.

125
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,880
I'm here for that idiot Pha.

126
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,480
Pha is your senior, you jerk!

127
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,760
Why're you calling him that?

128
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,800
I won’t respect someone like him anymore.

129
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,800
Where's your friend?

130
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,240
I'm gonna find out what Yu did so wrong.

131
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,600
Why would Pha do this to him?

132
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
What has he done?

133
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,320
Pha broke up with Yu.

134
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
Huh!

135
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,560
You can’t imagine how upset my friend is.

136
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,840
He didn’t even give him a reason.

137
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,320
He cried all night.

138
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,720
Keeps on wondering what he did wrong to leave him.

139
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,360
He kept saying that he can't take it.

140
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,640
Can not live anymore.

141
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,600
And you still expect me to respect Pha?

142
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,240
You think getting mad at me is going to help your friend?

143
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,200
No need to go up there.

144
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,440
Pha's not around.

145
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
So where is he?

146
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,960
I don't know.

147
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,920
But you should probably take me to Yu.

148
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,680
<i>( Callback Survice )</i>

149
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,960
Someone wants to see you.

150
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
P'Kit.

151
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,000
Have you seen Pha recently?

152
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,400
Not yet.

153
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,160
I haven't seen him today.

154
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,480
But there was another exam today, wasn't there?

155
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,120
He didn't attend.

156
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,400
He's already filed for withdrawal.

157
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,120
Why did he have to go that far?

158
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,680
What's this all about?

159
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,320
No idea.

160
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,440
I called him at home but no one answered.

161
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,079
If he gets back to me, I will let you know.

162
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,960
Why is your face looking so pale?

163
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,880
Did you eat anything?

164
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,240
You haven't eaten anything at all?

165
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Here.

166
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
Take this.

167
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,680
I'll find you something to eat.

168
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,440
Hey! Why're you following me here. How about Yu?

169
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
He's getting changed.

170
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,640
You don’t need to find anything for him.

171
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,840
Let's take him somewhere to eat.

172
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,840
Will he be fine with that?

173
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,680
Nothing gets better if he still locks himself in his room.

174
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,040
Only being depressed by old memories…

175
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,920
Kit.

176
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,400
What’s up? How's your training?

177
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,160
Yu. Mark.

178
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Hey.

179
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,320
Whoa!

180
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,880
I’m the only one who doesn’t know anyone.

181
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,920
Let sit there.

182
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Come​ on.

183
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,840
Seriously soft, like you must try this,

184
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,160
Vanilla Cold Brew!

185
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,480
For you my stepbrother,

186
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,440
anything you want but I would recommend

187
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,520
the Gotu kola Syrup on top.

188
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,280
For your health. Getting Immunity.

189
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,200
Alright, Silly.

190
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,680
Come and get your prize here.

191
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,400
For Yu,

192
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,800
Sansab said your favorite is Pink Milk

193
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,160
but today's special drink is coffee,

194
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,760
so we would like to recommend this one.

195
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,640
Here you go. Hot Cappuccino for a goofy but warm guy like Yu.

196
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,200
When the froth stays on your lip,

197
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,640
then your man can wipe it for you.

198
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,160
Well. How's Pha. Didn't he come with you guys?

199
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,800
Come on Yu, when are you gonna show him to me.

200
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,400
Keep him away for what? Huh!

201
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Sab. Shh!

202
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,880
No Pha anymore.

203
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
He...

204
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,120
left me.

205
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,080
Oh well... He left you.

206
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Hah?

207
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Mark.

208
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
Take Kit to clean his shirt.

209
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
It's messed up.

210
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,440
Sab. What a silly question!

211
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,840
I didn't know.

212
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,600
Why’d they break up?

213
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:56,400
I did not even see his face and now he becomes my brother's ex already.

214
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,880
Let me help.

215
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,080
Heartless.

216
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,920
He can't imagine,

217
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,160
how many times

218
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,480
Yu got into this kind of situation.

219
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,800
Ofcourse,

220
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,920
He'll never know.

221
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,280
Set up this problem and then disappears.

222
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,440
No responsibility.

223
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,520
Can you stop blaming my friend?

224
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Your friend hurt Yu this much

225
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,240
and you're protecting him?

226
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,960
Because he’s my friend.

227
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,880
You protect yours

228
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,800
and I protect mine.

229
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,520
You guys are probably the same.

230
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,880
You're gonna talk to me this way?

231
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
Kit.

232
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,040
Wait, please.

233
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Get off.

234
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,040
Listen to me.

235
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,800
I didn't mean to make you upset.

236
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,680
I'm sorry for what I said.

237
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,600
I don’t blame you, Mark, if you're mad for Yu.

238
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,760
But Pha is my friend, too.

239
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,480
I won't allow anyone to curse him.

240
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,400
He doesn't even get a chance to explain.

241
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,320
If you don't know all the truth, it's no right to judge him.

242
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,600
And another thing you might’ve forgotten.

243
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,320
The one you wanna blame isn't here.

244
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,840
It's only me

245
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,480
that's hearing all those curses.

246
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
Not Pharawee.

247
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,280
I'm…

248
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,280
Get off.

249
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,000
We should get out and see your friend.

250
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,400
Wayu suffered enough.

251
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,760
Don't raise him with these nonsenses.

252
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,880
You feel it too, right?

253
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,800
It's so awkward.

254
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,920
Ahem.

255
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,720
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

256
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
Okay.

257
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,920
How about you guys?

258
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,960
I'm okay.

259
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,280
Me too.

260
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
Hello.

261
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,000
Okay Okay Okay. I'm going.

262
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,400
It's my friend.

263
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,200
I have tutoring this evening, totally forgot.

264
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
So...

265
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,080
You should leave.

266
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
I'm okay now.

267
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,080
I'm gonna go.

268
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,960
Call me anytime you need me.

269
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
That's Kit's pen.

270
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Um.

271
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,160
Why don’t you return it to him?

272
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,600
He's gone.

273
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,280
Mark

274
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,720
If you are really okay,

275
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,160
you should probably follow him now.

276
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,680
You and Kit were fighting because of me, right?

277
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,640
No.

278
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,160
But why don’t you follow him?

279
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,560
Because…

280
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,920
I can use this to see him again at the college.

281
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
Don't think about it too much.

282
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Why is the coffee so bitter?

283
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,600
Is it bitter coffee or bitter love, Mark?

284
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,680
Here's again, Sab!

285
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
We should get back.

286
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
Okay.

287
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
You first.

288
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Thank you.

289
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
Ahem.

290
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,120
I saw how sweetly you were looking at my brother.

291
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,640
That's your brother,

292
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,720
Wayu? The newest Science beau?

293
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,480
You know Yu?

294
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,440
I see. You are interested in him right?

295
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,560
I wanna get a cocoa frappuccino

296
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,280
and brownie.

297
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,240
Order anyting you want. They’re on me.

298
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,320
Let's get something for your brother.

299
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,240
Tell him

300
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,880
that it from Koh, sophomore from Dentistry.

301
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,720
Here. Payslip.

302
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,480
Sir, but the price is only…

303
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
Keep the change.

304
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,360
Thank you sir!

305
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,160
So obvious.

306
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,760
Just wanna cheer up my dear brother.

307
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,320
Hey. I have a question.

308
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,680
What's the definition of love for Sab and Phai?

309
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,120
Love and feed me well.

310
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
What!

311
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,400
Just kidding.

312
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,760
My definition of love?

313
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:36,200
Love is inevitable destiny.

314
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,520
Whoa!

315
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,040
Can't believe that you have a little corner for Fairy Tales!

316
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,080
How about you Phai? What is love for you?

317
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Hmm.

318
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,320
Tell me why do you want to know?

319
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,000
I've got an idea to use some gimmick for our cafe.

320
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Pok.

321
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,680
Make sure their legs keep kicking on the surface.

322
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
Sure.

323
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,480
Very good. Hold it. Hold it.

324
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480


325
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,960
Don't run, okay.

326
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,360
Hey, Pok.

327
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Finish teaching?

328
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,200
Another group left.

329
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,560
What are you doing?

330
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,400
We're working on the new gimmick for our internship place.

331
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,840
The idea is asking

332
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,920
our customers to  share their own definition of love in the jar.

333
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,400
Then we'll attach them at the café's board.

334
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,560
Looks like your cafe doesn't have many customers,

335
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,720
if you still having time for this stuff.

336
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,000
We need to do an achievement.

337
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,240
So we can get something on the report for our professor.

338
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,160
We wouldn't be like you, Shark Pok, the youth swimmer.

339
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,880
A tight schedule swimming teacher.

340
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,280
Being in the waiting list of the Collegue's quota.

341
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,680
Who don't even need to do the entrance exam!

342
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,640
But it might be wasted

343
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,520
because he probably won't pass the match exam.

344
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,960
Ouch!

345
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,880
Well, how are your studies so far?

346
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
Don't you need to retest?

347
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,920
I gotta go teaching.

348
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Hey, wait!

349
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,160
Come on. Come on.

350
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,840
Since you're here, you can be the first.

351
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,680
Write us a definition of love. Just one.

352
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
Sure.

353
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,480
Hey, Tong!

354
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,440
Hello, teacher Pok.

355
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,360
Hello.

356
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,920
Go. Let's change your clothes.

357
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920


358
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,080
I'm handing my brother to you.

359
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,840
Please take care of him.

360
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,560
Thanks.

361
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560


362
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,199
Gotta go.

363
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,280
Wait, Tong. Don’t leave yet.

364
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
I'd like to ask for your help.

365
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,040
Well,

366
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,040
Pok didn't pass the mid-exam.

367
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,080
Do you have sometimes after your job, helping him as a tutor?

368
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,080
As a top score student, give mercy to a silly friend.

369
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,480
Just for a favor.

370
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,240
Sure, I'll do it.

371
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,080
Let's talk later, okay?.

372
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
Thanks.

373
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,520
Okay.

374
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Bye.

375
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,480
Here, Sab.

376
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,400
I gotta go teach now.

377
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
Okay.

378
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,520
Let's see what he wrote.

379
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,520
Love’s more than friends.

380
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,920
Whoa!!

381
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,440
I was around and decided to wait for you.

382
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,080
Here, your favorite right?

383
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,120
Thank you, pal.

384
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,440
Didn't you go to Medicine Faculty today?

385
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,280
He's so busy,

386
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,160
I don’t wanna disturb him.

387
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,720
Kit finished his exams and you know it.

388
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,280
Well…

389
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,840
Don't lie.

390
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,280
You're  just giving me an excuse to stay with me.

391
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,280
You know me too well.

392
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,400
How can I not know? It's been over 10 years since we've known each other.

393
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,720
I also know that

394
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,920
you're serious about Kit, unlike the others.

395
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,240
It's Okay. I'm really fine.

396
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,520
But It's not good

397
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,280
that you're wasting your time with me

398
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,000
and forgot to take care of yourself.

399
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,040
Go talk to Kit

400
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,120
or else you'll regret it.

401
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,840
The one you wanna blame isn't here.

402
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,120
It's only me that's hearing all those curses.

403
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,080
Not Pharawee.

404
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,640
Go talk to Kit

405
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,280
or you'll regret it.

406
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,680
Hey! Where are you going, Mark?

407
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,200
Going?

408
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,960
Nowhere, just wanna go back to my dorm.

409
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,400
Good. Let's go shopping.

410
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,280
But…

411
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,920
You have a good taste. Come give me a hand.

412
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,120
I wanna look smart like you.

413
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,240
Come on… Don't you dare refuse your senior, bro?

414
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,080
Yes. How dare you, Bro!

415
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
Come on.

416
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,160
Kit.

417
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,680
I don't wanna talk...

418
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,000
It's okay, sir.

419
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,480
But someone delivered this for you.

420
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,840
Give it to Wayu.

421
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,560
Pha!

422
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,480
This might be the only clue we have.

423
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,560
Kit. I'm scared.

424
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,200
If you don't wanna accept it, I can give it back.

425
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,760
I'll respect your decision.

426
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,080
But all I know is

427
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,160
I believe, Pha must have a reason for this.

428
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
Wayu.

429
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,840
Pha really loves you.

430
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,360
If it's really love...

431
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,680
then why did he leave his lover?

432
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,040
If I were him, I wouldn't do that at all.

433
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,840
Wayu, I gotta go.

434
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,080
Mark. Follow him!

435
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,880
No. I'm more worried about you.

436
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,000
Asking someone to give this to you

437
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,800
and he’s nowhere.

438
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,840
Why didn't he give it himself.

439
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,480
I don't like the way he did it.

440
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,480
Let me throw it away.

441
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,480
Hey!

442
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,800
Even though I don’t know what's inside.

443
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,720
At least,

444
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,160
It ensures me that Pha still is in this world.

445
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,600
He hasn't left.

446
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,000
He's still watching me from somewhere.

447
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,920
It's not only in my dreams.

448
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,600
I know that you are worried about me.

449
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,760
But let me handle it on my own.

450
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,880
Give me some time,

451
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,760
I'll be better soon.

452
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,800
It won’t be long.

453
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,400
You don’t need to be so protective.

454
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,080
you must go back spending time on hitting on Kit like always.

455
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,040
Okay.

456
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,960
Then hurry to get better,

457
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,920
don't let me worry for  too long, understood?

458
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,920
Sure.

459
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,920
Haven’t eaten anything yet, right? Here.

460
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,320
Come on.

461
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,640
Let's go to your room.

462
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,880
Pha!

463
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,160
Have you ever heard the tale of “The frog prince”?

464
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,640
The charming prince's been cursed to be a frog.

465
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,760
And will only return to human once he gets true love kiss.

466
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,440
Now I've met with my prince.

467
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,960
Here in front of me.

468
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,080
Be my prince, Pha.

469
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,520
Pha...

470
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,520
I kissed the frog,

471
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,440
please come back to me.

472
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,680
It's today.

473
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,120
My dearest Mark.

474
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,360
Today we better get some exercise.

475
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,360
Come on get in.

476
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,720
Hurry, come on man!

477
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,520
- Fast.
- Stop wasting time.

478
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,640
Come on,

479
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,760
hurry up.

480
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,960
I think today we should start with Cardio first.

481
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,480
Let's do weight training, I'm ready for it.

482
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,200
Cardio should be later, weights first.

483
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,480
How about letting our little brother choose.

484
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,120
Mark, what do you want to start with?

485
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,880
It doesn’t matter. You guys can choose.

486
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,720
Is that our college's student?

487
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,320
I think he is.

488
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:02,160
Whoa. So small but such a badass.

489
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,560
He can knock anyone with a punch.

490
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,720
But I think he's quite cute.

491
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,200
If I tease him a bit, will he punch my mouth?

492
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,680
Yeah, he might.

493
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,840
You guys can go and choose what to do today.

494
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,280
Whoa.

495
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,600
What's the hurry?

496
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,160
Such a fierce and tough punch but careful

497
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,680
you'll scare everyone away.

498
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,600
I know you're thinking about my face when you punch the sack right?

499
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,640
Hey. Kit don't go.

500
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,160
Jack. Jew. I'm gonna go.

501
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,840
Okay. See ya.

502
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,520
Hey, Mark. You've just been here a sec.

503
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,480
Not even sweating.

504
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,520
The prestige of the Beau award just returned to us

505
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,040
and we're gonna lose it to medicine again! What a world!

506
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,160
Pisses me off!

507
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,120
Hey Hey Hey.

508
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:57,200
Calm down. You can’t fight with the sack. Relax.

509
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
You wanna go in there with me?

510
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,440
Oh.. Please.

511
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,560
May I join you in your car?

512
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,880
I came with my seniors but they're not finish yet.

513
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,880
I didn't bring my car.

514
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,480
I'm fine if you just drop me at the entrance.

515
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,320
Come on Kit.

516
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:18,200
You know it's quite dangerous around here. I noticed it since I arrived.

517
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,760
And it's already late. Must be even scarier.

518
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,600
If I go back alone,

519
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,800
I may be dragged by a thief.

520
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,200
Will you not be worried about me if they try to harass me?

521
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,320
Okay.

522
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,280
If you're not gonna help, I won't get out.

523
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,280
We'll be stuck here together in the car all night.

524
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,600
Are you okay with that?

525
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,600
Just let me join you.

526
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,680
Please…

527
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,040
Come on.

528
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,360
Well, Yu's getting better lately

529
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,840
But I've gotta find him something to do,

530
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,640
so he won’t be distracted.

531
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,520
Should we drag him to learn how to drive?

532
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,040
Okay, deal. So we'll arrange it then.

533
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,560
And you gotta go with us.

534
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,160
All I know is

535
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,440
is that you must share the responsibility with Pha.

536
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,680
Speaking of him...

537
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,240
Do you remember the day you gave Yu a parcel?

538
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,480
I was really mad!

539
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,080
Leaving him,

540
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,600
but leaving him hope.

541
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,320
What was he thinking?

542
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,160
What kind of person is he?

543
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,200
But you know what?

544
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,680
I wanna thank him

545
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,640
for giving that gift to Yu.

546
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,200
At least it made me see his smile again.

547
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,440
Our minds are so contradictory

548
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,080
Oh!

549
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,360
You left this at the café.

550
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,200
It's broken so I fixed it for you.

551
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,360
Now, it can be used again.

552
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,720
So...

553
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,400
I’ll put here then.

554
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,560
Actually I wanted to return it to you long ago

555
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,640
and I would...

556
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,400
I’d like to say sorry

557
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,760
for the day when I shouted at you.

558
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,200
I didn't wanna see you so mad.

559
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,600
And it was really messy.

560
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,120
Everything that happened

561
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,560
and Yu's stuff.

562
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,440
I was really worried about him and couldn't leave him alone.

563
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,600
Kit...

564
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,360
Would you forgive me?

565
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:27,760
You keep acting like I'm not here,

566
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,680
It's killing me...

567
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,960
Just tell me what to do.

568
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,880
You can punch me, if it's gonna make you feel better.

569
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,240
If you're still quiet,

570
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,680
I'll kiss you.

571
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,520
Let's see if you're gonna talk.

572
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,560
You wanna leave me here?

573
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,800
Watching you and Kit playing like kids was fun.

574
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:38,880
But i would be so happy if I've got Pha sitting beside me.

575
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,840
Do you believe in destiny?

576
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,560
Not sure. Never experienced it before.

577
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,040
Guess I don't.

578
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,640
How about soulmates?

579
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,960
I saw you jumping in the car with that medicine student.

580
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,520
Who wants a lover,

581
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,600
A friend with benefits is way more comfortable.

582
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,360
Pha!

583
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,680
Wait, Pha. Don’t leave.

584
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,000
You are back.

585
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:16,720
Bas

586
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,320
Can you teach me how to confess my love with a snack?

587
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,600
Sure.

588
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,880
Here it is.

589
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,800
The last one, here.

590
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,440
And how is it gonna work?

591
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,760
Like this.

592
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,480
Good idea. So cute.

593
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,840
Lemme do it.

594
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,360
How is it again?
