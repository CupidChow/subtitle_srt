1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,360
Are you gonna bite me again?

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,320
It's not only Comm. Arts' studens love you,

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,880
but also Engineering's students too.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,840
What do I jealous for? We aren't boyfriends.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,520
So how many kisses you need, to make me be your boyfriend?

6
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,120
Are we gonna get back now?

7
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,160
Or you wanna keep talking until dawn.

8
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,960
Well.. If you'll stay with me until dawn and find somewhere to sleep oop!

9
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
find somewhere to sit and talk.

10
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,920
Mark!

11
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,280
Um. Just a little joke

12
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,240
and you wanna kill me?

13
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,520
So will you agree to be my boyfriend?

14
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,120
I won't agree to anything with you.

15
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,920
Gosh. Why do you have to make it difficult?

16
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,360
Why don’t you just flirt with someone who's easier?

17
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,600
No way! I’ll be right here even when you piss me off.

18
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,160
You are so shameless.

19
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,120
Please don’t push me away to anyone else.

20
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,800
I have only you

21
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,520
even how hard it is or how long it will be.

22
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,640
I'll wait until the day you call me your boyfriend.

23
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,920
Stay here as long as you want but get your hand off me.

24
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,280
Don't be sneaky!

25
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,440
Get your hand off of me!

26
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,400
Wait. I haven't left a mark yet.

27
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,840
What the hell is it?

28
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,040
I marked you now. No one can ever take you from me.

29
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,920
Do you know why I kissed you here?

30
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,320
Because the pulse point is right here.

31
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,720
Wish my feeling could reach you.

32
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,880
Kit.

33
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,360
May I ask you something?

34
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,920
No.

35
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Aargh.

36
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,080
You haven't heard it yet. Don't deny it so quickly. Look into my eyes.

37
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
No.

38
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,600
I told you don’t touch my ear.

39
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,159
But you weren't listening.

40
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,520
What? What do you think I'm asking for?

41
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,159
Is it dirty?

42
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:56,159
Mark! I'm not you who think only those filthy stuffs.

43
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,400
I just wanna hug you.

44
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,760
That's all.

45
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,760
Mission to win Wayu's heart

46
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,440
Crushing it before eating. Sounds good.

47
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,280
If you aren’t scared of me sinking your ship. Just come. Captain Jack.

48
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,480
Truce. Truce.

49
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,840
Go to your corner please.

50
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,720
Um. Let's go through the rules again, please.

51
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,640
No personal texts to Wayu.

52
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
For transparency.

53
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,560
What! So you want only us talking?

54
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,920
Who do you want me to flirt, Koh or Wayu?

55
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,080
If Captain Jack wants to change your ship.

56
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,600
What are you gonna say, Koh?

57
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,680
I'll kick his ass out of my ship. It's full already.

58
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,680
So, Let's see.

59
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,440
As you guys are aware, it's not that easy to flirt with our Wayu.

60
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,280
Therefore, I'll give you some assistance.

61
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,360
There he is!!

62
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,840
Hey! Mark! Cancel it now.

63
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,720
Hello!

64
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm Sansab, Wayu's brother and studying in High School.

65
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,840
If you choose to be in my team, You'll get a lot of Wayu's top secrets.

66
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,160
Well, It's up to you guys which team you're gonna choose.

67
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,320
Brother's team or BFF's team?

68
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,760
And here're the benefits of BFF's team.

69
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,920
Hard selling with compliments, and unlimited support.

70
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,000
You'll be praised until the mission is accomplished.

71
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,000
What are you playing?

72
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,680
You guys need to choose the team now.

73
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,880
- BFF's team.
- Brother's team.

74
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,840
Okay, deal.

75
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,120
Just to let you know… I'm being serious about hitting on you, Wayu.

76
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,120
Yeah, He's kinda chop.

77
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,200
He wishes only to sleep with you. Don't get close to him.

78
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,240
You better be with Engineer guy. Right Mark?

79
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,000
Um, that's right.

80
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,200
Yeah, I do wish to chop.

81
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,360
Chop your weapon off, so you can't use it for your whole life .

82
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,480
Hey! That's red-handed! Koh's trying to chop me!

83
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,120
Banned for life. Kick him off the group!

84
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,200
Wait. Wait. Stop chopping him now.

85
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,440
Don't forget that we have a minor in this group, there!

86
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:15,320
It's alright. I just wanna tell you that Yu likes a gentle and nice guy.

87
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,120
I'm…. just kidding.

88
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,720
Let me show you how gentle I am.

89
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,440
Is that so Koh?

90
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,040
If I see you next time,

91
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,560
would you pay respect to me for proving of your gentleman?

92
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,200
Don't worry Wayu. I'm only kind to a cute person

93
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,160
but gonna bug with some playboy… Hey!

94
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,120
Don't discredit another opponent like that.

95
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,640
Why don't we fight by using our advantages.

96
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,040
You started it first.

97
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,840
You wanna fight?

98
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,000
Wanna fight? Wanna fight?

99
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,640
Come on!

100
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,200
Mute!

101
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,240
Don't you wanna talk to me?

102
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,840
Where're you?

103
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,960
Pha

104
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,080
What's that name?

105
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,800
Change it now.

106
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,000
Why? It’s so cute.

107
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,840
Are you gonna change?

108
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,800
Nope-never!

109
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,440
Are you gonna change it or not?

110
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
Nope-never!

111
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,480
I'll be a stubborn kid today.

112
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,600
Mark, You jackass.

113
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,840
This is an order, change it now.

114
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,880
Don’t you wanna come punishing a stubborn kid here?

115
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,720
Then I'm gonna change it for you.

116
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,840
Change to any name you like. Up to you.

117
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,520
I don't have time to see anyone until I finished the exam.

118
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,480
Whoa! That's too long. I wanna meet you now.

119
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,520
Also wanna see your face.

120
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,480
May I?

121
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,600
No. I'm going to do some reading now.

122
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,440
Change the name. That's all.

123
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,920
Waaaaaaa.

124
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,240
Why can't I call you? Is there anyone with you?

125
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,480
Don't cheat on me. I get jealous.

126
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,320
Stop being a prat, it's such rubbish.

127
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,040
and let me warn you here.

128
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,600
Don’t play that cracked game like you did to Wayu with me ever,

129
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,640
or you're dead.

130
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,440
But I wanna show you off to everyone.

131
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,880
So they will be aware that you are mine.

132
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,680
Mine here.

133
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,240
Mine here… and here.

134
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,800
Stop repeating it, or I will…

135
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,040
Kit... It's me.

136
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,440
Pha.

137
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:59,600
Wayu has a new boyfriend?

138
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,080
When did he get here?

139
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,240
Here's Cocoa Frappuccino with whip cream, Koh.

140
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
The world is so small right,  Mark?

141
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,280
Are you sneaking to pull me a secret?

142
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,920
Let see who's the one that gonna be pulled the secret, Sab.

143
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,240
If anyone pulled mine, I would pull him back. No cheating.

144
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,280
Stop arguing. Let's get to the point, Koh.

145
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,360
Look at him. Doing his homework.

146
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,840
Why don’t you do that too, Mark?

147
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,000
Did I pick the right side?

148
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,920
Jack,

149
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,840
shoot me quick if you wanna ask me about Yu. I'm gonna go on an errand shortly.

150
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,440
This guy! You keep being lodge at Medicine all day.

151
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,480
Don't get a lover before your senior, understand?

152
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,720
Come on. Once I ended up with Kit, I would fully support you.

153
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like it.

154
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,680
Do you want me to kiss Wayu right away, Mark!?

155
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,000
Is that what you want?

156
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,160
Let see, who's beaten and who's kissed.

157
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,400
Koh, what did you say?

158
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,920
Are you going to beat me? You ask for it.

159
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,760
Don’t wanna be beaten, so you wanna be kissed?

160
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,320
Oh! So actually you wanna kiss me right Koh?

161
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,520
Choose it. Left foot or right foot first?

162
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,520
Err… stop it. I saw your energy and got the idea

163
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,560
Just a second. You guys can beat and kiss anywhere you want after this.

164
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,120
Hey. Are you sure that they are 2nd year and 3rd year college students. Mark?

165
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,040
It's more believable if you tell me they are 2nd and 3rd year primary student.

166
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,120
I think the same with you.

167
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,760
Ahem.

168
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,680
Well, okay.

169
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,160
As I have analyzed it, it's hard to get Wayu.

170
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,880
Because he hasn't opened his mind for a new guy yet.

171
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,880
So, Koh and Jack,,,

172
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,240
Firstly, you both need to work together on making Wayu forget Pha.

173
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,280
And how are we supposed to do that, Sansab?

174
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,040
Well…

175
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,080
Such a silly question!  A new guy must be better than an ex ofcourse.

176
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,600
Ummmm,

177
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,960
Pha is just a College Beau.

178
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,400
Jack can easily defeat him.

179
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,000
How can he fight with his no-name?

180
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,680
In case you don't know, Sansab.

181
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,960
I was a Dentistry's Beau on my freshman year.

182
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,520
Awwww. In my freshman year?

183
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,720
If I haven't sacrifice the Beau award to Thanu

184
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,280
the College Beau award of that year must be mine, Jongjet.

185
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:09,560
Um! For this handsome challenge, I'm... gonna give it to Koh.

186
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,839
He's been supported by his real award.

187
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,640
How tall are you, Koh?

188
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,839
183 cm

189
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh! You're shorter than me.

190
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,920
What's the size of your shoes, Jack?

191
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,200
I'm sure that mine is bigger.

192
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,760
45 cms.

193
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,240
The same size of shoes and a bit differ of height.

194
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,960
I don’t think we can count them as a competition.

195
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,680
I'm so sure that mine is bigger.

196
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,600
If you doubt, why don’t you take it off and measure it with me?

197
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,320
Come on, Jack. I'm not small at all.

198
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,920
Err… Can we just end at the size of shoes, please?

199
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,440
Don't need to measure anything else.

200
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,200
I'm pretty sure that the censors won't approve.

201
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,040
This mission has ended without knowing who's the winner right,  Mark?

202
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,080
What I'm sure of... I'm gonna go defeating Kit now.

203
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,360
Please take care of them for me bro.

204
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,800
Thank you so much Kit.

205
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,800
If I don't have your lecture, I surely can't catch up with the lessons.

206
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,360
Don't worry, we are brothers.

207
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,840
Even next semester when we have to study in the same class, you'll still be my brother.

208
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,120
Whoa! there're a lot of queues, relax.

209
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,240
Come on Padbok.

210
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,520
Then why did he show up in front of me.

211
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,080
Is that Dr. Kit, the one that Mark keeps flirting around?

212
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,840
They look so close, that's why Mark needs to keep an eye on him everyday.

213
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,520
Is he Thanu's junior from Medicine?

214
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,000
Um.

215
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,520
Follow me.

216
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,080
What about Jew?

217
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,080
He will stop me again. Only you and me is fine.

218
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,280
All of your friends are already here, where are you?

219
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,480
I'm not a kid who's waiting for a parent to pick him up, Mark.

220
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,440
Dr. Kit, do you have time? Can I talk to you?

221
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,560
I heard that you're quite close to Thanu?

222
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,240
If I am, what are you gonna do?

223
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,360
If you don't wanna get into trouble, stay away from him. Do you understand?

224
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,640
Lock the door.

225
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,520
Padbok, I beg you. Don't pick a fight.

226
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,320
I won't do anything. Just a little talk.

227
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,760
go lock the door!

228
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,600
What!?

229
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,960
I'll make you understand why you must obey what the senior asks.

230
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,920
Are you going to stay away from Thanu?

231
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,000
No.

232
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,200
Are you sure?

233
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,360
Are you scared of getting one by one?

234
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,280
One by one is fine. I'm good.

235
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,880
Come on fast, don't waste your time barking.

236
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,880
Look at you carefully, you're cute.

237
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,720
But your mouth needs a lesson.

238
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,360
Hey! Padbok Padbok.

239
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,640
Kit! Kit, are you in there?

240
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,000
Padbok, what are we gonna do?

241
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,800
Remember it.

242
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:45,160
If you don't stay away from Thanu, It won't be done easily.

243
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,680
Kit.

244
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,560
What have you done with him?

245
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,600
Hey! Mark! Mark, calm down.

246
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,680
Easy man. Kit didn’t get that much hurt.

247
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,440
It's nothing. Just some misunderstanding.

248
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,160
Misunderstanding?

249
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,120
Tell me what has he done to you?

250
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,480
Who's dare hurting him?

251
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,280
Such a cute face. It’s a shame if he must have any scratch.

252
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,520
You!

253
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,000
Mark!

254
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,160
Enough.

255
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,840
I'm begging you.

256
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,720
Padbok, go! Let's go.

257
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,840
Sit here.

258
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,280
You called Mark here right?

259
00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:00,320
Yes. If I didn’t, What would have happened to Dr. Kit?

260
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,480
You said you just wanted to scare him.

261
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,240
I didn't want to do anything to him. He started it first.

262
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,760
We just ended well with those Comm. Arts' people,

263
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,360
you now pick a fight with Medicine's kid again?

264
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,240
and you even have a problem with Mark, your junior.

265
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,480
He’s only a freshman.

266
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,200
But the guy that you just strangled, is his special one.

267
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:32,200
You can't blame him if Mark lost respect for you.

268
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,400
does it hurt too much?

269
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,520
I'm not dead.

270
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,480
Is there anywhere else he touched you?

271
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,400
Why do you wanna know that bad?

272
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,320
Just tell me.

273
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,520
Here?

274
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,240
Hey. It's enough.

275
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,440
I'm sorry. If I came faster you wouldn’t get hurt.

276
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,480
It's not your fault.

277
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,440
I wanna get hurt for you.

278
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,240
I'm not that weak.

279
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,040
I know you're scared.

280
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,240
It's alright.

281
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,480
I will protect you. There's no one who can hurt you anymore.

282
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,280
Stop. It's enough.

283
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,800
I'll keep doing it until you aren't hurt anymore.

284
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,200
Wait Koh, let me go through here first.

285
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,160
Don’t cheat, Wayu.

286
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,600
Look. Just suggest him any fun games. Wayu, he likes playing games.

287
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,240
Once he gets addicted, he would follow you anywhere.

288
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,800
Good. Good. I like it.

289
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,360
I've never gone through it!

290
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
Here. Give it to me.

291
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,960
Let me play for you. It needs to play this way. Watch me.

292
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,480
How's it?

293
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,000
Sorry.

294
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,200
Don't need to say sorry. You know how I think about you.

295
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,000
Koh. I'm…

296
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,520
I know what will you say. Knock me first and I will listen to you.

297
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,680
But now you lost. Let me dip your cheek.

298
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,000
Hey, Koh. I'm not a child.

299
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,360
Come here. Let me dip your cheek.

300
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,800
Ahem. What are you guys doing?

301
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,560
Flirting.

302
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,960
Really? Stay back it's my turn. Out of the way!

303
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,480
So I can continue hitting on him.

304
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,240
Wayu, why do you look away from me?

305
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,920
It's your friend. What he did to Kit?

306
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,920
You know that Mark is very protective of Kit.

307
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,240
He kept escorting him around for almost 24 hours without resting.

308
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,440
Don't be mad at me, Wayu.

309
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,360
I assure you that Padbok will not bother Kit again.

310
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,840
He was in a bad mood that day and didn't mean to do it.

311
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,960
He can't stand it when someone is protecting Thanu.

312
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,720
What was going on between Padbok and Thanu?

313
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,160
Well…

314
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,320
There're a lot of uninvolved people around here. I think…

315
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,160
we better move to another place.

316
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,240
No way. Wayu is playing games with me.

317
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,600
Koh, I'll get back to play with you later.

318
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,280
So let me go with you.

319
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,360
Ah. Ah. Ah. This is a private thing between me and Wayu.

320
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,000
You don't need to know about it, Koh.

321
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,360
let's go Wayu.

322
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,920
Jack!

323
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,360
We are sitting here like lovers,don’t you think?

324
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,800
So will you tell me what Thanu has done?

325
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,600
You seem so interested in him. Don’t tell me that you have a crush on him.

326
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,920
How can I like him? I saw him a few times.

327
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,480
Hmm.

328
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,160
Well. I believe you. It’s good that you don't like him.

329
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,720
Just so you know, it's wasting time for anyone who likes him.

330
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,600
I've never seen him interested in anyone since I've known him.

331
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,760
It's me and Padbok that needed to take care of those pity girls for him. Oh!

332
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,880
I mean only Padbok.

333
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,200
Well. So it wasn't about girls.

334
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,400
Nope.

335
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,440
We tried forcing him to get a girl since High School.

336
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,120
Don't know if he’s insensitive or not, but he kept ditching people around.

337
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,680
I don’t wanna brag but listen, we have 4 people in our group.

338
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,080
Padbok, Thanu, me and Jew.

339
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,360
Four of us were hot freshmen.

340
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,720
Surrounded by those girls screaming at us.

341
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:30,680
Can you answer me now about what happened between Padbok and Thanu?

342
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,400
You won’t take all day telling me right?

343
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,160
I told you a lot of things. Be patient, I'll let you know more next time we meet.

344
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,760
Alright, I'm gonna ask from Padbok myself then.

345
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,120
Don't rush, Wayu.

346
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,400
You shouldn’t worry about that. I sent Jew to deal with it already

347
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,800
Padbok's gonna say sorry to Kit in a few days.

348
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,320
Really?

349
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,280
If he doesn’t, you can punish me anyway you want.

350
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,040
Come, eat snacks with me.

351
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,960
it's better than playing game with Koh.

352
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,080
My game is more fun.

353
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,080
Hmm.

354
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,480
You and Koh aren’t any better than Thanu and Padbok actually.

355
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,040
How long have you guys been enemies?

356
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,400
Koh's not even on my level. He has nothing to fight me with.

357
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,040
He's never been in my sights.

358
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,920
Never been in your sight but you talk about him every 10 minutes.

359
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,400
Koh's this, Koh's that and Koh's those.

360
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,560
Are you crushing on him?

361
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,720
I know.

362
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,680
You pretend to flirt with me but actually you just find a way to talk to Koh, don't you?

363
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,720
What!

364
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,880
Me? Crushing on him? In your dreams!

365
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,160
How's Yuki?

366
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,400
Ask her yourself. Don’t ask me.

367
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,000
Do you think she's gonna talk to me?

368
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,360
I'm just worried. Yuki should be with a better man than me.

369
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,440
And don't you wanna be a better man?

370
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:55,360
I don’t wanna be a hero. I prefer being a villain, it's more fun.

371
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,720
We'll be in the final year soon. When will you stop being so childish?

372
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,240
I've never seen you have a serious relationship with anyone yet.

373
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,960
and when you hate someone, you're just straight up picking a fight with them.

374
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,320
I managed myself a lot, only one thing I won't.

375
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,960
But you need to consider. About Kit, you must say sorry to him.

376
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,480
I don't wanna get any problem with Mark.

377
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,280
Don't try to convince me.

378
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,000
There's nothing to be scared of that freshman.

379
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But I've even asked for his help to deal with your problem about Yuki before.

380
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,400
I never asked for it.

381
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,440
Yes, you're right.

382
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,800
But he did. Because he respected you as a brother from the same faculty.

383
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,840
Is it gonna hurt that much?

384
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,480
If you're just responsible for what you did as his senior.

385
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,280
Then why did his guy mess with a person he shouldn’t?

386
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,880
It's been a year. Why don’t you get over with Thanu?

387
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,639
He betrayed my trust as a friend. I won’t make it over easily.

388
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,679
Once he gets back to study, I'll be ready to welcome him.

389
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,639
Why're you here?

390
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,040
Padbok. Padbok.

391
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,440
Can’t you talk to him good just once?

392
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,440
Let him do it, Jew. If it makes you feel better. Do it.

393
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:10,240
Before you punch him! Don’t forget what he took for you on that day.

394
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,520
Come on!

395
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,760
Thanu!

396
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,760
Don't let me see your face again.

397
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,080
I can't guarantee what will happen to you next time.

398
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,080
Don't step into my problem between me and him again.

399
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,360
Why's he so stubborn?

400
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,720
Padbok is always the same. Never change.

401
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,840
So how about you? When are you going to tell him the truth?

402
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,280
It's not the right time.

403
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:47,760
Love is finding someone who makes you understand this word.

404
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,680
Are you alright?

405
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,600
Sandee

406
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,720
How am I gonna find someone if I didn’t know anything about him?

407
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,680
Try twitter? Make an announcement through it, isn't it good?

408
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,480
I don’t have any information,

409
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,440
not even picture or name. How am I supposed to follow him?

410
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,760
If you believe in destiny, you'll find him soon.

411
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,640
Come, let's go home.

412
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,120
It's enough for today.

413
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,840
I must go practicing my sport.

414
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,320
If I'm not fit, I might not get an admissions quota.

415
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,560
Don't think that far.

416
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,840
If you didn’t pass this exam, you won't graduate from High School.

417
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,960
Even if you have a University sports quota, you still can’t get in.

418
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,240
Pok!

419
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,000
Concentrate on your study, so Phai can be relieved.

420
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,880
Do you know that he called and begged me everyday?

421
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,080
Asked me to do anything for pushing you through this exam.

422
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,520
I should have been spending time on my sport practicing.

423
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,600
Don't forget that I'm a School athlete, chief.

424
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,760
No negotiation. Do it quick.

425
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,480
If I could do it, I would pass this exam for long ago.

426
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,120
Just memorize the answers.

427
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,400
Here're the exam forecasts I picked for you. Retain them.

428
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,400
If I memorize them now, I will forget!

429
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,720
I wasn't born to be a genius like you, Tong.

430
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,240
Even how hard I tried, it's no use. If you chop my head and look,

431
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,720
You'll see only how to swim freestyle, breaststroke and butterfly.

432
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,600
If I need to memorize anything else for the exam, I'm gonna forget it for sure.

433
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,840
Do you have any memorization trick?

434
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,080
Let me think.

435
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,360
Okay.

436
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,880
What is it?

437
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,360
What're you doing?

438
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,680
Finding a knife to chop my head?

439
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,320
I'm kidding.

440
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,440
You have to finish Medicine first to operate anyone.

441
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:39,200
How do you know I wanna study in Medicine?

442
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,560
Whoa!

443
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,800
You're top score student, so you must study in Medicine, don’t you?

444
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,760
Or you don't want to?

445
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,480
It's not because I don’t want to,

446
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,400
but I don't know... if I really want to.

447
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,000
Can't believe that a genius like you

448
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,160
Also has this kind of moment like others.

449
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,360
Sorry. I often do this with Phai.

450
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:28,520
It's alright. Just feeling weird. Nobody has done that to me before.

451
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,480
Well. I got an idea.

452
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,240
What is it?

453
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,880
Does it work? What's the last question's answer?

454
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,320
D.

455
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,600
Hey. You remember it now?

456
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,840
If you do this and memorize them this way. You will pass the exam for sure.

457
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,440
I even memorized them into my biceps and triceps, Tong.

458
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,240
Pok! It's heavy.

459
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,880
I didn't say a word when you were sitting on my back.

460
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,760
that's not heavy but this is.

461
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,680
Let me keep my first kiss for the one I love.

462
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,600
Concentrate on your study and don’t fail again.

463
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,680
Oh, Kit.

464
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:15,760
I fell asleep. How long have you been here?

465
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,920
Not long. You should go back to sleep.

466
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,240
No, I don't want to.

467
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,520
Just saw your face a second. I'm still missing you.

468
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,600
You see me everyday, don't you get bored?

469
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:47,080
Not ever, I never get bored being with you.

470
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,560
I know you won't believe me,

471
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:04,680
but I swear, everything I said is true.

472
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,400
Up to you.

473
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,560
I'll give you another 15 minutes,

474
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,960
and then we're gonna get something to eat.

475
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,960
It's alright, I'm okay.

476
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,840
I'm afraid that you might get hungry.

477
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,200
Kit.

478
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,960
I might change my mind if you still keep asking.

479
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:32,760
Okay. So… I better take a short nap.

480
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:52,720
You don’t need to wait for me here tomorrow, I'm going to see you at your faculty.

481
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,000
I think this one's correct.

482
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,480
That's it; just write it down and change it later

483
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,480
Um. It's so refreshing.

484
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,040
Are you going to see Padbok?

485
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,160
Yeah.

486
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,400
What's happened? Has he done anything to you again?

487
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,200
No. I  just wanna get it over with.

488
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,000
I got too heated last time actually.

489
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,920
I'll go with you.

490
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,680
I know you're worried about me,

491
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,880
but I wanna deal with it on my own.

492
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:43,960
But…

493
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,640
Trust me, wait here. I'll come back to you soon.

494
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,960
Padbok, do you have some time?

495
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,080
Relax.

496
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:29,120
Mark, your man is extraordinary. Where did you get him?

497
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,680
Jack, You better stay away from my man.

498
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:40,120
If your friend bothers him again, I won't be silent.

499
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:46,160
Let me assure you. Padbok always keeps his word.

500
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,280
And he swore to me that he's gonna say sorry to Kit.

501
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,440
I gave Dr. Kit an apology.

502
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,600
It's over now. Are you fine with that, Mark?

503
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,240
Over is Over.

504
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,880
Mark.

505
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,520
If he turns you down,

506
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,160
I'll get him.

507
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,320
I will take it as a joke from you.

508
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:34,920
Because if you're serious, one of us is going to die.

509
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,760
What're you doing? Where're you gonna take me?

510
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,960
Anywhere but not here.

511
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,040
Don't ever come here again, I'll go to see you.

512
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:43,720
The Engineer Faculty will be a prohibited place for you, Kamjornkit.

513
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,720
Immediately effective from now on.

514
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,570
You're cute with glasses.

515
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,880
But I wanna see you clearly.

516
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,560
Let me tell you.

517
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,640
About surprise things…

518
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:23,760
their result can be success or failure.

519
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,040
Kit!

520
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,240
Look at that.

521
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:30,680
I think it's enough.

522
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:33,800
I'm gonna give up

523
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,800
and disappear from you.

524
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,000
