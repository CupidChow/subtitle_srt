1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,240
I broke up with Pha.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,360
He left me.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,480
I'm…

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,080
Get off.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,080
Kit's pen.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,600
Why don't you give it back to him?

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,320
Pha really loves you.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,160
Pha.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
If  you're not gonna drop me off,

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,160
I won’t get out.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,200
We'll stick here in the car together tonight.

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,960
You’re gonna be fine with it, right?

13
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,960
Oh.

14
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,840
You left it at the café.

15
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,280
I saw it's broken, so I fixed for you.

16
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,480
Now it's back to use.

17
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
So...

18
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,480
I'll just put it here.

19
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
Actually, I wanted to return it to you long ago

20
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,400
and... I wanted to say I'm sorry for...

21
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,880
the day I shouted at you.

22
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,040
I don’t wanna see you so mad.

23
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,800
But it was really messy.

24
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
All those works

25
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,480
and Yu's stuffs.

26
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,040
I was so worried about him and couldn't leave him alone.

27
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Kit.

28
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,280
Will you forgive me?

29
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,079
You keep acting like I'm not here.

30
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,320
It's killing me.

31
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,600
Just tell me what to do.

32
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,800
Kit.

33
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,600
Get off me.

34
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,600
I know you're thinking of me

35
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,600
when you punched the sack right?

36
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Hey kit. Don’t leave.

37
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,800
You can punch me.

38
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,000
If it's gonna make you feel better.

39
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
If you keep being quiet.

40
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,440
I'll kiss you.

41
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,840
Let see if you're gonna talk.

42
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
What do you want me to…

43
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,240
Kit?

44
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,600
Don't ask me anything.

45
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,600
If you're not gonna tell me why you kissed me,

46
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,400
I'll think it myself that…

47
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,480
I don't care.

48
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,080
You talk to me now?

49
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,080
I can find a ride here.

50
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,200
So I'll leave you now,

51
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
Thanks Kit.

52
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
Where's your dorm?

53
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,840
Thanks a lot for taking me to my place.

54
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,120
Kit.

55
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,480
You wanna go up and get a ramyeon?

56
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,520
Are you thirsty?

57
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,800
No.

58
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,240
Wanna go to restroom?

59
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,960
No.

60
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,159
How about in my bedroom?

61
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,520
No.

62
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,880
Wanna go back to your dorm?

63
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,240
Don’t you be fooled by me?

64
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Just get off.

65
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Okay.

66
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,720
I'll stop annoying you now.

67
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,040
Gonna go.

68
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,800
Tell me when you reach home, Okay?

69
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,880
or at least send me a line message.

70
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,240
You've never replied me back

71
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,320
or even read my messages.

72
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,840
When are you going to unblock me?

73
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,640
Hey.

74
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,720
I blocked every weird person  who added my line account.

75
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,760
Now you can leave,

76
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,480
Okay.

77
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,520
What again?

78
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,120
I forgot.

79
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,600
Forgot telling you that please drive safe.

80
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
And also

81
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,799
I forgot to ask you that if I make you mad again

82
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,440
what kind of punishment will I get?

83
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,560
Mark. There will be no next time.

84
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Ouch.

85
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
Is that him?

86
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,000
So it's all done with Pharawee right?

87
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,120
Don't know what happend to him, such an urgent suspension.

88
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,240
It's normal for students these days.

89
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,600
I'm gonna leave now.

90
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,960
Your notebook will be getting full

91
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
before finishing your interns.

92
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,920
I’ll just use another new one.

93
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,800
I'm happy that there're more people than I expected.

94
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,520
What will you do with these definitions?

95
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Write a book to sell?

96
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,080
Do you wanna read if I do that?

97
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,240
Oh, no way.

98
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,600
I don't like these depressed stuffs.

99
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,800
Not all of them are sad.

100
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
Like this one.

101
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,240
True love, no matter how long they are apart,

102
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,040
but they'll get back together in the end.

103
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,920
But before being back together, isn't it sad?

104
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,160
There's always room for happiness in every sadness.

105
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,840
At least,

106
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,200
they're gonna miss each other more by being apart.

107
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,200
Hmm.

108
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,720
It seems that you can be a good writer.

109
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,560
Do you believe in destiny?

110
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,560
What a weird question!

111
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,160
Not sure.

112
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,880
Never thought of it before.

113
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,880
Guess I don't.

114
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,200
How about a soulmate?

115
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,880
Destiny and then soulmate?

116
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
What are you thinking about?

117
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,560
Are you a fortune teller

118
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,600
Who's gonna be my soulmate though?

119
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
When it's time.

120
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,080
You'll know who's the one.

121
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,080
Once that day comes.

122
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,000
Let's see, if you’re gonna believe in destiny.

123
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,520
What're you trying to say? Didn’t get a word.

124
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,920
If I've met someone.

125
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,320
How would I know that's the one?

126
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,040
Give me a clue.

127
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,080
What does my soulmate look like?

128
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,480
What’s the height? Younger or older?

129
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,200
Where will we meet?

130
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
When?

131
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
Don’t guess.

132
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,920
You'll know it someday.

133
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,640
But…

134
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,800
Phai. Sandee.

135
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800


136
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,040
Will your friend, Pok be coming to our café today?

137
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,880
He will, if you want.

138
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,280
Umm. Give this to him if he comes.

139
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,400
and please tell him

140
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,440
It’s low-sugar and low-fat.

141
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,840
Guarantee healthy.

142
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,960
Such a "sweet" Low-sugar cake.

143
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,960
Hey, can you stop by at the café before teaching?

144
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
Umm.

145
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,160
Love is even how painful it is.

146
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,440
I didn't order Hot Cocoa.

147
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,520
Someone ordered it for Yu.

148
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,160
His name is pronounced the same way as this drink.

149
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Koh?

150
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,600
That dentistry senior?

151
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,200
He's been here often lately.

152
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,880
And... Don’t you feel something for him?

153
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Yu.

154
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,760
You are hopelessly waiting for him.

155
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,640
Wouldn't it be better to move on.

156
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,800
Why do you have to be alone?

157
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,120
There are plenty of people out there waiting to hit on you.

158
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,200
If cutting someone off...

159
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,520
It's easy like you said, It'd be good.

160
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,160
If you never try, you'll never know.

161
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,800
It doesn't mean I'm not trying.

162
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,240
But I can't.

163
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,640
No matter how it hurts

164
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,320
I still love him.

165
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,800
Still waiting for him to come back to me.

166
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,440
How long are you going to wait?

167
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
No idea.

168
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,920
All I know is…

169
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
waiting.

170
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,000
Wayu.

171
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,080
Oh,

172
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
- Hey.
- Whoa.

173
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,800
Whoa. You guys look exactly alike.

174
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,120
This is my cousin.

175
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,160
Oh, hello.

176
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,400
This is Pha's friend.

177
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,280
See.

178
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
Wanna sit with me?

179
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,200
Well, how are you?

180
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,680
I heard that you and Pha aren’t together anymore.

181
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,760
Pha, did he get in touch with anyone?

182
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
No, not at all.

183
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,480
Thank you.

184
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
Well?

185
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,400
Hey, the collegue's ex-beau is here.

186
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,120
At the registration department.

187
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
Really!

188
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,520
Yes. I saw him myself. You'd better hurry.

189
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,200
Thanks a lot. See ya.

190
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,840
Bye.

191
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,000
Lay it on.

192
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,840
Someone reported to me

193
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,839
that the hottest college ex-beau is at the registration department.

194
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,160
What! Which one?

195
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,079
Don’t tell me it's the one who just dropped out.

196
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,760
Yes. Heard that he's gonna be back to study.

197
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,520
Yu. Wait Yu.

198
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
Yu.

199
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
I'll get back.

200
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Yu.

201
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
Stop!

202
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,680
What are you hurrying to, My dear Mark?

203
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,520
I have an appointment.

204
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,160
Appointment? Is it at the Medicine Faculty?

205
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
No.

206
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,360
Should I trust you?

207
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,120
You left us yesterday.

208
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,280
I saw you jumping in the car with that medicine student.

209
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,880
But I'm not really gonna go there.

210
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,280
I...

211
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I must...

212
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,680
I must go take care of my best friend, Wayu.

213
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,160
Wayu, that cute science's beau right?

214
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,200
Heard that he's single. Is it true?

215
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,320
I think so.

216
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,760
If his status is confirmed

217
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,400
Let me be the first one to know, okay.

218
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm really good at consolation

219
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,520
Okay.

220
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,200
I gotta go now.

221
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,440
Well, okay.

222
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,840
Hey.

223
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,280
Hey, Jack.

224
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,480
Didn't you say that you would take him to go bowling with us?

225
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,240
He has an important thing to do.

226
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,800
Let him go, Jew.

227
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,400
We can go together.

228
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,600
Or…

229
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,760
We might ask Yuki.

230
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,080
We're gonna see her on the way.

231
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,120
After she talked to Padbok.

232
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,520
Do you think that she still wanna go with us?

233
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,200
Sorry Yu.

234
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,600
If I didn’t bring up your name, they wouldn't let me go.

235
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,640
What's up, Sab?

236
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Pha is back.

237
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,640
He's at the registration department now.

238
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,040
Is he really back now?

239
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

240
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,920
Hello, professor.

241
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,640
Do you have anything for me?

242
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,880
Kamjornkit, I would like to ask you to take care of someone.

243
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,840
He'll get back to studying next semester.

244
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,360
Please escort him for now

245
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,840
I'm afraid he might be unable to catch up with the others.

246
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Who is he?

247
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,080
You've already known him, right?

248
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,440
Yes, I have.

249
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
Did you see him?

250
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
Is that Kit?

251
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
Pha.

252
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,280
Wait Pha, don't go.

253
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,440
Pha, you're back.

254
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,360
You. You're not Pha.

255
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Well.

256
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,240
I'm not him.

257
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,840
I...

258
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,120
My mistake.

259
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,040
This is Thanu.

260
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,240
He is senior from my faculty.

261
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,400
He's the college's beau three years ago.

262
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,600
You might haven’t seen him because

263
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,400
he dropped out.

264
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,440
He's Pha's senior?

265
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Yes.

266
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,840
He took care of Pha during his Beau contest

267
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
I've known him since then.

268
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,120
Thanu, this is Wayu.

269
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,720
He's a freshman from Science Faculty.

270
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
Hello.

271
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,000
I told him that you were Pha's boyfriend.

272
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,520
Thanu also told me that…

273
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,800
Pha had asked him for advice about the suspension.

274
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,760
Did Pha tell you a reason?

275
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,520
Where will he go to?

276
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,400
What will he do?

277
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Sorry.

278
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,760
He told me nothing.

279
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Okay.

280
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
Sorry Mark.

281
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,240
I've never met Pha before so I thought it was him.

282
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,720
By the way.

283
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,400
This guy looks good.

284
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
So handsome.

285
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,640
Should we get him for Yu?

286
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,280
Sab.

287
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,120
Between me and that guy,

288
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
who is better?

289
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,120
Why are you asking?

290
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
Just answer.

291
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,640
Tall, broad shoulders,

292
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
dark eyebrows.

293
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,960
Perfectly nose, lips, eyes and symmetrical face.

294
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,000
Serious and calm. He's a guy who people would kill for.

295
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,800
Also studying in Medicine

296
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,480
which means that he's smart.

297
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
Perfect!

298
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:18,760
But but

299
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,520
But, I think

300
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,680
you are more perfectly handsome than him.

301
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,280
You praised him that much

302
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,680
then you want me to believe in what you just said

303
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,080
Of course yes.

304
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,360
Who else will you gonna trust but me?

305
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Look.

306
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,800
Between me and him.

307
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,160
Who would you choose?

308
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,360
Certainly him.

309
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,280
Shit!

310
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,920
Don't be mad yet.

311
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160
Let me finish first.

312
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,520
I didn’t choose you

313
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,280
because I don't see you in other way

314
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,720
than my brother.

315
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,400
Even you are ten times more handsome and cuter,

316
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,160
I still can’t choose you,

317
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
okay?

318
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
Okay.

319
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,960
But it's only my answer.

320
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
If you ask Kit.

321
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,400
He probably answer otherwise.

322
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,160
I have no idea.

323
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,000
Let's get blocking them.

324
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,760
Go!

325
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
Here's your drink.

326
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120


327
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Where's mine?

328
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,320
Whoa. This is it.

329
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,400
We're gonna share it together.

330
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,360
Don't you think you should introduce him to me?

331
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,760
Can’t you speak it yourself?

332
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,960
Oh. It's because

333
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,280
my mouth is hurting.

334
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
Thanu.

335
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,160
This is Mark, my bestfriend.

336
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,080
He's a freshman in Engineering.

337
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840


338
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,320
Also being a collegue beau of this year.

339
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,640
Pay respect to him.

340
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,800
He dropped out since 2 years ago.

341
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,360
You and Pha are his junior.

342
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,000
Beau and Beau.

343
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,440
Such a pity.

344
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,680
If there's another one, it'll be completed of 3 generations.

345
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,560
Well, sorry.

346
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,920
I need to go I need to do something

347
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,640
I'm gonna take you guys for a meal when convenient.

348
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,320
I surely need a lot of  your help in this  semester.

349
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
It’s okay.

350
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,480
Just tell me anything you need.

351
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,000
You will absolutely need a lot of our help this year.

352
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,360
Sab.

353
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,120
Did Thanu go that way?

354
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,520
Yes, Are you going to follow him?

355
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,240
Why do you need to follow him?

356
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,720
Because I haven’t finished my introduction yet.

357
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,800
He doesn't know that I'm hitting on you.

358
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
Seriously

359
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,040
and extremely .

360
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,000
Get back here Mark!

361
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,480
Shut your mouth up.

362
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,680
What rubbish are you talking about? Recklessly.

363
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Mark.

364
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,600
I have an idea.

365
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,720
This guy.

366
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,520
I wanna get him for Yu.

367
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
- Sansab!
- Sab!

368
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,920
So I need to get back to my interns place.

369
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,960
Can't be a slacker.

370
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
Byebye.

371
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
Yu.

372
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,040
Can I have a cash for transportation?

373
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,680
I ran to you by bringing nothing with me.

374
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,720
Yu!

375
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,200
They won't accept a card.

376
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,880
Sorry sorry.

377
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,920
Thanks.

378
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:12,960
Kit.

379
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,920
Kit.

380
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
What?

381
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,080
We should bring Yu to some nice restaurant today.

382
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
I think…

383
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,120
he looks really depressed.

384
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,040
Look at that.

385
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Whoa!

386
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,120
In a broad daylight?

387
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160


388
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,480
Will you come?

389
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,640
Yes.

390
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,160
Where have you been?

391
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
I made a big excuse for you.

392
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
So what’s going on?

393
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,920
Long story. I'll tell you later.

394
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,800
Take it to that big table.

395
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
Jew.

396
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,600
Last week.

397
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,760
Padbok said he slept over with you.

398
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,560
I couldn't get him at all.

399
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,080
Why has he changed this much?

400
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
If you are asking me

401
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,000
Because I am his old friend…

402
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,440
He didn’t change.

403
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,840
But he is just being him,

404
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,320
like he was before.

405
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,520
Please come in.

406
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,600
Why're you having grumpy face, Yuki?

407
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,400
Where did you go last night?

408
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Hangout.

409
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,440
I've already asked you but you refused.

410
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,280
I don’t have a problem with that.

411
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,080
But last night...

412
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
who did you go home with?

413
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,400
You knew it. Asking again for what?

414
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,040
Asking because I wanna hear a lie.

415
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,320
Will you accept it if I tell the truth?

416
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,560
Yuki.

417
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,480
It's okay, Jew.

418
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Say it.

419
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,520
If it's the truth.

420
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,400
I went back with a girl last night.

421
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,120
we only separated this morning

422
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,960
but I can’t remember the name.

423
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,440
I couldn't contact you

424
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,240
because you were with another girl, right?

425
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,040
If you still wanna be my girlfriend,

426
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,480
stop finding fault in what I do.

427
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,520
I don't like to be investigated.

428
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,440
then stop flirting around.

429
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,840
if you still want me as your girlfriend

430
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,240
The girl last night,

431
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,960
who is she for you?

432
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,960
You are still my real one.

433
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,640
Don't bother those sleeping buddies.

434
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,240
How dare you say it.

435
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,880
There's nobody gonna take it.

436
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,160
If their boyfriend slept with other girl.

437
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,960
So you wanna fight?

438
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,640
I'm done.

439
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,120
Who wanna get lover

440
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,000
if only sex buddies are way more comfortable.

441
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
- Hey!
- Yu!

442
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040


443
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,520
Do you want something else?

444
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,840
Lychee jelly with soda, please.

445
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,440
I'm not done yet.

446
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,200
with Matcha smoothie

447
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
wait!

448
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,680
Matcha smoothie with red bean.

449
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,760
Don't order for me.

450
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
I didn't order for you.

451
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,360
They're all mine.

452
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,080
I'm easily getting bored.

453
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,720
Eating something over and over again makes me sick.

454
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,840
So I must order for two.

455
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,360
Hey. Are you silly?

456
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,600
Here's the recipe.

457
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,199
Who's telling you that I'm gonna follow it.

458
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,639
For some shit guy, he deserves this!!

459
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,600
- Hey that enough.
- Whoa.

460
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,080
Hope you like it.

461
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,000
Did I order this?

462
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,920
Didn't you order for two drinks?

463
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,880
Or they’re mixing it?

464
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,840
How to drink, then?

465
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,200
It might be good?

466
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,560
It's clear!

467
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,120
What's going on, Yu?

468
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Wanna sit here?

469
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,680
Let's go inside.

470
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
Kit.

471
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Well..

472
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,720
Did you hear anything about Pha?

473
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,440
His parents are working abroad. They're barely home.

474
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,600
So, nobody’s home if Pha isn’t around himself.

475
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,200
I’ve asked around, no one knows where he is.

476
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,440
It's only Thanu that he contacted.

477
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,640
But besides asking Thanu about dropping out

478
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,440
Pha also told him about you.

479
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,040
I see. That's probably why he looked at me strangely.

480
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,960
I think he probably knows more about Pha than we do.

481
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,520
If you get anything else from Thanu, please let me know.

482
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,080
When will you stop searching for Pha?

483
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,640
He left you for granted.

484
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,640
Do you think he wants you to find him?

485
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,520
Hey.

486
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,840
If you can’t sympathize with your friend

487
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,160
just think about Pha’s friend sitting opposite you.

488
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,800
I don’t want Yu to get more depressed than he already is.

489
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,080
Besides

490
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,560
He's very popular now. Everyone keeps chasing after him.

491
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,840
He can even flirt around with those disposables if he wants to.

492
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,600
When will you open your mind?

493
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,240
You're free from Pha now.

494
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,440
But...

495
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,960
But, but I haven't forgotten him yet.

496
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,160
What the hell!

497
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:18,720
Ouch!

498
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,720
Don’t worry.

499
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,920
I'll get back to you as soon as I hear anything about Pha from Thanu.

500
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,240
I'm gotta stick with him anyway.

501
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
What?

502
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,680
Doesn’t he have anyone else besides you?

503
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,680
Why do you need to stick around with him?

504
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,920
He dropped out for a year.

505
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,640
If he's going to come back as a junior, he has me to take care of him.

506
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,960
Why are you upset?

507
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,800
Yu.

508
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,200
This guy Thanu.

509
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,240
He's a bit better than me.

510
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,120
Don't you fancy him at all?

511
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,320
You can't replace the old one.

512
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,320
Why?

513
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,000
You even said it yourself

514
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,440
That Thanu is so good.

515
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,600
I just want my friend to start seeing someone good . Is that wrong?

516
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
Or...

517
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,800
you wanna keep him for your own?

518
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,120
Like Kit said.

519
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,360
If you can't keep your mouth shut,

520
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,600
Your lips are gonna be busted again.

521
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,080
I'm fine.

522
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,280
I want to get it everyday, to be honest.

523
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,720
When are you going to tell me?

524
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,480
how did you get that?

525
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,480
Crashing the door is so fake.

526
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,320
Tell me who punched your face?

527
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Kit

528
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,880
Dr. Kit

529
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,360
Yu keeps asking me everyday.

530
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,680
I don’t know how to tell him.

531
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,640
Would you check and answer him for me

532
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,840
how did I get this bruise?

533
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,360
Don’t know, don't care!

534
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,400
But you are a doctor.

535
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,320
Well.

536
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,400
If you wanna know that much,

537
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,320
why don’t you just run into the door.

538
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,880
Let see if it will be the same

539
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,000
If yes, that means you say truth.

540
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,800
No way.

541
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,000
I would rather have a partner in crime.

542
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,240
So I could have someone responsible for it.

543
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
Are you guys flirting?

544
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,720
- Yes.
- No.

545
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,760
Aww. Don’t you know I'm flirting you?

546
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,680
Flirting your ass.

547
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,280
I'm really into you

548
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,080
and I think you know it.

549
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,480
So you're going to take my kiss for free.

550
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
Shut up!

551
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
I didn't hear anything.

552
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I swear.

553
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,480
This is cheating.

554
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,160
Doesn't matter what it is, I'm a victim.

555
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,720
You took my kiss, I need compensation.

556
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,240
Just pay me back!

557
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,760
Stop talking.

558
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
You aren’t gonna stop right?

559
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,560
Ouch! That hurts!!

560
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,640
Ouch!

561
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,640
So painful!

562
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,720
You guys're playing like kids.

563
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,640
Byebye. See you on Monday.

564
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
See you later.

565
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,200
What did Mark do to make Kit upset again?

566
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,480
Kit's always like this.

567
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,040
Sab, close the door.

568
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,960
I wanna talk about something with Yu.

569
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Okay.

570
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
Bye.

571
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,440
Hey, don't get mad at me for suggesting that you move on, okay?

572
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,400
I just want you to be happy

573
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,160
and I don't want you to live like a dead man.

574
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,880
Angry at you?

575
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,960
Listen.

576
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,120
Watching you and Kit, playing like kids.

577
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,560
It was fun.

578
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,280
But it would be happier.

579
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,320
If I could turn back and...

580
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,280
I have Pha sitting beside me.

581
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,760
I would beg him to come back to me.

582
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,760
You too.

583
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,520
Whatever you're having now.

584
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,760
Keep it well.

585
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,320
Don't be a fool.

586
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Okay.

587
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,920
I'll do it.

588
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,640
You should go.

589
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,360
Sab is dying to know now.

590
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,360
Go.

591
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,360
Mark.

592
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,800
I just want to warn you...

593
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,040
What?

594
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,840
Don't be too rough on Kit.

595
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,680
I’m not so innocent as not to notice anything.

596
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,360
Why is it just me you warn? How about Kit?

597
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,520
I am really a victim.

598
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,720
You are the scamp.

599
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,840
Well. Goodluck.

600
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,920
Kit. I'm serious.

601
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,000
It's not a joke.

602
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,600
All this time.

603
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,880
Don’t you know that I really like you?

604
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,040
A playboy who's flirting around like you. No one's gonna trust it.

605
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,120
Where did you hear that I'm flirting around?

606
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,960
If I did, Yu must have been telling  you already.

607
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,480
But you see, he hasn't.

608
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,160
What should I do to make you trust me?

609
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,480
How do you want me to prove?

610
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,720
Just tell me.

611
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,200
Don't come close to me.

612
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,320
Why don't you want me to be close to you?

613
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,200
I thought we understand each other since that day…

614
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,320
you kissed me.

615
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,680
When will you gonna stop saying that?

616
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,480
No. I won’t.

617
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,240
I will keep talking.

618
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,320
Kit kissed me.

619
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,840
- Kit kissed me.
- Mark!

620
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,080
If you want me to stop,

621
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,080
you must return my kiss.

622
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,360
Okay. I'll give you back.

623
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,040
What?

624
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,040
The kiss. How am I gonna return it?

625
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,400
Do you really want me say it?

626
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,360
You don’t really know?

627
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,920
If I give it back,

628
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,360
you'll stop bothering me right?

629
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:16,840
Yes.

630
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,720
So hurry get it back.

631
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,720
You said it yourself.

632
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,840
Yes. You have my word.

633
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,240
Well.

634
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,880
Let me kiss.

635
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,520
Not now.

636
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,840
Don't care. Otherwise you'll deny it later.

637
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Not here.

638
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,560
Okay. If you wanna go to my room.

639
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
That's fine.

640
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,720
Who's gonna go with you?

641
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,560
Just kiss here.

642
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,800
Right here.

643
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,520
Gosh! Will you gonna kiss?

644
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,560
It’s so you.

645
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,000
I like it when you kissed me that day.

646
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,920
But today it's my turn.

647
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:28,720
So it’s done right?

648
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,880
Don't bother me again.

649
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,440
This is called touch.

650
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,280
Here’s the real one.

651
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,800
Can't you hear me?

652
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,240
Don't drag anyone in.

653
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,680
Hey, Padbok.

654
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,040
Are you gonna get it off?

655
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,120
Wait. I haven't leave a mark yet

656
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,200
What's the hell is it?

657
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,080
I wonder?

658
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,560
My soulmate will be so nice like yours, Sandee.

659
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,520
Do I look good?

660
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,040
Whoa!

661
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,640
Your face's so bright! What did you do?

662
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,880
I wanna get smooth and glowing face like this.

663
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,240
It's sure thing. Look, Myss powder.

664
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,000
You'll get a perfectly smooth and radiant face like me.

665
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,240
Just so you know.

666
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,080
if someone here wanna buy it for girls.

667
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,600
It's likely that you often change girls lately.

668
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,640
What are you talking about?

669
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,480
Hey, sounds good.

670
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,520
I wanna get something for my special one just right.

671
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,040
Thanks for the recommendation

672
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,480
Sure.
