1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,240
Have you ever heard of this?

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,080
Heart at gear.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,680
Gear is heart.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,600
Gear with who.

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,400
Heart with him.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,640
We are going to stay in the same room.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,120
Mark. Kit.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,560
I want to keep distance with Wayu for a while.

9
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,360
Why did you avoid me?

10
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,040
Don’t you have anything to say?

11
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
It doesn’t matter.

12
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,480
I just want to tell you.

13
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,440
If you don’t want to see me anymore.

14
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,800
Just tell me.

15
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,720
Don't avoid me like this.

16
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,680
Wait, Wayu.

17
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
Please don't be mad.

18
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,680
Then why did you avoid me?

19
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,520
I caused P’Koh and P'Jack to bother you?

20
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,400
Mark and P’Kit stopped you?

21
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,320
Or...

22
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,920
You didn’t believe that I’ve got over P’Pha?

23
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,680
It’s not all that.

24
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,440
But it’s me.

25
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,760
Not that I didn’t want to see you.

26
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,200
But if I kept seeing you.

27
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,400
I wouldn't be able to control my feelings.

28
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
I’m afraid that,

29
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
one day.

30
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,200
I might hurt you.

31
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,400
What if I’m willing?

32
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Wayu...

33
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,560
Whatever will be, will be.

34
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,960
If I must be hurt, so be it.

35
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,080
I don’t want to stop everything here

36
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
since I...

37
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
P’Thanu.

38
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,720
Even though we've just known each other,

39
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,400
but I’m sure about my feelings that I...

40
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,800
I’m sorry for interrupting you.

41
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,640
If you have someone waiting.

42
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
You should go.

43
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Wait.

44
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,080
I don’t have anyone.

45
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,640
There’s no one.

46
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
But you.

47
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,200
What were you saying?

48
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,760
I think… I’d rather not say it.

49
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,200
What if I want to hear?

50
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,720
Until you quit avoiding me,

51
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,480
I’ll think about it.

52
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
I’ll quit it now.

53
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,200
Not seeing you for so long.

54
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,000
It makes me realize how I feel, too.

55
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,080
Do you still feel the same?

56
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,000
You tell me.

57
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,640
What do you really want?

58
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,520
Today you take care of me.

59
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Next day, you avoid me.

60
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,120
You know… I can’t read your mind.

61
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,600
I’m sorry, Wayu.

62
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,920
Don't be mad.

63
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,600
I’ll never make you worry or wait anymore.

64
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
I promise,

65
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,480
no matter what happens.

66
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,800
We'll get through it together.

67
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Yes.

68
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,559
We’ll get through it together.

69
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,320
It might be nothing.

70
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,520
I’m sorry Phai.

71
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,840
It’s all my fault.

72
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Nothing.

73
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,440
It’s a gear. It must be Engineering’s.

74
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,600
Let me see.

75
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
Scales?

76
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,480
Oh. Law student.

77
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,280
No idea who started this hashtag.

78
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,480
What’s the clue for Science’s?

79
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,200
I can’t figure.

80
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
Help me think.

81
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
How about this!

82
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,000
Let shark Pok wear his swim trunks

83
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,080
showing off his six packs.

84
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,080
I guarantee his highest popularity!

85
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
That’s cool.

86
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,440
Don’t test me.

87
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,240
I’ll do it. Are you ready?

88
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,840
We’re ready.

89
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Shark Pok.

90
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,640
Let’s do it.

91
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,120
Show me some more.

92
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,840
Whoa. Sexy!

93
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,800
Ready?

94
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
One Two Three.

95
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,680
You can borrow these props for your photos

96
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,600
since we're both becoming a Comm. Arts student.

97
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,120
Sandee, Galae.

98
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,600
Please make sure the room is tidy when you’re done.

99
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,160
Others will use it after.

100
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
Sure.

101
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,040
Hey. Tong.

102
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Do you know about this hashtag?

103
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,400
Hashtag guess what am I studying?

104
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Look.

105
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,600
Phai can borrow P’Kit’s doctor gown for you.

106
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,400
He can borrow it from any Med seniors.

107
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,560
When are you moving to the Med dorm by the way?

108
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,280
Haven’t Tong told you that he’s not going to stay in the Med dorm?

109
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,520
He’s staying with me, in the same room.

110
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,160
Being my roommate.

111
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,320
I’ll be back.

112
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Okay.

113
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,480
Are they going to stay together?

114
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,200
Why didn’t you tell them?

115
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Are you going to bail on me?

116
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,880
Before we stay together.

117
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,560
We need to make a deal first.

118
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,160
What deal?

119
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,160
The deal between us is.

120
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,640
We only stay together as friends

121
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,840
and won’t cross each other's line, no matter what.

122
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,200
I don't quite get it.

123
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,920
Give me more details.

124
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,800
Basically, we won’t do anything that friends won’t do.

125
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,200
For example…

126
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,680
Something like this?

127
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,480
If you keep doing it, you’re on your own.

128
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,320
Are you still saving your first kiss for your first love?

129
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,520
It’s my business.

130
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,640
What do you say?

131
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Deal

132
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
or not?

133
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,040
So, what is considered crossing the line?

134
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,880
Kissing cheek.

135
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,720
Getting close.

136
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Touching

137
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,280
and...

138
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,960
kissing lips?

139
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,840
Hey. Where are you going?

140
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,680
It’s not funny.

141
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,200
I’m serious.

142
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,840
Fine.

143
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,880
I can’t kiss someone I hate anyway.

144
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,360
You’d better move in by this Saturday!

145
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,920
I’ll take them outside.

146
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,440
Um. See you then.

147
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,280
Sandee.

148
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,280
Please bring me the paper at the printer.

149
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,800
Why did you do that?

150
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,560
What are you playing, Tong?

151
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,680
You choose, that you’re going to confess

152
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,320
or Galae can witness that you tried to blackmail me.

153
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,400
Blackmail?

154
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,360
Very smart, as expected of Tongtrai.

155
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,720
Shocking right? To know that it’s me.

156
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,560
It’s more shocking when I found out

157
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,560
that you switched my scores with Pok’s.

158
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,720
I… I didn’t mean to.

159
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,480
I didn’t even know whom I switched it with.

160
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
But…

161
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,480
but you still got A, didn’t you?

162
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,520
That’s why I...

163
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes, I did.

164
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,800
But whoever you’d switch it with, it’s still wrong.

165
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,600
I’m… I’m sorry, Sandee.

166
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,280
But it was all my fault.

167
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,800
Why did you have to drag Pok into this?

168
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,640
What? You guys didn’t work together?

169
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,839
Pok didn’t know anything about it.

170
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,319
You got it all wrong.

171
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,680
If you had let everything go as it should.

172
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,920
It wouldn't have turned out this way.

173
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,280
What do you want, Sandee?

174
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,840
Why did you have to do this to Pok and me?

175
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,920
I just wanted to make things right.

176
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,960
Wait...

177
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,240
Or should I tell Pok the truth? You want that?

178
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,520
So, Pok stops being angry at you

179
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,080
and appreciates you more

180
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,520
for doing it for him.

181
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,840
So that he can get into university. Good?

182
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,480
This is too much!

183
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
Sandee!

184
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,440
What happened?

185
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,880
You should ask him.

186
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,480
Galae, you take care of Sandee.

187
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
Are you okay?

188
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,280
Why did you do that?

189
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
It’s my business.

190
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,800
You go apologize to Sandee, now!

191
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
Aren’t you guys friends?

192
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,280
How many more friends are you going to hurt?

193
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,520
I told you, it’s not your business.

194
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
Stay away!

195
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,760
Is there something I should stay away from?

196
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,800
Fine.

197
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,560
You won’t answer me?

198
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Well...

199
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,240
You said you’ll never kiss with someone you hate.

200
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,120
There’s always an exception for something.

201
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,840
Thought you’d save it for someone you love.

202
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,000
Is it this room?

203
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,720
- Where?
- It’s this one.

204
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Is it?

205
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,240
Oh wow!

206
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,400
Your room is over there.

207
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,080
Okay.

208
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,720
Go that way. Your room’s over there.

209
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,960
- I’ll stay with you.
- Go.

210
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,760
- Go back to your room.
- This one?

211
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,240
- Just go already. Go!
- Waa!

212
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,680
Why leave me like this?

213
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,160
Will this work?

214
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040


215
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,680
Hello. I’m Sansab, Comm. Arts freshman.

216
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,600
Hello. I’m Klui, Comm. Arts freshman.

217
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,040
Hello. I’m Sandee, Comm. Arts freshman.

218
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,560
Hello. I'm Tong, Medicine freshman.

219
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,280
Phai, Science freshman.

220
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,880
Galae, Science freshman.

221
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,320
Pok, Science freshman.

222
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,880
It’s probably obvious who’ll be our faculty’s beau without voting.

223
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,520
Chicken white butt, chicken white butt.

224
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
When it's hot so Arr...

225
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,800
When it's hot so Arr...

226
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,360
Turn to the left.

227
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,760
Turn to the right.

228
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Very hot, very hot!

229
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
Pok! Pok!

230
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Let’s go pick a senior buddy draw.

231
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,720
Okay.

232
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Thanks, P’Thanu.

233
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,440
189, P’Ek.

234
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,440
185, P’Wayu.

235
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,440
P’Thanu, I got Nong Phai as my junior buddy.

236
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,280
Let me go to him.

237
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,840
Phai.

238
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,520
Chicken white butt, chicken white butt.

239
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,520
When it's hot so Arr... When it's hot so Arr...

240
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,480
Turn to the left, turn to the right.

241
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,160
Very hot, very hot, very hot!

242
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,480
Ahw. P’Thanu,

243
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,080
Why’re you so late?

244
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,680
Did you go to the wrong booth?

245
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Just like you.

246
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,360
Aren’t you at the wrong place, too?

247
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,800
My right one happened to be here.

248
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,520
When it's hot so Arr...

249
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,440
Turn to the left, turn to the right.

250
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,040
Very hot, very hot, very hot!

251
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,000
Chicken white butt.

252
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,680
Hey, bros!

253
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,200
No violence needed!

254
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,760
I’ll go back soon.

255
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,280
Come on!

256
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,600
P’Kit, help me...

257
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Dr, Kit.

258
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,880
May I take this guy back to Engineering’s.

259
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,640
You can’t be trusted.

260
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,600
Luckily, we know where to find you.

261
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,240
Just take him, please.

262
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,720
Okay.

263
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
Wait.

264
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,400
P’Kit. I’ll pick you up after this finishes.

265
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,720
Hurry.

266
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,520
Go. Why are you so heavy!?

267
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,200
P'Jack, P'Jew!

268
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,040
Go! Go!

269
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Look at them.

270
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,280
P’Thanu.

271
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,160
They’ve just picked buddy draws.

272
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,800
That’s your grand junior buddy.

273
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,240
Alright.

274
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,240
Now you guys get a glimpse of Comm. Arts students’ lives?

275
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,720
We, Comm. Arts students, work hard, play hard.

276
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,320
That’s right.

277
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,480
In front of the camera, we might look amusing

278
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,920
but behind it, we devote all of our knowledge

279
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,720
and energy to the work.

280
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,720
What’s wrong, Klui?

281
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,720
Look.

282
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,440
It’s touching.

283
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,360
You’re so dramatic!

284
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,440
In this faculty, unity and equality are very important.

285
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,000
No matter what year, what gender or who you are,

286
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,520
We have to respect each other's humanity

287
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,160
and their works.

288
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,480
I want you guys to respect each other

289
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,600
just like we’ve been doing for all along.

290
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,040
Because… we all are…

291
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,480
Comm. Arts students!

292
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,560
Hip! Hip!

293
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,280
Hip hippo!

294
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,960
Shambling!

295
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,240
Shambling!

296
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,720
La-lun-la!

297
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,040
La-lun-la!

298
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,160
Stand up!

299
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,800
Hip! Hip!

300
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,680
Hip hippo!

301
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,320
Shambling!

302
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,640
Shambling!

303
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,120
La-lun-la!

304
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,920
La-lun-la!

305
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,320
Comm. Arts hasn’t finished, yet?

306
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,080
Whoa! The girls here are so pretty!

307
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,120
Phai! You’re making our Science girls sad.

308
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
You’re saying so...

309
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,080
Excuse me, Can you help?

310
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
Y... Yes.

311
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,760
Where has Alice gone?

312
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,640
It’s because of you, P’Jack.

313
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,480
You annoyed her.

314
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,760
You did, Koh!

315
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,200
I came first, I was born before you.

316
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,200
You can’t use this crap against me, P’Jack!

317
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Thanks.

318
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
You're welcome.

319
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,440
Hey, Galae. Where are you going?

320
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,400
- You’re too easy.
- You got stunt by Comm. Arts’ charm.

321
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,960
Didn’t you?

322
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,520
Ahw.

323
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,800
Science has finished already?

324
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
Been waiting long?

325
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,000
Yeah! So long that Galae

326
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,560
got a crush on Comm. Arts senior.

327
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,280
Hey! What are you talking about?!

328
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,120
Phai, tell us!

329
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,280
No! It’s not that! Nothing.

330
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,000
You couldn’t take your eyes off her.

331
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,320
No. No.

332
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,200
You misunderstood!

333
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,920
Galae, I saw it.

334
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,760
Don't wanna go to Com. Arts?

335
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,920
You misunderstood.

336
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,800
Believe me.

337
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,960
Huhh!

338
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,200
I wanted to take care of my junior buddy as well.

339
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,720
But he didn't join any activity at all.

340
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,880
How come no one was interested in Engineering?

341
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,720
Luckily, there's one Medicine kid here, at least.

342
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,840
We agreed, Mark,

343
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,520
that you’ll take care of Comm. Arts freshmen.

344
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,600
You get three of them, same as me.

345
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,080
Um.

346
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,480
Well, did you guys know?

347
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,880
There’s a Science Beau with us right here.

348
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,200
Who is it? Raise your hand.

349
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,720
Here he is.

350
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,080
Whoa.

351
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,840
Judging from your figure.

352
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,960
I guess...

353
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,200
Engineering will have to lose the University Beau champ

354
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,160
to Science  this year.

355
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,040
Absolutely. No one in this university doesn’t know

356
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,920
shark Pok from Sports Science.

357
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,320
You guys go ahead.

358
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,000
Medicine still hasn't picked our  Beau yet.

359
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,360
Ah. Since we are all here, let's take some pictures

360
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,400
of Nong Pok for good luck.

361
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280


362
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,400
Well, scootch over please.

363
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,840
P’Thanu, 2018 University Beau, is here.

364
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,840
Mark, 2020 University Beau, is here.

365
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,520
And Nong Pok, soon-to-be 2021 University Beau,

366
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
is also here.

367
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,080
Take pictures for us, Phai.

368
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,400
Oh ho!

369
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,720
This is really a Beau table!

370
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,600
Almost complete for four-year classes.

371
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,000
What about 2019 University Beau?

372
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,680
Yeah, right?

373
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,840
It’s my friend.

374
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,520
Now, he’s on a study leave.

375
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,760
He’s in our faculty, right?

376
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,360
Why is he on a leave, P’Thanu?

377
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:15,000
Uhh. Let’s talk about me, the latest University Beau.

378
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,080
Ahw. Isn't it me? The latest University Beau.

379
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,920
So confident!

380
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,840
Wait until you get the award, then we can compare our gorgeousness,

381
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,199
Nong Pok.

382
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,360
Here, take pictures and see who’s the hottest.

383
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,320
Let's do it!

384
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,760
So confident.

385
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,560
Pose, pose.

386
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,719
This pose?

387
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,280
Do this.

388
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,320
University Beau’s pose.

389
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
P'Thanu.

390
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,960
Good?

391
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,480
The one in the middle is the hottest.

392
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,800
It’s me.

393
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,080
Look who’s the hottest?

394
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,840
Even though he’s not around.

395
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,360
He can still be in the way of my friend’s love.

396
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,760
When will P’Thanu ask Yu to to be his boyfriend?

397
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,800
What will they do if P’Pha comes back before?

398
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,680
If Wayu really gets over him,

399
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,000
If he’s back or not.

400
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,480
It doesn’t matter.

401
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,080
And how can you be sure if he can do it?

402
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,000
That’s not the hardest part.

403
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,120
I’m worried if he can forget.

404
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,120
Yea, they were so in love.

405
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,880
Even though they broke up, the memories still remain.

406
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,880
I’m going to take a shower.

407
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Phai.

408
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,000
Can I ask you something?

409
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,840
Sure.

410
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,840
Do you have something to tell me?

411
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,520
What is it?

412
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,680
You should know better what you’re hiding from me.

413
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,640
I’m giving you a chance to confess.

414
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,480
Be honest with me.

415
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,000
Why haven’t you reserved a dorm room yet?

416
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,960
Are you seeing someone?

417
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,120
Huh! I thought it was a big deal, P’Kit.

418
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,720
I’m not seeing anyone. really.

419
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,840
Or do you want to stay home?

420
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,760
Do you want to learn to drive? I’ll teach you.

421
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
It’s alright.

422
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,560
I have you.

423
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,360
If I finish late.

424
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,680
I’ll crash in your place or ask you for a lift.

425
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,280
P’Mark shouldn’t say anything.

426
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,840
We’ll see.

427
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,280
You’ll find someone who can take care of you soon.

428
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,720
You won’t need me anymore.

429
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,600
If I keep disturbing you,

430
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,240
I’m sure P’Mark will get me someone.

431
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,920
So, you can move in with him.

432
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,760
You’re overthinking!

433
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,680
Let him complain If he wants.

434
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,960
I will never leave you.

435
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,560
P’Kit, now I’m a University student.

436
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,680
I can take care of myself.

437
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,920
If you want to stay with P’Mark. I understand.

438
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,720
Everyone wants to spend time with their loved ones.

439
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
P’Kit,

440
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,640
give me this room, please?

441
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
please...

442
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,840
I’ll think about it.

443
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,120
You’re too naive to be alone.

444
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Whatever.

445
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,400
Anyone trying to hit on you,

446
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,400
he needs to pass my test first.

447
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,640
Ho! Will anyone make it at all?

448
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,760
I sure have to be single throughout my university life.

449
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,200
P’Kit.

450
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,640
What?

451
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,400
So, please give me this room. Please…

452
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,320
please…

453
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,600
Please, please.

454
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,600
P’Kit, please...

455
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,850
Please.

456
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,760
Are you thinking about me and P’Pha?

457
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,440
Um. Too bad.

458
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,760
He met you first.

459
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,720
It wasn’t our fault.

460
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,920
I don’t even know what to blame that we met too late.

461
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,600
So...

462
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,000
What if we had met before?

463
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,360
If we had met before,

464
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,320
your memories would’ve had only me.

465
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,800
If only we could turn back time.

466
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,720
I’ve loved you since the moment I saw you.

467
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,640
Be my boyfriend

468
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,120
and I promise that I’ll take care of you my best.

469
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,240
What’s wrong?

470
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
Nothing.

471
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,960
It’s late now, P’Thanu.

472
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,200
Let’s go.

473
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,480
What did you tell Phai today?

474
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,480
If you’ve already asked him, why do you have to ask me again?

475
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,600
Stop framing Sandee.

476
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,880
When will you stop pretending, you’re a good guy?

477
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,800
And when will you stop looking at me bad?

478
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,720
Then behave yourself

479
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,280
and pay for what you’ve done to me.

480
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,040
What do you want me to do?

481
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,520
How much do I have to do to satisfy you?

482
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,160
Satisfy me?

483
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,640
My feelings have been ruined.

484
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,680
There’s no way you can undo it, Tong.

485
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,280
Then why do you want me here

486
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,160
if you don’t give me a chance?

487
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,120
I’ll keep you with me.

488
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,440
So, I can watch you not to betray anyone else again.

489
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,640
Just like you did to me.

490
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,680
Then, you better watch me well.

491
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,160
Never take your eyes off me.

492
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,960
You’re getting on my nerves.

493
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,920
Who’s the one doing that?

494
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,480
Go dry your hair off

495
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,120
before you’ll catch a cold?

496
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,120
You dry my hair then today.

497
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,120
Hurry.

498
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,240
Can’t you be more gentle?

499
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,960
Do you really want to make it up?

500
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,680
So, what was going on that day?

501
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,640
What’s with you and Sandee?

502
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,640
It’s dried now.

503
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,720
Go to bed.

504
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,920
So I can go back to study.

505
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,680
Hey, Pok.

506
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,920
Studying in high school is completely different from university.

507
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,840
Yeah, right.

508
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,240
It’s much easier here, isn’t it Phai?

509
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,480
Hey, Phai.

510
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:37,920
Huh?

511
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,320
Are you okay?

512
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,320
You don’t look so well.

513
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,600
I don’t know.

514
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,280
I have a bad feeling, but I can’t explain why.

515
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,800
Like something bad is going to happen.

516
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,200
It could be a sign.

517
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,480
A sign?

518
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,160
When I was in grade 11.

519
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,520
A few days before my grandma passed away,

520
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,640
I kept thinking about her.

521
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,760
So, I suddenly decided to go back to Chiangmai.

522
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,040
It got me a chance to say goodbye.

523
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,640
They say that

524
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,280
if you have a deep bond with someone,

525
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,720
you can connect with them somehow.

526
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,640
Pok, Pupae.

527
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,280
They call for gathering now.

528
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,760
Okay, P’Wayu.

529
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,840
I have a Beau & Belle activity rehearsal today.

530
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,320
You can come check it out after class.

531
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,160
Um.

532
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,880
Okay, I’ll follow.

533
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,600
- See you.
- See you.

534
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,640
Let’s go.

535
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,320
Science’s Beau & Belle?

536
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,920
Are they here?

537
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,800
We’re here.

538
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,760


539
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,600
Put your bag away.

540
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,960
Oh ho! Better late than never.

541
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,760
Get in the line, please.

542
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,120
Medicine’s Beau & Belle?

543
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,360
Here.

544
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,680
They were just like you and me, competing with each other.

545
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,120
Aham!

546
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,920
Medicine’s guys always seem so popular
amongst the Engineerings’ every year.

547
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,760
Many asked for your number.

548
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,160
Please keep your eyes out for me.

549
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,320
If you see anyone interesting, let them know...

550
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,240
that I’m single.

551
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,600
Sure.

552
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,080
Leave me your phone number.

553
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,080
I’ll find you a good one.

554
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,840
Hey, Yu.

555
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,720
Don’t you wanna help him?

556
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,000
He’s P’Thanu’s grand junior.

557
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,320
P’Wayu, P’Mark.

558
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,120
Take mine instead.

559
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,320
If anyone’s interested,

560
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,280
let them talk to me first.

561
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,600
It’s up to him.

562
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,720
If he said so.

563
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,600
Thanks for your concern.

564
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,200
Yu, do you think that’s a normal friendship?

565
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,960
Someone thinks of one another more than just a friend.

566
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,560
Uh! Did you see P’Thanu?

567
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,440
He’s a big senior.

568
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,720
He won’t get involved with this.

569
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,680
There, at the stage.

570
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,640
Taking care of the venue.

571
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:04,040
Why? You can’t let him be with anyone else, Nong Wayu?

572
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,080
Suspicious.

573
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,600
Phai.

574
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,840
Are you going to see Pok?

575
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,360
P’Kit, where’s P’Thanu?

576
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,520
He’s probably around the stage.

577
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,680
Wait.

578
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,080
Why is he looking for him?

579
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,280
Move the green one a little bit

580
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,760
and the red to the left.

581
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,560
Down a bit.

582
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,400
Zigzag.

583
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,560
- Yeah. That’s it.
- P’Thanu!

584
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,720
P’Thanu.

585
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,080
I feel strange somehow.

586
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,920
I… I don’t know how to explain it...

587
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,480
But...

588
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,240
But we have something somewhat connected.

589
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,680
You have to be very careful.

590
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,240
Thanks for warning me, Phai.

591
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,880
Okay.

592
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,040
I have something to talk to you about.

593
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,680
What we saw in our head

594
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,040
or those destiny stuff.

595
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,760
I want you to forget it.

596
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,400
I’ve decided .

597
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,000
No matter what will happen.

598
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,480
The one I want beside me

599
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,080
is Wayu.

600
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,080
I’m so sorry.

601
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,080
But I don’t want...

602
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,040
to let Wayu down anymore.

603
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,560
If possible

604
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,920
we...

605
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,560
should never meet again.

606
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,520
It's Phai’s mother.

607
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,160
I’ll go talk to her.

608
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,040
I’m sorry.

609
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,400
You got hurt because of me.

610
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,440
It’s good you’re alright.

611
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,680
How did you know it was coming?

612
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,560
I don’t know how to tell.

613
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,520
I had a feeling that something bad might happen to you.

614
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,080
It’s just a sense.

615
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,400
A sense?

616
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,840
I had it once before.

617
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,840
P’Thanu

618
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,520
I have to excuse myself.

619
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,640
I need some rest.

620
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,720
I’ll give you a ride.

621
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,680
- But...

622
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:48,200
Let me take care of you until you’re better.

623
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,440
P’Kit’s here.

624
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,920
They were slightly injured

625
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,600
But they’re fine now.

626
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,520
Phai went back home.

627
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,480
Let’s not bother him.

628
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,760
Let him rest.

629
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,120
How about P’Thanu?

630
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,080
P’Thanu told you to wait at the dorm.

631
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,280
He’ll see you there tonight.

632
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,040
P’Thanu. How are you?

633
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,280
Take a seat here.

634
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,760
How are you?

635
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,640
I got cut a little bit.

636
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,880
Not much.

637
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,240
But Phai was hurt more severely.

638
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:56,400
Don’t worry.

639
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,640
I took him back.

640
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,040
I should thank him too.

641
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,920
If he hadn't been there,

642
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,240
you could've been hurt worse.

643
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,600
Not sure if it's good

644
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,960
that he happened to be there.

645
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,320
I need to take care of him for a while.

646
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,560
I might not have much time for you.

647
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,720
Can you trust me?

648
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,720
I understand.

649
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,800
Do you think I’m jealous of you?

650
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,600
Don’t mind me. Just forget it.

651
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,280
You’re jealous of me. I’ll never forget.

652
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,640
I’ll keep it here.

653
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,520
Everything you say, I'll keep it here.

654
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,280
In our memories.

655
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:30,520
Let me see. Are you still hurt

656
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,200
Let me see.

657
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,680
Abracadabra!

658
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,520
I put a spell to make your pain go away.

659
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,840
Be well soon.

660
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,560
Last time,

661
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,680
you took care of me.

662
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,800
This time, let me take care of you.

663
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,640
Besides that.

664
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,640
Do you still remember

665
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,120
what else you did to me?

666
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,440
P’Thanu...

667
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,400
1 year ago.

668
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,120
Mark! If you did this to me,

669
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,640
you might as well put my face in the paint tub!

670
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,040
P’Thanu.

671
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,640
Hello.

672
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,960
Didn’t think I’d see you here.

673
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,920
Are you also an alumni?

674
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,280
I’m not.

675
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,600
I’m here to take care of something for Padbok.

676
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,920
The fight between the student from my school

677
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,120
and a college’s sophomore.

678
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,960
Was it P’Padbok?

679
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,680
Yes.

680
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,280
I’ll make sure he won’t cause any problem again.

681
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:52,840
Are you here to cheer up your juniors?

682
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:54,680
Yes.

683
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,520
Pha wanted to.

684
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,040
They have to compete with another school.

685
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,640
They’ll need more support.

686
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,880
But I’m going back now. I need to pick up my brother.

687
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,120
Is Pharawee here, too?

688
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,280
Yes.

689
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,440
He’s in the first aid room.

690
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,360
Someone got hurt, so he’s taking care of him.

691
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,040
Excuse me then, P’Thanu.

692
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Goodbye.

693
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,760
Mudmee is grating coconut in the kitchen.

694
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,400
A bad guys took him from there, because he was careless.

695
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,640
Mudmee is grating coconut.

696
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,160
Don't know what to do. Someone him please!

697
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,600
Mudmee, Mudmee.

698
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,400
Mudmee is grating coconut in the kitchen.

699
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,560
A bad guys took him from there, because he was careless.

700
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,200
Yes.

701
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,400
Yes, sure.

702
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,040
Padbok’s in trouble again. I have to go.

703
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,400
Good you’re still here, Pha.

704
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,400
I’ll leave him to you. Keep me updated.

705
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,080
Thank you for saving me.

706
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,480
You?

707
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:29,960
Pharawee.

708
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,000
P’Pharawee.

709
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:39,720
Can I call you, P’Pha.

710
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,880
If I had known that it was you.

711
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,160
All my memories

712
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,200
would have changed completely.

713
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,040
My lover would have been you.

714
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,439
I’ve loved you since even before I got to see your face.

715
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,479
Thank you for saving me.

716
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,479
Not P’Pha.

717
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:38,960
But it was you,

718
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,600
who saved me.

719
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,439
The last year,

720
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,920
when I fell off.

721
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,240
Was it really you?

722
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,800
Please give me a chance, Wayu.

723
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,360
Let me fix our past.

724
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,880
I know...

725
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,600
that you want to do this for a long time.

726
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,840
Waya. Sophomore, Faculty of Sciene.

727
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:39,560
No matter what happens.

728
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,120
Don't leave my hands.

729
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,920
Someone gave this gift to you, P'Copter.

730
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,320
A gift?

731
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,640
Here, BKC V-Plus.

732
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,080
For your health and your skin.

733
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,320
Thank you for him.

734
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,800
This is a brilliant gift.

735
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:04,720
I agree!

736
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:05,880
Wanna listen?

737
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,520
This new year, don't forget to give BKC V-Plus.

738
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,080
For your health, your skin

739
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,560
and for your love.
