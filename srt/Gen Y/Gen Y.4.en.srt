1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,080
Do you want me…

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,680
Wait Pha. Don't go.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,560
You are not Pha.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,080
Are you guys flirting?

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,440
- Yes
- No

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,440
This's called touch.

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,920
The real kiss is this.

8
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,760
What are you doing? It’s dangerous.

9
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,960
What's that?

10
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,680
What’s that. Get off!

11
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,280
I won’t get out.

12
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
What the hell are you doing?

13
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,760
This is dangerous.

14
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,880
So you care for me now?

15
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,000
You kinda like me, right?

16
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,360
You got me now. So what’s your problem?

17
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,160
Kit, listen to me.

18
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,040
I didn’t joke about hitting on you.

19
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,640
Don’t you know that I really like you.

20
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,960
A playboy who's flirting around like you. No one's gonna trust it.

21
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,040
Where did you hear that I was flirting around?

22
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,040
If I did, Yu must have told you already.

23
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,160
But see, he hasn't.

24
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,560
What should I do to make you trust me?

25
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,520
How do you want me to prove?

26
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,680
Just tell me.

27
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,920
Don't come close to me.

28
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Why don't you want me to get close?

29
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,960
I thought we understand each other since that day…

30
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,240
you kissed me.

31
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,880
When will you stop saying that?

32
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,160
No, I won’t. I will keep saying it.

33
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,920
Kit kissed me.  Kit kissed me.

34
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,040
Mark!

35
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,360
If you want me to stop, you must return my kiss.

36
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,720
Okay. I'll give it back.

37
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,159
What?

38
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:37,920
The kiss. How am I supposed to return it?

39
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,480
Do you really want me to say it? You don’t really know?

40
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,480
If I give it back to you, you'll stop bothering me right?

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,120
Yes.

42
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,800
So hurry and get it back.

43
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,920
You said it yourself.

44
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,840
Yes. You have my word.

45
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,280
Well, I'm gonna kiss you, then.

46
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,960
Not now.

47
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,680
Don't care. Otherwise you'll deny it later.

48
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,200
Not here.

49
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,560
Okay. If you wanna go to my room, that's fine.

50
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,240
Who's gonna go with you?

51
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,600
Let's just kiss here. Right here.

52
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,440
Gosh! Are you gonna kiss me or not?

53
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,800
It’s so you.

54
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,240
I liked it when you kissed me that day.

55
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,880
But today it's my turn.

56
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,400
So it’s done right?

57
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,800
Don't bother me again.

58
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,840
That was just a touch.

59
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,960
Here’s the real one.

60
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,320
Will you bite me again?

61
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,920
Hey! Mark!

62
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,360
So your ear is your weakness?

63
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,600
Don't you ever touch my ear again.

64
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,640
What if I do?

65
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,800
I'll cut your tongue.

66
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,480
You are getting more fierce and tough each day.

67
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,000
But you know, I'll love you more.

68
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,600
The real kiss is here.

69
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,160
Will you bite me again?

70
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,880
Hey! Mark!

71
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,920
Send me the picture. Wanna know whose mouth got more bruised.

72
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,880
I’ll make sure that my third kiss will make the sophomore’s mouth crushed.

73
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,720
Do you want anything else, Wayu?

74
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,400
I'll get it to you in a second.

75
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,280
It’s alright. Thank you.

76
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,040
Wayu, I kept searching for you for a long time.

77
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,560
Hey, Jack.

78
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,880
What's up, Koh. Why are you here?

79
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
I'm spending time eating with Wayu.

80
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,280
Do you wanna join? It's on me.

81
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,640
That's alright. You’d better keep it for Alice.

82
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,160
I saw that you were trying to flirt with her yesterday.

83
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,040
Dumplings. Dumplings.

84
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,200
Fresh & hot homemade dumplings here

85
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,280
Dumplings?

86
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,040
Three dumplings, please.

87
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,320
Do you mean this dumplings?

88
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,080
Hmm, what else do you have?

89
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,520
I'm offering me.

90
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,120
Thanks a lot.

91
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,600
Don't listen to him, Wayu.

92
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,640
It's the way of loser. He knows he can't win,

93
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,560
so he tries to frame another opponent.

94
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,760
Well, but I think I'm hitting on him first.

95
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,800
So what? You wanna start?

96
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,560
Hello, welcome everyone to the battle for a Beau.

97
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Mark, stop recording, no. Stop it now.

98
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,880
Today we are on a mission to find who's gonna win Wayu's heart,

99
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,640
a freshman from Science.

100
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,400
The first challenger, Jack Jongjet, a junior from engineering

101
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,440
and another one, Koh, Komes, a sophomore from Dentistry.

102
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,560
Now! Jack, please say something to the audiences.

103
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,600
I'm Jack. I fought with Koh many times,

104
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,640
and mostly I'm the winner.

105
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,960
Come a little closer so you can see  Wayu's future boyfriend clearly.

106
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,760
So terrifying!

107
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,360
Koh, do you wanna fight back?

108
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,440
I'm Koh. Everyone knows that I've been hitting on Wayu for a long time.

109
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,200
Let me announce here

110
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
I'll never lose.

111
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Wayu will  pick me.

112
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,200
We're gonna leave you here today for studying.

113
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,920
See you again on the next mission to win Wayu's heart.

114
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,440
Ah… I need to go study now.

115
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,000
It's getting late and you also have a class, don't you Mark?

116
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,320
Stop recording now. Go! Go! Go! Go!

117
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,960
I have to go study now.

118
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,920
See you later. Bye bye.

119
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,800
Why?

120
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,160
About Jack… It's your idea right?

121
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,840
Yeah. But Koh, I didn't invite him.

122
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,800
Come on. Just for fun.

123
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,800
I'm not laughing.

124
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,720
It's fun because both Jack and Koh, they are deceivers.

125
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,120
For you, there's a grand opening of the real one.

126
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,400
Real one?

127
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,400
Who's the real one?

128
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,680
There's no excitement if I tell you now.

129
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,480
Just spill it out. You are so dramatic.

130
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,640
If you won't tell me, I'll ask Kit to beat you.

131
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,080
Don't threaten me with my weakness.

132
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:55,120
Ah. The real one for you is Dr. Thanu.

133
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,880
How dare you bring him in.

134
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,400
Do you think Thanu will join your ridiculous game?

135
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,680
Come on, Yu. Help me distract him from Kit.

136
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,000
I wanna go somewhere with Kit, but he stuck with Thanu all the time.

137
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,320
Wanna know how much of studies they worked on.

138
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,120
So all of those scenes you did,

139
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,800
just because you need me for the sake of you and Kit right?

140
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,800
You give priority to your man over your friend now.

141
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,600
Ungrateful!

142
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,440
Come on. No one is more popular than you at this moment.

143
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,880
who knows, may be you'll get a new guy before me.

144
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,760
Such a man of honor. Come on don't be upset

145
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,840
come and get a kiss

146
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,720
Whoa!

147
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,040
Maybe don't, your Fans might see.

148
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,640
they're gonna come and kick my ass

149
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,600
Hey, don’t upload that clip on any social network okay.

150
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,640
I didn’t. It's live.

151
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,240
Mark!

152
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,320
Whew!

153
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,200
We have to leave for studying now

154
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,640
See you again on the next mission to win Wayu's heart.

155
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,560
This's from Koh, Dentistry

156
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,040
and this from Jack, Engineering

157
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,880
Tah - Political, Art - Sociology, Rit - Psychology, Fifa - Architecture

158
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,640
Mad - Business, Kan - Textile, Tor - Nurse, Wan - Arts

159
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,520
Shest - Economics, Mart - Education, Nu - Fishery

160
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,840
Yong - Account, Ky - Bachelor, Somkid - Master

161
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,720
All of these from the guys who watched the clip of battle for Beau.

162
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,920
They were paid already for Yu.

163
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,040
Which one you want to be the first?

164
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,200
Not any one.

165
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,440
and from now on, don't accept anything from them again.

166
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,720
Tell me, who started this promotion?

167
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,640
It's so good!

168
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,240
Our sales jumped to 60% since we started this promotion

169
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,160
It is the most sales record in our history.

170
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,240
I'll bring all of you for a Shabu this evening

171
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,800
Shabu!

172
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,640
Join us if you're available.

173
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
Okay.

174
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,600
You are quite hot.

175
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,640
I was hot like you at your age.

176
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,920
Thank you by the way.

177
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,080

Melon milk and Banana milk, please.

182
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,560
Which is your favorite?

183
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,760
I like…

184
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,160
just broke up from Yuki and now with a new girl. Such an idiot!

185
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,880
Let's go Taojeaw. Go finding a new restaurant.

186
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,960
Well. Sir. Sir.

187
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,360
Push!

188
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,080
Pull!

189
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,200
Sir, how about your orders?

190
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,560
Sir!

191
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
Cancel!

192
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,760
Whoa. This's the first time I've ever seen the mixing between Lychee and Red beans.

193
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,640
So odd.

194
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,200
Where're you going?

195
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,080
Any problem with me?

196
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,800
Can't you hear me?

197
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,480
I saw you were talking with many people.

198
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,320
How am I suppose to know who you are talking to?

199
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,000
What's your name? Which year?

200
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,480
Know a lot of people's business, but can’t remember your name?

201
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,520
I have a lot of names.

202
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,320
So I don’t know which one I'm gonna tell you.

203
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,520
I'll give you a new one.

204
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,720
Let me think.

205
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,080
How's about nosy, seems you like to snoop.

206
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,280
Sansab, Would you help?

207
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,720
Oh. It's Sansab

208
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,640
I'll keep in mind

209
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,840
Padbok!

210
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,560
What’s going on?

211
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,760
Duh! Just a jerk, you'll forget soon.

212
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,240
Come on. Come on. Have a drink.

213
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,560
Are we gonna eat in a cafeteria or outside today?

214
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,520
I'll pass...

215
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,040
Kit just messaged to invite me for a meal.

216
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,600
Hey!

217
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,360
Kit? Can I go with you? Please!

218
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,160
I wanna see him.

219
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,480
But Thanu is also with him.

220
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,960
In that case, I definitely have to go.

221
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,920
So I could spy on them if they are hiding something or not.

222
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,680
But you must not get me in trouble.

223
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,240
I'm gonna find out about Pha.

224
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,560
If you annoy Kit and he gives me nothing I'll get mad at you.

225
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,400
I promise.

226
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,960
Please...

227
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,920
Come on.

228
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,280
Thank you so much.

229
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:40,880
Thanks.

230
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,400
Hey! Wait.

231
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,240
You guys should go first.

232
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,120
Okay, I'll go get a car over there.

233
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,640
Byebye.

234
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,480
Hello Kit. Someone wanna join us,

235
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,280
Will you be okay?

236
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,160
Kit, Please let me join you.

237
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,600
What will you say?

238
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,720
Well, up to you.

239
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,320
Yeah! It means okay.

240
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,280
Thanks a lot Yu.

241
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,480
If I'm not afraid of your fans,

242
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
I'll give you a kiss on left and right cheek now.

243
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,440
Gosh, I shoudn't let you join me

244
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,200
I still didn’t beat you for that Live.

245
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,840
Hey! Jack.

246
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,000
Hey! Wayu.

247
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,560
Mark, How did Jack get here?

248
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,480
It's not me this time.

249
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,560
But he's already here.

250
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,640
Why don’t you change your mind and get him a dinner?

251
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,320
About Kit, I’ll take care of him for you.

252
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,960
Mark!

253
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,360
Wayu, I wanna ask you for help

254
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,800
for the survival of Engineering Faculty.

255
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,520
we need to…

256
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,080
Let me borrow Mark for a second.

257
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,640
Here's the thing. Since my friend, Padbok made a mess.

258
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,160
Engineering's students have been banned by an Comm Arts' students.

259
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,040
We can’t get close to those girls.

260
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,000
So we plan bringing him to be our leader for the apology.

261
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,680
Um. You guys ask this much. It's gonna be hard for me.

262
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,320
Well... take him.

263
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Hey! What!

264
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,480
Thanks a lot Yu. I'll pay you back later.

265
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,280
Oh, you’re welcome, because my friend is so glad. Look at his smile.

266
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,480
He's beautiful both inside and outside.

267
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,440
Shall we go now. Let's go.

268
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,880
Hey Yu.

269
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,600
Hurry, we'll be late.

270
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,400
Yu. Yu…

271
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,680
Do your good job as a cupid.

272
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,360
Don't forget to live, I'll show it to Kit.

273
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,800
Jack!

274
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,560
Hmm...

275
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,240
Why do I feel like I'm a dad who's going to ask for a girl to marry someone?

276
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,760
That't right, because you're gonna ask for a girl for him.

277
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,080
Whoa! What are you guys coming for?

278
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,680
Who allowed you to step into Communication Arts' area?

279
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,200
Well… Listen ladies.

280
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,240
Since one of us did…

281
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,960
misbehave with your Yuki.

282
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,680
We are aware of the mistake we have made.

283
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,000
So today we come to apologize to all of you.

284
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,280
And how will we gonna be ensured that anyone of you won't…

285
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,040
misbehave with our people again?

286
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:03,560
The one…. Who misbehaved, is only a minority.

287
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,680
See…

288
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,080
Look at our new generation young boy.

289
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,600
Here!

290
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,640
Err. Everyone, would you allow us to go inside and see Yuki, please.

291
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,560
You can go through.

292
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,280
No! He can't.

293
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,200
Even he's Mark, step back.

294
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,480
Concentrate, Taojeaw.

295
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,120
And… What do you want us to do ladies?

296
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,320
Dance.

297
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,520
I'll pass. I agreed only to join in the group.

298
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,560
Your friend made a mess, so you guys should responsible for it.

299
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,400
Ah… Hey.

300
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Music.

301
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,640
Ah! Let's dance. I want boybands.

302
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,880
Jew, Let's do it!

303
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,160
Not bad, not bad.

304
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
Ah, wait.

305
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,560
They said that Engineering's students are represented as the strength right?

306
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,880
Well…

307
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,440
Show us your six pack!

308
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,560
No, no, no. Not you Mark. Only Jack and Jew.

309
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,680
Guys, Jack and Jew are gonna show their packs.

310
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,160
Get your camera ready.

311
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,760
Okay, one two three.

312
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,520
Please accept it, Yuki.

313
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,960
We are truly sorry to you.

314
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,080
I've never convinced anyone to ban you guys.

315
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,000
You should bring it back.

316
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,640
Wait, Yuki.

317
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,080
Please listen to us first.

318
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,960
Although you've never convinced anyone to ban us,

319
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,000
but you are beloved by everyone.

320
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,200
It's normal if they hate us.

321
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,600
No one wants it to happen

322
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,400
with someone cute like you.

323
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,440
But since it happened.

324
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,960
The only thing we can do is give you a sincere apology

325
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,400
and ensure that we won't let it happen again.

326
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,120
We want you to know that it's not only Comm.

327
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,640
Arts' students love you,

328
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,080
but we also love you too.

329
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,800
You're smiling now.

330
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,640
You aren't angry with us anymore right?

331
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,200
No, not yet.

332
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,520
It's okay.

333
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,040
But at least take a look on our gift, please. You might feel better.

334
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,800
Gosh, Yuki. Just accept it for their sake.

335
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,840
Actually we're dying to get back flirting those Engineering's boys.

336
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,720
Kiss me.

337
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,880
For the name of us, you must sacrifice.

338
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,440
If I can do it for you, I would. That's Yuki.

339
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:15,120
Heard that your friends danced for you.

340
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,320
So let me be fair.

341
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,440
My friends are gonna kiss you for me.

342
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,520
Yes, Madam!

343
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,560
Perfect!

344
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
Look. So clearly.

345
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,720
He was forced to do it, Kit.

346
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,360
Trust me.

347
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,920
Shall we eat, Thanu?

348
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,120
Mark is so happy with those people now.

349
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,680
Hey, Thanu.

350
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,240
Do you need to do anything after this?

351
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,200
I just remember that I have a tutoring and need to go back to the faculty.

352
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,320
wonder if you could send Wayu home.

353
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,920
Hey, it's alright. I can go home by myself.

354
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,800
I can send you.

355
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,600
It's okay, There's no trouble at all.

356
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,880
Come on. Let him take you home.

357
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,920
So you won't be bothered by those weirdos again.

358
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,560
Well, I've gotta go. See you then.

359
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,040
Hey, Kit.

360
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,920
Miss you...

361
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,880
My friend asked me to tell you.

362
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,600
Don't be too much.

363
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,840
Tell your friend for me.

364
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,120
See ya.

365
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,320
You seem very kind.

366
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,920
I heard that your family owns a business out of town.

367
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,280
Where is it?

368
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,360
Saraburi

369
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,480
If you get back to study in next semester,

370
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,000
you will be in the same class with Kit, right?

371
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,520
Yes.

372
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,760
So they will call you a senior

373
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,480
and you’re gonna be the oldest.

374
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,360
Do you feel so old?

375
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,720
I spent my time with other matters while my friends were studying.

376
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,480
I have to accept what I choose.

377
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,680
You are amazing.

378
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,440
I would be so lonely if I were you.

379
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:16,520
Sitting alone without anyone at my age around.

380
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,240
So… the reason of your suspension for a year...

381
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,760
What was it sir?

382
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,920
That car behind has been following us for a while.

383
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,080
I think they come to pick a fight with us.

384
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,600
Are you okay?

385
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,280
I'm okay.

386
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,040
Hey, That's Padbok from Engineering faculty.

387
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,960
Wait, Thanu. Don't get in trouble with them.

388
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,080
They intend to bother us.

389
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,520
Wait in the car.

390
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,000
So you are back, Thanu.

391
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,600
I thought you were long gone.

392
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,840
Don't drag anyone in. It's dangerous.

393
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Don’t drag anyone in?

394
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,640
Do you have a right to say it?

395
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,080
Have you forgot what you did last year?

396
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,520
Never...

397
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,240
Hey, Padbok.

398
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,320
Good. So don't waste my time reminding you.

399
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Since you get back, you know what's gonna happen next right?

400
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,480
Enough.

401
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,320
We just cleared your name from those Comm. Arts's people.

402
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,880
Don't get any trouble again.

403
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,639
But I can’t let him go.

404
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,320
Back off!

405
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,239
Hey, don’t fight.

406
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,239
Wayu

407
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,000
Are you okay?

408
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,080
Are you good?

409
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,679
It's alright. Just a little scratch.

410
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,639
Good. You showed up at the right moment.

411
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,560
Thanu, you better take him away. I'll take care here.

412
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,480
Thanks.

413
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,880
Hey, let them go. Don’t you see he’s hurt?

414
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,239
Stop looking for trouble.

415
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,040
Don't let me see your face again!

416
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,120
Are you okay?

417
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,920
It's alright.

418
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,320
Got a little bit scratch might be from the rock. I'm fine.

419
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,800
Well… May I ask you something?

420
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,480
Do you have any history with Padbok?

421
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,920
Padbok is my ex-friend.

422
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,720
We had a conflict last year.

423
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,880
So now it's like you've seen.

424
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,200
Did you get hurt anywhere else?

425
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,080
No, that's all.

426
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,600
I'm always like this.

427
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,920
Fell down often til I get used to it. Cannot fix.

428
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,320
It's a stain.

429
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,960
I can clean it myself.

430
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,000
You don't seem to be well.

431
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,720
I'm fine. If I wanna find why you asked your brother to work at night shift.

432
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,120
I have to try it myself.

433
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,840
Good to be able to stay up late sometimes.

434
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,880
Do you remember when you asked me about soulmate?

435
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,240
I wonder if my soulmate will be so nice like yours.

436
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,640
Your soulmate might take good care of you better than me.

437
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,720
Again, say it like you know who it is.

438
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
Spill it out.

439
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,600
I will tell when it's time.

440
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,320
What's so secret. The more you hide, the more I wanna know.

441
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,960
The same right?

442
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,840
Err, My friend's never work in the night shift before sir, so he's knocked out.

443
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,520
Let me tell him to move so you could sit on your regular seat.

444
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,480
It's fine. This is my regular chair.

445
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,120
Oh, Okay.

446
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,160
So strange. One's never been at day,

447
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,280
another's never been at night.

448
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,720
Is it coincidence or destiny?

449
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,320
Woke up, Phai?

450
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,640
Sorry I didn't help you. Was there any customer?

451
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,320
Yes, just one. It's fine.

452
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,160
Oh! This must be belong to that customer, he must’ve forgotten it.

453
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,320
Did you call a car?

454
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,440
Um...

455
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,480
Love is to find someone,

456
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,520
who makes you understand the meaning of this word.

457
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,680
This would be from that customer. Nice signature.

458
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,800
Yes? I'll wait for you in front of the café.

459
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,600
Your car is coming right?

460
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,520
Um. I'm gotta go.

461
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,240
Safe trip.

462
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,000
Um...

463
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,520
Kit

464
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,800
I'm sorry for the afternoon.

465
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,960
It's out of my control, I didn't mean to miss our appointment.

466
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,880
Whose appointment?

467
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,360
It should be only Wayu. But it's you, who asked to be an uninvited guest.

468
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,640
Whatever, it's still our appointment though.

469
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,080
and since I missed it

470
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,680
I'm glad to take you for a dinner in return.

471
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,560
Hmm, dinner after midnight?

472
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,480
Who'll know if you stayed uplate until the library is closed like this.

473
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,400
Please come with me.

474
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,480
I didn't have anything yet.

475
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,560
And I know that you need to eat something too.

476
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,480
What will we find at this time?

477
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,720
If you are okay to go with me…

478
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,000
I can take you anywhere anytime.

479
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,360
Hang my arm.

480
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,640
One set of dumpling please.

481
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,080
They're all out, sir.

482
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,080
It's alright.

483
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,080
Okay.

484
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,840
You haven't been getting full from flirting with those girls yet?

485
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,240
Well. Was it good?

486
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,240
A dumpling?

487
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,600
Ahhh

488
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,600
Ummmm

489
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,920
It wasn't better than flirting with Thanu.

490
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,000
It's just a meal,

491
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,080
unlike you.

492
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,800
Hmm. Mine was nothing.

493
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,160
It's because

494
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,040
my seniors begged me to be a group's leader for apologizing those people.

495
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,960
You look upset. Are you jealous?

496
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,760
No.

497
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,200
Just tell me you do, because I'm jealous of you too.

498
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,400
What should I be jealous for? We aren't boyfriends.

499
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:39,320
So how many kisses do you need before you call me your boyfriend?

500
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,040
Here's the noodle.

501
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,720
Stop saying nonsense. Hurry up and finish so that we can go home.

502
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,040
Well, sir. There's no dumplings, but we have wontons if you want.

503
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,120
Can I get wrappers? I'm gonna do the dumplings myself.

504
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:56,920
That's good.

505
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,000
Once you finish, I'll boil them for you.

506
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,960
I'm gonna boil them till they burn your mouth.

507
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,360
It's alright.

508
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,360
Okay.

509
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,760
Are you gonna do that much?

510
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,680
Something needs to be tasted first,

511
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,320
so you'll know that I'm not only handsome, but also tasty.

512
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,640
Eat it up. No I can't, I'm gonna throw up.

513
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,880
Eat something, please.

514
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,680
Kit

515
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,840
Won’t you answer me something?

516
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,880
I asked you many times and you just acted like you didn't hear me.

517
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,800
You asked me a hundred questions a day. No one can remember them.

518
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,680
I know you do.

519
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,320
You see if you decide it now,

520
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,760
you'll get me for free with lifetime promotion and no conditions.

521
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,760
Don't care.

522
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,040
Hmmm. Really?

523
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,400
Why don’t you just give in.

524
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,800
I'm coming with a lot of premiums.

525
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,560
If you want anything just tell me.

526
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,440
I'll give you everything.

527
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,400
Only those who can't sell out come with that kind of promotion.

528
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,560
I just want you to get me with a guarantee I'll be gentle, indulgent,

529
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,480
caring and tolerative.

530
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,080
You will never find anyone like me.

531
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,880
So smooth.

532
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,080
How many people have you sold this to?

533
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,360
You are the first.

534
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:30,600
Should we go home now or you wanna keep talking till morning?

535
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,600
Well.. If you stay with me until morning

536
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,880
and find somewhere to sleep... Oops!

537
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,360
find somewhere to sit and talk.

538
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:38,840
Mark!

539
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,400
Um. Just a little joke

540
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,160
and you're gonna smack me?

541
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,440
So will you agree to be my boyfriend?

542
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,040
I won't agree to anything with you.

543
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,840
Gosh. Why do you have to make it difficult?

544
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,280
Why don’t you just flirt with someone who's easier?

545
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,280
No way!

546
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,520
I’ll be right here even if you piss me off.

547
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:03,080
you are so busted!

548
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,040
Please don’t push me away to anyone else.

549
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,720
I have only you,

550
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,440
even how hard it is or how long it will be.

551
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,560
I'll wait until the day you call me your boyfriend.

552
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:26,280
Stay here if you want but get your hand off me.

553
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,360
Don't be sneaky! Are you gonna get it off?

554
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,320
Wait. I haven't left a mark yet.

555
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,760
What the hell is it?

556
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,000
I marked you now.

557
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,040
No one can ever take you from me.

558
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,880
But I wanna show you with everyone.

559
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,800
So they will aware that you are mine.

560
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,440
Mine here.

561
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,640
Mine here… and here.

562
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,480
If he turns you off.

563
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,880
I'll get him.

564
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,000
You saw me everyday, don't you get bored?

565
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,400
Not ever.

566
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:10,560
I never get bored being with you.

567
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,320
Ugh! Out of internet again.

568
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:27,440
Even I spent a lot to refill it.

569
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,040
Here. Use this.

570
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,160
Z[EE]D SIM. I'm using it too.

571
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,560
Comes up with full package for studying and playing.

572
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,720
Free Internet.

573
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,840
whatever it for Youtube, Facebook or Instagram.

574
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,280
You can go all out.

575
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,400
Aha, thanks a lot, Kim.

576
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,680
What. Who said I'll give you?

577
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,680
This is mine. Go and get it yourself.

578
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,120
Duh! Let me see?

579
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,040
No. Don’t be so smooth.

580
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,600
A price just 50 Baht.

581
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,360
Come on, let me see it clear.
