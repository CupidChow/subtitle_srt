1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,920
P’Kit.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,120
Can you be my boyfriend?

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,800
Mark, listen.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,320
This isn't the right time.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,840
P’Kit.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,800
Why P’Pha do this to me?

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,120
He doesn’t want to see me.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,040
He doesn't love me anymore, right?

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,160
I won’t bother you again.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,400
I’ll quit and disappear from you.

11
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,160
Since the first time that you shouted at me.

12
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,960
I can’t stop thinking about you.

13
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,640
I want to see your face every day.

14
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,200
Sometimes, I want to see you mad.

15
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,280
Sometimes, I want to make you laugh.

16
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,400
Every time when we were together.

17
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,960
My feelings keep on growing stronger

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,840
and stronger.

19
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,600
I like you.

20
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,000
Like when you're being yourself.

21
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,960
Like how straightforward and tough person you are.

22
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,160
Like everything about you.

23
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,840
Here before my best friend,

24
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,160
I swear that

25
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,040
I'll do my best to take care of you.

26
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
P’Kit.

27
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,960
Will you be my boyfriend, please?

28
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,040
You don’t need to do anything.

29
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
I’ll be the one who will go.

30
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,200
You don’t need to do anything.

31
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,280
I’ll be the one who go.

32
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,440
This is the pin for the Love Sharing from seniors to juniors event,

33
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,320
which has been sent by alumni association for our consideration.

34
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,920
What do you think, president?

35
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:49,520
It looks good, except one thing.

36
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,159
Uh. What is it?

37
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,240
I’m not used to being called president.

38
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,560
Can you call me Nok as usual?

39
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,760
We’ve never been this formal in any meetings with professors.

40
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,560
We have guests today.

41
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,280
What guests, Matoom?

42
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,040
We’re all familiar ones.

43
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,920
Ah! ah! ah! well.

44
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,560
Raise your hand if you’re alumni.

45
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,960
Please.

46
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,720
Every single one?

47
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
Yes.

48
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,160
Anyway, since the association provides the fund for it.

49
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,840
We have to make it top-notch this time.

50
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,120
so we can get more donations.

51
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,880
My pleasure.

52
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,159
Of course, we won’t miss for a thing.

53
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,440
This event must be a legend for the university.

54
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,679
How about the financial support for the activities?

55
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,080
Do we have any sponsors from the private sector?

56
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,320
This year we still have our lovely same old supporters, which are…

57
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,040
AIS

58
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,560
Government Savings Bank (GSB)

59
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,960
Tao Kae Noi

60
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Eight Plus

61
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Mistine

62
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:59,120
and the last one is Viva Plus from the father of Wayu.

63
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,840
How about the activity booths?

64
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,600
No problem, right?

65
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,080
There’s no problem with them at all.

66
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,040
This year, besides the activity booths of each faculty and the center stage.

67
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,880
The medicine faculty will also provide first aid booth and staffs

68
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,440
for support all the guests.

69
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Cool!

70
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,600
Um. Good. Sounds great, Waen.

71
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,240
Is there anything anyone would like to add?

72
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
If not.

73
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,840
I'm going to finish this meeting now.

74
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,400
Sorry, I haven’t finished yet.

75
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
No need to rush.

76
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,720
I came too early.

77
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,560
You’ve been such an early bird lately.

78
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,800
I used to have to wait for you every time.

79
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
I’m used to it, i guess.

80
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,840
I tried to hit on an early bird before.

81
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,520
I always had to get up so early and wait to see him.

82
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,200
And now I don’t have anything to do.

83
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
Are you ok, Mark?

84
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,120
I’m trying to get used to it.

85
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
I’ll help you.

86
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,960
What are you doing?

87
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,280
You’ll make our shirts wrinkly.

88
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,440
You’ll be okay.

89
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,320
You know me too well, Yu.

90
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,000
You too. You’ll be alright.

91
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,960
I must have got used to the pain.

92
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
I’m fine now.

93
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,760
I don’t cry as crazy as when he just broke up with me.

94
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,240
Like I said.

95
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,600
Another real pain

96
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
would probably help me get over him.

97
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,040
P’Kit makes me totally feel you.

98
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,520
To get over someone isn’t easy at all.

99
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,840
I don’t want you to give up on him easily.

100
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,480
Give it another try!

101
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,120
I don’t want to make it difficult to him.

102
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,200
You know how he is.

103
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,720
He must have thought through it

104
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,120
that he’d be better off without me.

105
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
Mark, listen to me.

106
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,360
You and I are not the same.

107
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,560
There’s no hope for me

108
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,280
but I believe there’s still hope for you.

109
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,800
Admit it

110
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,600
you’d just give up on him only because you were offended

111
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,880
and wanted his attention.

112
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,240
You firmly told me that he had feelings for you, didn’t you?

113
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,880
Go make up with him

114
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,560
when you still can.

115
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,240
If I have a chance.

116
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,960
I’ll try.

117
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,200
Well, get ready.

118
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,760
We’re running late.

119
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,560
Who tied your necktie?

120
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,920
Why do your tie look fat today?

121
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,200
So that’s our first song with Com-Arts Folk song.

122
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,400
I, as the leader of the band,

123
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,760
would like to welcome all of you to

124
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,280
the Love Sharing from Seniors to Juniors!

125
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,880
Thank you.

126
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,040
Only a little wound.

127
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,200
Just avoid water contact.

128
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,720
Be careful when you carry something next time.

129
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,040
Thank you so much Dr. Kit.

130
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,440
Aww, P’Thanu.

131
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,280
Are you okay?

132
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Days ago, Parawee came to me.

133
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,720
He told me to apologize to you for that day.

134
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,960
Why didn't he come to see me himself, so he can see

135
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,640
how much pain he gave Wayu.

136
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,440
He didn’t mean to hurt anyone if he had a choice.

137
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,000
Especially his friends and someone he loves.

138
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,800
I think so too.

139
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,600
No matter how much everyone blamed him.

140
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,960
I was still on his side and helped him make up with Wayu.

141
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,240
But he blew his last chance himself.

142
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,680
Another thing he asked from me.

143
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,760
Pha asked me to take care of Wayu.

144
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,840
I’m sorry P’Thanu.

145
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,360
I've decided not to be invloved with Pha and Wayu again.

146
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,600
I’m done.

147
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,360
About what he asked from you to take care of Wayu.

148
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,880
You have to make up your mind.

149
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,040
I don’t have any comments.

150
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,599
Thank you.

151
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
Thank you.

152
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,599
Yu?

153
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,760
Yu?

154
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,839
Are you alright? You look so pale.

155
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,440
I’m okay.

156
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Wayu.

157
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,160
I’ve been putting on the pins for others since in the morning.

158
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,080
But I haven’t got mine yet.

159
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Will you put it on for me, please?

160
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,640
Put it on for me first.

161
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,240
I’ve been waiting here for so long.

162
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
Liar!

163
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,680
I saw that you just came.

164
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,600
You had waited for Alice ever since, hadn’t you?

165
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
Don’t frame me.

166
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,280
I was there to take care of my booth.

167
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,320
Why, Koh?

168
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,880
No one wanted you to pin it, right?

169
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,440
That’s why you have time to put your foot in it.

170
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,400
I was putting those pins that my hands hurt. Look!

171
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Ouch!

172
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Koh!

173
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,280
I’ll stab you back. You jerk!

174
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,560
Hey, stop!

175
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,040
You’re dead!

176
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,480
Jack - grade I and Koh - grade II, are fighting again.

177
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
Hey! Yu!

178
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,600
Are you okay?

179
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
Sit down.

180
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,640
Why didn’t you tell me that you aren’t feeling well?

181
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,880
It was just a little dizzy.

182
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,280
A little?

183
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,200
If I didn’t grab you, you would be already on the ground.

184
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
Come here.

185
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Sir,

186
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,200
can I get Anti-stubborn drug for him please, so he will…

187
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Thank you.

188
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
You should go to see the doctor for more advice.

189
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,920
If there’s any serious side effect.

190
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,480
You need to change the medicine.

191
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,200
Take these medicines only when you need it.

192
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,880
Thank you so much for your treat.

193
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,440
You haven’t hanged around out there, right?

194
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
I and Mark have been so busy since the morning, too.

195
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,560
I think we better go for a walk.

196
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,440
Is it good, Mark?

197
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It’s alright.

198
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,600
I must take care the booth until the event is finished.

199
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,720
Don’t waste your time persuade him, Yu.

200
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,400
There’s no use to bother him if he doesn’t want to go.

201
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,000
A man needs to keep his words,

202
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,040
not keep changing and make other confused.

203
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,880
I’ll quit and disappear from you.

204
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,400
Then,

205
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,280
shall we go have dinner this evening?

206
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,480
It’s been so long since we hung out together.

207
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,680
You should go for a rest, Wayu.

208
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,040
Before it gets worse.

209
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,720
Thank you, P’Thanu.

210
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,280
Mark! You’re here!

211
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,680
Well, we bring you the pins so you can put them on us.

212
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,560
We have an afternoon class that’s why we need to rush.

213
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
It’s fine.

214
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Excuse me.

215
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Aw, P’Kit.

216
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,680
You haven’t got any pin yet?

217
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,440
If you don’t have time.

218
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
Then let me put it for you.

219
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,720
It’s alright, P’Thanu.

220
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
I can do it myself.

221
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
Oops, Mark?

222
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
I’m fine.

223
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,240
I’d better not bother you.

224
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Thank you.

225
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,160
Why are you so distracted?

226
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,600
You’re bleeding.

227
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Leave it.

228
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,960
It’s just a little, not a big deal.

229
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
P’Kit.

230
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,600
Would you help bandage him, please?

231
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,600
Actually, he finds it immensly painful

232
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,040
Even if he acts like he doesn’t feel anything.

233
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
P’Thanu.

234
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,040
Would you bandage him, please?

235
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
P’Thanu.

236
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,320
Could you give me a lift to my dorm, please?

237
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,680
Suddenly, I get a headache.

238
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
Of course.

239
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,200
I’m okay. Just a little wound.

240
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
If you hurt just say it.

241
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,560
Is it that hard to be frank with your feeling?

242
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
I don’t want any sympathy.

243
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,000
I’ve got more painful wound, but I can still endure.

244
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Which wound?

245
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,840
If you want to blame me.

246
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,680
Make it clear, otherwise I won’t get it.

247
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
It’s done.

248
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,840
Thank you for your care.

249
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,040
But why do I still feel hurt?

250
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,400
And don’t you think it hurts me too, Mark?

251
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,000
We both hurt. For what?

252
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,920
Why don’t we start it all over?

253
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,440
Hurting me once was enough.

254
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,880
I don’t want to repeat it.

255
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
P’Kit.

256
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,120
If you can’t love me.

257
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,840
Can you not love anyone else?

258
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,920
I guess you can’t.

259
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,600
Just consider that I didn’t say anything.

260
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,320
What kind of asking is that from the guy who wants to quit?

261
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,200
P’Thanu, do you feel anything for P’Kit?

262
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,720
I saw him as my junior.

263
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,280
And I don’t think he feels otherwise.

264
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,880
I’m just his senior that’s all.

265
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Really?

266
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,560
I'm relieved.

267
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,200
If it turns out that you feel something for P’Kit.

268
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,160
It’d be difficult for Mark.

269
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,120
He’s too stubborn.

270
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,880
And P’Kit is too tough.

271
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,080
I don’t know how to help them.

272
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
Wayu.

273
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,560
Do you feel better?

274
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,120
I don’t have a fever now.

275
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,160
I mean…

276
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,920
about Parawee.

277
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,720
Why’re you asking me about him?

278
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,840
If my question upset you.

279
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,080
I’m sorry.

280
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,280
That’s fine.

281
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,720
I just…

282
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,560
still have doubts why he left me and took me for granted

283
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,320
It’s like what we had in the past.

284
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,800
Mean nothing to him.

285
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,920
If you’re hurt just cry it out.

286
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,000
I’ll be right here until you get better.

287
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,280
I don’t want to cry like a child anymore.

288
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,120
It’s useless to cry.

289
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,640
I know that he is still worried about you

290
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,480
If he's really worried about me.

291
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,560
He wouldn’t avoid me like this.

292
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,520
Thank you, P’Thanu.

293
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,840
For dropping me off.

294
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,440
I’ll take you to your room.

295
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,800
Then I’ll get back to you this evening.

296
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
To check if you are better.

297
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Okay.

298
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:52,960
P’Kit.

299
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
P’Kit.

300
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,320
I'm here.

301
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,680
You haven’t been changed a shift yet?

302
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,960
Sorry, I totally forgot

303
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,520
that we must go buy textbooks for the exam today.

304
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,200
You can hang around here meanwhile.

305
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,560
I must wait more 15 minutes until the next person shows up to replace me.

306
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,400
I’ve already done that.

307
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,520
Such a pity that there’s no pin left.

308
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,920
I wanted Mark to put it on me though.

309
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,560
You haven’t got it yet, right?

310
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,640
Is it okay? This is yours.

311
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,360
Someone passed it to me though.

312
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,320
You should keep it.

313
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
Thanks, P’Kit.

314
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,800
I’d rather go hanging around waiting for you.

315
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,520
Oh! Handsome, Thanu!

316
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,160
Are you getting back to study now?

317
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,800
I’ll get back on next semester.

318
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
I come here just for help today.

319
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,000
Well…

320
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,080
someone saw you leave with Wayu yesterday.

321
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
Was it true?

322
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,440
He didn’t feel well. I just took him home.

323
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Huh!

324
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,120
He’s sick?

325
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,160
What happened to him?

326
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Let’s talk later, Jack.

327
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Sorry.

328
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,360
Hey! Thanu!

329
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Who do you come for?

330
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,120
Hope it isn’t Wayu of Jack.

331
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,560
We’d better go on our own way.

332
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,680
Then, get out of my sight

333
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,360
because I’ll pick a fight whenever I see you.

334
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,680
Do whatever you want.

335
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,960
But don’t get other people into trouble.

336
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,920
What do Wayu has?

337
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,080
To make you so worried this much?

338
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,640
Leave him alone.

339
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
I can’t touch him at all, right?

340
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
The more you protect him,

341
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,560
the more I'm interested in him.

342
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,240
Don’t you know?

343
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,880
Don’t you dare trying to do anything to him

344
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,160
like you did with P’Kit!

345
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,240
Last year.

346
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,040
If you were protecting your friend

347
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,360
like you’re doing to Wayu.

348
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,840
we wouldn’t be in a fight like this.

349
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,960
Wayu.

350
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Stay still.

351
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,040
Let me wipe your body.

352
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,480
Mark.

353
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,160
Leave me alone, I want to sleep.

354
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,480
Wayu, don’t be stubborn.

355
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,960
I’ll be good, P’Kit.

356
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,120
Wayu won’t be stubborn anymore.

357
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,000
I’ll prepare you a dinner.

358
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
P’Pha.

359
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,640
You came back to me.

360
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,360
You really did.

361
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,640
Don’t leave me again.

362
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,200
You don't know how lonely I was,

363
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,600
when you were gone.

364
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,120
Didn’t we promised that we’d be together forever?

365
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,160
You just left me here

366
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,520
and think It’d be over that easily?

367
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,520
Did you even think of my feelings?

368
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,600
What did I do wrong, P’Pha?

369
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,480
Why did you have to do it to me?

370
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,400
You’re so mean.

371
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,280
Even how bad you treat me.

372
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,199
I still can’t…

373
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,600
can’t forget you.

374
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,080
And I can’t move on.

375
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,120
If this is my dream.

376
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,000
It would be the best dream I’ve ever had.

377
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,159
I don’t want to wake up.

378
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,960
Look at me. Who am I?

379
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,120
You can’t even take the right tablet.

380
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,080
So how will you take care of yourself?

381
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,520
Huh!

382
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,320
Finally done!

383
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,400
I almost broke my arms cleaning this up.

384
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,040
Wow.

385
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,880
So refreshing!

386
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,240
Do you have more?

387
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,120
Tada!

388
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,960
For something this good.

389
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,200
We should save some for us.

390
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,160
Well, who want some?

391
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,600
- Me! Me!
- Me! Me!

392
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,920
I want the pink one.

393
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,720
- Me too!
- Me too!

394
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
I want green.

395
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,640
Well.

396
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,680
Where is Jew?

397
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,640
Why didn’t he help us carry these stuffs?

398
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,960
Don’t tell me that he’s at the bar.

399
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,720
Well.

400
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,960
It’s a special occasion.

401
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,160
Huh!

402
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,120
It isn’t the special occasion at all.

403
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,400
It’s more like his routine.

404
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,040
Whenever I was at the bar, I always saw his gang.

405
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,400
I see them every time, you know why?

406
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,840
Because that college beau,

407
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,240
freshman from Engineering.

408
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,120
I can see his gorgeous face standout in the middle of the group.

409
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,600
Wherever you are in the bar.

410
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,280
You’ll still see him.

411
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,560
Such a shame

412
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,280
that he’s always wasted.

413
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
He must have been dumped.

414
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,720
Mark.

415
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,120
Someone follows you tonight.

416
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,680
He doesn’t come for me.

417
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,280
If he doesn’t

418
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,760
then who else that he looks for?

419
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,760
Mark.

420
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,680
Do you think that we didn’t know?

421
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,240
That who’s the reason to make you get drunk every day.

422
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,480
You should clear things up with him.

423
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,080
Or you'll regret it.

424
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,920
You didn’t tell me like this yesterday.

425
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,320
Where is the guy who gave my line account to those chicks?

426
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,800
Yeah, it’s me.

427
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,600
I couldn’t bear to see your horrible look from the heartbreak.

428
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,160
But now

429
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,400
he comes to make up with you.

430
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,600
Don’t make me tell him

431
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,480
that whose name you kept calling when you drunk.

432
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,840
Why are you here?

433
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,360
Let’s talk outside. It’s very loud here.

434
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,360
Just talk to me here.

435
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,880
What do you want?

436
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,520
You have a class tomorrow morning.

437
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,200
I can take care of myself.

438
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,960
I go to study every morning.

439
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,920
How will you go home if you are drunk?

440
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,920
Why do you ask me?

441
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Will you give me a ride?

442
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,920
Do you want me to do it?

443
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
Whatever.

444
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,000
But I don’t want to go now,

445
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,520
will you wait?

446
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,440
Go get drunk as much as you want.

447
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,320
and let’s see if I still wait for you.

448
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,400
What takes him so long in the toilet?

449
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,720
I’ll go check.

450
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,520
There’re a lot of scary girls here.

451
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Okay.

452
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
Mark!

453
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,520
I bring your friend for you.

454
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,640
Thank you.

455
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,800
Sit down here!

456
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,280
Hmm! It’s so good to be handsome!

457
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,200
You only went to the toilet just a second then you get a girl?

458
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,440
Hey, Mark!

459
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
Where’re you going?

460
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,760
Our table’s here.

461
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
I’ll go to P’Kit.

462
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,280
We should follow him.

463
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,920
No one will wait for you.

464
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,080
It’s been hours since he came.

465
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,320
He won’t waste his time waiting for you.

466
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,360
P’Kit.

467
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,200
You really wait for me.

468
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,960
Is he always drunk like this every night?

469
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,040
Tonight is the worst.

470
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,880
He might want to disappoint someone.

471
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,520
If you can’t love him,

472
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,640
don’t give him hope.

473
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,080
otherwise, he won’t get over it.

474
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,240
This car looks familiar.

475
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,600
Will he throw up in his car?

476
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,520
It’s you who cheered him to drink.

477
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,680
Why won’t we go this way?

478
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,600
Bye bye.

479
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,720
Hey! How about us?

480
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,880
How will we go home?

481
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,440
I told you not to bring the car.

482
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
There.

483
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,800
Our guardian angel has arrived.

484
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,560
Hello.

485
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,680
Hello, I’m from “U Drink I Drive”.

486
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,400
Please take care of us.

487
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,400
Yes, sir.

488
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
They’re water and refreshing towel.

489
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,440
Take the water, I had enough.

490
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,520
Hey, Mark!

491
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,640
Whoa! It’s dangerous.

492
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,560
Mark!

493
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,480
Okay. Wait! Wait!

494
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,320
Hey. Mark!

495
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,400
Hey! Get in the car.

496
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,120
Let’s go.

497
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,040
Are we really going like this?

498
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,480
- Go!
- Okay, let’s do it.

499
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,240
Let’s go. Let’s go.

500
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,880
Mark.

501
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,800
I’m fine. I’m fine.

502
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,480
I’m really fine.

503
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,760
So comfy.

504
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,960
I’m so fine.

505
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,160
So wrecked.

506
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,520
You didn’t let me finish that day.

507
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,320
And you got quite a mouth that you’d quit on me.

508
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,360
When I told you that it’s not the right time,

509
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,760
because there’s many things

510
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,360
I haven’t done to show you

511
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,440
that I

512
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,760
also feel the same way with you.

513
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,960
P’Kit.

514
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,400
I’m sorry for making you sad.

515
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,520
Please don’t lose faith in me.

516
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,920
Mark.

517
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,120
Mark.

518
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,560
What’s that mark on your neck?

519
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,240
Who gave it to you?

520
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,400
P’Kit.

521
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,040
Don’t leave me.

522
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,200
I have only you.

523
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,560
Mark.

524
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,200
Mark! Wake up!

525
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,920
Yu.

526
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,640
How did you get into my room?

527
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,040
Your room? Look again.

528
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,320
Look around.

529
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,480
Look!

530
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,760
This is P’Kit’s room.

531
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,480
Look, you see?

532
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,600
I’m having a good dream.

533
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,720
Only the owner of this room can wake me up.

534
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,440
He left since the morning for studying.

535
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,600
He brought me to wake you up.

536
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,960
Hey! Mark! Wake up!

537
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,720
Mark! Get up quick!

538
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,240
What made you so tired?

539
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:31,120
Don’t tell me that last night… You and P’Kit…

540
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,000
I don’t know!

541
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,560
I can’t remember a thing.

542
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,000
Hey, Mark.

543
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,480
Hey!

544
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,040
All these times I thought he’s a nerd.

545
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,600
I don’t know that he’s so sparky.

546
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,480
I’m shit!

547
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,440
I’ve searched everywhere.

548
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,200
but I can’t find it.

549
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,360
How’s that painting looks like?

550
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,400
It’s the portrait.

551
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,680
That’s alright.

552
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,640
I’m not so sure where I lost it.

553
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,320
I better return you that lectures.

554
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,960
You might find it in their.

555
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,280
Why’re you so fast?

556
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,840
Did you return P’Kit a key?

557
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,200
Not yet.

558
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,640
I saw him with P’Thanu.

559
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,000
So I don’t want to interrupt them.

560
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,240
You jerk!

561
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,120
I’ll tell you something.

562
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,640
I asked P’Thanu if he has any feelings for Kit.

563
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,760
He said that P’Kit’s only his junior.

564
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:30,480
Really?

565
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,200
Why do I have to lie to you?

566
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,680
So, let’s do this.

567
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,360
You come with me to the Medicine

568
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,120
then try to drag P’Thanu away like you did yesterday.

569
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,640
I think…

570
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,000
you better wait until this evening to clear up with P’Kit.

571
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,800
Why?

572
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,840
Well…

573
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,040
P’Thanu!

574
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,280
I’m not ready to see him.

575
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,320
Why?

576
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,720
What did he do to you?

577
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,560
No.

578
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,160
He didn’t do anything.

579
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,600
Hmm.

580
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,080
It’s nothing!

581
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,200
Shady.

582
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,120
Or… did you do anything to him?

583
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,400
What kind of person do you think I am?

584
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,280
Let’s go to the class.

585
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,640
We’ll late. Hurry.

586
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,360
Stop it.

587
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,040
You need to practice more about dodging.

588
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,120
Let me clear my problem first then I’ll interrogate you hard.

589
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,600
Well.

590
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,800
Let’s go.

591
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,200
Stop looking at me.

592
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,440
Jerk.

593
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,600
Last night I’m…

594
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,600
Give me my key.

595
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,960
I’m sorry that I was so drunk.

596
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,760
And thank you for giving me a ride.

597
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,000
Don’t you want to ask me anything about last night?

598
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,440
What else do I need to know?

599
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,240
The reason that made you drunk and almost lied on the street?

600
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,360
Or who gave the mark on your neck?

601
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,240
I wasn't aware about it.

602
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,440
No matter you believe me or not.

603
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,920
But I was forced,

604
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,720
and I have no idea who did it.

605
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,120
If you want to lie, make it better.

606
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,040
You tell me you got a bug bite, It’s more believable.

607
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,880
I didn’t lie to you.

608
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,480
Trust me.

609
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,760
You’ll know if I lie.

610
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,920
Actually,

611
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:48,120
there’s only one thing I lie to you.

612
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,080
What’s it?

613
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,280
I lied to you

614
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,280
that I’ll quit.

615
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,240
But until now,

616
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,200
I’ve never restrained myself from you.

617
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,440
I’ll try harder

618
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,440
so you won’t worry about me.

619
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,880
I’m happy that you came to me last night.

620
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,400
But I was stupid that I can’t keep that chance.

621
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,720
Thank you again for taking care of me.

622
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,680
I...

623
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,160
I won’t bother you again.

624
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,360
You said it yourself again.

625
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,960
And you’ve never let me say.

626
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,800
What do you want to tell me?

627
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,520
Um.

628
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,640
Are you ready to listen?

629
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,480
Be quiet this time.

630
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,920
Don’t say, don’t ask and don’t do anything

631
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,960
until I finish, okay?

632
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,560
Okay, but I want to know what’s it about?

633
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,200
About us.

634
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,560
Please start.

635
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,880
I’ll listen. I won’t say anything, only listen to you.

636
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,120
Mark.

637
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,240
Well…

638
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,480
I’m…

639
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,920
P’Kit, look at my eyes.

640
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,680
Just look into my eyes.

641
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,640
Please continue, don’t worry about other thing.

642
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,800
P’Kit.

643
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,200
I change my mind.

644
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,120
Wait until that damn mark’s gone then I’ll tell you.

645
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,080
P’Kit.

646
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,200
P’Kit.

647
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,200
It will take many days for that.

648
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,600
P’Kit.

649
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,680
P’Kit, come back.

650
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,520
What will you going to say about us?

651
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,080
P’Kit?

652
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,640
When can I get rid of it!

653
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,440
I wrote a note here.

654
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,280
Please read it before scolding me.

655
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,160
Don’t be angry at me.

656
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,240
I told you I love you more when you’re being mad.

657
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:42,000
My feelings for you are still the same.

658
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,920
Don’t be angry at me. I love you more when you’re being mad.

659
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,000
I forgot something, can I go up and get it?

660
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,280
No. Leave it here!!

661
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,600
Mark.

662
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,400
What are you doing?

663
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,120
Do you really want to know?

664
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,120
Don't trust Thanu so much.

665
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,520
People like him

666
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,400
never love someone

667
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,360
except himself.

668
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,680
Now you listen to my mind already.

669
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,320
And when I listen to your mind?

670
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,920
So.

671
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,920
Are we...

672
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,920
I saw that you took Viva Plus away.

673
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,800
Um.

674
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,160
Who’ll you going to give it?

675
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,320
Your man?

676
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,360
It’s for friend.

677
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,880
He lacks of vitamins lately.

678
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,320
Just friend?

679
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,760
Then, why you need to worry about him that much?

680
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,880
That’s for me, right?

681
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,360
Yeah, get it.

682
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:58,120
Eat a lot, okay?

683
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,520
But I’m not just friend!

684
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,920
Woww! Not a friend!

685
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,640
Not a friend!
