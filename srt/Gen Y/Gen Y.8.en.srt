1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,000
If you’re hurt just say it.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,560
Is it that hard to be honest with your feelings?

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,200
P’Pha, you came back to me.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,920
You really did.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,920
I’m so fine.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,560
Mark.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,600
Who gave you that mark?

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,120
Shit!

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,200
Wait until that damn hickey’s gone then we can talk.

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,400
P’Kit.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,600
How can I get rid of it.

12
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,280
Don’t scold me.
The more you get mad, the more I love you!

13
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,120
My feelings for you are still the same.

14
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,040
Don’t scold me.
The more you get mad, the more I love you!

15
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,120
I forgot something. Can I go back up and get it?

16
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,520
No! Just leave it here!!!

17
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,880
That umbrella’s quite hard to close.
It needs some tricks… do you want my help?

18
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,200
Such a stubborn umbrella...

19
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,600
Just like its owner!

20
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,840
Such a stubborn umbrella. Just like its owner!

21
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,360
What is it?

22
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,240
If you don’t know why you’re here, then I’ll go back to sleep.

23
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,880
Wait.

24
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,000
Calm down.

25
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,960
Hmm...

26
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,520
Look closely.

27
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,200
There’s no hickey anymore.

28
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,400
So what? Why’re you showing it to me?

29
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,760
Let’s talk about us.

30
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,920
You said we’d talk if the hickey’s gone.

31
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,680
Are you sure? I can still see it.

32
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,000
I checked it very well earlier. It’s gone.

33
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
Are you blind?

34
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,960
Go back and check again.

35
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,560
My eyes might have a problem.

36
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,200
Guess, I need your help to check it for me.

37
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,760
I won’t do anything. I’ll go back to sleep.

38
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,360
Hey!

39
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,800
Get out of my bed.

40
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,960
Aw! Don’t be possessive.

41
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,000
We slept together here all night, didn’t we?

42
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,520
Aren’t you sleepy?

43
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,080
Come here. Let’s sleep together.

44
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,720
Do you want to try me?

45
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,680
What do you have for me to try?

46
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,800
Stop talking! You’re dead!

47
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,240
P’Kit.

48
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,760
Check again closely.

49
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,360
If it’s still there.

50
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,200
Or… are there any hickeys anywhere else?

51
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,880
Why?

52
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,880
Besides the one on your neck.

53
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,400
You also have other hickeys?

54
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,560
If I have any.

55
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,720
It must be only from you.

56
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,560
If you want a scar, I can give it to you.

57
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,960
So rough.

58
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,800
But I like it.

59
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,320
When you were gone.

60
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,320
I’ve been missing you all the time, you know?

61
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,120
Who are you?

62
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,760
Where is the real Mark?

63
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,480
The old Mark couldn’t win your heart and even lost you once.

64
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,720
So, I’ve changed to be a new man.

65
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,040
I’ll do everything I can when you’re still with me.

66
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,880
Because I don’t want to regret it.

67
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,840
Huh.

68
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,640
The new Mark’s so bold.

69
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,400
Aren’t you scared that I might beat you up?

70
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,480
Old or new me.

71
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,600
I’m always afraid of you.

72
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,520
But I have to be fearless.

73
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,560
Because I fear that you won’t love me.

74
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,760
Please give me a chance.

75
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,640
I didn’t want it to come out like that.

76
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,880
It’s my fault that I overstepped into someone else’s business.

77
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,520
While the only one I should care about is…

78
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,200
Are you still hurt?

79
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,320
Yes, I am.

80
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,880
It’s not easy to recover.

81
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,520
I need Dr. Kit to cure me.

82
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
P’Kit.

83
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,680
I’m sorry, Mark

84
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,440
and thank you for still having faith in me.

85
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,320
Mark.

86
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What are you doing?

87
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,440
Do you really want to know?

88
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,360
We aren’t together. You can’t do this to me.

89
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,400
I said you can’t.

90
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,680
I don’t like skipping steps.

91
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,280
Don’t scold me yet.

92
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,360
I just…

93
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,240
I know how you think about me.

94
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,760
But I’m a good boy. I always listen to you.

95
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,000
If you tell me to stop, I will stop.

96
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,800
Even Though, I don’t want to.

97
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:09,240
You know that I can’t get over you.

98
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,080
It’s up to you now.

99
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,960
If you want to give me another chance.

100
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,920
I should be the one asking for a chance.

101
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,400
If we’re going to be boyfriends.

102
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,440
I should be the one who asks you.

103
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
What?

104
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,720
Are you going to ask me?

105
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,680
Where? When? How?

106
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,760
Tell me more, Please!

107
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,600
Give me a clue!

108
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,160
You’ll know when it’s time.

109
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,120
Just be prepared.

110
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Can you ask me now?

111
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,200
Please!

112
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,600
This will be the last time for you to wait.

113
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,560
Can you do it?

114
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,080
Um.

115
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,800
I’ll wait, no matter how long.

116
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
Just one thing.

117
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,880
Please don't have me wait in vain.

118
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,720
I came today.

119
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,440
Because I won’t have much time for you next week.

120
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,680
I have to rehearse with Yu every evening.

121
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,960
For the Winter Love Festival. Did you know about this event?

122
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,040
That Music performance in the park, right?

123
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,840
Yes. You must go. I’ll book the front row for you.

124
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,680
If I can, I will.

125
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,560
Don’t you want to know what I'm going to perform? And for whom?

126
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,680
If I want to know, I’ll ask Wayu myself.

127
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
P’Kit.

128
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,680
This song will represent my feelings for you.

129
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,720
How can you ask about it from other people?

130
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,800
If that’s so.

131
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,320
You should go practicing now because I want to go back to sleep.

132
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
Wait.

133
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,720
I was wondering...

134
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
What now?

135
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,920
If I come here next time as your boyfriend.

136
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,480
Then it won’t be skipping steps, right?

137
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,560
Enough! Get out!

138
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:43,080
So, I’m begging the stars to please tell me…

139
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,560
I think I still need to adjust it.

140
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,320
It isn’t good enough.

141
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,280
You’re even more serious than me.

142
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,440
And the song you prepared, is there something special about it?

143
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,000
Tell me.

144
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,920
I just picked one that goes along with yours.

145
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,200
Nah!

146
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,040
Don’t lie to me. I can tell when someone’s in love.

147
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,120
And when you were singing.

148
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,080
It made who you were thinking of.

149
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,360
Are you going to keep practicing?

150
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,080
I give you 15 minutes more, then I’ll go.

151
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,480
We can continue tomorrow.

152
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,880
I sing with my feelings and love.

153
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,040
So, it’ll come out beautiful anyhow.

154
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,880
Let’s pack our stuff.

155
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,680
Where’s your mind at?

156
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,000
Who’re you going to meet?

157
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,480
I…

158
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
I’m going to see a friend. What’s so weird?

159
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,040
Don’t tell me that…

160
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,160
It’s this friend.

161
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
P’Thanu!

162
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,800
Are you looking for me? Do you need anything?

163
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,720
It’s Wayu.

164
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,119
Ho! You didn’t get my joke.

165
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,119
You didn’t pass the test.

166
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,040
Mark.

167
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,400
See you tomorrow.

168
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,760
I’ll treat him a dinner

169
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,040
to repay him for taking care of me when I was sick.

170
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,880
Let’s go, P’Thanu before it gets crowded.

171
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,440
P’Thanu.

172
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,720
Don’t forget to watch him sing at the Winter Love Festival.

173
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,640
I tell you that it’ll be special.

174
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,240
Uh. Don’t listen to him. He’s talking nonsense.

175
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,920
Hey.

176
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,400
You need to hold on to him just to take him for dinner?

177
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,160
Well! Well!

178
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,000
You!

179
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,760
I’ll tell P’Kit!

180
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,560
I thought that we’d meet at the restaurant.

181
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,000
I just finished my drawing class around here,

182
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,440
so we might as well go together.

183
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,160
Besides studying in Medicines,

184
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,560
I never knew that you’re also fond of drawing.

185
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,480
I learned it to use for note taking to help me understand difficult lessons better.

186
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,960
Now I’m taking a class.

187
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,880
Because I want my drawings to look more realistic.

188
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,400
Can I see your drawings?

189
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,280
Sure. I’ll show you when we’re at the restaurant.

190
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,040
Hey! What’s up, Thanu?

191
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,760
Why’re you here?

192
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,840
You told me that you’ll get back to study next semester, didn’t you?

193
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,760
Aw!

194
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,880
Nong Wayu.

195
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,840
Did you guys come together?

196
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Yes.

197
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
Jack.

198
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Nong Yu…

199
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,120
Aw, Jack. You told me that it’d be only us.

200
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,040
Why is Wayu also here?

201
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,360
Are… you guys… having dinner together?

202
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,960
We just need to discuss…

203
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,360
about our competition.

204
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,680
But it’s not a point.

205
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,880
Koh.

206
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,960
He didn’t come with me, but he came with Thanu.

207
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,840
Aw!

208
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,400
How could you, P’Thanu!

209
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,240
You came after and snatch him.

210
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,880
You break the rule.

211
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,120
Stop it, P’Jack and P’Koh.

212
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,840
I’m single now.

213
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:36,640
I can do anything anywhere with anyone whoever I want.

214
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
Besides.

215
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,000
I’m the one who asked him out.

216
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
Thanu.

217
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,640
I’ve never seen you liked anyone before.

218
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,680
And now you happen to be interested in someone I like.

219
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,560
What’re you trying to do?

220
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,840
You reap what others have sowed.

221
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,000
This isn’t right.

222
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,520
You guys are misunderstanding.

223
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,120
I came here today.

224
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,880
Because he wanted to repay my help previously.

225
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,720
It's still suspicious.

226
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,400
Nong Wayu’s so cute.

227
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,960
You must have some kind of feelings for him.

228
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,040
That’s right.

229
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,440
You just use that excuse to smoothly get close to our Wayu.

230
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,800
And try to seduce him without his awareness.

231
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,480
That’s not going to work, P’Thanu.

232
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,960
Wait.

233
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
We just…

234
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,560
And since when did you guys become teammates?

235
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,680
It’s useless to argue anyway.

236
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,000
We all know that Wayu still can’t get over Parawee.

237
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,720
That’s in the past.

238
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
But now.

239
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:54,120
I believe that my love will help him forget his ex.

240
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,640
No one can replace anyone, Jack.

241
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
Also,

242
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,000
It’s better to let Wayu decide who he wants.

243
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,520
Thanks, again.

244
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,560
If you didn’t help me that day.

245
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,640
I would be in trouble.

246
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,640
And...

247
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,040
I’m really sorry.

248
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,200
If...

249
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,960
I said or did anything that seemed harassing you.

250
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,960
You feel better, right?

251
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,480
Take good care of yourself.

252
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,240
It’s not only me.

253
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,120
But also someone worried about you.

254
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
And...

255
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,880
earlier, what you said about me and P’Pha.

256
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,360
Well…

257
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,480
I want to tell you that...

258
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,680
Wayu.

259
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,320
You wanted to see my drawing, right?

260
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,520
Whoa!

261
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,960
If I didn’t know that you’re studying in Medicine,

262
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
I’d think that you’re from the Faculty of Arts.

263
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,280
You’re very talented, P’Thanu.

264
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,640
Wow.

265
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Kitty.

266
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,880
Sorry! I spilt some water!

267
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,240
Let me take care of P’Jack.

268
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,720
There’s no need.

269
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,520
P’Jack...

270
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,400
keeps interrupting us.

271
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
I have an idea.

272
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,520
Mark told me he has a special song?

273
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:48,240
I’m helping him prepare the song.

274
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:56,040
If P’Kit doesn’t show up, he must be disappointed.

275
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:05,800
Would you like me to bring Kit there?

276
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Can you?

277
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,480
What’re they doing?

278
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Maybe Math tutoring?

279
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,000
Tutoring your ass!

280
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,680
They’re too sweet.

281
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,400
Or they’re planning to get rid of you?

282
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,080
It’s YOU who they’re trying to get rid of, Koh!

283
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Hello.

284
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,480
As usual?

285
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,640
Yes.

286
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,040
Those kids have finished the internship.

287
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,760
They’re probably preparing for their University admission.

288
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,080
So, we have a new kid.

289
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,760
I’m helping him prepare the song.
If P’Kit doesn’t show up, he will be disappointed.

290
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,600
You fell asleep again?

291
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,160
You said you couldn’t keep up with studying.

292
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,600
Which one don’t you understand?

293
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,400
The first one, please.

294
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,440
I’m not sure if I choose the right answer.

295
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,280
Hold on.

296
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,960
Yes.

297
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,400
The Winter Love Festival?

298
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,080
I’m not sure if I’ll go yet.

299
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,520
I can go with you if you need a company.

300
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,360
Okay.

301
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,480
Let’s schedule it later.

302
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,280
I want to go to the Winter Love Fest, too.

303
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,440
Do you know about it?

304
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,680
Of course.

305
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,760
If I don’t have to catch up on studying, I won’t miss it.

306
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,160
You have to go.

307
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,440
Go see people express their love through music.

308
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,600
Starry-eyed.

309
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,680
And which one you were asking?

310
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,960
The first one, please.

311
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,040
I’m not sure if I chose the right answer.

312
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,800
It’s so cold.

313
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,440
Let the star keep you warm.

314
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,920
Eww!

315
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,800
Enough, enough!

316
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,800
This isn't a comedy show.

317
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,360
Welcome everyone to…

318
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,920
Winter Love Festival!

319
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,440
Oho! Jigchow.

320
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,960
I’m telling you, it’s going to be so fun tonight!

321
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,880
We have...

322
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,360
a bunch of entertainers to entertain our lovely audiences.

323
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,960
Since we have limited area tonight,

324
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,760
let’s move closer and make each other warm.

325
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,920
That’s right.

326
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,720
Get very very close, everybody!

327
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,800
Okay...

328
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
But if you hate each other, then suck up the cold.

329
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,800
Are you guys cold?

330
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,560
Nooo!

331
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:38,320
But you at the front should never get cold at all.

332
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,600
How are you, chubby boy?

333
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,080
Chubby!

334
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,520
Hey.

335
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,760
There!

336
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,680
My guy and yours have arrived.

337
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Whose guy?

338
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
What’re you talking about?

339
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,080
Be clear.

340
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,200
P’Koh and P’Jack are here, too.

341
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,920
Hey, keep an eye on them.

342
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,920
If they start a fight for you right here.

343
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,400
I can’t help you.

344
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,800
You’d better keep your mouth for singing.

345
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,040
If you talk too much, I’ll quit.

346
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,720
Hey!

347
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
No!

348
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,280
I devote myself to it.

349
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,200
How do I look?

350
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,360
Do I look good enough for P’Kit to accept my love?

351
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,640
Today is your day, Mark.

352
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,280
I root for you.

353
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,280
I believe your efforts and sincerity

354
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,040
will shine through the music.

355
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,160
Um.

356
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,800
Let’s go. I’m ready.

357
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,440
Let’s do it!

358
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,680
Alright guys.

359
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,920
Do you see what I see?

360
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,880
With my two little eyes.

361
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,480
Are you guys ready for our two favorite gorgeous buddies?

362
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,800
Do you know?

363
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,400
We have both beau and belle joining us tonight.

364
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,080
But who’s beau, who’s belle?

365
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,040
Wayu is belle, Wayu is belle!

366
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,200
Okay, okay guys.

367
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,680
Let’s hear it from themselves.

368
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,560
Please welcome our freshmen beau buddies.

369
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,200
Mark from Engineering and Wayu from Science.

370
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,160
Wayu – Science! Wayu – Science!

371
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,000
Thank you everyone for coming.

372
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,840
Especially...

373
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,720
the one who’s my star.

374
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,320
After hearing my song.

375
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,920
I hope you’ll give us another chance.

376
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,640
There’re million stars tonight.

377
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:42,160
But I only have you in my heart.

378
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,840
Looking in each other’s eyes, side by side.

379
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,720
I want to kiss my star under the moon shadow.

380
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,200
Where have you been?

381
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,920
Come lean on my warm heart, dear.

382
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:09,400
I said. Your dream will shine bright when you leave.

383
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:17,040
My love is around you.

384
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:25,440
My heart will always have you.

385
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:32,600
If there're only you and me here tonight,

386
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,199
I’ll stay till the star lights fading away.

387
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,800
I’ll remember this wonderful feeling.

388
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,639
No other lights shine brighter than your heart.

389
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,280
Where have you been?

390
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:54,880
Come lean on my warm heart, dear.

391
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:04,880
I said. Your dream will shine bright when you leave.

392
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:11,280
Love isn’t far from you.

393
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:20,400
My love is around you.

394
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:27,240
I’m singing from my heart,

395
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,880
I love you.

396
00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:01,680
If there were a million stars tonight,

397
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:08,600
May I ask just one to please listen to me?

398
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:15,280
Because tonight I’m so worried.

399
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:22,400
I want to pray and beg to the star.

400
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:29,520
Now my heart feels so weak.

401
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,440
I want to know his feelings after he listened to my words.

402
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,880
Because I just told him that I love him,

403
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:49,840
and It was like a dream that he listened to all my words.

404
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,880
I’m not sure...

405
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,080
If tomorrow we’re gonna be happy or sad.

406
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:09,200
So, I’m begging the stars to please tell me…

407
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,000
Please take my flowers, Wayu.

408
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,040
Mine are...

409
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,920
bigger.

410
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,320
But mine are more expensive and classier.

411
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,640
Take mine, please.

412
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:41,680
Koh!

413
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,680
Are you bullying my flowers?

414
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,920
Well, they’re ugly and too yellowy.

415
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,240
Mine is so colorful. Unlike yours, so plain.

416
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,720
White is so classy.

417
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,800
Hey, enough!

418
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Mine is better.

419
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,160
Mine is better.

420
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:56,840
Calm down.

421
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,280
Classy and expensive.

422
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,040
They’re both beautiful. Stop fighting, please.

423
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,800
That yellow flowers are not pretty at all.

424
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,800
What are you doing?

425
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:29,080
From now on you can’t have eyes for anyone.

426
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,000
Only for me.

427
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,960
There’s only you here.

428
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,160
How can I look at anyone else?

429
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,800
You’re giving me hopes.

430
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,120
You heard my feelings...

431
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:51,120
and when will I hear yours?

432
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,440
Just listen to me.

433
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:59,520
Don’t say anything until I finish.

434
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,560
You marked me once.

435
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,280
Now I give it back to you.

436
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,400
Mark...

437
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,880
You asked me.

438
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,080
How important you are to me.

439
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,960
Please know that...

440
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,660
You are the most important person.

441
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:39,690
P’Kit…

442
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,000
Are you giving me a chance?

443
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,160
Are you sure that...

444
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,640
you’re ready to take care of me?

445
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,540
I’m ready.

446
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,240
Are you ready to get scolded every day?

447
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,600
I’m ready.

448
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,320
Are you ready to stand beside me...

449
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,520
and never leave?

450
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,800
I’m ready since the first day I knew I’ve fallen for you.

451
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,230
If so.

452
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,600
Then…

453
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,080
Will you be my boyfriend?

454
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:29,570
What?

455
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,320
I can’t hear it.

456
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,200
Can you say it again?

457
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,160
Do you want to be my boyfriend or not?

458
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,720
Ummmm.

459
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,240
Let me think about it...

460
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,200
or you’ll say I’m easy that...

461
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,160
I accept it since the first time you ask me.

462
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,320
I haven’t played hard to get yet.

463
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
Ten...

464
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Nine...

465
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:55,960
Eight...

466
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,840
Why are you counting?

467
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,400
If I count to one, you get ready to find a new boyfriend.

468
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,280
Seven...

469
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:01,960
Six...

470
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,640
Five...

471
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,640
Four...

472
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:04,760
Three...

473
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:22,950
Okay, fine!

474
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,280
I’ll be your boyfriend.

475
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,090
Who allowed you to kiss me?

476
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,720
You counted so fast.

477
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,200
I’m afraid I’d miss it.

478
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,470
Also...

479
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,000
we are dating now,

480
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,920
I can kiss you many as times as I want.

481
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,960
Who told you that you can kiss me unlimitedly?

482
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,280
You have something for me?

483
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,520
I don’t have anything for you.

484
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,680
I was busy rehearsing.

485
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,960
The song you sang to me tonight is...

486
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:58,600
worth more than anything else.

487
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,320
Thank you.

488
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,960
I’ll keep it well.

489
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,720
Let me set it up.

490
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,280
Wait.

491
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,920
Are you ready to start it with me?

492
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,680
I am so ready.

493
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,520
Thank you for...

494
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:54,280
letting our time run together.

495
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,040
Let’s start our time together.

496
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:29,890
Do you like it?

497
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,400
Thanks.

498
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,120
Do you like it?

499
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,560
To the moon...

500
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:39,120
and back.

501
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,120
To the moon and back
#MarkKitBoyfriend

502
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,080
Sorry.

503
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,600
Dr. Kit, Mark’s boyfriend.

504
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,320
Seems like everybody’s talking about...

505
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,280
Kit and Mark are dating.

506
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,120
P’Thanu!

507
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,360
Can you be the only one that doesn’t tease me about it.

508
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:21,080
What would you like, Mark’s boyfriend?

509
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:35,350
Wait a moment.

510
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:36,760
Yu’s coming.

511
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,720
Didn’t you tell me that the Engineering building is my prohibited area?

512
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:43,160
We have a lot of photos on our cell phone.

513
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,520
Why would we bother others?

514
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:51,000
I just want beautiful photos for our one-month anniversary.

515
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,720
I was about to talk to you about this.

516
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,190
Let’s see in three months,

517
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:59,280
If you’ll pass boyfriend probation.

518
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,400
Am I not your boyfriend yet?

519
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,640
We’re in trial.

520
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,860
You’ve never heard of?

521
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:09,000
It’s like three months’ work probation.

522
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,000
If you don’t pass…

523
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:13,720
What’s that?

524
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,440
You can’t fire me from being your boyfriend.

525
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,400
You’ve never told me!

526
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:18,480
Well...

527
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,680
I’m telling you now.

528
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,680
Or you’re afraid that you won’t pass?

529
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,480
If I pass and get to be your boyfriend officially,

530
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,240
do you have any rewards for me?

531
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:29,960
Let’s see if you pass first.

532
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:31,360
Well...

533
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:34,640
how’s my score during the past month?

534
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:37,560
On the borderline.

535
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:39,960
You obviously make it hard for me.

536
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,440
Since you’re assessing me,

537
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,280
then let me finish my job.

538
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:48,120
What are you talking about?

539
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,080
Don’t be mad.

540
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,080
Well…

541
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,040
last time in your room...

542
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:57,520
we were still in the middle of it.

543
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:06,280
Can I continue it?

544
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,240
Mark!

545
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,980
You’re so dirty!

546
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,510
Yu!

547
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,800
Since when did they always stick together?

548
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,520
Do you know?

549
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,560
I also want a building in the picture, please.

550
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,400
One, two, three…

551
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,280
Smile.

552
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:44,700
What?

553
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:53,760
Both P’Jack and P’Koh will have to be disappointed, I suppose.

554
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,040
They almost killed each other for Wayu.

555
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,560
But suddenly someone else stole him.

556
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:01,640
It’d be good if they can end up together.

557
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,080
P’Padbok.

558
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,600
Would you take a picture for me and...

559
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:12,560
my boyfriend, please?

560
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,320
What picture, Mark?

561
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,680
I’m late for my class now.

562
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:18,560
Maybe next time…

563
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,160
Well, fine!

564
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,720
I never refuse when people ask for help anyway.

565
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:40,880
Give me some nice shots.

566
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,040
I want to show everybody that...

567
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,960
this man has been taken.

568
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:48,440
I know.

569
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:50,760
Despite my bad look,

570
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,960
I don’t betray anyone, cold-bloodedly.

571
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,320
Ready?

572
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,720
I think P’Padbok probably misunderstood P’Thanu for something.

573
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,440
You guys should calm down and talk.

574
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,400
How good it is to be Thanu!

575
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,200
People still protect you no matter how much bad you’ve done.

576
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,570
Did he know...

577
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:26,120
what his decent Thanu did to a bad guy like me?

578
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,190
It’s our business.

579
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,480
Don’t drag Wayu into this.

580
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,280
I’m warning you.

581
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,160
Don’t trust him too much.

582
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:43,640
A guy like him never loves anyone but himself.

583
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,640
He’s not what you said.

584
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,920
How about a man who got away and left his friend behind?

585
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:53,040
While his friend was waiting to be bailed out from the jail.

586
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,240
What do you call a guy like that?

587
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,520
I don’t know what happened between you guys.

588
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,760
But if it happened with me and Mark.

589
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,360
I’d trust my friend.

590
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:13,040
Even if he left me waiting in the jail.

591
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,490
I’d just wait.

592
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,560
Because I know that...

593
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,960
he’ll find a way to help me out.

594
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,160
There won’t be anyone leaving another behind.

595
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,280
Let me ask you, P’Padbok.

596
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:32,240
Who’s actually betraying his friend’s trust.

597
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,280
Don’t say anything if you don’t know!

598
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:35,000
Stop already, Padbok!

599
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:39,120
We can’t fix what happened that night.

600
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,320
Tell me what I can do today to make it up.

601
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,720
Do you think it’s that easy to recall our friendship that has been broken?

602
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,120
Padbok!

603
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,160
Padbok!

604
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,160
What’s with you and Thanu again?

605
00:50:58,710 --> 00:50:59,920
Drop it now!

606
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:02,280
We’re having a test. Hurry!

607
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,880
Why does it have to be today?

608
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,520
It’s for your own sake!

609
00:51:09,030 --> 00:51:10,320
Let’s go! Jack’s buying us time.

610
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:12,000
Hurry! We need to run now.

611
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,280
Remember.

612
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,480
You can fool everyone today.

613
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,880
But one day they’ll see how you actually are.

614
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,240
Come on!

615
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:41,800
I’m sorry.

616
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,360
I shouldn’t bring you here.

617
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:49,640
It’s my fault, I shouldn’t have got him here.

618
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:51,680
It’s good that you’re aware of it.

619
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:53,640
Be careful next time.

620
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,240
Otherwise, I’ll consider you failing the probation.

621
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
P’Thanu.

622
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,280
Don’t make that face.

623
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,600
You are not alone.

624
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,320
I’m on your side.

625
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:10,840
As well as P’Kit...

626
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,280
and Mark.

627
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:19,320
If P’Padbok tries to mess with you again.

628
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,280
I’ll be your back up.

629
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:25,840
What back up?

630
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,800
You little shorty. If P’Thanu didn’t block him.

631
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,360
You’d be beaten up already.

632
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:43,450
Thanks for your faith in me.

633
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:47,120
Let’s take a few more photos.

634
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:47,960
Come on, P’Kit.

635
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:48,960
What else to take?

636
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,200
Come on, hurry up!

637
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,440
You didn’t even…

638
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,840
P’Thanu.

639
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,260
Be honest with me.

640
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:04,920
You’re taking care of Wayu...

641
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:07,520
for Parawee.

642
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,480
Am I right?

643
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,320
Or you don’t approve of me doing this?

644
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:19,800
If Wayu misunderstands your actions.

645
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:23,560
how will you take care of his feelings?

646
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,240
Wayu’s much better now.

647
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:31,480
If Parawee’s back,

648
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,200
I’ll make sure that...

649
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,240
he won’t hurt Wayu once again.

650
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:38,720
If he can’t do it.

651
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,880
Will you take him back?

652
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:47,880
I don’t have the right to do that.

653
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,360
At first, I didn’t understand.

654
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,960
Why Pha left Wayu with you.

655
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:57,840
But now I can see that he knows that...

656
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:02,320
you’ll never betray him...

657
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,360
or cross the line with Wayu.

658
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,840
But you can’t control the feelings.

659
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,640
I want you to think this through.

660
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:23,880
I’m begging you.

661
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:26,240
Don’t pick a quarrel with Wayu again.

662
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,160
I didn’t mean to.

663
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,560
I just want him to...

664
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:33,600
know the truth.

665
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,760
So, he won’t be a fool...

666
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,120
and take the wrong side.

667
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,010
Isn’t it good, Jack?

668
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,400
You’ll have less competitors as well.

669
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,360
It’s not that he’d like me instantly.

670
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:48,400
I want to win it fair and square.

671
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,680
But what if what you were telling him...

672
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,360
isn’t a real story?

673
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,760
What do you mean?

674
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,380
Well…

675
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:08,120
Last time you said you’d only talk to Dr. Kit.

676
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:11,200
Look how it turned out.

677
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,960
It was a big deal.

678
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:16,440
You should calm yourself down.

679
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:37,280
Jew, hold him back!

680
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,840
Jew!

681
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:40,960
Let go of me!

682
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,320
I cannot!

683
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:45,150
Run Wayu! Run!

684
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:46,120
Run!

685
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,800
Where? Why, Jack?

686
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:49,400
No time to explain! Hurry!

687
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,400
Hey! P’Jack!

688
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,360
P’Jack!

689
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:52,680
P’Jack!

690
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,680
Why is P’Padbok looking for me?

691
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:07,680
It’s about Thanu.

692
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,200
You screamed out to be on his side like that.

693
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,560
So, Padbok got mad.

694
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,440
Is that it?

695
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,280
I’m not afraid of him.

696
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:19,440
But I’m afraid.

697
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,760
I can’t stand seeing you get hurt.

698
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,050
Trust me,

699
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,960
you’d better be here.

700
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:42,720
Okay, it’s safe now.

701
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:45,510
Nong… Nong Wayu?

702
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,680
Are you looking for Wayu?

703
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:56,560
Yes.

704
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:57,960
Where is he?

705
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,760
P’Padbok, what do you want from me?

706
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:09,040
We haven’t finished.

707
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:11,720
Thanu isn’t a good person like you think.

708
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:15,080
Do you know why he dropped out?

709
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:18,040
Besides betraying his friend,

710
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,720
he has something worse.

711
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,360
I don’t care.

712
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:25,480
If he’s ready to tell me, he’ll tell me.

713
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,000
Shut up and listen!

714
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:31,840
That’s enough, Padbok! Let go of him now.

715
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:42,440
Are you okay, Wayu?

716
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,120
P’Thanu!

717
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,440
I really want to know!

718
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:53,920
Why?

719
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:59,000
Why the friend I trust the most could do this to me?

720
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,800
How could you leave me like that?

721
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:01,890
I’ve never left you!

722
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,520
Between you and me.

723
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:05,960
Who’s the one betraying trust?

724
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:13,200
Hey, don’t! You’ll get hurt.

725
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,280
So, we’ll let them fight like this?

726
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,160
I’m so done with you guys!

727
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,160
This’s the first time you punched me.

728
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,800
Your punch was harder than I thought.

729
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,360
I’m sorry that...

730
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,280
you got hurt because of me.

731
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:28,440
Are you okay, Yu? I told you to be care…ful.

732
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,400
I’m fine.

733
01:00:32,210 --> 01:00:33,440
P’Thanu saved me.

734
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,440
What were you doing? I saw it.

735
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,920
Hunnae!

736
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,320
You blushed…

737
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:22,850
Uhh, P’Kit.

738
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:25,480
After what happened that day,

739
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:29,050
P’Padbok got a serious warning from professors.

740
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,200
How about the Medicine’s side?

741
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,440
Did P’Thanu get any punishments?

742
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:35,320
They got so bruised!

743
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:36,870
Um...

744
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,640
I saw P’Thanu got a warning, too.

745
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:42,200
But no one asked for responsibility.

746
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:43,480
So, it ended there.

747
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:44,640
Um.

748
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,200
Now I got why you warned me.

749
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:50,720
Violence never fixed any problems.

750
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:55,920
No idea when they’re going to settle eventually.

751
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:58,440
You wanna help them?

752
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:00,440
You’re good at making up, aren’t you?

753
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:02,740
Well…

754
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:04,800
I have to be good at it,

755
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:06,520
since my boyfriend gets mad easily.

756
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:07,720
Who got mad easily?

757
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:10,640
I saw you quite like it.

758
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:12,360
So, should I give you some more treats?

759
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:13,880
I’ll serve you three times...

760
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:14,990
before and after meals every day.

761
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:23,560
I think we should practice diagnosing.

762
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:25,320
Put it on, Doctor.

763
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,960
From my conditions.

764
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:36,000
What do you think, Dr. Kamjornkij?

765
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:37,960
Am I having lovesickness or...

766
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:41,360
broken heart from missing someone too much?

767
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:49,590
I’m sorry, sir.

768
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:53,160
You only have 5 minutes and 59 seconds left to live.

769
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,600
If you have anything you want to do, do it now.

770
01:02:57,470 --> 01:02:59,080
Cursing me like this...

771
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,600
aren’t you afraid of becoming a widower even before graduating?

772
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:04,720
I think this stethoscope is...

773
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,480
broken.

774
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:07,680
Better use this one.

775
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,280
Hey!

776
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:11,880
So, who’s the one studying Medicine?

777
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:18,040
What a mean doctor! You have to console me.

778
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:21,840
My heart is extremely weak.

779
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,320
Do you have any way to help?

780
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,540
I need...

781
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:28,880
something strong.

782
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:30,400
Very very strong!

783
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:33,720
Hmm. Let me give you something refreshing?

784
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:34,720
Um.

785
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:38,200
Try this.

786
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:41,680
Jelly Vitamin A-Z. It has all the vitamins.

787
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:46,040
Since A B1 B2 B3 B5 B6 B7

788
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:48,530
Okay.

789
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:50,210
fine…

790
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:51,470
Refreshing is fine.

791
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,560
Instead of obsessing with dirty stuff.

792
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:55,440
You should worry about Wayu!

793
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,920
Why do I have to worry about him?

794
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:02,880
From what I told you.

795
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:07,000
Don’t you think Wayu and P’Thanu are very happy now?

796
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:09,360
Or did you know something?

797
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,200
P’Thanu.

798
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:15,040
Be honest with me.

799
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:19,720
You’re taking care of Wayu for Parawee.

800
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,880
Am I right?

801
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:25,880
He’s a serious person.

802
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,880
If he’s really into Wayu, we’ll see.

803
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:32,030
P’Kit.

804
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,640
Are you hiding something from me?

805
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:38,600
Didn’t you say that I’m the most important person?

806
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:44,760
At first, I didn’t understand.

807
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:48,080
Why Pah would leave Wayu with you.

808
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:50,850
But now I can see that...

809
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:55,320
he knows that you’ll never betray him...

810
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:57,560
or cross the line with Wayu.

811
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,760
I know as much as I can see!

812
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,320
Mark.

813
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:10,760
Do you have any plans tonight?

814
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:12,560
Hmmm.

815
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:15,160
You changed the subject.

816
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,380
Are you asking me out?

817
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,480
You wanna sleep over at my room?

818
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,440
What did you just say?

819
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:28,960
You wanna sleep over at my room?

820
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:33,430
What did you say?

821
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,480
Are you going to sleep at my room tonight?!

822
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:52,520
Should’ve let you sleep on the floor.

823
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:17,080
I’m a sleep-cuddler.

824
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:21,400
I’m also a sleep-elbower!

825
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,000
Hey.

826
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,760
Let me sleep next to you every night.

827
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:31,000
I can help you fix it.

828
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:33,600
Mark!

829
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,400
We’re dating.

830
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,240
You don’t think that...

831
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:39,960
I’ll stop at kissing you right?

832
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,040
That's all you did...

833
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,160
Because of P'Pha, right?

834
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:20,760
It's mine.

835
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:27,270
You know?

836
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,960
Every second I spent with you

837
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:33,720
is my precious time.

838
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:37,520
Don't you stay with me tonight?

839
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:46,840
What is it?

840
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:49,920
Let’s have breakfast together.

841
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:00,920
Tada!

842
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:05,280
Have it. It’s ready

843
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:08,920
