00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,370
There was an internship program when you were in high school, right?

2
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There was an internship program when you were in high school, right?

3
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,330
I wanna apply there too.

4
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,910
Wow!

5
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,750
I'm sure you've got a lover already.

6
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,329
Let me have a look!

7
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,620
Please! Please! Let me see…

8
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,950


9
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,580
Concentrate on your studies, Sab.

10
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,410
I'm gonna go now.

11
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
Yes sir!

12
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,500
Thank you, P'Pha.

13
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:42,950
You see!

14
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,500
Dr. Pharawee and Wayu

15
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,620
are so sweet this early!

16
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,290
A Campus Junior Beau and a Beau of Science Faculty on this
year.

17
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,450
One is so handsome, like an angel

18
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,909
and the other is also cute and charming.

19
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:55,040
Such a nice couple of Beau & Beau.

20
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,830
They're both Moons by the way.

21
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,580
Mark!

22
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,000
I want him!

23
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,290
What should I do?

24
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,620
Line up girl.

25
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,540
The end of the queue

26
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,160
is over there! You see…

27
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,040

28
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,909
So Hot!!

29
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:39,620
He is definitely the Campus Beau this year!

30
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,790
Mark. Freshman Moon of Engineering Faculty.

31
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,200
Many people have their eyes on him.

32
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,870
But nobody has gotten him yet.

33
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,750
Ahem!

34
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,450
What is this? P'Jack. P'Jew.

35
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,540
Special benefit from the faculty,

36
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,500
for our new Campus Moon.

37
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,200
Which faculty is he from, Jew?

38
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,040
Cheer for me!

39
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,950
Ofcourse from Engineering Faculty Jack!

40
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,540
After the Faculty of Medicine took it for 2 years.

41
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,580
Finally the honourable Moon award is returned to us,

42
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,870
Engineering Faculty!

43
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,870
Let's shake hands!

44
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,750
Super!

45
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,790
Come on! Come on!

46
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,200
I saw it bro.

47
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,790
Girls from these

48
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,540
belle from those.

49
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,040
They keep flirting with you!

50
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,750
If any of them gets hurt by you,

51
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,580
hand them over to us, we will treat them well.

52
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,250
Sorry sir,

53
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,700
there won't be anyone getting hurt.

54
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,750
Cause I am super duper single. Guaranteed.

55
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,750
Really?

56
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,950
Are you lying?

57
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,370
I didn't lie to you.

58
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,620
Just, I really don’t have one yet. Trust me!

59
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,700
He's lying.

60
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,330
I've never met the right one yet.

61
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,080
This theory's been called….

62
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,080
Hello professor.

63
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,200
Although this class is mixed with others faculties,

64
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,040
It would be good if you could come on time, please.

65
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,200
I'm sorry, Professor.

66
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
Wait.

67
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,540
Nice flowers.

68
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,910
Thanks.

69
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,539
Thank you.

70
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,580
That is for congratulating me, right?

71
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,580
Not funny!

72
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,450
Just a little joke, don't be so dramatic.

73
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,330
P'Pha, he's so full of package.

74
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,040
Is there anything for me?

75
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,410
Let me remind you that I'm your best friend bro!

76
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,580
Well, you know...

77
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,410
I'm going to treat you to dinner.

78
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,870
Hah! Really?

79
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,160
Yes.

80
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,620
Pha wanna celebrate you cause you got a beau award next to
him.

81
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,120
But it's alright if you can’t go.

82
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,250
Ofcourse I'll go!

83
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,790
Since you let me be a fishbone in your throat.

84
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,500
You know what? I'll sit in the middle, between you and P'Pha.

85
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,250
Who told you that it's gonna be only me and P'Pha?

86
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,250
P'Pha's best friend will also join us!

87
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,160
Pha's best friend?

88
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,040
Who?

89
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,080
Hey! If you're bringing someone else,

90
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,830
make sure he's worthy enough of my honourary  beauty award okay?

91
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Is it him?

92
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,950
If Dr. Pharawee is the face.

93
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,000
Then, Dr. Kamjornkit must be the brain of the Medicine Faculty.

94
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,790
Dr. Kit got top scores in every classes.

95
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,620
He's the god of the faculty

96
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,830
He's not only smart, but is very kind as well.

97
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,330
That's why he's loved and respected by everyone.

98
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,120
He is the best friend of P'Pha.

99
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,790
So can you promise me...

100
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:14,500
that you won't annoy him or do anything ridiculous to him?

101
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,660
Kid!

102
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,370
Yeah I'm talking to you, kid!

103
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,450
I'm Mark,

104
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,870
from the Engineering Faculty.

105
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,540
I am the Campus Beau of this year.

106
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,700
I've come to see Dr. Pha.

107
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,700
Do you know him?

108
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,040
Freshman…

109
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,410
what kind of right do you think you have to call me kid?

110
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,500
I address everyone who looks young as "Nong".

111
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,160
But if you want me to call you by your name,

112
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,500
just introduce yourself to me, "kid"

113
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,160
Open your eyes!

114
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,200
And know that I am your senior!

115
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,290
Don't be a jackass calling me "nong" again.

116
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,370
Yes, P'Kit.

117
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,540
I knew it.

118
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,540
I'm just messing with you.

119
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,330
Don't mind me, please.

120
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't let me hear it again.

121
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,040
Pha's already picked up Wayu.

122
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,540
You came late,

123
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,750
Just join them at the restaurant.

124
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,750
Wait.

125
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,950
Can I go with you, please.

126
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,040
Don't you have a car?

127
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes, I do.

128
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,370
But I don’t know the way.

129
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,250
Please… we're going the same way anyways.

130
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:44,580
Have mercy on a freshman, please.

131
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,910
Give me your phone.

132
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,750
Unlock it!

133
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,620
It's the only mercy I can show you.

134
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,160
You're the one who set my GPS,

135
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,870
why did you just get here?

136
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,330
I drove behind you and saw that you made the wrong turn.

137
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,290
and saw that you did another wrong turn.

138
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,290
Even when I wanted to tell you, I didn't know how.

139
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,790
I don't have your number.

140
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,290
Should we have each other's number?

141
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,500
In case of an emergency?

142
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,000
Can you stop disturbing me!

143
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,580
I'm not disturbing you.

144
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,540
But you're standing in my way.

145
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm not.

146
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But…

147
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,870
It's written here "Pull" not "Push"

148
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,250
If I enter and break the door.

149
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,790
It'll be your responsibiity.

150
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
After you...

151
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,250
Kit! Mark!

152
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,540
This way.

153
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,870
You can't sit here.

154
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,370
It's reserved.

155
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,790
Where's Pha?

156
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,040
P'Pha is outside, on the phone with someone from home.

157
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,250
But he said we can start eating.

158
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,250
Don't wait for him.

159
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,910
Hey!

160
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,040
Don't be nosy!

161
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,330
So, P'Kit likes to eat liver?

162
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,790
I can eat anything.

163
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,330
Mind your own business.

164
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,160
It's good if you can eat anything.

165
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,870
So my heart…

166
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,000
I'll give it to you okay?

167
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,910
If you don't eat it.

168
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,290
Can I get an onion, please?
(onion = homophone with kiss in Thai)

169
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,790
I mean the onion on your plate.

170
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
Yu.

171
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,910
Sorry, I totally forgot about taking care of you.

172
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,790
Here you go.

173
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,580
Phalo Egg.

174
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,370
P'Kit… Do you want some?

175
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,370
Even if it's too dark…

176
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,450
But it's nice.

177
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,500
Excuse me. Have you ordered drinks yet?

178
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,790
May I have a "taro" juice for him, please?
(Taro = Homophone with ‘intrude’ in Thai)

179
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,450
Sorry, sir. We don't have the Taro juice on our menu,

180
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,830
So may I have Longan juice instead, please?
(Longan means ‘be annoying’ in Thai)

181
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:42,950
For me

182
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,250
I want the Coconut water, please.

183
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,410
But, could you possibly serve me a whole coconut?

184
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,040
Cause I would throw it at some kid's contradicting head around

185
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,950
May I have a young coconut, please?

186
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,620
Since this elder seems to like

187
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,200
something younger.

188
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,450
Ahh… Here comes P'Pha.

189
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,040
P'Pha. This meal will make you broke.

190
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,250
Because both of us and your friend

191
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,700
won't stop ordering food.

192
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,329
Don't you know Pha! It won't hurt his pocket!

193
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,869
You can even take away home.

194
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,700
I want boiled egg fried in a sweet sauce.
(This food’s been called ‘son-in-law egg’)

195
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,410
But not for me actually.

196
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,450
It's for this elder

197
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,660
so he can take it home to his parents.

198
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,290
Okay, sir.

199
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,290
Will you go back home or your dormitory today?

200
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Dorm.

201
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,000
It's too late and I don’t like Pha driving too far.

202
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,040
Whoa! Why don't you rest at Pha's dorm tonight?

203
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,620
I have my own.

204
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,330
I'll go back to my place.

205
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,200
Why do I need to go to Pha's?

206
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,370
But you guys are boyfriends.

207
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,120
Oh…. Or…

208
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,790
You haven’t done it …. yet?

209
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,250
Really?

210
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,410
I really respect Pha.

211
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,700
Seeing each other for a long time.

212
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,620
How can he still let you survive?

213
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,500
Look! You should start it first.

214
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,250
What!

215
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,160
What kind of person do you think I am?

216
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,040
Look at you!

217
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,660
If you still act careless and let him go…

218
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,540
Don't blame me saying that I didn't warn you.

219
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,120
No way. I trust Pha!

220
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,330
Trust Pha?

221
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,370
I'm gonna go now.

222
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,370
Okay.

223
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,660
By the way.

224
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,040
You messed with Kit too much today.

225
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,330
Lower it down.

226
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,830
Think about me, please.

227
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,580
He's Pha’s best friend, okay?

228
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,540
Let's go home bro.

229
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,540
Okay.

230
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,500
There… here he comes.

231
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
See you.

232
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,080
Bye.

233
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,040
Don't forget what I told you.

234
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Got it.

235
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,040
Sorry, Yu…

236
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,040
About Kit, I can’t promise.

237
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,910
Everyone, take a break, take a break, please.

238
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,290
So sweaty and tired.

239
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,660
Let's relax and have Viva Plus.

240
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,160
Come on! Come on!

241
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,120
Everyone got it right? Over there?

242
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,040
You guys are good?

243
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,750
It's true.

244
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,830
Just suck it and get 8 types of vitamin.

245
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,910
Mainly sponsored by Wayu’s father.

246
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,620
Hmm. Why do I feel like we are watching an advertisement?

247
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,290
Yeah. You're right.

248
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,080
Okay. Everyone.

249
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,950
Oops.

250
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,330
Our big senior will come to visit us here at our department
today.

251
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,410
Please welcome Booko.

252
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
Hello

253
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,620
Hello! Hello!

254
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,910
What year did you graduated, sis?

255
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,290
What was that stupid question?

256
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,290
It's already nonsense geez!

257
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,250
It’s enough to know that I'm the senior!

258
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,540
Understood right children?

259
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,540
Is that Campus moon?

260
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,040
Yes.

261
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,750
What is it sis?

262
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,410
Come here… Let’s clean your face.

263
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,290
Woah! So obvious!

264
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,160
And for you, Let me clean it.

265
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,200
Sorry that I came so late.

266
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,040
But it's okay. Once you finished the photo shoot,

267
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,830
just come and get the water splash fish ball in my car okay?

268
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,410
Sis!

269
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,450
Does it need to be in the car?

270
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,620
Yes

271
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,080
- Oh dear! Sis!
- What!

272
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,580
This is an academy.

273
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,450
You should bring it down a notch, sis.

274
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:09,200
But if he asks, I'll pay!

275
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,830
Oops! I mean sway, baby.

276
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,410
Damn! It's all been revealed!

277
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,870
Seven ways to smoothly bait your darling.

278
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,500
Seven ways to smoothly bait your darling!

279
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,660
What are you reading bro?

280
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,950
Yeah! Just like what you said!

281
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,160
Those things you told me last night.

282
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,660
I thought about it.

283
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,500
I was overthinking

284
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,790
until I couldn't sleep.

285
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,580
Cause I… don't wanna lose Pha.

286
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,660
I think, this is useless though.

287
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,750
Here, listen!

288
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,040
Let me help you myself.

289
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,750
Will you?

290
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,040


291
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,540
What're you doing!

292
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,500
Why do you have to be rude to me, Yu?

293
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,080
Mark! Stop it! You're so creepy! Piss off!

294
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,330
Who's Mark?

295
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,700
I'm Pha.

296
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,540
Don't you remember me?

297
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,200
Should I have to remind you again.

298
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Hmm?

299
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,040
You asshole, Mark!

300
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,250
That thing you just read.

301
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,620
It's only a  theory.

302
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,620
I think..

303
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,500
We better skip it and head straight to the practical step.

304
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,330
Mark..

305
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,200
You're stupid!

306
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,660
Let me go. Mark!

307
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,330
Hey! guys!

308
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,450
This is  the activity room!

309
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,660
It's not like what you saw Kit.

310
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,870
Yeah. Well,

311
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,540
I just gave him a lesson to apply with Pha.

312
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,750
Your lesson looks so real to me.

313
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,200
You seem to know.

314
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,750
What real looks like

315
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,370
I was  passing by  here,

316
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,040
So Pha asked me to give this to you.

317
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,790
Thank you, sir.

318
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,700
I gotta go now.

319
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,660
Hey, P'kit.

320
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,290
Please don't go yet.

321
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,000
I told you.

322
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,540
Don't ask for trouble.

323
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,660
It's an adult's thing.

324
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,410
Nothing to do with an innocent child.

325
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,410
Back off.

326
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,790
Oh!

327
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:38,830
And don’t forget the thing I just taught you. Do it with Pha tonight.

328
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,750
Virgin no more.

329
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,410
You cheeky bugger! Just go!

330
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,080
Kit.

331
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,790
What is that faculty?

332
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,160
Read it yourself.

333
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,500
Whoa…

334
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,950
Not gentle at all.

335
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,660
I'm a freshman.

336
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,700
You're a sophomore, can't you suggest me something?

337
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,790
You're not even from my faculty.

338
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,660
Not my business.

339
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,250
Go away and ask your own senior.

340
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,830
No.

341
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,950
See. I totally got lost.

342
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,080
Can't even find a way back to my faculty.

343
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,660
You sure you wanna cross that bridge.

344
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,910
Why?

345
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,500
And why do you need to go around that way?

346
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,160
The red bridge is considered a sacred place of our Campus.

347
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,950
Only graduates can walk across.

348
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,620
Anyone who hasn’t yet graduated and crosses that bridge,

349
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,370
will never graduate.

350
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,950
You wanna try?

351
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,290
Hmm.

352
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,450
I better go around.

353
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,790
Mark!

354
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,330
Are you Mark?

355
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,120
Do you remember me? I'm Tonfern.

356
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,540
We used to study together in Chem with Professor Tu.

357
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,540
Can’t you remember?

358
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,500
I see.

359
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,250
You're also here, Tonfern?

360
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,250
Yeah.

361
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,160
What is your faculty.

362
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,120
I study at the Medicine faculty.

363
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,120
Ah. So you are from the same faculty as….

364
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,540
Kit?

365
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,080
I just saw him walk away.

366
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,410
Guess he's in a hurry for class.

367
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,200
How about you, Mark?

368
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,450
Why don’t we go have some coffee?

369
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,830
Sure.

370
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,000
Okay.

371
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,410
Let's go.

372
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,950
- Ouch!
- Sorry.

373
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,250
Are you okay bro?

374
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:03,870
No. Don’t worry.

375
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,040
Sorry. It's my fault. Oh! It's "Pull".

376
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,120
Sorry! Sorry!

377
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,700
It's okay.

378
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,410
Don't worry at all.

379
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,200
You're not hurt right?

380
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,450
Yes, sir.

381
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,700
Why're you standing here, Phai?

382
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,250
Come. Let me see.

383
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,950
Well, it's a bit red.

384
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:41,040
Lucky that you didn't bust your head.

385
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,330
How long you've been here, pal?

386
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,080
Let's go inside.

387
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,250
Hello sir.

388
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,370
You guys are those who called and asked about internship
right?

389
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:06,950
Yes, sir.

390
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,040
Okay. Wait here a sec.

391
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,660
I'll bring the details to you.

392
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,660
Okay.

393
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:15,950
San.

394
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,330
Mark.

395
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,540
How are you?

396
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,250
Long time no see.

397
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,830
You're taller than Yu now.

398
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,160
What brings you here?

399
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,120
I'm here submiting the internship's application with my
friend though.

400
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,250
Hmm. Internship program.

401
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,540
So all of you are gonna apply?

402
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,870
Yes, sir.

403
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:37,500
This is my friend. His name's Phai.

404
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,040
- Hello sir.
- Hello.

405
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
And this guy's name is San.

406
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,450
Like me.

407
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,370
His firstname is Tisade. So we call him Sandee.

408
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,040
Sandee…

409
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,290
This's Sandee..
(Dee = homophone with ‘good’ in Thai)

410
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,580
How about you? San... what?

411
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,000
I am San…

412
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Sansab!
(Sab means ‘bad’ in Thai)

413
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,080
Sansab.

414
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,700
It suits him well.

415
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,080
From now on.

416
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,660
I'm gonna call you

417
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,370
Sab instead of San okay?

418
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,500
I'm leaving now.

419
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,370
You better continue flirting with her.

420
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,040
Flirting with who?

421
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,120
Piss off. Go.

422
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,000


423
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:14,750
My junior.

424
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,910
I see.

425
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,540
Let's try this. It's good.

426
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,040
Okay.

427
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,200
Is it good?

428
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,250
Very much.

429
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,370


430
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,500
Right.

431
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,250
Shall we go again next time?

432
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,040
Sure.

433
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,450
Okay.

434
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,830
Thanks a lot for bringing me here.

435
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,120
We'll probably see each other again around here.Right?

436
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,250
See. You talked to me for an hour

437
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,620
but you even said the name of that senior of my faculty

438
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,120
more than mine.

439
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,120
No.

440
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:55,120
I'm leaving. See you around. Byebye.

441
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,790
You think you can avoid me?

442
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,700
You just left me.

443
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,250
They say if two people meet each other twice in one day,

444
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,700
It's because of…

445
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,870
of fate.

446
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,040
Hey.

447
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,040
You have a dimple.

448
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,410
You are such a little cutie.

449
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,330
Cutie my ass!

450
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,870
Your height is just around my shoulder.

451
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,540
You're saying I'm short?

452
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
Well…

453
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,080
Isn't it true?

454
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,000
Even if I look small

455
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,660
that doesn't mean I'm short.

456
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,660
Take it back.

457
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,200
You mean now.

458
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,040
Sure.

459
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,040
Hey. What are you doing?

460
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,290
Hey!

461
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,410
I'm trying to take back my words, just like you asked.

462
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,500
Unfortunately,

463
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,290
it gets stuck here.

464
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,910
At your dimple.

465
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,370
You know something, you are so cute.

466
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
Don't let me see your face again!

467
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
Asshole.

468
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,580
Yu. I think I will try hitting on Kit.

469
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,160
Do you still want a lecture?

470
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,040
Yes. Yes. Yes.

471
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,040
Photocopy it.

472
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,290
Don't you dare.

473
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,370
Now, you know how I feel, right?

474
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,000
Pha told me

475
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,580
that you always held up and waited for him under his

476
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,620
You are so serious, right? About Kit?

477
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,500
I kept my eyes on him all the time.

478
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,370
Do you still think I did it for fun?

479
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,040
But, no matter how much I devoted myself, it's useless.

480
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,750
Kit never wants to talk to me at all.

481
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:54,000
Those dogs at his faculty care for me more.

482
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,790
Around this time of this month,

483
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,660
the Medicine Faculty always have exams.

484
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,080
A top score student like Kit,

485
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,870
He'll be so busy, surely he doesn't have time to talk to you.

486
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,080
Really?

487
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,409
That's why all this time he finishes so late.

488
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:13,159
It's gonna be last til this Friday.

489
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,659
You probably try again and see what will get.

490
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,790
Okay.

491
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,699
Even if his faculty's all busy.

492
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:27,290
Your supplies're still full though.

493
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,250
Cause he cares for me.

494
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,159
Geezzz. Don't let it be my turn.

495
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,870
Well.

496
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,830
Did you do that lesson with Pha yet?

497
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,580
Come on.

498
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,659
You did right?

499
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,699
Tell me everything.

500
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,159
Tell me!

501
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,870
So this is it,

502
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,290
You stop telling me anything now, right?

503
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,160
I'm still your friend.

504
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,000
Tell me all about it, now.

505
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,000
Come on.

506
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,910
Quick.

507
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,370
I'll remember this!

508
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,750
Dad gave this to me?

509
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,200
Yes.

510
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,160
Actually.

511
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,080
Your dad seems to know that you're busy studying

512
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,290
and rarely get back home.

513
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,540
So he's afraid that you probably get sick

514
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,450
and a lack of vitamins.

515
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,950
I can get it myself from 7-Eleven.

516
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,830
You barely get back home.

517
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,580
Did you sneak to somewhere else?

518
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,290
Tell me.

519
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,330
I promise not to tell anyone.

520
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,620
Where could I go?

521
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,750
I just stayed at the dorm.

522
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,540
Whoa. Whose dorm?

523
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,120
Mine.

524
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,870
Ugh. You sure that it's not Pha's place?

525
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,040
Hey.

526
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,370
How do you know that?

527
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,330
Mark told me everything.

528
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,830
Yu already has a boyfriend. Name's Dr. Pha.

529
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,790
Pharawee Prapathanakul.

530
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:21,330
The Campus's hottest and most handsome senior of all time.

531
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,040
So in love and never left each other for a second.

532
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:30,200
Mark! You asshole!

533
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,160
Yu. Where are you going?

534
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,080
To see Dr. Pha?

535
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,950
Can I go with you?

536
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,330
No, You can't. It's an important appointment.

537
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,040
So jealous.

538
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,750
Please Yu.

539
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,040
Can I go see Dr. Pha's face?

540
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,160
No.

541
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,620
If you can’t see Pha today,

542
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,620
Why don't you just go ask Mark to see Dr. Kit instead?

543
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,080
Dr. Kit.

544
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,290
Who is he, Yu?

545
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,620
I saw someone with Mark at the coffee shop last time.

546
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,330
Hmm. But it shouldn’t have been Dr. Kit

547
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,830
No. My name isn't Kit.

548
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,790
It means that Mark is still flirting around.

549
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,040
He's not the real one.

550
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,120
Real one?

551
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,790
Do you mean lover, Yu?

552
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,330
Kit should be finishing his exam by now.

553
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,870
Mark must be waiting for him at the Medicine Faculty.

554
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,450
Medicine Faculty?

555
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,790
I'm gonna leave you now, Yu.

556
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,790
See ya.

557
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,500
Huh. Mark!

558
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,040
You started it first.

559
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,250
Kit, so your perfect skin

560
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,750
comes from drinking a lot of water.

561
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,040
You finished the exam right?

562
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,540
Well, let's go eat together.

563
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,950
It's on me.

564
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,370
Hmm. How about sushi?

565
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,250
Mark!

566
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,580
Mark!

567
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,330
Yu told me to see Mark's boyfriend.

568
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,750
His name's….

569
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,750
Dr. Kit.

570
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,750
Here.

571
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,080
It's him.

572
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,410
No!

573
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,330
But your name's Kit.

574
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,750
So what!

575
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,750
My name's Kit.

576
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,160
But I'm surely not your boyfriend.

577
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,660
But Yu said

578
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,910
Dr. Kit is your boyfriend.

579
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,500
Yu! Wait for it! I'm gonna tell Pha everything.

580
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,950
Huhh!

581
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,620
Where are you going?

582
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,620
Wait for me, please.

583
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,830
You must go have sushi with me today.

584
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,450
I never said I would go with you.

585
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,660
Sushi? Can I go with you guys?

586
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,830
Please Mark…

587
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,750
Kit.., I wanna eat it.

588
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,790
Sab, see…

589
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,410
If Kit doesn't join us.

590
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,830
Why do I have to go?

591
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,910
Kit. I'm really craving for sushi.

592
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,620
Please come.

593
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,080
Please.

594
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,160
Well.

595
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,080
We go together now

596
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,830
or... is it that actually...

597
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,700
you just wanna go alone with him?

598
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,580
Good.

599
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,830
- Let's just go only both of us.
- No. I won't go with anyone.

600
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,870
Yeah. because you're gonna go with both of us!

601
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,330
So it's a deal?

602
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,370
Sab, my dear bro.

603
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,200
You are really a smartass.

604
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,290
So your type is bright skin, small

605
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,700
and tough.

606
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,830
Yes, he's tough.

607
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:04,160
But when he smiles, it's so cute.

608
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,830
Let's go and finish it, bro

609
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,790
Please…

610
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,870
This restaurant is so good. It's my regular place.

611
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,120
After you.

612
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,450
Hey.

613
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:24,950
Please.

614
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,830
Medium Sashimi Set, please.

615
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,830
Let's get a big set. Kit will join us.

616
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,160
I won't eat.

617
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,200
How about eating kid?

618
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Including it.

619
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,450
Kit.

620
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,370
Mark.

621
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,000
Let's play something fun.

622
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,500
It's so popular at my school.

623
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,250
What game is it?

624
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,950
It's Like King's cup game.

625
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:27,500
You write the order on the paper, not more than 3 words.

626
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,870
Anyone who draws it, must follow.

627
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,040
Even it wrote take off the shirt, we still need to do it
right?

628
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,290
Looks so fun.

629
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,410
Can't wait to play it now.

630
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,790
You pervert. I don't think so.

631
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,040
Not particularly that much.

632
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,660
Every order needs to be checked by the king first.

633
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,120
If it's approved, then we can start drawing them.

634
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,830
I'll be the King.

635
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,660
I'm the King or I won't play.

636
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,160
Well. That's fine.

637
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,750
Kit, you are the King.

638
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,790
Oh. I forgot to tell you something.

639
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,370
Apart from checking stuff.

640
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,830
If any player gives up by refusing to follow the order,

641
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:12,830
The King has right to punish that one to do anything he
wants.

642
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,950
Good.

643
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,040
…And follow that thing for him in replacement.

644
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,450
What!

645
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,040
Super!

646
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,750
If you're afraid of losing, you don't have to play.

647
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,540
I don't like to force anyone.

648
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,750
I'll play.

649
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,120
Okay, so let's get started.

650
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,370
Give it to me.

651
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,660
- "Fold the bird"
- "Eating sauce"

652
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,700
"Kiss the cheek"

653
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:49,950
What is it?

654
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,080
"Kiss the lips"

655
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,370
- "Kiss the neck"
- "Unbutton"

656
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,040
Kissing. Are you mad!

657
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,080
"Strip off"

658
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:00,500
"Sit on lap"

659
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,500
Sit on lap.

660
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,500
"Smile sweetly"

661
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,000
"Tie the hair"

662
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:18,000
Hey! Hey!

663
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,700
Eat a vegetable.

664
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,370
I can eat for you, but you need to be punished.

665
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,830
Bump a glass…

666
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,330
Wait.

667
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,120
This one is from me and I didn't write bump a glass.

668
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,370
"Bump a glass"

669
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,660
It is right. Bump a glass.

670
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,040
No.

671
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,080
Read it carefully.

672
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,580
Bump a glass…

673
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,370
"Bump a cheek"
(Cheek in Thai has similar pronunciation with glass.)

674
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,370
Huh?

675
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,700
Is it kinda greeting like French, Mark?

676
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,580
That's right.

677
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,080
Bonjour Monsieur

678
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,370
Bonjour Muah! Muah!

679
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,080
Almost right.

680
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,870
But you must actually touch each other,

681
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:18,580
not far away like that.

682
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,000
No pressure.

683
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,830
But you're King. If you won't do it

684
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,410
just give up

685
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,700
and punish yourself for jumping jacks.

686
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,660
No. I'll do it.

687
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,290
So do it with the person who wrote that paper.

688
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,450
Come on.

689
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,370
Hey.

690
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:36,080
Consider the game over.

691
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,910
I'll go back and continue reading textbooks.

692
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:38,910
I'll go with you.

693
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,040
Wait.

694
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,540
I'm not finished yet.

695
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,290
Who's gonna pay this stuff if you guys leave?

696
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,040
Hmm… confirmed!

697
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,700
Who dragged me here is responsible for it.

698
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,700
I'll go now.

699
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,040
Great.

700
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,750
Hey.

701
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:12,410
You better be my little brother instead of Yu's.

702
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:14,870
Order anything you want.

703
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,750
I'll pay for it all. It’s on me.

704
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,540
Shall we go eat Bingsu next

705
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,950
and then take me home?

706
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,540
I give you an inch,

707
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,040
and you'll take a league.

708
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,410
Here. Finish it first.

709
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,330
Go on. Don’t be shy.

710
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:36,950
Hello Yu.

711
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:40,620
I must thank you for sending Sab here today,

712
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:46,000
You know what? I just had lunch with Kit.

713
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:50,950
Sab set the scene for me to get cheek by cheek with Kit
today

714
00:46:52,330 --> 00:46:54,500
Sab, he's so damn good.

715
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,870
Why won't you get excited with me?

716
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,870
Is there something wrong?

717
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:07,200
Are you with Pha? Am I bothering you?

718
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:12,120
Yu.

719
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,040
What's going on?

720
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,080
Why are you crying?

721
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,120
Did you get hurt? Tell me, Yu.

722
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,620
I just broke up with Pha.

723
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,040
He left me.

724
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,750
Yesterday

725
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,290
he still loved me.

726
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:12,580
But why today

727
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,580
he doesn't?

728
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,080
I don’t wanna talk to you now.

729
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,290
I didn't come to see you today.

730
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,620
I came to see Pha.

731
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,580
Hey. Tong.

732
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,330
What's the definition of love between Sansab and Phai?

733
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,830
Um. Tell me why?

734
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:40,410
Ah. Pha didn’t come with you?

735
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,200
- Well… I'm…
- Let me go.

736
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,370
Copter, what are you eating? It looks so good.

737
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:02,620
You mean this, Kim?

738
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,120
It's Viva Plus.

739
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,080
So tasty, full of 8 types of vitamin

740
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,200
Let me try it too!

741
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,700
Hey! You're dirty, Kim.

742
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,000
What's dirty?

743
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,370
I mean Viva Plus looks

744
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,790
so yummy, there's also 8 types of vitamins.

745
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:17,330
That's why

746
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,250
you look really fresh.

747
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,000
Is it because of this jelly?

748
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:24,040
Can I try?

749
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:30,160
Sorry bro. It's finished.

750
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,450
If you wanna try.

751
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:35,200
You better buy it from 7-Eleven.

752
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:39,200
So sad. Why don’t you just keep some for me?

753
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:40,790
Bye.

754
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:42,450
Where are you going, Kim?

755
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:44,080
7-Eleven.

756
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,870
Wanna buy Vivia Plus.

757
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:48,700
Kim! Get some for me!
